VF Corp. and Michael Kors.Kicking off the series  in episode one: “Re-setting Retail — State of the Industry ” Standish and Chip Bergh  chief executive officer of Levi Strauss & Co.  discussed the state of retail and the important acceleration of technology and environmental  social and corporate governance.“This year was one unlike any other we’ve had in our careers ” said Standish  applauding the strides that Levi Strauss & Co. had made in the last year  including prioritizing ESG and its recent acquisition of the athletic brand  Beyond Yoga.Notably  Bergh said  Beyond Yoga was the first acquisition for the company in the 10 years he has been acting as CEO  but importantly  it was a strategic one for the times. “One of our strategies is to continue to diversify the company and we’ve been looking at acquisitions for a couple of years  but we had pretty stringent filters that an acquisition would need to pass through ” said Bergh. “We have a very strong culture  very strong values and principles and so that is a very important filter for us.”Episode two  “Re-setting Customer Experience ” focused on the importance of elevating the consumer journey with insights from Peloton chief marketing officer Dara Treseder. During the episode  Treseder shared the company’s experience from a boom during the pandemic  when people looked to work out at home more than ever before  to democratizing offerings at multiple price points that embraced the needs of all consumers.“You have to make decisions based on what is going on around you ” said Treseder. “And having the right insights and the writing especially about what’s going on with the consumer and the culture that is known for making sure that you’re making the right decisions and I think that that is really exciting.”In episode three  Joseph Taiano  managing director of marketing for consumer industries at Accenture  and Sarah Dunn  global human resources officer at Tapestry  joined WWD to discuss the disruption of the workforce.

Knowing more changes everything  she said. And looking to the future she believes informing products that are built will become an even bigger part of leveraging data. “This whole thing around first-party data is absolutely critical ” said Carboni. “In some ways  I think everyone was stressed. I’m actually excited because I view it as an opportunity to own that relationship with that consumer even more so than what we had before.”Upcoming episodes of WWD Voices premiere every Monday and will highlight topics including reinforcing ESG  the new generation of beauty consumers  inclusive and sustainable beauty and reinvigorating brand purpose.

PyNews API,"MUMBAI : Companies are aiming to recalibrate their businesses to not only get closer to their net zero emissiongoals but also to tap into newer pools of capital and shore up valuations to attract investors in these reorganized entities while enhancing shareholder value  as calls for them to become environment friendly get louder.In the past month alone  Vedanta Ltd  Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and JSW Energy have started moving in a new direction.Vedanta’s restructuring may include a demerger and subsequent listings of the aluminium  iron and steel  and oil and gas businesses as standalone entities  while RIL is transferring the company’s gasification assets to a wholly-owned unit. JSW Energy is housing its green energy business in a new wholly-owned unit  JSW Neo Energy Ltd (JSWNEL)  while keeping the thermal business as part of the main company. The green business is expected to contribute more than 62% of JSW’s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization (Ebitda).“The last decade has been certainly eventful with financiers  investors  and the society starting to demand transparency as well as comparability and reliability of environmental  social and governance (ESG) performance. These demands are nudging organizations to tell the whole story of their value and true impact on society "" said Inderjeet Singh  director  Deloitte India. “The access to green capital through dedicated ESG funds are triggering a recalibration of businesses towards an integrated outlook "" he said.At the COP-26 summit  India announced its target of reaching net zero emission by 2070 and achieving 500 GW of non-fossil fuel energy capacity by 2030. India’s installed renewable energy capacity  excluding large hydropower projects  crossed 100 GW in August. India currently ranks fourth globally by installed renewable energy capacity  fifth in solar  and fourth in wind. Certain sectors such as aviation  maritime  energy-intensive manufacturing and conventional energy production depend on third-party technological know-how and may find it more complex to improve some aspects of their business such as specific energy consumption or environmental footprint  according to analysts. Other sectors can  however  quickly implement off-the-shelf solutions for their transition  they said.Most Indian companies have announced intention to be net zero by 2035-2050  but experts said this needs a deeper inbound approach than carbon neutrality  which allows purchasing offsets. The biggest challenge will not just be around the access to technology but also around cost-effective access to technologies.“Company managements are faced with two choices—adapt and voluntarily change  or be forced to change. The forced change may come through regulatory changes  changing business conditions or through investors (access to capital  cost of capital) "" said Ruchit Mehta  fund manager  SBI Mutual Fund. “There are also opportunities in this transition from newer markets to reduce the cost of capital  which can materially enhance shareholder value "" Mehta said.kalpana.p@livemint.comSubscribe to Mint Newsletters * Enter a valid email * Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter.",0.43,0.16,0.41,mixed,2021-12-06 00:00:00,English,2021-12-06,ESG,12,ESG,livemint.com,"In the past month alone  Vedanta Ltd  Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) and JSW Energy have started moving in a new direction.JSW Energy is housing its green energy business in a new wholly-owned unit  JSW Neo Energy Ltd (JSWNEL)  while keeping the thermal business as part of the main company.“The access to green capital through dedicated ESG funds are triggering a recalibration of businesses towards an integrated outlook "" he said.Most Indian companies have announced intention to be net zero by 2035-2050  but experts said this needs a deeper inbound approach than carbon neutrality  which allows purchasing offsets.The forced change may come through regulatory changes  changing business conditions or through investors (access to capital  cost of capital) "" said Ruchit Mehta  fund manager  SBI Mutual Fund.",ESG-led corporate restructuring is about capital too,0.01,0.99,0.0,neutral,https://www.livemint.com/companies/news/esgled-corporate-restructuring-is-about-capital-too-11638725604112.html,True,True

Talent pool has started to become limited in all areas especially within the technology and financial services sectors due to demand for digitalisation  travel restrictions and higher level of emigration.Findings also show that candidates consider factors beyond compensation and benefits when looking for jobs  such as if companies offer good work-life balance  access to latest technology  hybrid working and if the company's positions on social and political matters align with their own etc.Digitalisation and transformation will continue to be a key growth area across many sectorsCompanies are becoming more agile with their workforce post-COVID and are speeding up their transformation projects. Findings show that 95% of tech professionals are confident about job opportunities. It is anticipated that the hottest technical skills in 2022 will be big data analysis  machine learning  AI and cyber security across both permanent and contract roles. For job movers possessing in-demand or niche skill sets  salary increments of 15-20% would be expected  and could be as high as 40% for some senior positions.Demand for hybrid jobs has intensified in the commerce sectorsAcross HR  marketing and finance functions there is an increase in hybrid jobs where more and more jobs are combining skill sets that traditionally do not fall under the same roles  or candidates in technical disciplines are expected to apply more soft skills such as analysis and management skills in their jobs. For example  companies will be seeking for finance candidates that are highly analytical with strong commercial mindset who can analyse big data and convert this into commercial results. This shift in demand for talent has created challenges to hiring managers as the broader the job requirements and more specialised the role are  the harder it will be to attract the best talent that are often experienced candidates.The financial services candidate pool is shrinking with higher demand for ESG-related skillsTravel restrictions and higher level of emigration mean that financial services professionals who stay may be able to command higher salary increments when they move jobs. With very little hiring of expatriates and many existing ones emigrating from Hong Kong  the percentage of foreign nationals working in the Hong Kong financial services sector especially front office pool will shrink further. The sector has performed strongly and firms are anxious to avoid turnover and focus on retention. Salaries are expected to increase in 2022 with the standard pay rise level of 4-5% reaching 10%. For job movers the previous standard increment of 15% is now closer to 20%  although it can vary somewhat depending on the individual context.On the other hand  with Environmental  Social & Governance (ESG) edging into finance's mainstream  it is expected that ESG factors are increasingly taking centre stage within investment strategies by corporates and financial services in 2022 and beyond. However  supply of professionals that possess sustainability-related skills are limited in Hong Kong so the competition will be fierce.Companies are advised to capitalise on the opportunities brought by the new normalThe pandemic has forced companies and workforces to scramble towards hybrid working and the experience has shaped the perspectives of work. Industry survey[2] conducted by Robert Walters reveals 78% of professionals said that the offer of hybrid working arrangements would make them more likely to join a prospective employer.Ricky Mui  Managing Director - Greater China of Robert Walters Group says  ""Given the shortage of candidates and the increasing demand for hybrid jobs  it's expected that the competition for the best candidates will be fierce in 2022. Candidate experience will be key in attracting talent and businesses embracing hybrid workplace effectively will be recognised as an employer of choice. At the same time  having a robust equity  diversity and inclusion (ED&I) policy  as well as adopting new strategies to broaden the talent pool will ensure companies gain an edge over their competitors. ""Steady growth in contract roles for key projects drives demand for tech professionals and junior staffMarket rebound has also driven companies to catch up with projects that were on hold during COVID. During busy periods with an increased workload  contract professionals that can alleviate a short-term skills or resource gap will be particularly valuable to hiring managers where the recruitment process is more drawn out due to a narrow talent pool with few suitable candidates. Distinct recovery especially within the junior permanent recruitment market is also expected across technology and business transformation project roles.Carly Adams  Director of Walters People Hong Kong  says  ""Hiring managers need to be prepared to run an efficient and timely recruitment process in junior roles and contract recruitment. Time delays between interview rounds or non-essential interview participants will very often mean that they will miss out on their preferred candidate in a market such as this.""[1] Statistics are based on industry research conducted by Robert Walters and Walters People in Hong Kong during the period of September to October 2021.

Bing API,Responsible investing is paying dividends for Australia’s $3.4 trillion super industry  a new report shows. Photo: Getty ImagesSuper funds with rigorous ESG frameworks in place went on to claim 42% of the market’s assets through 2021.They outperformed the sector’s laggards  too  with a lead of 87 basis points over the last year  and 56 basis points over the last seven.Simon O’Connor  CEO at the Responsible Investment Association of Australasia  said the year’s results make plain what has been on the cards for quite some time.Visit Business Insider Australia’s homepage for more stories.Australia’s super industry is learning that it pays to be good  as leaders in sustainability and transparency came to outperform the market’s laggards with responsible investment.According to the Responsible Investment Association of Australasia  about a quarter of Australia’s super funds have come to control 42% of the market’s assets as a result of establishing “leading responsible investment” principles  up from the 28% they held in 2019.The funds that have committed to rigorous environmental  social and governance (ESG) frameworks are also outperforming those who haven’t with a lead of 87 basis points over the last year  and 56 basis points over the last seven years.Simon O’Connor  CEO at the Responsible Investment Association of Australasia  said the year’s results make plain what has been on the cards for quite some time.“Australians are realising the often superior financial performance of leading responsible investment super funds  and are moving their money to reap not only benefits for society and the environment  but their retirement savings as well ” he said.The number of funds leading the charge on responsible investment  though  remains the same as it was in 2019  with just 13 of the industry’s 53 funds operating on the foundations of clear environmental  social and governance (ESG) frameworks.Among them are Active Super  Australian Ethical Super  AustralianSuper  Aware Super  BT Superannuation  CareSuper  Cbus  Christian Super  HESTA  Mercer Superannuation (Australia) Limited  Rest  UniSuper and Vision Super.But the majority of funds still have a way to go. The study found that 77% of the industry’s largest funds still fall well short of the transparency standards they’ll soon be required to meet under new legislation that will force them to publicise their holdings from next year.Concerns are surfacing at a boardroom level as a result. In the face of rising public concern and the increased financial materiality of climate change  92% of funds said that consideration for greener positions on investment and operation had reached the highest levels of management.Ryan Korinke  global head of sustainability at US investment firm PIMCO  said it’s encouraging to see the pool of funds responsible for the world’s biggest pension pool start to take responsible investing seriously.“Asset owners in Australia and New Zealand are bellwethers for sustainable investing in the Asia region and globally  which makes the results of this study — showing their increasing commitment to responsible investment practices — particularly encouraging ” he said.For the first time  responsible investment approaches have played a role in strategic asset allocation among the majority of the industry’s funds  up to 55% from the 39% who were doing so in 2019.The shift comes in the wake of immense pressure directed at the industry by Australian workers  reaching an inflection point through the 2019–20 “Black Summer” bushfire season which brought about outsized pressure to dump high-emitting investments.At the time  some said the change was long overdue  as major investment outfits abroad  like BlackRock  and Europe’s largest pension fund Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP  in February last year started to fold on investments in carbon-heavy operations.The trend has been slower to pick up in Australia  but funds that are heeding market warnings are reaping rewards  even if only to shake off a longstanding reputation for yielding passive returns and charging exorbitant fees.Only last year  four of Australia’s biggest super funds said they stood for climate action  but often vote against it.Independent research released last February found that AustralianSuper  UniSuper  HostPlus  and HESTA were still heavily invested in fossil fuels to the tune of billions  despite making commitments to reduce climate risk.At the time  the four funds — some of the biggest and most powerful in the country — claimed they would remain invested to improve coal  oil and gas companies from within.Changing attitudes towards ESG in general have had a trickle down effect across corporate Australia  including the boardrooms of major emitters  who fear they’ll soon lose out on major super fund investment without responsible  transparent governance frameworks in place.It’s a shift that has so far prompted marquee resignations and boardroom reshuffles at firms that have long considered themselves out of reach.In March this year  Simon Thompson and Michael L’Estrange  two senior executives at Rio Tinto  stood down from their roles at the mining giant after widespread backlash over its role in the destruction of a 40 000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site at Juukan Gorge.At global investment manager AMP Capital  a years-long sexual harassment scandal forced the firm to reshuffle its board make up twice in as many years.,0.54,0.22,0.24,mixed,2021-12-06 00:00:00,English,2021-12-06,ESG,21,ESG,businessinsider.com.au,Responsible investing is paying dividends for Australia’s $3.4 trillion super industry  a new report shows.They outperformed the sector’s laggards  too  with a lead of 87 basis points over the last year  and 56 basis points over the last seven.Australia’s super industry is learning that it pays to be good  as leaders in sustainability and transparency came to outperform the market’s laggards with responsible investment.Among them are Active Super  Australian Ethical Super  AustralianSuper  Aware Super  BT Superannuation  CareSuper  Cbus  Christian Super  HESTA  Mercer Superannuation (Australia) Limited  Rest  UniSuper and Vision Super.Only last year  four of Australia’s biggest super funds said they stood for climate action  but often vote against it.,Responsible investing is paying dividends for Australia’s $3.4 trillion super industry  a new report shows,0.17,0.79,0.04,neutral,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/responsible-investing-is-paying-dividends-for-super-funds,True,True
Bing API,IN today’s increasing modernised world of digitalisation and globalisation  it is only appropriate for everyone to believe that every single individual living on this planet must have the right to a life free from slavery. Is this really happening?Unfortunately  the answer is no. It is being said that now  millions of children and adults are trapped in slavery in every single country in the world that includes in Malaysia. It is estimated that more than 40 million people are trapped in modern slavery globally.What is modern slavery?Modern slavery is the severe exploitation of other people for personal or commercial gain. People can become entrapped making our clothes  serving our food  picking our crops  working in factories  or working in houses as cooks  cleaners  or nannies. When looking from the outside  the jobs being carried out look like a normal job.However  when one looks at the details  it appears to be that the people are being controlled. They can face violence or threats  be forced into inescapable debt  or have had their passport taken away and are being threatened with deportation. Many fall into this cruel trap simply because they were trying to get away from poverty  insecurity  improve their lives  or support their families. Unfortunately  they are unable to do so.Today’s modern slavery comes in many forms. And the most common are:It appears that some of the problems are systemic  occurring on numerous plantations. And interestingly  palm oil is hidden on labels as an ingredient> Human trafficking: The use of violence  threats or bullying to transport  recruit or harbour people with the aim to exploit them for purposes like forced prostitution  labour  criminality  marriage or organ removal.> Forced labour: People are forced to do any work or services against their will under threat of punishment.> Debt bondage and bonded labour: The most widespread form of slavery where those who are trapped in poverty borrows money and are forced to work to pay off the debt  losing control over both their employment conditions and the debt.> Descent–based slavery: An old-fashioned way where people are treated as property or commodity and their “slave” status is passed down the parental line.> Slavery of children: A child is exploited for another person’s gain which includes trafficking  soldiers marriage and domestic slavery.> Forced and early marriage: A person is married against their will and is unable to leave.Closer to home...The issue of modern slavery has been buzzing in Malaysia for sometimes now. It has been well documented in many of the economic sectors  ranging from domestic work right up to construction  agriculture  mining  manufacturing  and services.For instance  our palm oil industry was impacted. This came about after a couple of big names were unveiled to have practised forced labour and other abuses on their plantations that feed into the supply chains.Abuses against workers that included physical and sexual violence  restriction of movement  intimidation and threats  debt bondage  withholding of wages and excessive overtime  regular harassment by authorities  swept up in raids and detention in government facilities are some of the issues highlighted.It appears that some of the problems are systemic  occurring on numerous plantations. And interestingly  palm oil is hidden on labels as an ingredient. It is found in more than half of the products on supermarket shelves  cosmetic brands  paints  plywood  pesticides  pills  animal feed  biofuels and even hand sanitisers. Hence  it can be a challenge to avoid modern slavery.Besides palm oil  modern slavery also became apparent during the Covid-19 pandemic  especially in the glove industry. The pandemic placed pressure on labour standards in this industry due to a sharp surge in demand for gloves and risk of the virus transmission among workers.Besides palm oil  modern slavery also became apparent during the Covid-19 pandemic  especially in the glove industry. The pandemic placed pressure on labour standards in this industry due to a sharp surge in demand for gloves and risk of the virus transmission among workers.There was a shift in power towards glove manufacturers in relation to distribution  pricing  and payment terms. It increased pressure on existing workers and reduced opportunities for ethical procurement.But the forced labour issues were there even before the pandemic. It has been longstanding. The United States placed import bans on gloves produced by two major manufacturers in Malaysia due to findings of forced labour.And the so-called shift in power to the manufacturers due to the pandemic is not permanent. So  it is vital to ensure improvements in labour standards be part of the supply chain resilience strategies.The industry should not be merely focusing on “profiteering” or “bottom-line”.And the electronics industry is now the latest. We are one of the world’s largest exporters. Most of the global best-selling electronic brands are in one way or the other sourced from us. In the process  it appears that we have become addicted to the labour force issues under modern slavery. It is because  the modern-day slavery issue in this industry was already highlighted even before the pandemic. It exposed us to a system of exploitation that has deepened and expanded over the years.With the high-tech home appliance maker Dyson Ltd having cut their ties with supplier ATA IMS Bhd due to the issues of forced labour under modern slavery  is this the tip of the iceberg for this industry?A need to address the damageWith the high-tech home appliance maker Dyson Ltd having cut their ties with supplier ATA IMS Bhd due to the issues of forced labour under modern slavery  is this the tip of the iceberg for this industry?A need to address the damageUnderpinned by the modern slavery issue  there is an urgent and serious need to address this matter quickly before it becomes irreparable to our economy. Immediate attention is needed. It is to be in line with our global commitment towards sustainability.Risk of many global businesses will exclude our companies that are accused of engaging in forced labour practices and modern slavery from the supply chain is high. Investors are increasingly applying these non-financial factors as part of their analysis process to identify material risks and growth opportunities.This is where the environmental  social and governance (ESG) comes into play.Based on the ESG components  both the ‘E’ and ‘G’ includes modern slavery directly. The ‘S’ accounts for polluted or dangerous conditions where people are forced to work in.> SEE next PAGE And so  the ESG reporting provides guidance that the company is social- conscious and aims for a positive impact in the long-run on ESG and business performance.It demonstrates a holistic approach to sustainability. However  in today’s environment  what can be seen is that the modern slavery is an “underweighted” element within the ESG framework.Indicators on this area are non-standardised. So  it makes things difficult.Companies will not disclose enough information on modern slavery. They tend to be less transparent in this area largely because they want stable earnings. Poor disclosure retards investor’s ability to understand how companies manage their risks related to modern slavery.Nonetheless  this issue must be addressed fast. It is more than just an ethical issue. Modern slavery can become as costly and urgent like climate change and Covid-19 pandemic in the public eye.Investment risk will escalate related with potentially catastrophic outcomes for businesses found dealing with human rights violations.The government alone cannot resolve this issueMalaysia has been downgraded by the United States Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report.After being on a watch list for three years  Malaysia has been dropped to “Tier 3 ” its lowest ranking.This is for countries whose governments fail to fully meet the minimum anti-trafficking standards and are not making significant efforts to do so.The downgrade has kicked Malaysia into the same category as North Korea  Myanmar  China  Syria  and Turkmenistan.It means that Malaysia could lose some United States assistance  although the United States President can choose to issue a waiver. Decisions on whether to impose penalties will not be made until later this year.The downgrade should not come as a surprise. The issue of modern slavery emerged even before the Covid-19 pandemic for our rubber glove manufacturers  palm oil producers and electronics sector.And what about the other economic activities ranging from domestic work right up to construction  agriculture  mining manufacturing  and services?It is time for us to seriously embark on reforms in our labour policies to address matters relating to modern slavery. Policy must ensure business supply chains must improve their ESG. Failing to do so must be prosecuted  even if there is an “opportunity loss” from the said business.Such drastic measures will instill fear in businesses and raise ESG values and not just focus on earnings.By procrastinating on the modern slavery issues  it will pose serious investments risks. This will include reputational and brand damage and regulatory changes and general business risk. Potential investment flow will take a strong hit.But the government alone cannot eliminate modern slavery. No number of policies formulated will work effectively and efficiently without developing a strong ecosystem embedded with ESG. To this  we need the government  businesses  and the people.Anthony Dass is group chief economist and head of AmBank Research.

Google API,Environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) constitute the natural progression from social responsibility and triple-bottom-line frameworks that have guided the policies and activities of Kenanga Investment Bank Berhad since its foundation in 1973.“Five decades of experience have shown us how urgent it is to develop comprehensive ESG practices for our operations  as well as  in supporting investments that are truly sustainable and accountable ” says Chuah Sze Phing Head of Group Marketing  Communications and Sustainability.“Sustainability is undeniably a complex and broad topic. Our ESG framework - predicated on Sustainable Economic Growth  Environmental Stewardship  Empowering People and Communities  as well as  Good Governance - shapes how we prioritise our resources and is a focal point for the articulation of our ESG goals for the long term. Enterprise-wide effort is crucial to truly move the needle on ESG. In this respect  we are very lucky to have tremendous all-round support  from Board members to employees on the ground ” Chuah adds.“A big part of the Kenanga culture is centred on embracing technology and innovation  and this permeates into our ESG efforts as well ” Chuah says. Earlier this year  Kenanga sealed an MOU with one of Malaysia’s leading solar producers  reNikola  to purchase renewable energy for its operations. “Depending on reNikola’s production schedule  we hope to be operating on 100% renewable energy by 2025 ” Chuah explains.“A big part of the Kenanga culture is centred on embracing technology and innovation  and this permeates into our ESG efforts as well.”— Chuah Sze Phing  Head of Group Marketing  Communications and SustainabilityLike most buildings  Heating  Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) makes up the lion’s share of energy consumption. To tackle this  Kenanga has operationalised an AI-powered energy saving solution at its premises and is on track to save up to 1 million kWh in the next 12 months.“At the end of the day  it is simply about balancing the pursuit of prosperity while making a positive impact on people and the planet ” says Chuah.Leading Kenanga’s drive for Responsible Investing  its asset management subsidiary  Kenanga Investors Berhad  has been a member of the Institutional Investors Council Malaysia since 2017  and continues to push the envelope in terms of ESG integration into its products and decision making. “Our private equity arm is also constantly seeking out investments in start-ups and companies that exhibit a strong ESG agenda. We are looking at impact investing strategies and ways for us to catalyse businesses that make a positive impact while generating revenue ” Chuah says.Empowering People and Communities remain top of its agenda  with a strong focus on social enterprises that encourage independence  ownership and the promotion of dignity. Throughout the decade  Kenanga continues its support of Dialogue in the Dark (for the sight impaired) and Silent Teddies (speech/hearing impaired)  and in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic  Kenanga launched an online campaign #HumanKIND  raising over 5 000 food & beverage orders for Café Includes  an outlet operated by people with disabilities.With over 1 300 employees nationwide  and a hybrid working arrangement that is here to stay  Kenanga Group is working to offer its employees  an integrated digital care solution that combines the support for both physical and mental health. “It’s imperative that we take a holistic view on the wellbeing of staff that includes mental health. We want to be able to provide the support our staff need  as we operate in this new norm.”In 2021  the Group also renewed its commitment to promoting Good Governance throughout its operations. “Fraud awareness is a topic close to our hearts ” Chuah says. “This year we ran our fifth annual fraud awareness campaign with participation from the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission  Bursa Malaysia  the Securities Commission  Bank Negara Malaysia  professional bodies and private sector organisations. It means a lot to us that what began as an internal programme has become an annual industry event.”“The need for change is urgent ” Chuah says. “We may not have all the answers yet  but it is an active corporate commitment that we are making  with a willingness to lead change  be it within Kenanga or in the businesses and communities we invest in.”,0.23,0.1,0.67,mixed,2021-12-06 00:00:00,English,2021-12-06,ESG,3,ESG,theedgemarkets.com,In this respect  we are very lucky to have tremendous all-round support  from Board members to employees on the ground ” Chuah adds.“A big part of the Kenanga culture is centred on embracing technology and innovation  and this permeates into our ESG efforts as well ” Chuah says.Earlier this year  Kenanga sealed an MOU with one of Malaysia’s leading solar producers  reNikola  to purchase renewable energy for its operations.“Depending on reNikola’s production schedule  we hope to be operating on 100% renewable energy by 2025 ” Chuah explains.“Our private equity arm is also constantly seeking out investments in start-ups and companies that exhibit a strong ESG agenda.,Raising ESG ambitions for a sustainable future | The Edge Markets,0.05,0.66,0.29,neutral,https://www.theedgemarkets.com/content/advertise/raising-esg-ambitions-sustainable-future,True,True

Google API,The response from customers so far has been encouraging  especially as we’ve noted that 60% of our fund sales have been ESG funds and we remain poised to achieve the RM5 billion target for sustainable AUM by year-end”. — LehOCBC Bank (Malaysia) Bhd is ramping up its environmental  social and governance (ESG) investment offerings to ensure it stays ahead of the game as retail customers increasingly catch the wave of investing sustainably.“We are offering even more products that take ESG into consideration and are ultimately aiming for 100% sustainable investments under our investment product recommendation by 2025 ” Anne Leh  its managing director & head of consumer financial services  tells The Edge.This year alone  the bank has already rolled out 15 ESG-themed investment offerings for retail customers in the form of unit trusts and structured investments.“With this  we have set a target of achieving RM5 billion in sustainable assets under management (AUM) for our retail banking segment by year-end ” says Leh.“Looking beyond 2021  we have also set a 2025 target of having at least 80% of our total AUM for consumer banking recognised as sustainable investments. I’m happy to say we are well on track  with more than half of our current investment AUM recognised as such today ” she adds.The bank’s growing focus on ESG investments is warranted considering that  globally  demand for such investments has jumped since the Covid-19 pandemic broke out last year. According to industry tracker Morningstar  AUM for ESG funds rose 29% globally in 2020 to a record high of nearly US$1.7 trillion.OCBC Bank currently has 68 ESG funds. There are plans in the pipeline for several more ESG-based unit trusts to be rolled out for retail customers before the end of the year.Last month  the bank sealed a fund distribution partnership with Maybank Asset Management Sdn Bhd (MAM)  marking a major move in its journey towards expanding its ESG offerings. The partnership will enable OCBC Bank to access an even greater number of sustainable investment products for its retail customers.“Through this partnership  we have also put together a unique scheme whereby a tree is planted for every investor of a sustainable unit trust product from MAM that is distributed by us ” says Leh  adding that the trees will be planted along the lower end of the Kinabatangan River in Sabah.Given growing demand  OCBC Bank is focused on ensuring retail customers have access to a wide range of ESG-related investment products.The tree planting initiative  done in collaboration with Animal Projects & Environmental Education Sdn Bhd (APE Malaysia)  is aimed at broadening the conversation on sustainability to generate awareness among investors on the ways to get involved in environmental- and climate-related causes.The partnership officially kicked off on Nov 15 with three of MAM’s global unit trust funds as a start  namely Maybank Global Sustainable Equity-I Fund  Maybank Global Sustainable Technology Fund and Maybank Global Mixed Assets-I Fund  all of which will be distributed by OCBC Bank.“We are hoping to have at least 5 000 sign-ups in the three months [following the partnership] so that we can plant 5 000 trees over a half-year period  based on APE Malaysia’s current rate of 800 to 1 000 trees a month. In the longer term  we are looking well beyond the initial 5 000 sign-ups to embrace a wider cross section of society  that is  people who invest in other sustainable funds as well through us ” Leh says.According to Leh  the bank has been actively increasing ESG awareness among both its internal staff and customers. “While profit does matter  we want to encourage our customers to adopt a more holistic approach that incorporates socio-environmental values and responsible investing. We will continue with our long-term sustainable approach to do well by doing good.”OCBC Bank is guided by its group sustainable investment framework when it comes to advisory and investment product recommendations. It also works alongside independent ESG data research providers to ensure that its investment offerings are done appropriately and according to the latest agreed taxonomies and standards.The bank’s fund distribution partnership with MAM comes with a unique tree planting initiative.The bank  a subsidiary of Singapore’s second-largest banking group by assets  Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd (OCBC Group)  began its venture into the realm of ESG-related retail offerings in 2020.It has been an interesting journey so far  says Leh.According to her  the bank’s strategy is to create an “informed and keenly aware” retail clientele who are familiar with the rudiments of sustainable investing. This is so that clients are able to invest in a manner that achieves the ideas of ESG.The bank conducts talks on ESG investing and also promotes awareness via webinars as well as a dedicated retail-specific ESG page on its website.“The response from customers so far has been encouraging  especially as we’ve noted that 60% of our fund sales have been ESG funds and we remain poised to achieve the RM5 billion target for sustainable AUM by year-end. We started on our journey of ESG-themed investment offerings in 2020  and we have at least 50% of our existing investments already in ESG investing ” she shares.Recognising the importance of having employees who are well-versed and competent in the nuances of ESG investing  the bank has taken pains to train and upskill them.“To ensure our customers receive best-in-class advice and services  the training and upskilling of our staff in sustainable financing and investments remain an ongoing journey. In fact  we launched our latest series of ESG training in November for all our retail banking staff  not only the customer-fronting ones. Yes  everyone needs to be equipped in order for us to embrace [this journey] ” says Leh.Leh with OCBC Bank CEO Datuk Ong Eng Bin and OCBC Al-Amin Bank Bhd CEO Syed Abdull Aziz Syed Kechik at the launch of the tree planting initiativeGrowing sustainability-linked loansThe retail aspect of OCBC Bank’s sustainability journey is part of the lender’s overall integrated ESG strategy. This  in turn  is aligned with the OCBC Group’s “S$25 billion by 2025” strategy — which  in a nutshell  is a pledge to grow its sustainable finance portfolio to S$25 billion by 2025.OCBC Group had announced this target in June last year. Interestingly  its original target of S$10 billion was surpassed in the first quarter of 2020 — two years ahead of its 2022 schedule.As a group  OCBC has seen a significant increase in demand for sustainable financing in recent years  owing to better awareness and heightened efforts to combat climate change. Its key markets are Singapore  Malaysia  Indonesia and Greater China.“The group has witnessed strong demand for green and sustainability-linked loans in recent times and has made good progress in the financing of renewable energy projects  especially following its announcement in April 2019 that it will no longer finance new coal-fired power plants ” Leh highlights.In 2019  the group participated in solar as well as onshore and offshore wind projects in Taiwan  China  the UK  Australia and Malaysia.In September this year  OCBC Bank rolled out a solar panel financing plan for residential homes as part of its thrust to make sustainable practices accessible to consumers. The move comes at a time when global carbon footprints and greenhouse gas emissions remain uncomfortably high.“We believe there are enough people out there who want to do the right thing but might not be sure how to go about it or are unable to come up with lump sums for payments. We would like to be an enabling catalyst that spurs good practices ” Leh says of the bank’s solar panel financing plan.,0.39,0.14,0.47,mixed,2021-12-06 00:00:00,English,2021-12-06,ESG,4,ESG,theedgemarkets.com,— LehOCBC Bank (Malaysia) Bhd is ramping up its environmental  social and governance (ESG) investment offerings to ensure it stays ahead of the game as retail customers increasingly catch the wave of investing sustainably.This year alone  the bank has already rolled out 15 ESG-themed investment offerings for retail customers in the form of unit trusts and structured investments.OCBC Bank currently has 68 ESG funds.The partnership will enable OCBC Bank to access an even greater number of sustainable investment products for its retail customers.Given growing demand  OCBC Bank is focused on ensuring retail customers have access to a wide range of ESG-related investment products.,OCBC Bank ramps up ESG retail offerings | The Edge Markets,0.0,0.99,0.01,neutral,https://www.theedgemarkets.com/content/advertise/ocbc-bank-ramps-up-esg-retail-offerings,True,True
Google API,Ms Armour said ASIC was looking forward to the release of new guidelines by the International Sustainability Standards Board  which was established at the recent COP26 summit in Glasgow. The ISSB would build upon those guidelines set out by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosure  to help companies and investors navigate ESG disclosures.“[The ISSB] is working first to meet the urgent demand for transparent and comparable reporting and climate-related matters  with the aim of publishing a climate standard in 2022  probably the second half of 2022 ” Ms Armour said.The ISSB would consider all international standards and bring together a comprehensive set of guidelines for global markets  she said.REA Group chief financial officer Janelle Hopkins  who also chairs CFO industry body the Group of 100  said reporting of climate risk and strategy was a challenge for companies and would put strain on finance executives.“The level of different frameworks that are out there  all the non-financial information that we are going to be providing to the market  then auditing of all of that  there’s actually going to be a substantial amount of work that’s going to be put onto the accounting and finance profession to be able to make sure we can transparently share what we are doing around climate change and talk to our stakeholders about that ” she said.BHP chief financial officer David Lamont agreed climate risk and the company’s decarbonisation progress were front of mind for investors. “There’s not an investor call that I have now that it doesn’t come up in relation to decarbonisation  and where are we heading in relation to our targets ” he said.AdvertisementBHP wants to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and reduce operational emissions by at least 30 per cent from their 2020 level by 2030.“We need about $2 billion to $4 billion [of investment] in helping us decarbonise and get to our 2030 targets ” he said  adding the targets had been approved by shareholders.Despite the cost  BHP says the global energy transition is a net positive for the miner because demand for nickel and copper needed for batteries and electrification will rise.ESG’s role in decision makingRichard Sleijpen  the Australasia head of global capital markets for investment bank UBS  said ESG considerations are increasingly a factor for institutional investors in deciding whether to back a buyout deal.Richard Sleijpen  the head of global capital markets for investment bank UBS in Australasia  said large holders of capital are looking to make an impact by investing with an ESG framework in mind. Edwina PicklesAdvertisement“All investors now have ESG framework as part of their decision-making process with very few  if any exceptions ” he said.Mr Sleijpen said more capital was being directed to deals where sustainability measures were factored into future growth plans.“There is also an increasing pool of capital which is investing with less financial hurdles  and more focus on whether it’s the sustainable development goals of the UN [United Nations] or other impact type of measures that they’re using to justify their investment ” he said.Mr Sleijpen said the influence of index funds and “quant” funds which use trading algorithms to invest  was rising and they now made about one-third of a share register usually in the ASX200  compared with 17 per cent a decade ago.Those funds were much more on the front foot in engaging with companies on their ESG positions  and companies needed to make sure they spoke to them regularly.Warning to finfluencersAdvertisementThe ASIC commissioner also warned CFOs on collaborating with financial influencers on social media  known as finfluencers.“If you’re approached by a finfluencer  seeking to collaborate  or you’re considering reaching out to one  please make sure you do your due diligence as they may be contributing to your regulatory risks ” she said.“We’ve enhanced our surveillance capacity capability across social media  so we can quickly identify pump-and-dump activity and instances of unlicensed advice.”Ms Armour also reiterated calls to market participants to be ready to trade via alternative venues to the ASX in the event of a future outage  emphasising the likelihood of “hiccups” as the market operator embeds the distributed ledger technology-based CHESS replacement in 2023.“We’re expecting market operators and participants to implement the measures set out in this report to ensure that they’re meeting their obligations under the corporations law.

Google API,[ESG Talk] Implant basic principles of ESG  competitiveness in 2022Lee Yeon-wooCompanies are facing a stricter and more standardized ESG business environment. Recently  the Korean state-run bodies have released the K-ESG guidelines  or guidelines for domestic players to abide by. As 2021 ends  reputable ESG rating agencies are publishing ESG scores in Korea. One of the most famous rankers globally is MSCI  and its ESG ratings recently added the new climate change section as part of their rating systems. The newly included “Implied Temperature Rise” element tracks how the company is proceeding with the global target of no more than 2 degrees Celsius increase by 2050. Other information about the company’s decarbonization target and comprehensiveness are summarized.Transitioning with ESGAccording to a study by McKinsey & Co.  the corporations face a new challenge to transition the entire market forces toward climate change in a condensed time frame. Especially  the recent COP26 reassured that governments and business entities have pledged to achieve net zero. This will require the largest reallocation of capital in human history because stakeholders now have to rebuild an economy in 30 years which originally took 200 years to build. However  net-zero commitments have risen without clear scientific targets and solutions.Companies that can actualize the organizations’ true ESG targets most efficiently and effectively are likely to become new leaders in the coming years. ESG will become both the new competitiveness driver and capabilities. The fastest way varies by industry segment; however  the common procedure is to start with the ESG-linked compliance issues. Rating agencies have differentiated evaluation criteria  but there are standard components such as climate change or environmental management (e.g.  policy  organization  stakeholder training  and risk monitoring and reporting).While conducting compliance management  companies usually start developing new opportunities to expand their business areas along with the newly found ESG expertise. For example  manufacturing companies focus on reusing energy  heat  or water waste into their production cycles. These solutions ultimately allow companies to reduce cost and climate change-averse resources for improving operational efficiencies.Information technology-driven companies with a harder time deriving climate change technologies and performance usually focus on using data-based solutions to improve innovation features. Businesses that belong to this industry segment can use their technological capacity to enable and explore new opportunities with the other industry players.Climate change transition and ESG require our utmost attention and immediate technological adaptation. Responsible investment monitoring will be simultaneously reinforced to check if capital goes to the proper ESG-prone businesses. Challenging as it seems  the core principles still follows the old wisdom of competitiveness building -- a source of competitive advantage that stems from improving efficiency and differentiation. Companies that can reinstate their brand value to the consumers and society along ESG efficiency and differentiation will become the new winners or game changers.K-ESG: What it means to businessesOn Dec. 1  Korea’s Ministry of Trade  Industry and Energy released the K-ESG guideline by incorporating 13 key indexes of ratings agencies such as KCGS  DJSI  EcoVadis  Sustainalytics  WEF  and GRI. K-ESG is composed of four main categories and a total of 61 elements. The government bodies will update the guideline every one or two years. In addition  specific guidelines for industries and company types will be released starting 2022.K-ESG guidelines will be helpful to the organizations that need to develop clear and solid systems. Currently  there is an oversupply  a flood of ESG raters that account for over 1 000 worldwide. This has caused a degree of confusion for the recent followers  and K-ESG is likely to serve as a simplified remedy for many that have just begun to pay attention to improving ESG management.Korea has a unique economic characteristic as a nation. The country functions as a vast platform. At the center are large enterprises. Each company is densely connected with a broad range of suppliers. It is true in most IT  manufacturing  automotive and retail industries. Since Korea’s economy has the trait of interdependency  having standardized and consistent ESG guidelines will help garner ESG competitiveness as a nation.C-level and business leaders have spent 2021 catching up with the global ESG news and information. In 2022  businesses should stop questioning the necessity of ESG management and use corporate resources and capabilities to achieve climate change transition in every business practice.Only a few Korean companies smiled or showed relief at the release of many ESG ratings this year. Businesses should quickly incorporate K-ESG criteria into business operations by meeting the compliance issues. Then  depending on the industry type  companies must either explore new opportunities around operational efficiencies or differentiate value.

Google API,iStockNew analysis from international investment firm Citi highlights the increasing pressure on Australia’s big banks to weigh executive pay against climate action.It said 12 ASX200 companies linked executive pay to climate change in 2020.The report comes ahead of the bank’s annual general meetings this month  where shareholders are set to force more transparency around net-zero commitments.Visit Business Insider Australia’s homepage for more stories.How chief executives at Australian banks are paid could be linked to climate change targets in the future  according to a new report from Citi that analysed the impact of climate action on executive pay in 2020.It comes as investors are increasingly scrutinising banks over their exposure to coal  oil  and gas businesses  along with how they plan to lift financing of renewable energy.New analysis of Australia’s ASX200 companies conducted by consulting firm PwC suggests that investor expectations continue to outpace the efforts of Australia’s largest companies amid shifting expectations.Matthew Lunn  ESG assurance lead at PwC Australia  said that while the broader Australian market had seen improvements  critical areas continue to go unaddressed.“We’re witnessing enormous investor-driven demand for information about a company’s commitment to ESG activities  which provides a significant opportunity to impress capital markets and reap the rewards of doing so by clearly demonstrating goals and commitments ” Lunn said.Amid this mounting pressure  Citi analysts suggested investors may also start to push banks to include climate targets in the criteria for executive bonuses  something that has already occurred in some resources companies and other heavy emitters.The report from Citi’s banking and environmental  social and governance (ESG) analysts said that 12 ASX200 companies linked executive pay to climate change in 2020.It cited figures from the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors  and noted energy companies were at the forefront of the movement globally.The report also suggested investors may hold banks to a higher standard than the minimum requirement of regulators  saying climate goals could be included in “scorecards” that influence bonuses.“More sustainable financing is likely to remain a key issue for investors  and we expect that given global trends to link remuneration and sustainability  it could be linked into scorecards given the need to introduce more hard measures ” the analysts said.Pressure on banks over climate change follows the push on lenders to move away from purely financial targets when determining bonuses after the 2018 Royal Commission said remuneration was a key contributor to misconduct.The analysis also follows new findings on employee expectations around climate action by employers.Another report from the Australian Institute of Company Directors (AICD) on the actions of Australian businesses found that almost half of respondents have embedded climate change into risk management frameworks.Almost half of Australians  including 71% of Gen Z and 52% of millennials report they would not work for a business that did not take action to address climate change.The report found that 84% of Australians believe Australian businesses should do more to reduce their emissions and carbon footprint  along with 75% who believe that climate change action could generate new jobs.Cit’s analysis said that CBA had transformed its pay regime by giving the board greater discretion over bonuses in a way it says will lead to greater alignment between shareholders and executives’ interests.In contrast NAB  ANZ  and Westpac were in a “holding pattern” for executive pay in 2021  but there would likely be bigger changes in 2022 when banks would incorporate new requirements from the regulator.Westpac  ANZ Bank  and National Australia Bank will all face shareholder resolutions over their climate change plans at annual general meetings this month  after the issue played a key part in Commonwealth Bank’s annual meeting in October.It has also been flagged as a key issue by activist group Market Forces  which lodged shareholder resolutions with all three banks that will force them to disclose how they propose to meet “net zero” commitments by 2050.,0.84,0.13,0.03,negative,2021-12-06
