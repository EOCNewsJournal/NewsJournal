In 2021 alone  the company has introduced new  innovative products while building – and expanding upon – its RIA partnerships.Midland National Life Insurance Company""We have taken a strategic  focused approach that offers financial solutions that reflect the best possible outcome for clients "" said Rob TeKolste  president of Sammons Independent Annuity Group. ""Our RIA partners and their clients want safe and consistent performance  which is often anchored in insurance and annuity-based offerings.""Additionally  the fixed index annuity (FIA) industry leader has added staff  expertise  and consultants to grow sales and develop its distribution platform. Among the most recent moves are new product innovations  a realignment of priorities  and the launch of MidlandAdvisory.com. The new website cements Midland National's growing commitment to serve and become a resource to advisors.""Our growth  commitment  and investment in technology solutions are well timed "" TeKolste said. ""We have great confidence in developing the advisory business through solutions that deliver compelling results that are specifically designed for these advisors.""Midland National is strategically focused on building fee-only insurance solutions designed for advisors and their clients. Within the past two months  Midland National demonstrated this approach by launching two financial solutions: a contingent deferred annuity (CDA) and a multi-year guaranteed annuity (MYGA). Additionally  Midland National offers two FIA-product series with health-activated benefits and protected accumulation growth.Also last March  Midland National named Cooper Sinclair as associate vice president to lead and strengthen the company's efforts in the RIA market. The company is also actively growing relationships with outsourced insurance desk (OID) leaders. These relationships include RetireOne and DPL Financial Partners.Story continuesNext up: Oak ADVantageMidland National is well seasoned in offering MYGAs through independent agents and broker dealers  and understands the value MYGAs bring to clients with interest rate guarantees and asset protection. As a result  Midland National expanded its MYGA presence into the RIA market with Oak ADVantage.Oak ADVantage was created for the advisory market. The product offers strong credited interest rates with 3-  5-  or 7-year guarantee periods  asset protection in a market downturn  and flexibility for advisors to take advisory fees from the product. Through Oak ADVantage  advisors not licensed in insurance  can access the benefits of a Midland National MYGA without the requirement of having an insurance license. This advisor solution is available through outsourced insurance desks who act as agents of record  allowing an advisor to continue to maintain discretionary authority over the client's account. Learn more here.Midland National underwrites and manages the risk associated with other new solutions recently introduced to advisors:Constance (CDA) offers a stand-alone living benefit to unbundle the annuity's insurance component from the underlying investment. This allows RIAs to wrap client brokerage accounts  Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA)  or Roth IRAs with lifetime-income protection. Constance acts as a ""personal pension"" to transfer risk to the insurance company. By doing so  advisors are empowered to help clients navigate sequence of returns risk  return volatility risk  and longevity risk while providing stable  guaranteed income for life.IndexMax ADV offers three financial index options including an Environmental  Social  and Governance (ESG) index. ESG indices are becoming more popular with advisors and clients. IndexMax offers a dual-crediting strategy for accumulation growth and includes an index tied to the growing ESG market. Making an ESG index available across a range of FIAs allows clients broad access to tools to manage their annuity performance.Capital Income is an FIA that enables advisors to help address the challenge of planning for a client's long-term care costs. As clients live longer  Capital Income provides a health-activated income multiplier to help protect the client's underlying assets if the client is not able to perform two activities of daily living.""I am excited by the offerings we have brought to the marketplace and our ongoing focus to grow the value of Midland National among our agents  advisors  and clients. We are on a strong  upward trajectory "" TeKolste said. ""In our first 20 years  we have delivered amazing results. We are now laying the foundation for our next 10 to 20 years of growth.""About Midland NationalFor more than 115 years  Midland National® Life Insurance Company (Midland National) has been an industry leader  crediting the company's strength to its commitment to stability  innovation  and dedicated customer service.

In a sign of the times  most executives (73%) and investors (70%) say that their organizations or those in which they invest are either very prepared or moderately prepared to achieve more than a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030. The data show even stronger values related to reduction of methane emissions by 2030 (77% for executives and 71% investors).“Five years ago  it would have been difficult to believe that three-quarters of energy executives would feel this well-prepared for carbon and methane reductions – and that investors would feel the same way about their portfolio companies ” said Womble Bond Dickinson partner and Energy and Natural Resources (ENR) sector co-lead Jeff Whittle. “The industry is clearly looking long-term and sees its future as having a very different shape from what it is today.”In addition  77% of industry executives reported that they were already focusing on or considering carbon-neutrality measures and they expressed a relatively equal embrace for pollution-neutrality (79%). Overall  the survey’s findings paint a fascinating snapshot of where the energy transition stands as 2021 draws to a close and suggest that energy leaders do not see an inherent conflict between climate goals and the long-term success of their businesses.Mixed Perspectives on Biden Administration’s Policies and GoalsMost executives (70%) and investors (78%) view the Biden Administration’s climate policies as favorable to their businesses and business opportunities. This data indicates that energy industry leaders value federal guidelines and initiatives supportive of definitive strategies for investment in the transition and for the achievement of net zero goals.“The fact that the new administration is prioritizing these efforts is seen as a welcome change in contrast to the hesitancy of the previous administration to embrace climate initiatives ” said Womble Bond Dickinson partner and ENR sector co-lead Lisa Rushton. “Many in the industry likely see the potential for big returns  whether they’re utility companies already betting on solar and wind or upstream players who see potential in hydrogen and other longer-term plays.”Despite a comfort with the administration’s plans  almost half (49%) of those surveyed believe that the Biden Administration’s announced goal of decarbonizing the power sector by 2035 will not be met. One-third (32%) believe that it will and 20% are unsure.Hydrogen  Biomass and Geothermal Becoming Bigger Pieces of the PuzzleIn reflecting on their status with regard to various renewable energy sources  respondents are actively operating  investing in  or researching a range of established technologies  with solar (50%) topping the list  followed by geothermal (39%)  hydro (37%) and wind (34%). Roughly one-third are active in biofuel/biomass (34%) and hydrogen (31%)  but 8 in 10 said they are either active in  planning for  or considering these areas as future energy sources.“The fact that the data did not identify any clear areas of early concentration in newer technologies suggests that the industry is hedging its bets across many fronts ” said Womble Bond Dickinson partner and ENR sector co-lead Belton Zeigler. “At the same time  it is surprising to see the amount of activity in hydrogen – which is relatively new to the party – and geothermal  which has been something of sleeper to date.”The most appealing growth opportunities in the eyes of executives were identified as battery storage (69%)  hydrogen (67%)  energy efficiency improvements (58%)  and electrification (56%). Furthermore  industry executives identified hydrogen (38%) as the technology for which research and development is most important  followed by biofuels/biomass (29%) and geothermal (27%)Carbon capture and sequestration was not seen as a leading technology by respondents as far their own operations. Only about 1 in 5 of those who said they were prepared at some level to reduce more than 50% of their methane and carbon emissions by 2030 said the technology was part of their plans – which is consistent with the expense and complexity of the technology  as well as the number of high-profile projects that have failed in the past.ESG Mindset in Its Early Days  But GrowingLeaders in the energy sector  while further along than many other sectors  remain in the early stage of implementation when it comes to environmental  social and governance (ESG) policies. There is intense scrutiny in this sector  more than any other  and a major obstacle in the United States remains the lack of any consistent standards.However  there is clear investor focus on ESG  with 76% of those surveyed saying that it is at least a moderate consideration in evaluating energy investments and 85% saying their focus on ESG in investments will increase at least slightly in the next two years. As noted in the firm’s recent article on ESG  “a lack of ESG strategy will ultimately affect a company’s access to public  and increasingly private  capital.” Regardless of the drivers  ESG has certainly played  and will continue play  a material role in accelerating the world’s transition to green(er) energy.Womble Bond Dickinson’s 2022 Energy Transition Outlook Survey Report was completed by 170 decision-makers in the energy industry  including C-suite executives (32%)  investors (29%)  business or operations managers (7%) and in-house legal counsel (29%). Respondents represent a broad spectrum of energy industry sub-sectors including oil and gas  power and renewables  and mining and minerals.

Kao  a leading manufacturer of personal care  household  and cosmetics products  received the highest triple-A score for its sustainability initiatives involving climate change  forests  and water security. Selection onto the list was determined by a global survey of businesses and an evaluation of their activities. 12 000 firms were evaluated for the ‘A List’  with only 14 selected for inclusion across the three categories. Kao has now been included in the Climate Change ‘A List’ for the third time  the Forests ‘A List’ for the second time  and the Water Security ‘A List’ for the fifth time.Dave Muenz  Executive Officer in charge of ESG at Kao Corporation  comments  “Receiving a triple-A score in CDP’s rankings two years in a row is a great honor and is a huge motivation for Kao to push even further to build and grow a purposeful business and help people live a more sustainable lifestyle  a Kirei Lifestyle. The Japanese word ‘kirei’ describes something that is clean  well-ordered and beautiful  all at the same time. We made some big decisions from last year  which we believe has helped us earn this recognition. These include committing to going beyond carbon zero to carbon negative by 2050  and launching programs for our palm oil supply chain.”Recognizing its responsibility as an enterprise that provides products people use on a daily basis  the Kao Group takes active steps to reduce the environmental footprint of its products throughout the entirety of the product lifecycle. In April 2019  Kao launched its ESG strategy—the Kirei Lifestyle Plan—which incorporates 19 key leadership actions. By integrating ESG into the core of its company management  Kao will drive business growth and better serve consumers and society through its enhanced products and services.The inclusion of Kao in the Climate Change  Forests  and Water Security ‘A Lists’ is a result of efforts being made across its value chain. Kao will further its actions in decarbonization  committing to 1.5 degrees scenario carbon reduction targets  as well as joining RE100. Advancements in its commitments regarding forests have been reflected in the positive evaluation it received. Acknowledging the challenges that exist in its palm oil supply chain  Kao has launched the SMILE program designed to support smallholder plantation farmers to increase their yield and improve their living standards  as well as alleviating the pressure for deforestation. With water security  Kao continues to pursue its ‘eco together’ approach in which it works together with stakeholders including consumers  business partners  and society in order to reduce water use through its products with water-saving features powered by its proprietary technologies. The key  however  has been to conduct and maximize scenario analysis relating to climate change  forests  and water security by identifying the risks and opportunities  while integrating plans and actions into the business strategy.Paul Simpson  CEO of CDP  said: “Many congratulations to all the companies on this year’s A List. Taking the lead on environmental transparency and action is one of the most important steps businesses can make  even more so in the year of COP26 and the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report. The scale of the risk to businesses from climate change  water insecurity and deforestation can no longer be ignored  and we know the opportunities of action far outweigh the risks of inaction. Leadership from the private sector is essential for securing global ambitions for a net-zero  nature positive and equitable world. Our A List celebrates those companies who are preparing themselves to excel in the economy of the future by taking action today.”By integrating ESG into the core of its company management  for example taking active steps in relation to climate change  forests and water security  Kao will drive business growth and better serve consumers and society through its enhanced products and services. With this socially conscious ethos  Kao will create a Kirei life for all—providing care and enrichment for the life of all people and the planet.About CDPCDP is a global non-profit that runs the world’s environmental disclosure system for companies  cities  states and regions.

Responsible Innovation Labs  founded by Hemant Taneja  managing partner at venture firm General Catalyst  and former Stripe executives Jon Zieger and Diede van Lamoen  will help founders innovate with economic inclusion  environmental sustainability  workforce diversity  privacy  and “intentionality and impact.”“I’ve been investing for 20 years now and when you think about the role of technology … it’s become one of the most powerful forces  if not the most powerful force for shaping change in society ” Taneja says. Adds Zieger: “We think about this as turning good intentions into practical action and rigorous standards.”In recent years  large corporations have embraced stakeholder capitalism—the notion the purpose of a corporation is to serve employees  customers  suppliers  and communities  in addition to shareholders—and some large public stock holders are factoring environmental  social  and governance (ESG) metrics into investing decisions.

Key findings[1] show that nearly 90% of employers in Hong Kong are concerned about employee retention when market conditions improve  while 85% of them also concern the shortage in talent and skills  in particular within senior and team leader levels.LogoHong Kong overviewOverall  Hong Kong market rebounded strongly in 2021. There was a good deal of pent-up demand to start the year and hires that would possibly have been made in 2020 under normal conditions were executed in early 2021  leading to a glut of hiring. Talent pool has started to become limited in all areas especially within the technology and financial services sectors due to demand for digitalisation  travel restrictions and higher level of emigration.Findings also show that candidates consider factors beyond compensation and benefits when looking for jobs  such as if companies offer good work-life balance  access to latest technology  hybrid working and if the company's positions on social and political matters align with their own etc.Digitalisation and transformation will continue to be a key growth area across many sectorsCompanies are becoming more agile with their workforce post-COVID and are speeding up their transformation projects. Findings show that 95% of tech professionals are confident about job opportunities. It is anticipated that the hottest technical skills in 2022 will be big data analysis  machine learning  AI and cyber security across both permanent and contract roles. For job movers possessing in-demand or niche skill sets  salary increments of 15-20% would be expected  and could be as high as 40% for some senior positions.Story continuesDemand for hybrid jobs has intensified in the commerce sectorsAcross HR  marketing and finance functions there is an increase in hybrid jobs where more and more jobs are combining skill sets that traditionally do not fall under the same roles  or candidates in technical disciplines are expected to apply more soft skills such as analysis and management skills in their jobs. For example  companies will be seeking for finance candidates that are highly analytical with strong commercial mindset who can analyse big data and convert this into commercial results. This shift in demand for talent has created challenges to hiring managers as the broader the job requirements and more specialised the role are  the harder it will be to attract the best talent that are often experienced candidates.The financial services candidate pool is shrinking with higher demand for ESG-related skillsTravel restrictions and higher level of emigration mean that financial services professionals who stay may be able to command higher salary increments when they move jobs. With very little hiring of expatriates and many existing ones emigrating from Hong Kong  the percentage of foreign nationals working in the Hong Kong financial services sector especially front office pool will shrink further. The sector has performed strongly and firms are anxious to avoid turnover and focus on retention. Salaries are expected to increase in 2022 with the standard pay rise level of 4-5% reaching 10%. For job movers the previous standard increment of 15% is now closer to 20%  although it can vary somewhat depending on the individual context.On the other hand  with Environmental  Social & Governance (ESG) edging into finance's mainstream  it is expected that ESG factors are increasingly taking centre stage within investment strategies by corporates and financial services in 2022 and beyond. However  supply of professionals that possess sustainability-related skills are limited in Hong Kong so the competition will be fierce.Companies are advised to capitalise on the opportunities brought by the new normalThe pandemic has forced companies and workforces to scramble towards hybrid working and the experience has shaped the perspectives of work. Industry survey[2] conducted by Robert Walters reveals 78% of professionals said that the offer of hybrid working arrangements would make them more likely to join a prospective employer.Ricky Mui  Managing Director - Greater China of Robert Walters Group says  ""Given the shortage of candidates and the increasing demand for hybrid jobs  it's expected that the competition for the best candidates will be fierce in 2022. Candidate experience will be key in attracting talent and businesses embracing hybrid workplace effectively will be recognised as an employer of choice. At the same time  having a robust equity  diversity and inclusion (ED&I) policy  as well as adopting new strategies to broaden the talent pool will ensure companies gain an edge over their competitors. ""Steady growth in contract roles for key projects drives demand for tech professionals and junior staffMarket rebound has also driven companies to catch up with projects that were on hold during COVID. During busy periods with an increased workload  contract professionals that can alleviate a short-term skills or resource gap will be particularly valuable to hiring managers where the recruitment process is more drawn out due to a narrow talent pool with few suitable candidates. Distinct recovery especially within the junior permanent recruitment market is also expected across technology and business transformation project roles.Carly Adams  Director of Walters People Hong Kong  says  ""Hiring managers need to be prepared to run an efficient and timely recruitment process in junior roles and contract recruitment.

The securities priced on Monday and will yield 1.17 percentage point more than Treasuries  according to a person with knowledge of the matter.The notes it is selling are a type of environmental  social  and governance security known as sustainability-linked bonds  sales of which have surged in recent months  reaching a record high for the year. Global sales of the bonds are around $105 billion so far this year  a record and up from just $10 billion the whole of last year  according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Unlike traditional sustainable notes that finance specific projects  sustainability-linked bonds allow companies to tap the ESG bond market to fund just about anything provided they pledge to meet certain social or environmental thresholds. That flexibility is attracting companies that don’t have specific green ventures to fund  including corporations in the largest carbon-emitting industries.Denver-based Newmont aims to reduce direct emissions from operations and indirect emissions from purchased and imported electricity consumption  or scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions  by 32% by 2030 based on a 2018 baseline  according to Monday’s filing.Story continuesThe company also aims to slash select indirect emissions from its value chain -- including from activities like waste generated in operations  business travel and employee commuting -- by 30% in the same period  according to the filing. These scope 3 targets are based on a 2019 baseline. The company also has goal of achieving a 50% representation of women in senior leadership positions by 2030.The interest rate payable on the notes will be increased if the company fails to reach these targets.

Obtained less than 12 months after the acquisition of these assets  this certification demonstrates Kasada's strong commitment to developing a hospitality platform that meets the most stringent international ESG standards.An innovation of IFC  a member of the World Bank Group  EDGE is a green building standard and a certification system that empowers building professionals to quickly and easily determine the most cost-effective ways to build green based on occupant behavior  building type and the local climate. Available worldwide  EDGE was created in response to the need for a measurable solution to prove the financial case for building green and to help jumpstart the mainstreaming of sustainable real estate.In order to obtain these certifications  Kasada conducted an audit and detailed studies of the buildings built in the 1980s. New improvements carried out have reduced energy and water consumption by 35% and 22% respectively for Ibis Plateau  and 38% and 28% respectively for Ibis Marcory. The measures implemented by Kasada have made it possible to avoid producing 583.07 tonnes of CO 2 per year. This program also entailed large investments in staff training  who now integrate energy management into their daily activities.Olaf Schmidt  IFC’s Manager for Real Estate  Hotel & Retail  Health & Education and Manufacturing Investments in Africa said: “Now is the time to accelerate investments in green building that lay the foundation for a sustainable building sector. The hospitality sector has an important role to play and we are glad to see Kasada’s work in getting more of the hotels in its portfolio to be EDGE certified.”Olivier Granet  Managing Partner and CEO of Kasada  said: “Kasada's goal is to push the boundaries of hospitality in sub-Saharan Africa by becoming the regional benchmark for environmental  social and governance standards. We strive to ensure that our operations have as little environmental impact as possible and benefit local communities in a sustainable way. Obtaining the EDGE certification is a first step in this direction  but we will not stop there. We are therefore very pleased to welcome to our platform an experienced professional  who shares our values  as our new Head of ESG : Mokgadi Maunatlala. She will be crucial in bringing our vision to life and in positioning Kasada as a game changer in this industry.”Other hotels owned by Kasada are currently at an advanced stage of the audit process and should be EDGE certified by the first quarter of 2022.

Together with partners like Ureeka  Comcast is committed to investing in diverse small businesses that play a critical role in driving our economy.In honor of National Entrepreneurs’ Day  we asked Melissa to share her top three tips for underrepresented entrepreneurs  what she looks for when considering companies to invest in  and her thoughts on the role entrepreneurs play in growing jobs and building wealth. Below are some highlights of the conversation.What are your top three tips for underrepresented entrepreneurs?Melissa Bradley: “As we move into 2022  and I think we're still all adjusting to what this new normal is  my tips are grounded in where I know there are the greatest gaps  either because they have been intentionally excluded from traditional systems that foster entrepreneurship or because we know that too often these entrepreneurs lack access to capital.”Manage your finances well. Plan  plan  plan. Don't be afraid to ask for help.Learn more about Melissa’s advice for underrepresented entrepreneurs and why they are essential to our economy and collective successIn addition to your role at Ureeka  you are also an angel investor. What do you consider when choosing companies to invest in?Melissa Bradley: “I look for three things. One  I spend a lot of time with the entrepreneur. I know people say ‘team  team  team’  but I'm not looking for a pedigree. I'm not looking for years and years of accolades. I'm looking for passion. I'm looking for commitment. I'm looking for a willingness to learn because these are uncharted waters. And I'm looking for a desire to be the best that they possibly can. You know  we're all going to make mistakes and they're going to learn. I want to know that the entrepreneur is willing to learn with me and learn with others to be able to advance the investment.”Story continues“The second thing is  I do want to understand the market. There's a lot of things I don't know. I like to be able to rely on the entrepreneur and their community to really understand what is the market opportunity here.”“[Lastly] And what you probably hear a lot is making sure there's product market fit.

We know that if you were to total up all the women-based businesses here in the United States  they would have the fifth largest GDP in the world  which is ahead of France  the United Kingdom  and Italy.”“And if you were to use African-American entrepreneurs as a proxy for other entrepreneurs of color  we know that they contribute 10 percent of the GDP year-over-year and are starting businesses six times beyond the national average.

But the electric company has now quadrupled the rebate amount for those who either live in a state-designated  income-qualified household or who are enrolled in certain state or federal income assistance programs.“We want the benefits of clean transportation to be available to all our customers  including those who are buying pre-owned EVs ” said Carter Prescott  SCE director of Electrification. “And now we’re happy that we can provide additional help to customers who may need it.”Rebates for new and used EVs have been available to SCE customers since 2017. Earlier this year  the utility extended its program for used EVs to lend a hand to more cost-conscious customers seeking to go electric. Federal and state government programs also offer rebates and other incentives to lower the cost of buying new electric cars.The Pre-Owned EV Rebate program is available to first  second and third owners or lessors of pre-owned EVs. By overcoming one of the key barriers to EV ownership — affordability — the program aims to stimulate EV adoption  a key component in helping the state meet its critical climate and air quality goals.“Many people  regardless of income  would rather buy pre-owned vehicles instead of new  and SCE’s pre-owned EV rebate may make the difference between those customers buying an EV rather than a car powered by fossil fuel ” Prescott said. “At SCE  we also strive to ensure that our programs help communities that are most impacted by harmful vehicle emissions.”Story continuesApplying for the rebate can be done online in a few minutes. SCE customers simply need to go to evrebates.sce.com and enter their SCE service account number and current vehicle registration card number. Up to three consecutive owners of a single EV are eligible for a rebate  and up to three EVs at each SCE customer address can receive rebates. Those applying for the higher rebate amount will be asked to provide information proving that they qualify.""We want the benefits of clean transportation to be available to all our customers  including those who are buying pre-owned EVs. And now we're happy that we can provide additional help to customers who may need it.” - Carter Prescott  SCE Director of ElectrificationCustomers can also shop for used EVs online and compare the price of owning them to similar gas-powered cars at cars.sce.com. The site shows how EVs can save on fuel  maintenance and other costs. Charging an electric car at home is equal to paying less than $2 per gallon of gasoline.The Pre-Owned Rebate is funded by the California Air Resources Board’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program  which helps combat climate change by encouraging the use of clean fuels  like electricity  in vehicles.SCE is helping to accelerate EV adoption through its innovative Charge Ready charging infrastructure programs  which support the installation of electric car charging at workplaces  schools and public places and multifamily dwellings  as well as charging for fleet and industrial vehicles.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Edison International on 3blmedia.comView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/sce-quadruples-rebate-offer-for-pre-owned-evs-181469170",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.76,0.09,0.15,True,English,"['SCE Quadruples Rebate Offer', 'Pre-Owned EVs', 'innovative Charge Ready charging infrastructure programs', 'current vehicle registration card number', 'Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program', 'California Air Resources Board', 'SCE service account number', 'federal income assistance programs', 'Pre-Owned EV Rebate program', 'harmful vehicle emissions', 'air quality goals', 'electric car charging', 'Southern California Edison', 'similar gas-powered cars', 'state government programs', 'three consecutive owners', 'SCE customer address', 'pre-owned electric vehicles', 'higher rebate amount', 'new electric cars', 'Income-qualified residential customers', 'Income-qualified SCE customers', 'owned vehicles', 'fossil fuel', 'electric company', 'income-qualified household', 'third owners', 'pre-owned EVs', 'Edison Writer', 'Edison International', 'EV ownership', 'EV adoption', 'single EV', 'industrial vehicles', 'income-qualified customers', 'Paul Griffo', 'clean transportation', 'SCE director', 'additional help', 'other incentives', 'first, second', 'key barriers', 'key component', 'critical climate', 'Many people', 'Up to', 'other costs', 'climate change', 'clean fuels', 'public places', 'multifamily dwellings', 'additional multimedia', 'ESG storytelling', 'source version', 'three EVs', 'cost-conscious customers', 'Carter Prescott', 'News Direct', 'EV.', '$4,000 rebate', '$1,000 rebate', 'Northampton', 'SCE_PaulG', 'benefits', 'Electrification', 'Rebates', 'utility', 'hand', 'lessors', 'affordability', 'difference', 'communities', 'minutes', 'information', 'price', 'site', 'maintenance', 'home', 'gallon', 'gasoline', 'electricity', 'installation', 'workplaces', 'schools', 'fleet', '3blmedia', 'View', 'newsdirect', 'quadruples', 'offer']",2021-12-06,2021-12-07,finance.yahoo.com

The event brought together more than 60 major political  business and academic leaders who care about the future of ESG to discuss 10 ESG-relevant topics  among them  ESG investment  sustainable development and low-carbon transformation.According to Harari  the turmoil in the international order was not inevitable  but was rather the result of conscious and deliberate decisions made by certain politicians or leaders. These leaders sought to disrupt the international order by constantly emphasizing the inherent contradiction between loyalty to one's own country and international cooperation.In fact  there is no natural contradiction between nationalism and globalism  between loyalty to one's own country and international cooperation. The core of nationalism is to love and care for one's compatriots  rather than hate foreign countries. And in many cases  to take good care of one's compatriots will inevitably require global cooperation. Harari mentioned that  from the global responses to COVID-19  a good nationalist is sometimes also a good globalist that knows how to cooperate with others. No country will be safe as long as the virus spreads in other countries across the world. Once the virus has undergone mutations  it will come back in a much more vicious form. In the face of such a crisis  all countries are ""communities with a shared future"". Epidemic prevention is an international matter requiring international cooperation.Climate change is also a global crisis needing our common attention. No one country can solve it independently  even if the best ecological policies are adopted. If any country refuses to cooperate  all countries still need to bear the consequences of global warming and ecosystem collapse.We have only one Earth  all countries should do their bit to protect it and cooperate on climate issues. Harari took the Tokyo Olympics Games as an example and pointed out that the Games  although  technically speaking  an inter-national competition  are in fact a deep cooperation among different countries. The Olympics are hosted under the premise that all countries agree on the rules of the competition. Admittedly  it is much easier to form a consensus on Olympic rules than on governing the climate crisis. But we need to realize that international cooperation is possible  and cooperation is the cornerstone for solving problems together.""It is possible for humans to cooperate with each other as long as we realize that cooperation is not for others but for ourselves "" Harari concluded. ""In the face of crises  if we cannot reach global cooperation  we will all bear the severe consequences.""About CITIC Press GroupCITIC Press Group  affiliated with the CITIC Group  was founded in 1988 and announced its public listing by 2019.

Throughout the rest of the month  the brands will donate $1 to hunger relief organization Feeding America for every TikTok user who posts content using a special snowball-themed effect and the hashtag #SnowballFightAgainstHunger.“The holidays are a very special time of year for my family ” Brandy said in a press release. “I’m so excited and honored to partner with T.J.Maxx  Marshalls  and HomeGoods to spread holiday magic in a creative way  while also raising money and awareness for the important work being done by Feeding America.”This seasonal giving campaign offers the latest example of how your brand or organization can tap into an influencer’s existing following on TikTok to promote your charitable campaigns.Here are today’s top stories:Doordash launches new grocery service with emphasis on full-time employmentFood delivery app Doordash is launching a pilot in NYC that promises to deliver “ultra-fast” groceries. Customers can choose from 2 000 items in the company’s newly minted Dashmart to have them delivered by a courier in 10-15 minutes.For the new service  Doordash will employ full-time courier employees who are actively managed  and use a new  internal app designed specifically for them. These roles will include traditional benefits like medical  dental and vision insurance.According to its press release:“Millions of people across the country turn to platforms like DoorDash to earn supplemental income when  where and how they choose  providing them with unique flexibility and choice that is so valuable ” [said Christopher Payne  President of DoorDash]. “We’re proud to be a leader in providing economic opportunities that fit the lives of so many people. And now  we’re excited about the new employment opportunity that DashCorps offers for a different type of work.”In interviews with several news outlets  Max Rettig  vice president of public policy at Doordash  went deeper into the DashCorps’ emphasis on creating full-time employment opportunities:“[Employees] will not have the ability to say which deliveries they want to do  that’s kind of what it is to be an employee ” Rettig said. “You’re going to have to show up  you’re going to have to do the deliveries that need to be done in order to operate this ultrafast delivery service. I will say  though  that the radii around each of the DashMarts is going to be relatively small  so we’re not talking about deliveries across bridges or through tunnels.” “There’s a form of flexibility and independence that you get as a Dasher that is incredibly valuable to people as they’re seeking to earn supplemental income that just won’t be available to you if you’re an employee of DashCorps ” Rettig said. “There are also things that you’ll get as an employee of DashCorps  especially if you’re working full-time  that you won’t get as an independent contractor as a Dasher.”Why it matters:Doordash’s foray into the growing grocery delivery market follows a Doordash driver strike in August to protest a lack of transparency around tips and a low base pay  along with new NYC legislation guaranteeing delivery worker protections. By focusing on NYC as the pilot market for its new service and launching a small business advisory council  Doordash demonstrates how a company can test industry-first policies and procedures by sharing them with critics from the outset.By focusing on how its new service will have roles for both full-time employees and independent contractors  Doordash also demonstrates how you must consider employee messaging when announcing a new service or product. Particularly as Doordash has faced questions around work conditions  the message around a new ultra-fast delivery service had to address how workers would be compensated fairly.MEASURED THOUGHTSIn new data from LinkedIn  80% of Gen Z users said they trust the platform and 73% said that they feel safe posting content there. Meanwhile  70% said that the content shared on LinkedIn is relevant to them. LinkedIn also found that Gen Z users prefer its platform over other channels for networking  learning and research.Courtesy of LinkedInLinkedIn’s numbers suggest the platform is embraced by younger  as well as older  generations. By focusing on trust  LinkedIn hopes to distinguish itself from other social media platforms like Facebook that are currently experiencing public reputational crises.Check out the full report here.TAKE OUR SURVEYIf you’re looking to further your understanding of your industry to navigate what’s ahead in 2022  lend us a hand—and help yourself and your peers identify shared benchmarks in areas such as budgets  team structure  ESG and DE&I efforts  and more.

All of the identified cases onboard are asymptomatic. In addition to requiring that 100% of guests and crew are fully vaccinated  per the Company’s comprehensive health and safety protocols  we have implemented quarantine  isolation and contact tracing procedures for identified cases. We are testing all individuals on Norwegian Breakaway prior to disembarkation  as well as providing post-exposure and quarantine public health guidance by the CDC. Any guests who have tested positive for COVID-19 will travel by personal vehicle to their personal residence or self-isolate in accommodations provided by the Company according to CDC guidelines. We take this matter extremely seriously and will continue to work closely with the CDC  the office of Governor John Bel Edwards  the Louisiana Department of Health as well as the city and port of New Orleans.

ESG,200,2021-12-07 18:33:01.358285+00:00,ESG,NewsApi.org,https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2021/12/07/engaging-with-state-street-global-advisors/,Engaging with State Street Global Advisors,I joined State Street Global Advisors in 2018 as Asia-Pacific Head of Asset Stewardship  based in Japan.We saw that you supported the HCM proposal and note that this topic is a thematic priority for State Street.They also participate in meetings more frequently in the off-season when we dive deeper into long-term strategy and its link to specific ESG issues.There are so many important and financially material ESG issues we want to focus our direct engagements on.Erica: In recent years  there’s been a shift in the broader narrative around board diversity from disclosure to representation.,Key TakeawaysState Street Global Advisors is evolving its proactive and targeted approach to engagement  prioritizing climate change  human capital management (HCM) and diversity equity and inclusion  and expanding its stewardship teamPlans to publish new guidelines on HCM and effective climate transition disclosures  focusing on how companies will achieve their Net Zero commitments and encouraging interim progress on GHG reduction goalsConsidering modifications to its director overboarding policy that would allow exceptions to current guidelines if boards provide disclosure of their policies for outside board service and how board contributions are evaluatedRefining its views on executive compensation  with a focus on encouraging increased exposure to the company’s stock price over time and guidance for inclusion of ESG metricsApproach to Stewardship and EngagementErica Lukoski: Ben  you’ve been at State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) for three years and in your role as Global Co-Head of Asset Stewardship for almost two years. Can you tell us about your path to SSGA and your current position?Ben Colton: I’ve been in corporate governance for more than a decade. I started my career at Norges Bank Investment Management  working in Oslo for almost five years and then in New York City for three years. I joined State Street Global Advisors in 2018 as Asia-Pacific Head of Asset Stewardship  based in Japan. I always say that this global context is important as it has informed my view of stewardship but it is also reflective of how our team is structured.We have analysts in three regions—APAC  EMEA  and the Americas—and among these teams we have a considerable amount of overlap when it comes to how we cover companies. The stewardship team is not siloed based on sectors—we have subject-matter experts who focus on social issues  those who focus on environmental topics and others who specialize in governance topics. The common factor is that everyone is involved in voting and engagement.Similar to how we share our view with companies on the importance of diversity of thought  we also encourage diversity in our team in terms of perspectives  geographies and backgrounds. We believe it is to our advantage to debate and deliberate across the team  which helps us be consistent in our approach. We have expanded the team in 2021 and expect to considerably grow headcount in 2022.Erica: How does this team structure support your approach to engagement?Ben: Over the past year and a half we have shifted our engagement program toward a more targeted and outcome-oriented approach that is focused on issues we believe are financially material. We are prioritizing engagement based on our thematic priorities which encompass 1) Emerging ESG trends 2) Our clients’ portfolio exposure 3) Developing macroeconomic conditions and regulation and 4) Insights derived from our R-Factor™ scores.Even though we won’t be able to engage with every company  we have other means of communicating with our portfolio companies that we believe are effective. This includes the thought leadership we publish such as the annual CEO letter to board members highlighting our stewardship priorities  quarterly vote disclosure alongside our quarterly stewardship reports  a multi-year outline of our key voting policies in Q1 and our R-Factor™ program. We view all of these as part of our engagement program because each play a role in communicating our approach to these issues and provide a roadmap for companies to move their own practices forward.In addition  there are a number of issues that we want to do deeper dives on—climate change  HCM and human rights—and we have shifted our approach to be more proactive in our engagement on those topics. For example  earlier this year  we sent letters to 35 of the largest employers in the US and UK  across sectors  as part of a new initiative on HCM practices. We met with many of these companies several times to really understand and gather information on best practices  challenges  expectations and what the future looks like. We’ve used that due diligence to develop a well-vetted and thoughtful approach. Based on this  we’ll be publishing best practices and expectations about what good HCM disclosure looks like and also where companies may fall short.Erica: How are you prioritizing with whom you engage and what are the best ways for companies to get your attention when they want to discuss particular topics?Ben: We are doing fewer engagements with companies where we have no outstanding concerns  there is significant information in the public domain or the issue that the company wants to engage on is related to a clear-cut policy that we have in place. But that doesn’t mean that we do not want to hear from companies that have issues that they want to raise with us. We are working to improve our engagement tracking capabilities and moving forward in 2022  intend to respond to all incoming requests within a week of receipt.To that end  we encourage companies to send their engagement requests to the full team because it means there will be more eyes on that request. Sending a note to a single analyst means that if that person misses it then no one will see it. The best practice from our standpoint is to email the full team distribution and provide context in the email body. For example: “Dear Governance Team  we would like to schedule an engagement following up on a conversation we had with Michael during proxy season. We saw that you supported the HCM proposal and note that this topic is a thematic priority for State Street. We would like to dive deeper to understand your views and share our practices.”Erica: How frequently are active managers joining stewardship team engagements and what is the catalyst for them to join meetings?Ben: Our active teams have access to our internal stewardship platform and are able to get visibility into our upcoming engagements which they may choose to join depending on the topic and expected attendees. That typically includes meetings in which they have access to board members or the executive management team or in discussions related to contested situations. They also participate in meetings more frequently in the off-season when we dive deeper into long-term strategy and its link to specific ESG issues. While proxy voting responsibility ultimately lies within the stewardship team  our active teams are integrated into the voting process and systematically provide us with their recommendations and perspectives.Erica: When do you want to engage with directors and what should every director know before they engage with SSGA?Ben: We are looking for directors to demonstrate robust ESG knowledge and be conversant on how topics like climate change and diversity are linked to company strategy. We want to know how the board tracks progress  how the board helps determine which ESG issues are material to the company and how the board holds management accountable for ESG commitments.As it relates to executive compensation  for example  we don’t find it relevant to hear what a company’s compensation consultant recommended—we care about what the compensation committee members think. We are often engaging with the same board member for two or maybe even three CEO transitions. We value the relationship we have with directors in good times and in more challenging times  even if that encompasses a withhold vote or disagreement about compensation for the year in review.Executive CompensationErica: What about companies that are looking to engage because they have specific questions or concerns  such as on executive compensation?Ben: Companies often seek to engage with us after a low or failed say-on-pay vote or in response to a majority-supported shareholder proposal. Our view is that when companies come to us and say—we have a new plan for compensation after this challenging vote  what do you think?—we view that as a missed opportunity. We want these discussions to be around giving feedback on a company’s general approach to executive compensation so that our view can be taken into account  rather than a box-ticking exercise after the revised plan has already been developed. We expect compensation committees to develop an effective plan that will achieve the company’s goals  tie closely to strategy and align with investors’ interests.I want to be clear about a related point—we generally don’t want to focus all of our calls on a single issue  namely executive compensation. There are so many important and financially material ESG issues we want to focus our direct engagements on. I would rather start the conversation on strategy  including how ESG material factors are overseen and managed  and then dig in to understand how incentives have been developed to support the execution of that strategy.Erica: What are the primary reasons that SSGA votes against executive compensation?Ben: One of the main reasons we vote against pay is due to the lack of alignment with long-term strategy and long-term shareholder interests. In our view  the most effective way to attain this alignment is to give executives equity-based compensation in a form that exposes the amount actually received by the executive to the performance of the company’s stock for a long period of time. Robust  minimum stock ownership guidelines can further bolster this alignment.We are willing to be more flexible with what the ratio of PSUs to RSUs are with longer periods  but companies should strive to put as much pay tied to stock price performance  and with the same risks experienced by shareholders  as the compensation committee is comfortable with  balancing retention and other needs. We are rethinking what a “good” executive compensation plan looks like and we plan to further refine our views on how companies may need to adjust their practices to achieve that goal.This year we voted against more compensation plans than in prior years  which was the result of a combination of a few different factors. In the summer of 2020  we put out guidance on our expectations for executive compensation practices during the pandemic. This past proxy season  we were surprised by the numerous situations where we saw the use of upward discretion  especially in light of furloughs and lay-offs. We also expected downward discretion to be used more frequently in situations where performance related to the pandemic was extraordinary  but not ultimately sustainable.From our perspective  discretion is not inherently bad—it can be used in a productive way and that’s the responsibility of compensation committees. But  when discretion is used  or there’s a deviation from the plan  there needs to be robust disclosure on the committee’s decision-making process. That’s a critical component of our analysis.Erica: What is SSGA’s view on ESG metrics in compensation programs?Ben: We are agnostic about ESG metrics in compensation plans. Too often are we finding that they are either easily gamed  fluffy  or ‘tick the box’ metrics. There isn’t yet clear evidence showing that the inclusion of these metrics actually leads to better ESG performance. We have pushed so hard over the years towards compensation plans that minimize the principal-agent problem and our concern is that the inclusion of poorly crafted ESG metrics could exacerbate it.If used  ESG metrics need to be tied to strategy  quantifiable  sufficiently challenging and incentivize behavior that is clearly articulated in companies’ disclosure. In addition  given ESG is inherently long term  our view is that ESG metrics should be part of the long-term program. We will likely provide more clarity on this topic in the future.OverboardingErica: Let’s shift to director commitments  an increasing focus for companies and investors. SSGA tightened its policy on overboarding in 2020—what has been your experience these past two proxy seasons?Ben: Directors have a challenging role and the topics that they are being asked to oversee have increased in scope and become more complex. Engagement culture  not only with shareholders but with internal and external stakeholders  has placed more demands on their time. We have taken a bright line approach to overboarding because we do not necessarily want to make a subjective call comparing one directors’ performance to another. But we have been listening to companies as well and want to be pragmatic about how we approach this policy.One idea we are considering to go into effect for the 2022 proxy season is to provide more guidance within our policy to clarify that it is the board’s decision to determine if a director has enough time to fulfill their commitments. While some companies have policies on outside board commitments in their corporate governance guidelines  it is not a standard practice and not all companies that have such a policy disclose that information in the proxy statement. If companies have a written policy on board commitments and provide more visibility into how nominating and governance committees are assessing directors’ time commitments and engagement on the board  that might help us get comfortable moving away from our bright line approach.Climate Coalitions and Approach to Climate RiskErica: What is SSGA’s approach to joining and working with the growing number of investor coalitions such as the Climate Action 100+ (CA100+)?Ben: We are members of the CA100+ as well as the Net Zero Asset Manager Initiative. We are very directionally aligned with both of these organizations and have taken the lead on engagement with two companies for CA100+—one in the UK and one in Japan—where we have had positive outcomes to date. We think the information sharing in these groups has been effective and we recognize that they require a two-way exchange of information. With that being said  we have our own guidelines and perspectives and we also have the ability to influence change and disclosure standards through our own efforts. So  while we provide perspectives on best practices  we tend to do that separately from group efforts.Erica: What is next for SSGA when it comes to assessing climate risk?Ben: One area where I think we can improve is to provide greater clarity about our expectations on what an effective climate transition plan looks like. We are not trying to reinvent the wheel  but we do need to be able to show the commonalities between disclosure frameworks and baseline expectations about what goes into a climate transition plan. That may be done on a sector-specific basis  but we are in the process of developing a set of expectations or underlying themes that we think all companies should take into account. That could include topics like climate strategy and governance  how companies are considering a Just Transition  capital allocation planning  emissions targets  and goals.We are also assessing the unintended consequences of climate action. Take the Net Zero initiatives many companies are making—we encourage companies to make Net Zero pledges but for us it is much more about how you get there. One issue that is not getting enough attention is aggregate carbon emissions and other asset classes. If investors push a company to achieve Net Zero and they achieve that by selling their ‘brown’ assets to private equity  that changes nothing from an aggregate carbon emissions standpoint and in many cases it might actually increase it.Just because a company is “Net Zero” doesn’t mean that they  or the broader market  have avoided the negative externalities of climate change. Similarly  if companies offload ‘bad’ assets to other market actors  we as an investor lose disclosure  our seat at the table  and ultimately our ability to influence and hold companies accountable. That results in a private benefit but a social cost.I think we also need to shift the conversation around these issues from a binary lens—brown and green—to one that encourages directional progress. By shaming brown assets and neglecting the fact that in the near term we will need fossil fuels that have to be supplied from somewhere  we’re missing the forest for the trees.As a universal owner that holds more than 13 000 companies  we want to use our ability to influence and support companies transitioning from dark to light brown as it may be more impactful than a company that is going from green to darker green. We are open to those ‘dirty’ companies that are committing to make measurably greener outcomes because that may be more impactful than simply pushing them to divest to the private sector.Shareholder ProposalsErica: While we saw significantly higher support for E&S-focused shareholder proposals this year  SSGA has been relatively consistent in its support for these proposals over time. Can you give us some insight into why you don’t support certain proposals?Ben: We don’t tend to support proposals that are too prescriptive on business strategy or capital allocation—we elect directors to set the strategy and oversee risks and opportunities and feel it is more appropriate to hold them accountable through director votes. We also are unlikely to support proposals if the company is already providing disclosure aligned with our expectations.We are seeing more proposals around HCM  social issues and the governance of environmental and social issues. These track the broader evolution of proposals which used to be primarily around disclosure but are now around oversight of topics such as climate lobbying. This pattern is evolving quickly on the social side and we expect to see more of those this coming year. If we see a proposal type that seems like it will become more prominent  we try our best to publish our expectations and framework for evaluating that proposal. We’ve done that in the past with political participation  pay gap  and racial equity audit proposals  among others.Companies may agree or disagree with our expectations  but ultimately I think they appreciate that we are consistent in our approach and maintain our overarching voting philosophy year-over-year even as our policies evolve. The increased level of support for shareholder proposals this past year will empower and embolden proponents and I think that will lead to an increase in the number of proposals. Some will be well crafted and others will not warrant our support  but we do intend to be clear about how we analyze them.This new landscape is going to be a challenge for directors – while many of these proposals can bring up important issues and spark conversations about whether current practices are meeting market expectations  others may be duplicative  overly prescriptive or poorly crafted. We strive to be as transparent as possible about how we analyze shareholder proposals to provide directors with clarity (and by that I mean predictability) into our voting decisions.Diversity Equity & Inclusion (DE&I)Erica: The final topic we wanted to touch on is DE&I. Let’s start with disclosure of EEO-1 data  which you first called for in August of 2020 and then added as a voting policy in January 2021. Now that a number of companies are disclosing this information  how strictly will you enforce the policy and how will you use the information once you have it?Ben: When we wrote to board chairs in August of last year  we made clear that EEO-1 disclosure was part of a broader set of expectations that we had for companies on their racial and ethnic diversity. That starts with strategy  setting goals  providing metrics  ensuring board engagement and effective oversight. Our policy that goes into effect in 2022 (announced in 2021) is clear—if an S&P 500 company does not disclose its EEO-1 report  we will hold compensation committee chairs accountable.Since publishing our guidance we have held more than 200 engagements on this topic and companies have rightfully raised some concerns—that the data is not the whole picture  that it is not efficient to disclose that along with their own data. But  in our view  every company is already collecting this data and though it may not be how the company views its workforce’s racial and ethnic makeup  it does provide a comparable baseline framework. We fully encourage companies to add their own complementary narrative and disclosure to show why other measures are more important  how the board is looking at this issue or how the company views its workforce composition.Erica: In recent years  there’s been a shift in the broader narrative around board diversity from disclosure to representation. What’s SSGA’s longer-term vision on board diversity?Ben: Our underlying goal in all of our efforts around improving diversity  equity and inclusion is to promote diversity of thought. That’s why we are so focused on gender  racial and ethnic diversity. A lot of research points to the fact that once a critical mass of diversity of thought is reached  it enhances the ability of that group to achieve better outcomes. We have a policy coming online this year to vote against nominating and governance committee chairs at S&P 500 and FTSE 100 companies that do not have at least one director from an underrepresented community on their boards. We are looking at how we can continue to enhance our voting guidelines and disclosure expectations on this topic  and how they might include additional dimensions of diversity and inclusion. As we approach the five-year anniversary of the Fearless Girl campaign  we know that these initiatives can have an impact  which is why we are continuing to make it a focus.Erica: You recently published a report with Russell Reynolds and the Ford Foundation on board oversight of racial and ethnic DE&I. What is your current thinking about the role of the board in setting and overseeing these initiatives?Ben: The genesis of that report was an exercise at the request of State Street Corporation when it launched its “10 Actions” to address racism and inequality earlier this year. When we set out to do that research  we found that there just wasn’t a lot of good information out there on the topic of what relevant risks and opportunities boards should be overseeing on the topic. Our interviews with over 25 leading directors in the US and UK led us to establish 10 recommendations for boards  including establishing KPIs on racial equity  engaging with relevant stakeholders  and focusing on the potential impacts of a company’s products and services on communities of color.One of our learnings from that project was that directors are not doing enough to oversee risks related to the impact of their company’s products and services on communities of color. There was a lot of emphasis on board and workforce diversity  but very little conversation about externalities related to racial equity. Given the increased focus from stakeholders  including investors  on this topic—for example  in the emergence of racial equity or civil rights audits—we think directors are missing an important dimension of risk. Going forward  we expect to learn more from boards about how they’re overseeing risks and opportunities related to DE&I in a comprehensive way  beyond the board and workforce. We hope to see the overall conversation move from diversity in terms of representation to also focus on equity and inclusion.,positive,0.89,0.11,0.0,mixed,0.74,0.08,0.18,True,English,"['State Street Global Advisors', 'Norges Bank Investment Management', 'State Street Global Advisors', 'effective climate transition disclosures', 'human capital management', 'Net Zero commitments', 'GHG reduction goals', 'annual CEO letter', 'Emerging ESG trends', 'outside board service', 'New York City', 'quarterly vote disclosure', 'clients’ portfolio exposure', 'quarterly stewardship reports', 'engagement tracking capabilities', 'good HCM disclosure', 'key voting policies', 'Global Co-Head', 'global context', 'climate change', 'Key Takeaways', 'increased exposure', 'ESG metrics', 'human rights', 'new guidelines', 'board contributions', 'board members', 'new initiative', 'interim progress', 'overboarding policy', 'current guidelines', 'executive compensation', 'stock price', 'three years', 'two years', 'current position', 'corporate governance', 'a decade', 'five years', 'Asia-Pacific Head', 'three regions', 'considerable amount', 'subject-matter experts', 'common factor', 'past year', 'a half', 'thematic priorities', 'macroeconomic conditions', 'R-Factor™ scores', 'other means', 'multi-year outline', 'R-Factor™ program', 'deeper dives', 'largest employers', 'due diligence', 'best ways', 'fewer engagements', 'outstanding concerns', 'public domain', 'clear-cut policy', 'incoming requests', 'Asset Stewardship', 'stewardship priorities', 'environmental topics', 'governance topics', 'best practices', 'particular topics', 'portfolio companies', 'engagement program', 'thought leadership', 'significant information', 'engagement requests', 'outcome-oriented approach', 'thoughtful approach', 'full team', 'HCM practices', 'Erica Lukoski', 'stewardship team', 'Ben Colton', 'social issues', 'targeted approach', 'proactive', 'diversity', 'equity', 'inclusion', 'Plans', 'modifications', 'director', 'exceptions', 'boards', 'views', 'focus', 'encouraging', 'company', 'time', 'guidance', 'SSGA', 'role', 'path', 'career', 'Oslo', 'Japan', 'analysts', 'APAC', 'EMEA', 'Americas', 'teams', 'overlap', 'sectors', 'others', 'everyone', 'importance', 'terms', 'perspectives', 'geographies', 'backgrounds', 'advantage', 'headcount', 'regulation', 'Insights', 'Q1', 'roadmap', 'addition', 'number', 'example', 'letters', 'challenges', 'expectations', 'future', 'attention', 'place', 'week', 'receipt']",2021-12-07,2021-12-07,corpgov.law.harvard.edu

(NYSE: ICE) is a Fortune 500 company that designs  builds and operates digital networks to connect people to opportunity.At ICE Mortgage Technology  we are transforming and digitizing the U.S. residential mortgage process  from consumer engagement through loan registration.Trademarks of ICE and/or its affiliates include Intercontinental Exchange  ICE  ICE block design  NYSE and New York Stock Exchange.,"ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Intercontinental Exchange  Inc. (NYSE: ICE)  a leading global provider of data  technology and market infrastructure  today announced a series of senior leadership changes across the company under Chief Executive Officer Jeff Sprecher that reflect the firm’s expansion in recent years and position it for continued growth in its third decade. The leadership changes  designed to continue delivering value for ICE customers  shareholders  and other stakeholders  draw entirely from deep and diverse talent within the organization  providing these leaders an opportunity to help grow the business in new ways and expand their management roles.“ When a handful of colleagues and I founded ICE over twenty years ago  our simple idea was to make trading more automated and transparent  and that purpose anchored our original leaders as we grew exponentially  and their duties grew along with the firm ” said Jeff Sprecher  Founder  Chairman and CEO of Intercontinental Exchange. “ Now with a market capitalization of over $70 billion  and a substantially transformed company from our origins  it’s more important than ever to challenge our leaders to take on new tasks and acquire new skills as we serve a new and ever evolving marketplace.”Below is a letter that Sprecher shared with the company’s nearly 10 000 employees today.To my ICE colleagues:All around us  the world is changing. The market environment in 2021 is vastly different than when we began our journey in 2000.At COP26  which concluded in Glasgow last month  the private sector pledged $130 trillion in finance commitments to address climate change  which provides great opportunity in many areas of our exchanges segment.Investors are seeking increased transparency in the fixed income markets  punctuated by a demand for more ESG data to guide investing in the $128 trillion bond market  an opportunity that’s still in the early innings for our fixed income and data segment.The increasing cost of originating mortgages and changing regulatory framework are driving demand for increased efficiency and transparency in this space  trends that will continue to benefit our mortgage technology segment.I mention these factors that affect each of our businesses because at no point in our history have global trends and macroeconomic factors aligned so favorably with the strategic decisions that our management team have made over the past few years to prepare for them. ICE’s ability to plan for such events has allowed it to thrive amid dramatic moments of change.And as times change  ICE is changing along with it. As I said in our third quarter earnings call a few weeks ago  our broad product and service platform positions us well to benefit from not only near-term cyclical events  but also longer-term secular growth trends. In the same way  the increasing expertise  experience  and diversity of our management team position us to innovate more rapidly  manage risk more efficiently  and grow more sustainably.As organizations everywhere adjust to a world transformed by the pandemic  our management team is evolving along with the market environment. I’m not going anywhere  but for many years  we’ve been working to develop the next generation of ICE leaders who’ll bring energy and experience to drive our success in the future. Challenging this group of global leaders with new or expanded roles is fundamental to good governance and stewardship of our firm.Here are some of the noteworthy changes you’ll see as we head into the new year:At the New York Stock Exchange  Sharon Bowen  an ICE and NYSE Board Member  one of the nation’s leading finance and securities lawyers  and formerly a Commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)  will become the next Chair of the NYSE. In addition  Lynn Martin  currently President  ICE Fixed Income and Data Services  has been appointed the next President of the NYSE  succeeding Stacey Cunningham  who is beginning a new chapter in her career and will join the Board of Directors of the NYSE. I’ll share more thoughts on Stacey at the end of this note.Lynn will lead the NYSE with a knowledgeable  collaborative  and outstanding team of executives  including Michael Blaugrund  the Exchange’s Chief Operating Officer  and John Tuttle  its Vice Chairman and Chief Commercial Officer. In addition  Hope Jarkowski  formerly the Co-head of Government Relations at ICE and currently the NYSE’s Head of Equities  will become its General Counsel  replacing Elizabeth King who  you’ll note below  is taking on additional ICE-wide responsibilities.While Lynn assumes her new role at 11 Wall Street  she will continue to serve as Chair of ICE Fixed Income and Data Services to help guide that business as Amanda Hindlian  currently the Global Head of Capital Markets at the NYSE  becomes its new President. The global business that Amanda will now lead includes our evaluated pricing business  which prices nearly 3 million securities daily  and our rapidly growing index business. As this business continues to expand  Mark Heckert  the Chief Product Officer of ICE Fixed Income and Data Services  will add leadership of the index and desktop areas of the segment as he broadens his duties.Turning to ICE as a whole  Mark Wassersug  ICE’s Chief Operating Officer  will transition to a new role as the company’s Chief Information Officer  overseeing our industry leading technology implementations across our growing business and working closely with Mayur Kapani  ICE’s Chief Technology Officer. As Mark moves into this position  Stuart Williams will succeed him as Chief Operating Officer of ICE  reporting to ICE President Ben Jackson. Stuart  who is currently President of ICE Futures Europe  will remain in that post until a successor is identified and in place.As part of this transition of Stuart into a new role  Trabue Bland  currently President of ICE Futures U.S.  will oversee all of ICE’s Futures Exchanges  which will continue to report to Ben. Adding to Trabue’s team  Jennifer Ilkiw  now the head of ICE Asia Pacific  will relocate to New York to serve as President of ICE Futures U.S.Rounding out the organizational changes  Elizabeth King  ICE’s Chief Regulatory Officer  who will report to me  will add responsibilities for ICE ESG  our burgeoning product initiative around sustainable investing. Elizabeth will also oversee the NYSE’s Board Advisory Council  which works with the CEOs of NYSE-listed firms to identify diverse candidates for boards of directors of venture-funded and newly public companies. In addition  Chris Edmonds  who also reports to me and has been leading our clearing businesses  will see his role expanding as Chief Development Officer for ICE  adding oversight of ICE’s marketing and communications  in addition to his other duties.Nine years ago this month  ICE announced its $8.2 billion acquisition of NYSE Euronext  a move that put our relatively obscure company on the map. One week before that news broke  Stacey Cunningham joined the NYSE. She was new to our team  but not new to the building  having spent the early years of her career on the NYSE Trading Floor. Stacey embraced the challenge as ICE set out to reinvent a global icon. As the NYSE’s Chief Operating Officer and  since 2018  its 67th President  Stacey oversaw a complete technology overhaul of the Exchange  delivered innovations in our capital markets with the advent of the NYSE Direct Listing  and expanded ESG efforts across NYSE and its broader community  all while continuously advocating for investors. Stacey led the NYSE through an extraordinary era that saw its technology prove resilient and its trading systems thrive in even the most turbulent times. She begins a new chapter with the Exchange better and stronger for her tireless efforts  and with our deepest thanks.As we look to the future  it’s worth recalling we launched ICE with $1 000 and a focus on energy trading. Two decades later  we’re a mission-critical provider of technology and data services across global commodity markets  interest rates  equities  fixed income  and mortgages. The ICE that our customers know today is a company with a broad mix that  together  delivered net revenues of $1.8 billion in the third quarter of 2021  our best third quarter in history. Our performance so far in 2021 is a testament to everyone who has helped build ICE into an all-weather performer for our customers and shareholders over the years.We’re mindful that this sets a high bar for our management team in the new or expanded roles we’re announcing today. Our Board of Directors and I have total confidence this group of seasoned professionals will take ICE to new heights  leading our team all over the world  collaborating across businesses  and innovating continuously to unlock additional growth opportunities in the months and years ahead.Thank you for all that you’re doing  every day  to help our customers make the connection between people and opportunity.JeffAbout Intercontinental ExchangeIntercontinental Exchange  Inc.

Our assets have been highly utilized  reflecting strong end-user demand and the critical role they play in delivering reliable and affordable energy. Recent global energy shortages have confirmed again that our assets will remain essential  while our early low-carbon energy investments illustrate how our assets will be a bridge to a cleaner energy future.Story continues""Last year  we set new ESG goals to reduce emissions to Net Zero and improve diversity. This year  we've lowered emissions  increased workforce and Board diversity  and integrated our ESG goals into enterprise-wide business plans and compensation to drive future performance.""This year  we've placed $10 billion of growth capital into service  which will generate significant cash flow growth in 2022. This is also expected to drive our leverage metric to the lower end of our 4.5-5.0x debt-to-EBITDA target range  providing us with additional financial capacity to grow the business. Going forward  our value proposition will continue to emphasize a strong balance sheet and return of capital to shareholders.""We are pleased to be growing our 2022 dividend by 3%  marking our 27th straight year of increases. This is consistent with our objective to grow dividends ratably up to the level of our medium-term average annual DCF per share growth outlook of 5 to 7% (through 2024)  while targeting the midpoint of our payout range of 60-70%.""We've also announced our intent to file a notice of intention to make a normal course issuer bid before year end. Implementing a normal course issuer bid will provide flexibility to repurchase up to $1.5 billion of our common shares and create an additional avenue to supplement the return of capital to shareholders  while increasing per share earnings and distributable cash flow.""One of our mantra's at Enbridge is the disciplined deployment and allocation of capital. Looking forward to our 3-year planning horizon  we expect to have $5-6 billion of annual investment capacity  of which $3-4 billion is prioritized to core low capital intensity and utility-like investments. The remaining $2 billion will be deployed to the next best alternatives and benchmarked against share repurchases.""Our organic growth will be focused on enhancing existing asset returns  modernizing our assets  and low capital intensity opportunities within our conventional businesses to serve growing domestic and export market demand. We also plan to continue to invest in low-carbon opportunities that leverage our existing assets and provide a platform for future growth.""Today's announcement of $1.1 billion of newly sanctioned growth projects  along with the $1 billion announced earlier this year  demonstrates the size and quality of our opportunity set  and how we're advancing our growth strategies across the business.""We're confident that our assets will be an integral source of energy supply for decades to come and are excited by the future low-carbon investment opportunities that we see. Through 2024  our secured capital program along with embedded revenue escalators and continued focus on productivity improvements provide us with confidence that we can grow DCF per share by 5-7% per year on average.""We believe that our strategic plan continues to provide investors with a compelling total shareholder return value proposition  which combines highly predictable cash flows  an attractive organic growth outlook and a ratable return of capital to shareholders.""Strategic Priorities and Three-Year Financial OutlookThe Company's 2022 Strategic Plan priorities continue to reinforce the resilience  longevity and organic growth potential of its cash flows over the long-term.

Capital Power is currently repowering the Genesee 1 and 2 units  to create North America's most efficient natural gas combined cycle power generation units  positioning it to deliver reliable and affordable electricity for generations to come. The Genesee CCS Project is expected to capture up to 3 million tonnes of CO 2 annually from the repowered units  which would be transported and stored through Enbridge's Open Access Carbon Hub that could also serve several other local industrial companies.

This information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as ''anticipate''  ''expect''  ''project''  ''estimate''  ''forecast''  ''plan''  ''intend''  ''target''  ''believe''  ""likely"" and similar words suggesting future outcomes or statements regarding an outlook. Forward-looking information or statements included or incorporated by reference in this document include  but are not limited to  statements with respect to the following: Enbridge's strategic plan  priorities and outlook; 2021 and 2022 financial guidance  including projected DCF per share and adjusted EBITDA and expected growth thereof; expected dividends  dividend growth and dividend policy; intended normal course issuer bid and related filing of notice of intent to make a normal course issuer bid; supply of  demand for and prices of crude oil  natural gas  natural gas liquids  (NGL) liquefied natural gas (LNG) and renewable energy; expected energy transition; environmental  social and governance (ESG) goals and targets  including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions intensity and reduction targets and diversity and inclusion goals  and our plans to achieve such goals and targets; anticipated utilization of our existing assets  including throughput on the Mainline; expected future cash flows; expected shareholder returns; expected performance of the Company's businesses  including customer growth; financial strength and flexibility and investment capacity; expectations on sources of liquidity and sufficiency of financial resources; expected in-service dates and costs related to announced projects and projects under construction and for maintenance; expected capital expenditures and capital allocation priorities; anticipated cost savings; expected future growth and investment opportunities  including secured growth program; expected use of new technologies and the benefits thereof; expected future actions of regulators and courts and the timing and anticipated impact thereof; and toll and rate case filings  and the anticipated impact therefrom.Although Enbridge believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable based on the information available on the date such statements are made and processes used to prepare the information  such statements are not guarantees of future performance and readers are cautioned against placing undue reliance on forward-looking statements. By their nature  these statements involve a variety of assumptions  known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors  which may cause actual results  levels of activity and achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements. Material assumptions include assumptions about the following: the COVID-19 pandemic and the duration and impact thereof; the expected supply of  demand for and prices of crude oil  natural gas  NGL  LNG and renewable energy; expected energy transition; anticipated utilization of our existing assets; anticipated cost savings; exchange rates; inflation; interest rates; availability and price of labour and construction materials; operational reliability; customer and regulatory approvals; maintenance of support and regulatory approvals for the Company's projects; anticipated in-service dates; weather; the timing and closing of acquisitions and dispositions; the realization of anticipated benefits and synergies of transactions and projects; governmental legislation; litigation; impact of the Company's dividend policy on its future cash flows; credit ratings; capital project funding; hedging program; expected EBITDA and expected adjusted EBITDA; expected earnings/(loss) and adjusted earnings/(loss); expected earnings/ (loss) or adjusted earnings/(loss) per share; expected future cash flows and expected future DCF and DCF per share; and estimated future dividends. Assumptions regarding the expected supply of and demand for crude oil  natural gas  NGL  LNG and renewable energy  and the prices of these commodities  are material to and underlie all forward-looking statements  as they may impact current and future levels of demand for the Company's services. Similarly  exchange rates  inflation  interest rates and the COVID-19 pandemic impact the economies and business environments in which the Company operates and may impact levels of demand for the Company's services and cost of inputs  and are therefore inherent in all forward-looking statements. Due to the interdependencies and correlation of these macroeconomic factors  the impact of any one assumption on a forward-looking statement cannot be determined with certainty  particularly with respect to expected EBITDA  expected adjusted EBITDA  expected earnings/(loss)  expected adjusted earnings/(loss)  expected DCF and associated per share amounts  and estimated future dividends. The most relevant assumptions associated with forward-looking statements regarding announced projects and projects under construction  including estimated completion dates and expected capital expenditures  include the following: the availability and price of labour and construction materials; the effects of inflation and foreign exchange rates on labour and material costs; the effects of interest rates on borrowing costs; the impact of weather; customer  government and regulatory approvals on construction and in-service schedules and cost recovery regimes; and the COVID-19 pandemic and the duration and impact thereof.Enbridge's forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties pertaining to the realization of anticipated benefits and synergies of projects and transactions  successful execution of our strategic plan and priorities  operating performance  the Company's dividend policy  regulatory parameters  changes in regulations applicable to the Company's business  litigation  acquisitions and dispositions and other transactions  project approval and support  renewals of rights-of-way  weather  economic and competitive conditions  public opinion  changes in tax laws and tax rates  changes in trade agreements  political decisions  exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices  supply of and demand for commodities  and the COVID-19 pandemic  including but not limited to those risks and uncertainties discussed in this and in the Company's other filings with Canadian and United States securities regulators. The impact of any one risk  uncertainty or factor on a particular forward-looking statement is not determinable with certainty as these are interdependent and Enbridge's future course of action depends on management's assessment of all information available at the relevant time. Except to the extent required by applicable law  Enbridge assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements made in this news release or otherwise  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise. All forward-looking statements  whether written or oral  attributable to Enbridge or persons acting on the Company's behalf  are expressly qualified in their entirety by these cautionary statements.Non-GAAP MeasuresThis news release makes reference to non-GAAP  including adjusted earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization (Adjusted EBITDA)  distributable cash flow (DCF) and DCF per share. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for unusual  non-recurring or non-operating factors on both a consolidated and segmented basis. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA to set targets and to assess performance. DCF is defined as cash flow provided by operating activities before the impact of changes in operating assets and liabilities (including changes in environmental liabilities) less distributions to non-controlling interests and redeemable non-controlling interests  preference share dividends and maintenance capital expenditures  and further adjusted for unusual  non-recurring or non-operating factors. Management uses DCF to assess performance of the Company and to set its dividend payout target. Management believes the presentation of these measures gives useful information to investors and shareholders as they provide increased transparency and insight into the performance of the Company.Reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP measures to comparable GAAP measures are not available due to the challenges and impracticability with estimating some of the items  particularly certain contingent liabilities and non-cash unrealized derivative fair value losses and gains which are subject to market variability. Because of those challenges  a reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.The non-GAAP described above are not measures that have a standardized meaning prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and are not U.S. GAAP measures. Therefore  these measures may not be comparable with similar measures presented by other issuers. A reconciliation of historical non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures is available on the Company's website.

Those days are long gone. Now  waste paper can be processed to yield products that are just as clean and bright as their virgin counterparts. That opens up new opportunities for brands seeking a sustainable profile  even in the previously challenging area of direct-contact food and beverage packaging.The next big step for recycled paperPackaging and shipping materials  napkins  paper towels  stationary  craft papers  newsprint  books  magazines  various kinds of office papers  and even kitty litter are among the many different kinds of paper products now made partly or entirely with recycled fibers.Foods and beverages are becoming another important growth avenue for recycling stakeholders  as consumers become more accustomed to the idea that recycled paper can be safely used in that area. However  until recently the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) only allowed recycled paper in food and beverage packaging with a polyethylene coating or other barrier. The concern was that trace amounts of ink and other chemicals used in papermaking and recycling could contaminate foods and beverages.In past years  that created a challenge for brands seeking to simplify their packaging  eliminate petroleum-based plastics  and source 100 percent recycled materials.In 2018 the recycling industry finally reached a groundbreaking  first-of-its-kind milestone when the FDA approved Sustana Fiber’s proprietary EnviroLife recycled fiber for direct-contact food and beverage packaging. Among many uses Sustana lists takeout containers  including hot beverage and soup containers  as well as pizza boxes  bread bags  coffee bags  meat and cheese wrapping  and clamshell-type containers.Emily Olson  director and sustainability ambassador at Sustana  calls EviroLife the company’s “hero product.”Story continues“We’re seeing a shift away from the linear economy of take  make and waste  both from consumers and brands  and we want to engage in a circular economy ” Olson told TriplePundit. “EnviroLife 100 percent recycled fiber is compliant with FDA standards for use in direct contact with food. We can partner with global companies  for example  to put recycled content into coffee cups and sandwich wraps for fast food.”Consumers are primed to accept the use of recycled paper in direct-contact food packaging  Olson observed. Recycled paper content is already commonplace in cereal boxes and other non-contact packaging. With the assurance of FDA approval  direct food contact is simply the next step.A big step up for the circular economyThomas Fu  vice president of global innovation at the packaging company Sabert Corp.  also emphasizes the significance of EnviroLife being FDA compliant.Fu observes that the use of soy ink and other environmentally-friendly substances in food packaging has made a difference  and EnviroLife is a next-level improvement for brands seeking to disentangle themselves from the plastic supply chain. The availability of direct-contact recycled paper packaging also coincides with government policies aimed at reducing the flow of plastic waste  including the European Union’s Single-Use Plastic Directive.“Especially in the last three years  the pace of innovation has picked up ” Fu told us. “We see significant innovation in sustainable packaging from raw materials  to design  to adoption by brands in the marketplace  through the supply chain.”The now-familiar demands of environmentally conscious consumers have also played a strong role. “One thing we observe is that more and more brands are making public commitments to sustainable packaging in paper products ” Fu said. “That public commitment to big sustainability goals goes back to consumer expectations  especially with the younger generation. They are clearly driving it.”Yes  we can science our way out of thisMovie-going audiences got a Hollywood style perspective on the zero waste  circular economy of the future through the 2015 film The Martian  in which Matt Damon’s fictional astronaut survives the harsh environment on Mars through a combination of solar power  organic farming and cutting-edge technology.Sustana brings a similar sustainability trifecta to the packaging industry by innovating solutions that are better for business  the environment and society at large. The company’s Sustana Fiber plant deploys a chlorine-free processing system that separates moisture barriers in cartons and other containers to be turned into new products like toilet paper  tissues and paper towels. It also captures recycling byproducts for reuse as animal bedding and other purposes.The emphasis on continued innovation enables Sustana to provide brands with a proactive edge on growing consumer interest in the circular economy.“We are very aware of the consumer and the end user. We recognize we have a very unique opportunity to partner with brands to meet sustainability goals ” Olson explained  taking note of research indicating that consumers have become more satisfied with sustainable products over the past three years.“More and more products are being put on the market to help consumers make different choices  compared to even five years ago ” she told us.The growing consumer preference for environmentally-friendly products has become a powerful driver of both public policy and private-sector activity. As the recycled paper field becomes more crowded  brands that take advantage of new recycling technologies can stake out a position ahead of the pack.This article series is sponsored by Sustana and produced by the TriplePundit editorial team.Image courtesy of SustanaView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from TriplePundit on 3blmedia.comView source version on newsdirect.com: https://newsdirect.com/news/raising-the-recycled-paper-bar-for-better-branding-687144652,positive,0.92,0.07,0.01,mixed,0.22,0.12,0.66,True,English,"['Recycled Paper Bar', 'Better Branding', 'EnviroLife 100 percent recycled fiber', 'direct-contact recycled paper packaging', 'important growth avenue', 'Hollywood style perspective', 'chlorine-free processing system', 'Single-Use Plastic Directive', 'similar sustainability trifecta', 'last three years', '100 percent recycled materials', 'big sustainability goals', 'other environmentally-friendly substances', 'U.S. Food', 'News Direct-- TriplePundit', 'growing consumer interest', 'plastic supply chain', 'next big step', 'many different kinds', 'other non-contact packaging', 'direct food contact', 'direct-contact food packaging', 'Sustana Fiber plant', 'Recycled paper content', 'direct contact', 'next step', 'sustainability ambassador', 'various kinds', 'past years', 'shipping materials', 'raw materials', 'plastic waste', 'other uses', 'other barrier', 'other chemicals', 'other containers', 'other purposes', 'beverage packaging', 'sustainable packaging', 'packaging industry', 'fast food', 'paper towels', 'toilet paper', 'Tina Casey', 'virgin counterparts', 'new opportunities', 'sustainable profile', 'craft papers', 'office papers', 'kitty litter', 'Drug Administration', 'polyethylene coating', 'trace amounts', 'petroleum-based plastics', 'kind milestone', 'proprietary EnviroLife', 'takeout containers', 'hot beverage', 'soup containers', 'pizza boxes', 'bread bags', 'coffee bags', 'cheese wrapping', 'clamshell-type containers', 'linear economy', 'circular economy', 'global companies', 'coffee cups', 'sandwich wraps', 'cereal boxes', 'vice president', 'Sabert Corp.', 'next-level improvement', 'government policies', 'European Union', 'familiar demands', 'strong role', 'One thing', 'public commitments', 'consumer expectations', 'younger generation', 'Movie-going audiences', 'The Martian', 'Matt Damon', 'fictional astronaut', 'solar power', 'organic farming', 'cutting-edge technology', 'moisture barriers', 'animal bedding', 'proactive edge', 'end user', 'unique opportunity', 'paper products', 'recycling stakeholders', 'recycling industry', 'global innovation', 'significant innovation', 'new products', 'recycling byproducts', 'continued innovation', 'waste paper', 'challenging area', 'FDA standards', 'FDA approval', 'soy ink', 'harsh environment', 'packaging company', 'Emily Olson', 'Thomas Fu', 'conscious consumers', 'Words', 'Northampton', 'cardboard', 'degree', 'coarseness', 'days', 'brands', 'napkins', 'stationary', 'newsprint', 'books', 'magazines', 'fibers', 'Foods', 'beverages', 'idea', 'concern', 'papermaking', 'challenge', 'groundbreaking', 'meat', 'director', 'EviroLife', 'Story', 'shift', 'example', 'assurance', 'significance', 'difference', 'availability', 'flow', 'pace', 'design', 'adoption', 'marketplace', 'way', 'future', '2015 film', 'Mars', 'combination', 'solutions', 'business', 'society', 'cartons', 'tissues', 'reuse', 'emphasis']",2021-12-06,2021-12-07,finance.yahoo.com

Taught by Barbara Porco  PhD  and Tim Hedley  PhD  the class blends SASB materials such as case studies  powerful data sets and other resources with impressive guest speakers including sustainability experts from the Value Reporting Foundation and Big Four accounting firms to prepare students for the Fundamentals of Sustainability Accounting (FSA) Level 1 certification.As more companies around the world issue standardized sustainability disclosure  demand for professionals who can prepare and use financial and material sustainability information has never been higher.The course – and the FSA credential itself – is configured to emphasize the connection between financial sustainability reporting and a business’ ability to drive value. Currently  over 20 graduate and undergraduate students are gaining new knowledge of how sustainability issues impact enterprise value  and how to better integrate ESG data into reporting  corporate strategy  and investment analysis.Speaking about further implications for students  Timothy Hedley  PhD  adjunct professor and senior advisor at K2 Integrity said  “There is a huge demand for skillsets in the [ESG] area  and I believe our students are going to be uniquely qualified when they get to the marketplace  because they have been so deeply engaged with these standards.”The Sustainability Disclosures and SASB Standards course accompanies an already robust range of credit-bearing options for Gabelli School students to study sustainability literacy. A sustainability accounting track is available for accounting majors and a sustainability concentration is open to all undergraduates. Additionally  all Gabelli School students are introduced to sustainability content embedded into their curricular and co-curricular programming.“There are many skills needed to lead businesses in a responsible way  but one key aspect is sustainability reporting ” said Barbara Porco  PhD. “This new pathway toward the FSA Credential further enables the Gabelli School to offer unparalleled sustainability education opportunities for students.”According to the Value Reporting Foundation  80% of Fortune 500 CEOs have FSA Level 1 certification. To date  more than 3 000 candidates  representing more than 50 countries around the world  have participated in the FSA Credential  with more than 1 900 passing FSA Level I and more than 900 earning the full credential by passing Level I and Level II.Founded in 1920  the mission of the Gabelli School of Business is to inspire and empower positive global change  developing students into compassionate business leaders and supporting faculty and students in the ongoing generation of new knowledge. The Gabelli School’s vision is to become a world leader in social innovation by inspiring and equipping its graduates to be business leaders who understand the challenges in sustainability facing businesses and the potential of harnessing the power of social responsibility for both financial success and societal impact.For more information  visit: https://www.valuereportingfoundation.org/  https://fsa.sasb.org/ and https://www.fordham.edu/business/.###,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,positive,0.51,0.48,0.01,True,English,"['Foremost ESG Reporting Credential', 'Value Reporting Foundation', 'Fordham University', 'Gabelli School', 'Business Teams', 'Students Access', 'Big Four accounting firms', 'unparalleled sustainability education opportunities', 'impressive guest speakers', 'one key aspect', 'positive global change', 'powerful data sets', 'standardized sustainability disclosure', 'sustainability accounting track', 'foremost professional credential', 'The Gabelli School', 'The Sustainability Disclosures', 'FSA) Level 1 certification', 'FSA Level 1 certification', 'Value Reporting Foundation', 'material sustainability information', 'FSA Level I', 'compassionate business leaders', 'SASB Standards course', 'financial sustainability reporting', 'Gabelli School students', 'Level II', 'ESG data', 'FSA credential', 'ESG) reporting', 'sustainability experts', 'sustainability issues', 'enterprise value', 'sustainability literacy', 'sustainability concentration', 'sustainability content', 'SASB materials', 'full credential', 'New York', 'GLOBE NEWSWIRE', 'dynamic collaboration', 'exclusive access', 'Barbara Porco', 'Tim Hedley', 'case studies', 'new knowledge', 'corporate strategy', 'investment analysis', 'Timothy Hedley', 'adjunct professor', 'senior advisor', 'K2 Integrity', 'robust range', 'credit-bearing options', 'many skills', 'responsible way', 'new pathway', 'Fortune 500 CEOs', 'ongoing generation', 'social innovation', 'social responsibility', 'financial success', 'societal impact', 'business’ ability', 'Fordham University', 'other resources', 'undergraduate students', 'huge demand', 'curricular programming', 'world leader', 'Dec.', 'field', 'governance', 'fall', 'kind', 'PhD', 'class', 'Fundamentals', 'companies', 'professionals', 'connection', '20 graduate', 'implications', 'skillsets', 'marketplace', 'majors', 'undergraduates', 'businesses', 'date', '50 countries', '1,900 passing', 'mission', 'faculty', 'vision', 'challenges', 'potential', 'valuereportingfoundation', 'org']",2021-12-07,2021-12-07,marketscreener.com

They're known for high growth but also high volatility  something that shareholders have unfortunately learned about the hard way in 2021.Their latest ETF  which is set to launch this week  is going to be unlike anything they've done before. The ARK Transparency ETF (CTRU) has the goal of targeting the 100 companies that it defines as ""most transparent"". The idea is that companies with greater transparency and visibility can offer greater long-term return potential to shareholders.Note: Interested in getting periodic e-mail notifications when articles are published here? Drop your e-mail in the box below!source: ARKThat objective alone could be considered unusual for ARK given the ""swing for the fences"" nature of its other 8 ETFs. CTRU  however  goes another step further by adding an ESG screen to its investment strategy.Yes  ARK is jumping on the socially conscious investing train.Inside The ARK Transparency ETFCTRU plans on avoiding all of the areas that you might expect when going ESG - tobacco  alcohol  fossil fuels and gambling - but avoids some other industries as well that on the surface seem like curious areas to avoid.The banking sector  for instance  is out altogether as is the ""confectionary"" space. By eliminating sweets  I guess ARK is looking out for your waistline as well as your brokerage account!At a high level  the fund will track the Solactive Transparency Index  which will assign an overall transparency score to potential components using several criteria. The specific algorithm is proprietary  but we can get a pretty good sense of what a company needs to do in order to make the cut.Not surprisingly  the more companies disclose  the better. While that certainly applies to legal documents  such as annual reports  privacy disclosures and diversity practices  it also applies to what the end consumer more directly can see. That includes website descriptions of products  costs  user reviews and other details.Reputation risk is also considered. The number of lawsuits outstanding as well as the nature of those legal claims will negatively impact the final transparency score.In the end  the universe of potential stocks will be narrowed down to 100 names with the highest transparency scores. Those companies  which must have a market cap of at least $1 billion and meet certain liquidity requirements  will be equal weighted.Inside The ARK Transparency ETF PortfolioEven though CTRU isn't expected to launch until Wednesday  we can look at the underlying index to see how the portfolio will look.source: ARKThe fund leans heavily towards large- and mega-cap names  but that's not all that unusual when comparing some of the other major ARK ETFs. This composition is relatively similar to that of both the ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) and the ARK Next Generation Internet ETF (ARKW). There's a little geographic diversity  but this is still a fund that will focus heavily on U.S. names.The sector breakdown is kind of interesting. Even though the transparency screen runs across all segments of the equity markets  it's still heavily tilted towards tech. There is a surprising amount of diversity here  including areas that seem not very ARK-like. You won't find much in the way of consumer staples or real estate exposure outside of this fund.Many of CTRU's top holdings look like what you'd see in an ARK portfolio  but there are also names that don't necessarily look like the others.Tesla (TSLA)  of course  is ARK's most popular holding as are names  such as Nvidia (NVDA)  Cloudflare (NET) and Teradyne (TER)  but you'll probably struggle to find The Buckle (BKE) in any other ARK ETF.ConclusionAs has already been noted by others  ARK is launching a brand new ETF at a time when the popularity rating of Cathie Wood and her company may be at an all-time low. That probably ends up resulting in a pretty tepid start for this fund and I expect it could very well be the smallest in the ETF in the company's lineup for a while (the ARK Israel Innovative Tech ETF (IZRL) is currently the smallest at around $260 million).ARK's last new ETF - the ARK Space Exploration & Innovation ETF (ARKX) - came roaring out of the gate following its launch at the end of March and had nearly $700 million in total assets in less than its first three weeks. That number has shrunk to around $540 million amid a surge in outflows across virtually all of the ARK ETFs.CTRU is going to be playing in a much bigger sandbox since ESG funds are being offered by almost every major ETF issuer nowadays. The ARK name will set this fund apart from the others  but will that end up helping or hurting in the current environment?The 0.55% expense ratio probably won't help against other ultra-cheap ESG funds  but ARK's expense ratios are generally of little consideration for investors.

Serving as LP's inaugural environmental  social  and governance (ESG) report  the document outlines LP's five sustainability pillars—governance  people  environment  products  and community—which represent the foundation of the company's sustainability work and collective commitment to ESG principles.LP Building Solutions (LP)  a leading manufacturer of high-performance building products  released its 2021 Sustainability Report""We are energized and excited to build on LP's 50-year legacy of sustainability."" - Chair and CEO Brad Southern""At LP  we define sustainability as doing the right thing today so that we can build a brighter future for generations to come "" said LP Chair and Chief Executive Officer Brad Southern. ""Our work to support a successful future is inextricably linked to protecting the environment  minimizing waste  manufacturing sustainable products  developing our employees  diversifying our workplace  supporting our communities  and promoting economic prosperity. With a strong track record of sustainability across these areas  LP continues to improve so that we can build a stronger tomorrow.""By Building a Better World™  LP not only cultivates community and sustainability but also helps drive business performance. For example  in 2020  LP achieved $2.8 billion in net sales and $4.31 earnings per share.""We are energized and excited to build on LP's 50-year legacy of sustainability "" Southern continued. ""As this report shows  LP is managing risks and capitalizing on opportunities to establish new leadership standards on ESG matters.""Elevating People and CommunityThe health  safety  and wellness of LP's employees are paramount to sustainable business success. LP's health and safety programs are governed by the LP Environmental Health and Safety Protocol Standard and rely on an advanced form of safety management that measures serious injury and fatality potential to prevent incidents before they occur. LP considers safety so fundamental to its operations that the company uses it as a key metric in evaluating operational excellence.Earlier this year  LP released the LP Diversity  Equity  and Inclusion (DEI) Pledge for Action  which prioritizes gender and racial diversity  equity  and inclusion as critical focus areas for the company. The goal of LP's DEI journey is to cultivate an inclusive work environment that attracts and retains a diverse and high-performing workforce to meet the needs of LP's rapidly diversifying markets and communities.LP has also continued its long-standing history of volunteerism and philanthropy this year. The company strives to build strong relationships in the communities where its employees live and work  with teams volunteering their time and expertise in many ways. In 2021  the LP Foundation donated more than $500 000 through five programs: Disaster Relief  Grants and Sponsorships  Community Mill Grants  Employee Giving Match Program  and Employee Nonprofit Board Sponsorships.Promoting Environmental Stewardship with Responsible Manufacturing and Carbon-Conscious ProductsStory continuesFounded as a commodity forest products company nearly 50 years ago  LP has evolved into a leading specialty building solutions provider that continues to preserve and enhance the environment. LP's commitment to sustainable forestry is highlighted by its third-party forest certification to independent standards from the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI®) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification. All of the fiber that LP sources from the U.S and Canada is certified to SFI standards.To minimize waste  LP uses more than 99% of the fiber harvested for manufacturing in products or as an alternative thermal energy source. Nearly 80% of LP's thermal energy is derived from renewable energy sources.Using globally recognized protocols  LP is working to quantify contributions to greenhouse gas emissions related to product manufacturing  including Scope 1 (direct emissions from owned or controlled sources) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity  steam  heating  and cooling consumed by LP)  as well as contributions across its supply chain  including Scope 3 (all other indirect emissions that occur across the company's value chain). This information will provide the initial baseline used to establish measurable targets for carbon emission reductions moving forward.The Value Reporting Foundation's SASB Standards Board oversees the SASB Standards  an ESG guidance framework for the disclosure of relevant and material sustainability information to investors. LP is aligned with SASB's Building Products and Furnishings standards and Forestry Management standards (the full SASB index is provided in LP's 2021 Sustainability Report). LP is also currently undertaking a climate change risk and opportunity assessment using the framework established by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.In 2021  LP released an environmental product declaration (EPD) for LP® SmartSide® Trim & Siding products. The results helped show that SmartSide products store more carbon than is released in the production and distribution of the product. The EPD  along with a supplemental assessment  demonstrates that SmartSide products are carbon negative.Building a Brighter Future Through SustainabilityFor LP  Building a Better World™ is a journey of continuous improvement that can only be achieved through collaboration with stakeholders. To that end  LP initiated an ESG priority assessment in 2021  engaging a broad group of stakeholders to identify the ESG topics most relevant to the long-term sustainability of its business. This discussion also sought to shed light on the material risks and opportunities for the company. LP is currently establishing goals and developing action plans in relation to these ESG priority topics.LP is proud of the steps it has taken in 2021 to implement a holistic sustainability strategy and looks forward to further building upon its ESG program in the years to come.To read LP's 2021 Sustainability Report  visit lpcorp.com/sustainability.About LP Building SolutionsAs a leader in high-performance building solutions  Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LP Building Solutions  NYSE: LPX) manufactures engineered wood building products that meet the demands of builders  remodelers and homeowners worldwide.

ESG,236,2021-12-07 18:33:02.162808+00:00,ESG,Bing API,https://www.livemint.com/opinion/online-views/businesses-need-strategic-pivots-as-a-great-value-migration-revs-up-11638895860352.html,Businesses need strategic pivots as a great value migration revs up,The value migration is also a reflection of the accelerating divergence in the operating performance of companies  both across sectors and within most of them.Will the great value migration continue?Only time will tell  but one of the leading indicators—where the funding from the institutional private equity and venture capital (PE/VC) investors is channelled—confirms that these funding flows are indeed lopsided in favour of those sectors where value migration gains are higher.Our sector analysis shows that a pivot towards sustainable business strategies could unlock incremental real productivity growth of approximately 1.5 to 3.0 percentage points per year in the next five years.Embracing five elements of the ‘pivot’ outlined above towards sustainable business strategies could enable positive value migration as companies chart their path ahead.,The covid pandemic has battle-tested the resilience of India’s corporates. Top executives reacted swiftly  reorganizing supply chains  speeding up decision-making and adopting remote-working models. As companies emerge from the pandemic  business leaders are now focused on how to pivot their operations and strategies to optimize—and in some cases  re-imagine—their businesses for the ‘next normal’.The call to re-imagine business strategies has come from the great migration of value—happening since 2015 but accelerated by over 10 times since the onset of the pandemic—towards companies and business models that use disruptive technology and customer-centricity in an agile manner to leapfrog their competitors.McKinsey research shows that of all the market capitalization gains witnessed so far since just prior to the onset of the pandemic  in February 2020  a handful of 25 global firms (call them the ‘mega 25’) have captured as much as 40% of all the value migration gains. For example  electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla  one of these ‘mega 25’ companies  now has a market capitalization equivalent to that of the next 10 largest global automotive manufacturers combined.The value migration is also a reflection of the accelerating divergence in the operating performance of companies  both across sectors and within most of them. Even before the pandemic  the top 20% of companies globally by economic profit (defined as net absolute value created by a company after returning cost of capital) have been gradually pulling away from their peers since 2015.Will the great value migration continue? Only time will tell  but one of the leading indicators—where the funding from the institutional private equity and venture capital (PE/VC) investors is channelled—confirms that these funding flows are indeed lopsided in favour of those sectors where value migration gains are higher. These include tech-intensive companies in software and SaaS (software as a service)  pharmaceuticals and biotechnology  financial technology  energy transitions  logistics and consumer products/services that are drawing the lion’s share of such funding. At $165 billion  SaaS alone accounted for 17% of the total capital flows from global PE/VC funding.In a recent McKinsey survey to understand the drivers of productivity that companies will put into action between 2020 and 2025  executives cited automation and technology  business reorganization and agility  and adopting digital channels as the main enablers of productivity gains. Our sector analysis shows that a pivot towards sustainable business strategies could unlock incremental real productivity growth of approximately 1.5 to 3.0 percentage points per year in the next five years.As chief executive officers (CEOs) step back to craft strategies and transform their organizations  there are five elements of the ‘pivot’ that become apparent.First  raise digital customer access and engagement  often using the data thus generated to continue to bring new offerings and commerce to them—i.e.  think ecosystems  omni-channels  direct-to-consumer modes of operation and ownership of customer data. Significant value has migrated to digital ecosystems and many leading Indian companies have already taken steps to build such digital ecosystems. For example  a healthcare company has created India’s largest omnichannel healthcare system—and the fastest growing health-tech platform—with over 6.5 million registered users. It offers customers personalization at an individual level  consistency of customer experience across channels and customer journeys  and an opportunity to develop and promote more personalized products and services.Second  get on the right side of sustainability. There is no hiding place after CoP-26—‘net zero’ is likely coming to every country and its firms—and proactive movers are likely to get rewarded the most. Our global research shows that corporates with higher environmental  social and governance (ESG) performance show superior financial performance as well—up to 10-20% higher valuation multiples and better funding availability. ESG projects  especially focused on decarbonization  circular products and packaging  water/waste management  hydrogen and so forth  are projected to generate $5 trillion in addressable market value by 2025. The value from embracing ESG also extends to retaining and attracting talent  as they experience a sense of purpose at the workplace.Third  embrace the power of the cloud as a real value creator with potential to deliver huge gains across sectors  such as high-tech  oil and gas  retail and healthcare services  insurance and banking. Cloud and digital technologies are now seen as strategic differentiators and value creators across the organization—from research and development to logistics and sales and marketing—and are an intrinsic part of boardroom discussions. Our research estimates that by 2030  Fortune 500 companies alone stand to benefit by more than $1 trillion in improved earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization (EBITDA).Fourth  build speed and agility as a muscle. During the pandemic  many companies were forced to move swiftly to optimize their operations. Now  this speed must be woven into the design of an organization. Companies must anticipate future shifts in demand and get ready to re-imagine their entire commercial and operating models with due agility. There are three aspects to consider while building for speed: Rethink ways of working (for example  by configuring agile squads to speed up decision-making)  redesign non-hierarchical structures (by way of empowered teams that leverage a hybrid work model  for example)  and reshape the talent pool (field tomorrow’s leaders today and foster a culture of learning and development).Finally  companies must envision partnership ecosystems that would enable them to stay asset-light  not owning every piece of the value chain. Many of India’s fastest-growing digital-native companies have woven an extraordinary partner ecosystem to enable an asset-light approach. Larger companies must also rebalance their capital allocation towards growth and the creation of optionality that could promote resilience.India offers a tremendous opportunity for its companies to grow and create value in the coming decade.

We’re going to need new inventions and new technologies that have not yet been even imagined.”“I call upon our entrepreneurs  our innovators  in Israel and across the world: You can be the game changers. You can help save our planet. You see  instead of building yet another hyped-up internet app  why don’t you launch startups that will help solve this global threat?”COP26 focused on the role of governments in reducing emissions  but Bennett hit the nail on the head by suggesting that the solution to our climate crisis relies not just on state actions  but also requires superhuman efforts by startups and the venture capital community. The reward awaiting such risk takers is the “double bottom line” identified by impact investing guru Sir Ronald Cohen: doing well  while doing good.As the IMF notes in its recent Global Financial Stability Report  the transition to net-zero greenhouse emissions will require “unprecedented change by companies and governments  as well as additional investment of as much as $20 trillion over the next two decades… The world’s $50 trillion investment fund industry  especially funds with a sustainability focus  can play an important role financing the transition to a greener economy and helping to avoid some of the most perilous effects of climate change.”In recent years  there has been a significant shift toward environmental  social  and governance (ESG) investing. However  the ESG label does not necessarily mean that those investments are directly contributing to the preservation of the planet  since it also includes such important issues as boardroom gender equality and transparency in governance as well as action on sustainability.AdvertisementAs the IMF report reveals  the proportion of investment funds actually targeted at “sustainable” investment by the end of 2020 totaled “about $3.6 trillion  representing only 7 percent of the overall investment fund sector. Funds with a specific climate focus accounted for a meager $130 billion of that total.”That’s less than three-tenths of one percent of total investment.So despite the shift toward ESG investing  it has not provided sufficient funding for deep-tech startups solving climate problems.Traditionally  most venture funds have been reluctant to make climate technology bets that often require complex hardware which takes years to develop and whose purchasers  in the main  are governments. Many of those who have tried have been burned. There have been periods when venture fell in love with climate-focused companies or water tech  but it rarely worked out.AdvertisementBut one lesson from the Covid crisis may help to settle nerves. For decades  major pharma companies avoided developing vaccines for much the same reasons: long and expensive development  with governments as the main customers. One of the many business lessons from the past two years is that a winning vaccine development can deliver a triple bottom line: doing good business  while doing good for people  and also doing enormous good for a company’s brand as the savior of humanity.It’s time to take “green” investing beyond ESG.It is not enough to invest in companies that are environmentally aware  reducing pollution  working toward zero carbon and have diversity on their boards. Investors must focus their dollars on the technologies necessary to make the climate revolution a reality.This is where Israeli entrepreneurs  the venture funds that empower them  and the individual investors who fund them  have a duty and a responsibility to play an outsized role to develop the technology the planet so urgently requires.“The survival of this country will be dictated by its expertise in technology ” Albert Einstein told the founders of the Haifa Technion nearly 100 years ago. Listening to Einstein that day were the scientific leaders who helped transform this largely barren country into a green and fertile land. A century later  the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology is one of the engines of the Startup Nation ecosystem  which needs to extend its green expertise to the entire planet.,positive,0.96,0.02,0.02,mixed,0.28,0.13,0.59,True,English,"['ESG', 'planet', 'recent Global Financial Stability Report', 'Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett', 'overall investment fund sector', '$50 trillion investment fund industry', 'UN Climate Change Conference', 'up internet app', 'double bottom line', 'Sir Ronald Cohen', 'boardroom gender equality', 'triple bottom line', 'insignificant carbon footprint', 'many business lessons', 'winning vaccine development', 'venture capital community', 'net-zero greenhouse emissions', 'next two decades', 'past two years', 'specific climate focus', 'major pharma companies', 'Startup Nation ecosystem', 'climate technology bets', 'most venture funds', 'recent years', 'heavy industry', 'global emissions', 'global threat', 'IMF report', 'Israeli entrepreneurs', 'additional investment', 'sustainable” investment', 'carbon emissions', 'expensive development', 'good business', 'zero carbon', 'investment funds', 'climate crisis', 'Behavioral change', 'unprecedented change', 'climate problems', 'climate revolution', 'small nation', 'total investment', 'mighty’ contribution', 'minimal ability', 'mighty” contribution', 'entrepreneurial smarts', 'most startups', 'new inventions', 'game changers', 'state actions', 'risk takers', 'sustainability focus', 'greener economy', 'perilous effects', 'important issues', 'sufficient funding', 'complex hardware', 'water tech', 'one lesson', 'Covid crisis', 'same reasons', 'enormous good', 'Haifa Technion', 'scientific leaders', 'fertile land', 'Technion-Israel Institute', 'climate-focused companies', 'important role', 'outsized role', 'new technologies', 'superhuman efforts', 'investing guru', 'significant shift', 'ESG label', 'one percent', 'deep-tech startups', 'main customers', 'individual investors', 'Albert Einstein', 'barren country', 'ESG investing', 'green expertise', '7 percent', 'siren', 'COP26', 'Glasgow', 'order', 'alarms', 'world', 'population', 'innovators', 'planet', 'hyped', 'governments', 'nail', 'head', 'solution', 'impact', 'transition', 'governance', 'investments', 'preservation', 'transparency', 'Advertisement', 'proportion', 'three-tenths', 'purchasers', 'periods', 'love', 'nerves', 'vaccines', 'long', 'people', 'company', 'brand', 'savior', 'humanity', 'time', 'pollution', 'diversity', 'boards', 'dollars', 'reality', 'duty', 'responsibility', 'survival', 'founders', 'engines']",2021-12-07,2021-12-07,blogs.timesofisrael.com

Learn more about becoming a client.The news: Forty-seven percent of financial services executives said their budgets for open banking technology increased in 2021  per a survey by the open banking platform provider Tink. The survey was based on 308 financial services decision-makers in 12 European countries.Insider IntelligenceBy the numbers:Tech budgets took a hit early in the pandemic: COVID-19 affected budgets for 93% of respondents  with 25% calling the impact ""significant.""Early in 2020  execs pegged their budgets for open banking at €50 million ($56 million) to €100 million ($113 million)—but their actual spending averaged well below estimates  at €32 million ($36 million).Some spent more  though: Retail banks spent €84 million ($95 million) on average  and wealth management firms averaged €79 million ($89 million). To comply with open banking legislation  they had to overhaul their legacy tech infrastructure with APIs capable of sharing necessary data.But open banking budgets rebounded in 2021: Wealth management firms' budgets showed the strongest increase  at 58%  followed by wholesale banks at 55%  credit providers at 51%  and digital-native challenger banks at 50%.Where did the money go? Seventy-two percent of financial institutions said payment initiation services were their first priority and streamlined their payments processes as innovations heated up the financial services sector.After that  71% of executives equally weighted account verification  identity verification  and asset verification—reflecting the need to easily handle data involved in customer onboarding and the digital customer experience.Risk and creditworthiness assessments critical to risk management were also important for 71% of executives.Carbon footprint accounting was lower on the list but remained important for 62% of executives. Among commercial banks  it was the fourth-highest priority.Open banking-related spending in 2022: As open banking moves toward mainstream adoption  fintechs and banks must continue to plan and budget for data-driven initiatives.ESG data spending is on the rise and is expected to grow 20% annually  reaching $1 billion in 2021. Concerns over greenwashing will require due diligence in identifying ESG data providers who follow transparent methodologies.Streamlined consent management—necessary for collecting or sharing various types of personal information between financial institutions—is still evolving. Laws are under review in the UK and being drafted in the US and Canada. Systems will need to adapt to maintain user-friendly processes.Balancing data privacy and data security has become increasingly challenging for open banking—particularly in light of consumers' uneasiness about sharing data. Identifying digital customers is more complex  with more personal information moving across online channels. Technologies such as tokenization or biometric identifiers offer promise for authentication solutions.Staying competitive  agile  and responsive is even more critical as open banking breaks down barriers and lets new players—many digitally native—enter the market. Financial institutions must continue to enhance their core infrastructure  or if they have smaller budgets for in-house tech development  consider partnering with fintechs.Want to read more stories like this one?

Ask These Questions When You Make Financial Plans for 2022,If you want to retire earlier  don't forget to dig deep and ask yourself the following questions.Start by walking backward from your ideal retirement age  and from there  determine how much you need to save.And growth stocks tend to be among the ones that show the largest gains.One misconception of growth stocks is that they have a high correlation with the market.However  when the market is moving lower  these stocks sometimes perform better.So why should you consider buying growth stocks now?,"Have you put a plan in place to figure out exactly what you need to do to retire with a certain amount of money in the bank — by a certain age?A total of 49.9% of Americans expect to retire before they turn 62  according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.We can point to a booming stock market  soaring house prices and even the results of the pandemic to inspire Americans to change their retirement timeline.Millions of Baby Boomers (28.6 million) said they left the workforce in the third quarter of 2020. This added up to 3.2 million more compared to those who said they were retired during the same period in 2019  according to a Pew Research report.If you want to retire earlier  don't forget to dig deep and ask yourself the following questions.Question 1: What are my retirement goals?What are your goals for retirement? What's the magic number at the end of your career that you should aim to save?Americans believe they need $1.7 million to retire  according to a survey from Charles Schwab  which examined results from 1 000 participants in 401(k) plans nationwide.The amount you need depends on how much you currently earn and can live off of comfortably in retirement.The rule of thumb used to be saving 80% of your current income — you can theoretically save less than your current income because it's assumed that you'll have fewer expenses in retirement.Need an exact formula? The retirement savings formula looks like this: Subtract your estimated Social Security benefits from your current income and divide by 0.04 to get your number.Question 2: Have I been saving enough to reach those goals?How much are you currently saving to get to your target number? Just over half of households with workers aged 55 to 64 have retirement accounts. The median value of the accounts oges up to $134 000  according to a report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.The old rule of thumb was to save 15% of your pre-tax income each year  including your employer match. However  based on your target retirement goals  it's a good idea to figure out whether 15% will be enough to maintain your current lifestyle in retirement  particularly if you got a late start on saving.Question 3: How old do I want to be when I retire?It can't get any more basic than that. Funny enough  many people don't consider that they should work backward in order to figure out their retirement strategy — many have a hazy idea that they want to retire ""sometime in their 60s."" However  identifying a target date means you can pin down much you need to save per month.Of course  deciding on your retirement date comes down to a lot of unknowns — whether you'll feel ""ready"" to retire by a certain age  whether you're in good health or not  the status of your kids and other family members (think aging parents or a daughter who has triplets and desperately needs help) and more. Obviously  you can't know any of that when you're 30 and actively saving for retirement. However  you can start to speculate on your target age now and assess whether early retirement sounds like something you'd want to do.Question 4: Do I have the right asset allocation to meet my goals?Your asset allocation means dividing your investment portfolio among different asset categories  like stocks  bonds and cash. Where you decide to put your money among these types of assets will look different for everyone and will depend in large part on your time horizon and risk tolerance.One guideline suggests that you make your stock allocation equal to 120 minus your age. For example  a 39-year-old individual's portfolio would contain 81% stocks. A 50-year-old's portfolio would contain 70% stocks.As a side note  the recommended allocation has long been 60% stocks and 40% bonds in retirement  but some financial professionals suggest holding 75% in stocks and 25% in bonds due to today's low bond yields.Question 5: Am I monitoring my portfolio like I should?With the goal of retiring earlier  you'll need to keep tabs on your portfolio. That might mean regularly meeting with your financial professional to check out your asset allocation or checking out your robo-advisor to make sure it's still helping you achieve your goals. Regular checkups also give you a chance to rebalance  or realign the weightings in your portfolio.Ultimately  you want to make sure that you still have the right investment portfolio for every goal you've set for yourself.Question 6: Have I taken advantage of the right types of investments?What do you like to dabble in? Stocks? Cryptocurrencies? Real estate? Nonfungible tokens? Whatever it is  have you been investing in the right types of investments for your needs?If you love investigating Bitcoin or Ethereum  does it make sense to invest every penny you own into crypto? (Maybe not — cryptocurrencies carry a lot of risk.) Are you addicted to acquiring real estate? ESG investments might make sense for you if you're passionate about investing in sustainable companies.Anyway  the point is  have you chosen investments that fit you? Just like a pet dog or cat  you're more apt to keep track of them and treat them with TLC when you love them.Can You Retire Earlier? Find Out!If you can say  ""I have no idea if I can retire early "" it may be time to consider when you can or want to retire. Does 60 sound like the magic age? 50? 40  even?Now that we're walking into a new year  you might want to consider putting a plan together right now. Start by walking backward from your ideal retirement age  and from there  determine how much you need to save. It can give you a lot of peace of mind and also make it more likely that you'll achieve your goals of retiring earlier.At times of volatility  it can be hard for even experienced investors to stay the course. Yet over time  stocks have consistently increased in value. And growth stocks tend to be among the ones that show the largest gains. Growth stocks are companies that analysts believe will grow at a rate that is significantly above the market average.These stocks are also characterized by companies that invest a significant portion of its profits back into its business in order to accelerate growth. This is opposed to value stocks that make returning a portion of its profits to shareholders a priority. This typically occurs in the form of a dividend. One misconception of growth stocks is that they have a high correlation with the market. It’s true that when the market is moving higher  these stocks tend to outperform. However  when the market is moving lower  these stocks sometimes perform better.So why should you consider buying growth stocks now? The reason is this. In many cases  the company’s underlying fundamentals are still positive  but the sentiment has changed. And that means it’s a good time to buy these stocks on sale.",neutral,0.1,0.88,0.02,mixed,0.75,0.14,0.11,True,English,"['Financial Plans', 'Questions', '2022', 'soaring house prices', 'Social Security benefits', 'other family members', 'low bond yields', 'booming stock market', 'different asset categories', 'Federal Reserve Bank', 'Pew Research report', 'retirement savings formula', 'right asset allocation', 'right investment portfolio', 'target retirement goals', 'exact formula', 'stock allocation', 'target date', 'right types', 'New York', 'Baby Boomers', 'third quarter', 'same period', 'following questions', 'Charles Schwab', '401(k) plans', 'current income', 'fewer expenses', 'median value', 'Policy Priorities', 'pre-tax income', 'employer match', 'good idea', 'current lifestyle', 'late start', 'many people', 'hazy idea', 'good health', 'aging parents', 'large part', 'time horizon', 'One guideline', '39-year-old individual', 'side note', 'financial professionals', 'Regular checkups', 'Real estate', 'Nonfungible tokens', 'sustainable companies', 'target number', 'retirement timeline', 'retirement strategy', 'retirement date', 'early retirement', 'magic number', 'old rule', 'target age', 'risk tolerance', 'ESG investments', 'retirement accounts', 'place', 'amount', 'money', 'total', 'Americans', 'results', 'pandemic', 'Millions', 'workforce', 'end', 'career', 'survey', '1,000 participants', 'thumb', 'half', 'households', 'workers', 'Center', 'Budget', 'order', '60s', 'month', 'lot', 'unknowns', 'status', 'kids', 'daughter', 'triplets', 'help', 'something', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'cash', 'assets', 'everyone', 'example', 'today', 'tabs', 'robo-advisor', 'chance', 'weightings', 'advantage', 'Cryptocurrencies', 'needs', 'Bitcoin', 'Ethereum', 'sense', 'penny', 'point', 'pet']",2021-12-06,2021-12-07,marketbeat.com

Here’s what to keep in mind as you measure and invest.facebooktwitterlinkedinemailprint open share links close share linksAs the financial community enthusiastically embraces environmental  social  and governance investing  there are two things it should know:ESG ratings are measured differently across agencies  and can therefore be an inconsistent measure of performance.Some experts are increasingly skeptical that ESG scores have any direct correlation to more sustainable business.Work smart with our Thinking Forward newsletter Insights from MIT experts  delivered every Tuesday morning. Email Address Leave this field blankIn a recent Q&A  Lenora Suki  product manager for sustainable finance solutions at Bloomberg LP  summed up the situation: “Right now  information about sustainability is often nonfinancial and so diffuse and diverse that it’s difficult for decision-makers to digest and synthesize into strategic and operational decisions.”This isn’t to suggest that it’s time to write off ESG. All signs point to consumers wanting to purchase products from companies that align with their values  whether that involves protecting the environment  empowering women  or addressing societal inequities.And investors are ever more enthusiastic about ESG investing.According to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance  global sustainable investment reached $35.3 trillion at the start of 2020  a 15% increase over the past two years. In addition  the same report found that sustainable investment assets under management comprised more than a third (35.9%) of total assets under management in 2020  up from 33.4% in 2018.A majority of business leaders are fully onboard with sustainability measures  while also aware their efforts may not have significant impact. In 2016  a United Nations/Accenture joint survey found that more than three-quarters (78%) of CEO respondents believed corporate efforts would contribute to Global Goals  adopted by the United Nations as a universal call to action to end poverty and protect the planet.2 1 % ShareOnly a fifth of CEOs responding to a 2019 United Nations/Accenture survey felt businesses are actually making a difference in the worldwide sustainability agenda.In the most recent survey (2019)  only a fifth of responding CEOs felt that businesses are actually making a difference in the worldwide sustainability agenda. Nevertheless  almost half (48%) remain committed to implementing sustainability as part of their overall operations.The disconnect between accelerating ESG activity and confidence in the results should serve as a wake-up call for companies and investors alike  according to Kenneth Pucker  SM ’90  the former COO at Timberland.Challenges include discrepancies in ESG measurements  ongoing data quality problems  and the pervasive greenwashing that can happen as companies try to spin their data in a positive light  said Pucker  who in June published “Overselling Sustainability Reporting” in Harvard Business Review.“ESG ratings firms take self-reported data from companies on their corporate social responsibility [CSR] activities  add their own information and weightings  and mix it in a caldron to come out with a rating for a company ” said Pucker  now a senior lecturer at the Fletcher School at Tufts University.“A problem is garbage in  garbage out "" Pucker said. ""The reporting is not complete  results are mostly unaudited  and they are not comparable  so ESG ratings often use bad data that’s unaudited  extrapolated  and interpolated.”Why ESG ratings diverge — and what to do about itThe MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative has taken up the cause with the launch of the Aggregate Confusion Project  aimed at improving the quality of ESG measurements.ESG ratings are used by individual investors and fund managers to guide investment strategies by understanding potential sustainability risks to business performance. Companies also leverage ESG ratings as an internal benchmarking tool to help improve sustainability performance and for potential public relations opportunities.The problem  as defined by the MIT project  is that ESG data is noisy. That leads to a divergence in ratings from the independent agencies that evaluate and assign ESG ratings to firms  according to Florian Berg  a research fellow working on the challenge. In turn  that leads to confusion and a much lower probability that ESG ratings have a direct correlation to financial performance  undermining their utility as an investment tool  Berg said.Berg  along with research affiliate Julian Koelbel and MIT Sloan professor Roberto Rigobon  has published three papers on ESG ratings divergence and its impact. Using a common taxonomy and various mathematical modeling techniques  the MIT team was able to fit the different rating agency approaches into a consistent framework to better understand the ratings differences.In the initial paper  the researchers identified the following takeaways:There’s ambiguity around ESG ratings. The research found the correlation among six prominent ratings agencies (KLD/MSCI Stats  Sustainalytics  Vigeo Eiris/Moody’s  RobecoSAM/S&P Global  Asset4/Refinitiv  and MSCI) was on average 0.61. In comparison  mainstream credit ratings from Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s are correlated at 0.99.The finding suggests that ESG ratings do not properly reflect ESG performance  making it difficult for decision-makers to identify outperformers and laggards.Divergence in ratings also hampers the motivation of companies to improve their ESG performance  the paper states  because there are mixed signals from ratings agencies about what to focus on and what is valued in the industry.There are three factors driving ratings divergence. Scope divergence occurs when ratings are based on different attributes — for example  one rating service includes carbon emissions or labor practices while another does not — which leads to ratings inconsistencies. Measurement divergence happens when agencies measure the same attributes  but do so using different raw data  which results in different assessments. The last factor relates to weights divergence  which emerges when ESG ratings agencies take different views on the relative importance of attributes.They also identify something they call the “rater effect ” namely  a firm receiving a high score in one category is more likely to receive high scores in other categories  particularly from that same rater.As part of their ongoing research  the team is trying to understand the effects of ESG-driven investment flows on stock price and company behavior. They are also developing smarter ways to aggregate ESG factors into composite indices for use by portfolio managers and passively managed funds.ESG ratings and stock performanceRelying on the scores of several complementary [ESG] ratings yields better results. Florian Berg Research Fellow  MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative ShareA subsequent paper depicts in detail a noise-correction procedure designed to tackle the bias caused by noisy ESG data and ratings divergence. Using a variety of modeling techniques  the research team was able to demonstrate ESG ratings actually have a much higher impact on stock returns than previously anticipated.Without the correction procedure  standard regression estimates of ESG ratings’ impact on stock returns were biased downward by about 60%  Berg said.“We found the link between financial performance and ESG performance to be stronger because it’s not overshadowed  hidden by noise ” Berg explained.The practical takeaway from the research: “Relying on the scores of several complementary ratings yields better results ” Berg said.Addressing ESG shortcomingsNext steps for the Aggregate Confusion project are to work with industry partners to gather data  solicit feedback  and create a set of best practices for use by ESG ratings providers as well as the companies reporting CSR data for disclosure purposes.Improving the measurement of raw data and formalizing best practices is all well and good  but Pucker is convinced it will take global standards and formal audits to demonstrably bolster the utility of ESG ratings.Pucker explained the environmental impacts of sustainability reporting and ESG investing have been oversold  hampered by lack of oversight into what goes into sustainability reports as well as huge gaps in data tracked to generate a complete picture of carbon footprint.As an example  Pucker cited Scope 3 emissions  which comprise all the upstream and downstream emissions generated by suppliers and customers. Figures from CDP  a global aggregator of corporate carbon emissions data  show that only about half of companies disclosing CSR data report on Scope 3 emissions even though that constitutes the bulk of their greenhouse gas impact.More pointedly  Pucker contends the problem is bigger than noisy data or ratings discrepancies.At its core  ESG investing may deliver better financial returns for investors  but it’s not designed to deliver the intended impact for solving environmental problems.“Asset managers have incentives to drive equity returns  not solve water problems in Egypt or deforestation in Malaysia ” Pucker said. “It’s not what they are paid to do.”Pucker believes impact investing is better positioned to make more of a material difference. Estimated by the Global Impact Investing Network to be a $715 billion market  impact investing targets companies or institutions that have specific intentions to build products and services that generate social or environmental impact — for example  one that is actually developing technology that solves water problems.This type of investment in companies pursuing climate tech to solve transportation  agricultural  energy  and land use challenges is more likely to deliver change  Pucker said.More work to be doneRegardless of that debate  Pucker said the industry has a lot of work to do to get better at CSR reporting and make ESG ratings a more effective tool.Making reporting mandatory  creating comprehensive standards on what to report  increasing transparency in what is reported  and enacting some form of industry or regulatory governance is one piece of the equation. Efforts like the Aggregate Confusion Project for improving data quality and ESG measurements is another critical step.“All those things will help the correlation of ratings converge among different raters  but to me  that’s not a leveraged solution for impact ” Pucker said. “Ultimately  addressing environmental and social externalities needs effective regulatory policy.”Read next: 4 Strategies for Sustainable Business",positive,0.5,0.41,0.09,mixed,0.22,0.1,0.68,True,English,"['MIT Sloan News', 'sustainable business', 'ESG ratings', 'MIT Sloan professor Roberto Rigobon', 'The MIT Sloan Sustainability Initiative', 'Thinking Forward newsletter Insights', 'various mathematical modeling techniques', 'potential public relations opportunities', 'research affiliate Julian Koelbel', 'different rating agency approaches', 'United Nations/Accenture joint survey', 'Global Sustainable Investment Alliance', 'ongoing data quality problems', '2019 United Nations/Accenture survey', 'potential sustainability risks', 'sustainable finance solutions', 'worldwide sustainability agenda', 'past two years', 'internal benchmarking tool', 'open share links', 'close share links', 'sustainable investment assets', 'Harvard Business Review', 'recent Q&A', 'Overselling Sustainability Reporting', 'Aggregate Confusion Project', 'ESG ratings divergence', 'ESG ratings firms', 'MIT project', 'recent survey', 'investment tool', 'sustainable business', 'MIT team', 'Global Goals', 'research fellow', 'investment strategies', 'MIT experts', 'sustainability measures', 'two things', 'a third', 'total assets', 'sustainability performance', 'business leaders', 'ratings differences', 'ESG scores', 'ESG investing', 'ESG activity', 'ESG measurements', 'ESG data', 'governance data', 'financial community', 'governance investing', 'inconsistent measure', 'direct correlation', 'Lenora Suki', 'product manager', 'Bloomberg LP', 'operational decisions', 'societal inequities', 'same report', 'CEO respondents', 'universal call', 'overall operations', 'wake-up call', 'former COO', 'pervasive greenwashing', 'positive light', 'CSR] activities', 'senior lecturer', 'Fletcher School', 'Tufts University', 'bad data', 'fund managers', 'business performance', 'lower probability', 'three papers', 'common taxonomy', 'consistent framework', 'initial paper', 'following takeaways', 'financial performance', 'Email Address', 'significant impact', 'corporate efforts', 'independent agencies', 'individual investors', 'Florian Berg', 'Kenneth Pucker', '2 1 % Share', 'planet', 'mind', 'facebook', 'twitter', 'field', 'situation', 'information', 'decision-makers', 'strategic', 'time', 'signs', 'consumers', 'products', 'companies', 'values', 'environment', 'women', 'start', '15% increase', 'addition', 'management', 'majority', 'three-quarters', 'action', 'poverty', 'CEOs', 'businesses', 'part', 'disconnect', 'confidence', 'results', 'SM', 'Timberland', 'Challenges', 'discrepancies', 'June', 'self-reported', 'weightings', 'caldron', 'company', 'garbage', 'cause', 'launch', 'turn', 'utility', 'researchers']",2021-12-06,2021-12-07,mitsloan.mit.edu

Fortunately  the rapid rollout of COVID-19 vaccines shows what can be accomplished when traditional organizational and sectoral silos are ignored in the interest of a common cause.NEW YORK – The word of the week  unfortunately  is Omicron. With yet another new COVID-19 variant dominating the headlines  the global spotlight on climate issues following last month’s COP26 conference is quickly fading. Humanity  after all  tends to focus on the most immediate threat.Still  our response to the pandemic could offer a roadmap for confronting climate change. Both crises involve a classic tragedy of the commons  which occurs when individuals disregard the well-being of society in the interest of personal gain. Yet the global reaction to COVID-19 demonstrated that some unlikely parties could come together  at risk to their individual interests  to accelerate the development  testing  and distribution (at least in the rich world) of successful vaccines. The climate crisis demands a similar approach. Deploying capital to mitigate global warming will require an alignment of unusual bedfellows in finance  technology  social-justice activism  and beyond.Capital  along with government and religion  has been one of the three great levers of change in history. It has the power to alter the trajectory of entire civilizations. For many decades  capital flows have followed a simple rule defined by the Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman: all that matters is shareholder returns. But the continuing viability of this maxim has been called into question by unprecedented wildfires  more frequent and severe flooding  increasingly visible social inequities  and other worrying problems.There is now growing support for the idea that capital should be used for more than just financial returns  as demonstrated by the explosion of interest in ESG (environmental  social  and governance) standards for corporations.It is good news that investors are starting to demand greater transparency into how companies manage their ESG dynamics  and that executives and boards of directors are beginning to track relevant data to report to their investors. You can’t change what you don’t measure.But the ESG movement has largely focused on publicly traded companies. That is understandable  because such companies are where individual shareholders can influence behavior  as the hedge fund Engine No. 1 recently demonstrated with its successful campaign to install decarbonization advocates on the board of ExxonMobil. The problem is that there are fewer than 50 000 publicly listed companies in the world today  compared to more than 200 million privately held companies. If the lever of capital is going to be used effectively  it must include private companies.Subscribe to Project Syndicate Subscribe to Project Syndicate Our newest magazine  The Year Ahead 2022: Reckonings  is here.

Subscribe NowNot only do privately held companies represent the vast majority of employment and much of the world’s GDP  but they are also who public companies rely on for key inputs. Most of the recent net-zero commitments made by Fortune 500 corporations will have little meaning until there is greater clarity about what is happening in their supply chains.As matters stand  there is very little information about privately held companies’ ESG metrics. And much of the data that do exist is of poor quality  calculated by third parties using algorithms that do little more than guess at conclusions. What has been missing is a consortium model in which unusual bedfellows come together to solve a problem that cannot be addressed by any one group.Fortunately  there have been promising recent efforts to address this problem. For example  the ESG Data Convergence Project  a group of private-equity managers and limited partner investors  led by the Carlyle Group and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System  is working to standardize a set of ESG reporting metrics for private-equity managers. Similarly  the Institutional Limited Partners Association has put together an ESG Roadmap to identify best practices for private market investors who are interested in advancing ESG efforts at their organizations.Finally  at Novata  we have organized a highly unusual consortium of players representing interests that have likely never before come together. Its members include the Ford Foundation  the Omidyar Network  S&P Global  Hamilton Lane  and a wide range of private-equity firms and pension-fund investors in the US and Europe. It represents some of the world’s leading foundations committed to social justice and inclusive capitalism  major players in financial data and analysis  the largest intermediary in the private markets  a diverse group of private-equity firms with longstanding commitments to ESG standards  and a set of leading pension funds that invest in the private-equity asset class. As a public-benefit corporation  Novata will provide an ESG “on-ramp” for privately held companies from around the world to track  store  and report on relevant data.This emerging ecosystem of partnerships in the private markets represents a new approach to collecting accurate ESG data  which is essential to using capital to tackle some of our greatest challenges. And  importantly  these efforts aim to complement rather than compete with each other to accelerate change in the private markets.In less than two years  we have seen biotech startups  pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  governments  foundations  and think tanks come together to develop and roll out COVID-19 tests  vaccines  and other cutting-edge treatments. This stunning achievement came from cutting across traditional organizational and sectoral silos and reminds us that  when faced with an imminent threat  disparate interests can come together to chart a new course.The path is lit.

The results show that China Eastern Airlines Corporation Limited (""China Eastern Airlines"") has an MSCI ESG rating of A.China Eastern Airlines ESG Rating ChangesChina Eastern Airlines Carbon-neutral FlightsReviewing the MSCI ESG rating changes of China Eastern Airlines in the past few years  its rating has made significant progress from BB in 2018 to BBB in 2019  and then to A in early 2020. The rating results signify that China Eastern Airlines has maintained its rating at A for two consecutive years after upgrading to A in early 2020  surpassing 64% of airlines worldwide.As social responsibility has become a global consensus for corporate development in recent years  non-financial factors such as a company's ability to govern and its impact on the environment and society have also received increasing attention from society and investors. ESG (Environmental  Social and Governance) is gradually taking shape in the mainstream development of the capital market with the promotion of organizations led by the UN PRI (Principles for Responsible Investment).MSCI's latest ESG rating report for China Eastern Airlines indicates that it ranks above the industry average in substantive issues such as carbon emissions  product safety and quality  and corporate governance  boasting best practices among global airlines.China Eastern Airlines has been adhering to high-quality and high-level information disclosure and active communication with stakeholders and has published CSR reports for 13 consecutive years since 2009. Meanwhile  China Eastern Airlines has strengthened the collaboration of multiple parties  made efforts to improve the operational efficiency of its aircraft groups  and explored new technological changes such as sustainable fuels and aircraft. From October 12  2021  China Eastern Airlines operates the first carbon-neutral flights in China  eliminating millions of miles of carbon footprint in the air throughout the entire jet fuel life cycle from the oilfield to the sky. From December 1  2021  China Eastern Airlines will also become the first airline in China to ""fully digitize electronic invoices"". According to EBA's calculation  1 million pieces of paper invoices consume 400 trees  and China Eastern Airlines will realize the electronic system to reduce the use of paper by nearly 10 million pieces each year  which is equivalent to reducing the consumption of nearly 4 000 trees each year.Story continuesIn the future  China Eastern Airlines will further integrate ESG concepts and measures into its daily operations  continuously improve its performance in all aspects of ESG  and explore a stronger development model with higher quality and sustainability to bring higher value to the development of society.Image Attachments Links:Link: http://asianetnews.net/view-attachment?attach-id=409927Caption: China Eastern Airlines ESG Rating ChangesLink: http://asianetnews.net/view-attachment?attach-id=409931Caption: China Eastern Airlines Carbon-neutral FlightsCisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/china-eastern-airlines-maintains-the-msci-esg-rating-at-a-for-two-consecutive-years-tying-for-no-1-in-the-world-301438686.htmlSOURCE China Eastern Airlines",neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,neutral,0.06,0.92,0.02,True,English,"['China Eastern Airlines', 'MSCI ESG Rating', 'Two Consecutive Years', 'No.', 'World', 'China Eastern Airlines ESG Rating Changes\n\nLink', 'entire jet fuel life cycle', 'China Eastern Airlines Corporation Limited', 'China Eastern Airlines Carbon-neutral Flights', 'latest ESG rating report', 'SOURCE China Eastern Airlines', 'Morgan Stanley Capital International', 'MSCI ESG rating changes', 'first carbon-neutral flights', 'new technological changes', 'high-level information disclosure', 'Image Attachments Links', 'international index company', 'stronger development model', 'two consecutive years', 'global airlines', 'ESG concepts', 'rating results', 'capital market', '13 consecutive years', 'first airline', 'airline industry', 'significant progress', 'global consensus', 'corporate development', 'recent years', 'increasing attention', 'mainstream development', 'UN PRI', 'Responsible Investment', 'industry average', 'substantive issues', 'carbon emissions', 'product safety', 'best practices', 'active communication', 'CSR reports', 'multiple parties', 'operational efficiency', 'sustainable fuels', 'carbon footprint', 'electronic invoices', '1 million pieces', 'electronic system', '10 million pieces', 'daily operations', 'higher value', 'original content', 'social responsibility', 'corporate governance', 'aircraft groups', 'paper invoices', 'higher quality', 'SHANGHAI', 'Dec.', 'PRNewswire', 'November', 'A.', 'past', 'BB', 'early', 'ability', 'impact', 'environment', 'society', 'investors', 'shape', 'promotion', 'organizations', 'Principles', 'high-quality', 'stakeholders', 'collaboration', 'efforts', 'October', 'millions', 'miles', 'oilfield', 'sky', 'December', 'EBA', 'calculation', '400 trees', 'use', 'consumption', '4,000 trees', 'Story', 'future', 'measures', 'performance', 'aspects', 'asianetnews', 'Caption', 'Cision', 'multimedia', 'news-releases', 'consecutive-years', 'world']",2021-12-07,2021-12-07,finance.yahoo.com

This is Bank of America's Ninth ESG-themed Bond  Raising Nearly $12 Billion in Aggregate for Investments for Environmental and Social Sustainability  Helping to Advance the United Nations Sustainable Development GoalsCHARLOTTE  N.C.  Dec. 7  2021 /PRNewswire/ -- Bank of America announced today the issuance of its second Equality Progress Sustainability Bond for $2 billion. The use of proceeds from the bond offering is designed to advance racial and gender equality  economic opportunity and environmental sustainability. This transaction marks the first offering following the publication of Bank of America's ESG-themed Issuance Framework last month. The Framework aligns to Bank of America's Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG) leadership and the company's sustainable finance strategy  which aims to mobilize and scale capital deployment to help advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.(PRNewsfoto/Bank of America Corporation)The ""Equality Progress"" label is outlined in the Framework. This label indicates an objective to advance equality and economic opportunity for historically marginalized populations by focusing on financing and investments that provide people of color or women with expanded access to essential services  such as affordable housing  and business capital.Bank of America will allocate at least 50% of an amount equal to the net proceeds from the sale of the bond to one or more eligible Equality Progress Social Assets  with the remainder allocated to eligible Green Assets (together ""eligible assets"").This issuance expands upon Bank of America's first Equality Progress Sustainability Bond issued in 2020 by broadening the scope of the target populations for eligible Equality Progress Social Assets to include women and Asian American  Pacific Islander and Indigenous people  along with Black and Hispanic-Latino populations. In addition  the eligible Green Asset categories have been expanded to include sustainable water and wastewater management  green buildings and carbon capture.Story continues""This bond offering demonstrates our continued commitment to sustainable development and delivers shared value between us and our stakeholders. It provides an opportunity for fixed income investors to be part of the environmental and social change that we stand for by providing access to financing and investment  and socioeconomic empowerment  for underserved populations  as well as continuing to invest in the environmental transition towards a low-carbon economy "" said Anne Finucane  Vice Chair at Bank of America.""ESG-themed securities are scaling finance to critically-needed services  such as healthcare and affordable housing  and environmentally-focused projects across communities. This bond issuance will promote financing for  and investments in  underserved communities and minority- and women-led businesses  and will help drive the adoption of more low-carbon solutions"" said Tom Montag  Chief Operating Officer at Bank of America. ""This transaction is unique because Bank of America will allocate the bond proceeds only to eligible assets that are funded after the issue date of the bond  which is different from many similar transactions in the market.""The four-year bond  which is callable in three years  will pay interest semi-annually at a fixed rate of 1.53% for the first three years  and quarterly at a floating rate thereafter. BofA Securities was the sole bookrunner on the deal and six minority- or women-owned broker dealers served as joint-lead managers – Cabrera  CastleOak  C.L. King  Loop Capital  R. Seelaus & Co and Siebert Williams Shank.Within one year of the issuance of today's Equality Progress Sustainability Bond  Bank of America will publish a report related to the use of proceeds of the bond on the company's ESG-Themed Issuance webpage  located on the Bank of America Investor Relations website. The information in the report regarding allocation to eligible assets will be updated at least annually as long as the bond remains outstanding.Since 2013  Bank of America has issued $11.85 billion across nine Green  Social and Sustainability Bonds – five ""Green"" Bonds  two ""Social"" Bonds  and two ""Sustainability"" Bonds  including today's issuance – which focused on areas such as clean energy  energy efficiency  affordable housing and community development  and addressing the global coronavirus pandemic. Additionally  Bank of America co-authored the original Green Bond Principles  a voluntary set of guidelines and standards meant to bring integrity to this market where proceeds help to directly finance environmental projects. Bank of America has also been a member of the executive committee of the industry group that provides guidance on ESG-themed bond issuances since its inception.These efforts underscore Bank of America's long-standing leadership in ESG and demonstrate the company's commitment to advancing environmental transition and social inclusive development as part of its sustainable finance goal of deploying $1.5 trillion in capital by 2030 . In addition  BofA Securities has helped clients across all sectors support their sustainable business needs by raising in excess of $400 billion in principal amount through more than 550 ESG-themed bond offerings  including Green  Social and Sustainability Bonds.To learn more about Bank of America's ESG-themed issuances or to view past financed projects  please visit Bank of America's Investor Relations website.

The rest is in bonds  real estate and renewable energy infrastructure. The 55-year-old former hedge-fund boss has been looking after Norwegians’ collective savings since late 2020. And he’s promised Norway’s government he’ll turn the fund  which was built from the country’s fossil-fuel riches  into a global leader in responsible investing.It’s a strategy that’s ultimately intended to make money  based on a view that ESG duds will become uninvestable. The next step for the fund is to speed up the pace of divestments based on ESG risks  according to its chief corporate governance officer  Carine Smith Ihenacho. Companies are dumped if the fund decides engagement isn’t worth the effort  a tactic that’s mostly applied to smaller stocks.Pressure CampaignFor bigger companies with low ESG scores  the investor says it’s about to apply a lot more pressure. Companies are sent so-called expectation documents which encompass everything from water use  to biodiversity to children’s rights. Firms that don’t score well against those requirements can expect to be grilled by the fund  with a view to a change of strategy. If that doesn’t work  an aggressive cycle of shareholder voting awaits.Story continues“It’s based on the belief we have that in the longer run  if companies don’t manage their ESG challenges well  they’re not going to be profitable ” Ihenacho said. If they don’t improve  then the fund can “start to vote against  for example  a director who’s responsible for climate  or a board committee chair  or the chair of the board ” she said.This year  Norway’s wealth fund didn’t back Exxon Corp. CEO Darren Woods continuing as chairman  and demanded that the oil giant be transparent around political contributions  in an effort to stop the kind of corporate lobbying that leads to dubious climate policies.The investor also backed a successful proposal that Chevron Corp.’s emissions targets include Scope 3  which is the broadest definition and covers the carbon footprint of its customers. And Ihenacho says the fund is now stepping up pressure on companies that can’t explain their taxation models.It’s a strategy the fund says is more powerful than outright divestment. “If we just sold out right away  it wouldn’t solve the problem of getting towards 1.5 degrees ” Ihenacho said  referring to the critical planetary warming limit identified by scientists.The fund’s governance structure means it’s also guided by recommendations from a Council on Ethics regarding companies to blacklist  irrespective of any financial considerations. Within that framework  the investor has excluded scores of companies such as Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.  due to its “unacceptable greenhouse gas emissions ” BAE Systems Plc  because of its involvement in the “production of nuclear weapons ” and Vale SA  based on the “severe environmental damage” caused by the company.Read More: World’s Biggest Wealth Fund Set to Target National Oil GiantsBut beyond that framework  Tangen characterizes divestment as a cop-out. “You have two camps ” he said. “One sees a problem  and just runs away. We think that approach doesn’t make much sense  because you don’t solve any problems. Somebody needs to own these companies. We think it’s better that we try to constructively move them in the right direction.”Divestment vs EngagementThe debate around ESG divestment versus engagement is increasingly attracting academic research. A study earlier this year showed that funding costs for companies that pollute hardly change when they’re divested  indicating that portfolio allocation ultimately does little to correct unethical behavior in the corporate world.Authors Jonathan Berk (Stanford Graduate School of Business) and Jules Van Binsbergen (Wharton School) wrote that “given the current levels of socially conscious capital  a more effective strategy to put that capital to use is to follow a policy of engagement.”Other studies suggest that both strategies can go hand in hand. Divestment as well as thematic and integrated strategies “have potential to help in their own way ” according to research by Jonathan Harris  director of Total Portfolio Project and an associate researcher at EDHEC-Risk.Tangen says engagement works most of the time. “There are very few companies that don’t respond ” he said. And those that resist change face a bleak future  he said.“You’re not going to get any financing because the banks are under increasing pressure to be very careful; you’re not going to get any insurance  because insurance companies are under pressure as well ” Tangen said. “Nobody’s actually going to work for you because for young people  it’s really  really important that their values are aligned with your values.”And then there’s the impact of social media  which has the power to sway customer behavior  he said. “You’re not going to get any clients...if you are not sustainable.”(Adds reference to the role of the ethics council)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2021 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.02,0.1,0.88,mixed,0.22,0.1,0.68,True,English,"['Top Stock Owner', 'ESG Duds', 'World', 'Exxon Corp.

Shares of Box ( BOX 1.08% )pop 12% as the cloud storage company continues its revenue growth. Allbirds ( BIRD 9.85% ) falls as revenue growth for the apparel company is outweighed by increasing losses.

A full transcript follows the video.This video was recorded on Dec. 1  2021.Chris Hill: It's Wednesday  December 1st  which means it's time to start the holiday music  but not yet. That'll come at the end of the show. Welcome to Market Foolery. I'm Chris Hill. Joining me from the financial capital of the United States of America  Maria Gallagher. Good to you see you.Maria Gallagher: Nice to see you too.Chris Hill: Once again  we have a trio of third-quarter earnings. We will talk apparel  we will talk Cloud. We're going to start with software. Salesforce  making headlines in more ways than one. Profits and revenue were higher than expected  but shares of Salesforce down little more than 6 percent this morning  because guidance for the fourth quarter was not what Wall Street wanted to see. Also  President and Chief Operating Officer  Bret Taylor has been promoted to Co-CEO and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors. We will get to that decision in a minute. First in terms of the results and the guidance  what stands out to you?Maria Gallagher: Like you said  the results were pretty strong  their revenue was 6.86 billion up about 27 percent  which is in line with estimates. They are on track to reach 50 billion in revenue by 2026. They're expecting revenue up for the full-year of about 26.39-26.4 billion  which is up about 24 percent. But something important I think to look at when you're setting companies like Salesforce is understanding how their acquisitions are performing. One of their recent acquisitions  MuleSoft  which is a Cloud application builder has encountered problems scaling up which weighed on the revenue  which they talked about a little bit this quarter. Slack  on the other hand  which they acquired earlier this year for 27.7 billion  actually outperformed expectations which just good to see. Slack Connect  which allowed intercompany messages between customers  saw a 176 percent growth  and so they're saying it's going to be a couple of more quarters before Slack's fully integrated. But so that is important to look at  not just those top line numbers  but understanding how their acquisitions are doing. It was good to see about Slack and I will be interested to see how MuleSoft performs in the next couple of quarters as well.Chris Hill: Obviously  if you're a shareholder  anytime there is an acquisition  you want to follow what the company is saying  what are their own expectations for how long this is going to take to integrate that sort of thing. You want them all to work. My hunch is if you're a Salesforce shareholder and you were going to be told one of these is working out better than the other  you'd be happy that the answer was  it's Slack that was  because that was even for a company the size of Salesforce  that was a big acquisition they made. There were people skeptical  [LAUGHTER] among other things. There were people who just thought it was a bad idea  but there were plenty of people who were like  I think I understand this  but that's a decent chunk of money.Maria Gallagher: It is definitely the one that you want to see performing well  it's the one that people are going to be paying a lot of attention to  it's one of their biggest name acquisitions that they've done. It's good to see how strong it's doing. I think it will be interesting to see how it gets integrated and how that increases their revenue in different ways  because obviously they are trying to compete more with Microsoft and have those abilities of a full business software company. We think it's going to be really interesting to see how it continues to compete.Chris Hill: Now  I don't know what your reaction was to the news about a Co-CEO. First of all  what a week for Bret Taylor. On Monday  he's named Chairman of the Board of Twitter  and now he is Co-CEO of Salesforce. It's a good week to be Bret Taylor. I don't know about you  but my first thought was  didn't Salesforce do this once before? Didn't Marc Benioff try this with Keith Block and it ended with Keith Block leaving the company because the Co-CEO thing wasn't working out? I don't know. Maybe second time is a charm. Certainly there are second marriages that work out better than first marriages  but I don't know  Maria. I'm still waiting to see the really shining example of the Co-CEO thing working out well for everybody involved.Maria Gallagher: It's interesting because Keith Block pretty recently stepped down  he stepped down in 2020. It's not like we've really learned from the past where we've had enough time to really think about it and try again. It's pretty recent in terms of now having a new Co-CEO. I agree with you. I think a lot of people are thinking  again  didn't we just do this? It will be interesting to see maybe second time will be of the charm.Chris Hill: Benioff is  I think  about 10 years older than Bret Taylor. If I'm being charitable  and I think Benioff has spoken a little bit to this  basically saying it's an opportunity for him to take a little bit more time off. This could be a prelude to  in 2-3 years down the line  Benioff says  ""All right  I'm stepping down as Co-CEO  and the company is now in the hands of someone with experience in the corner office."" I don't know. I was going back and forth with Andy Cross yesterday a little bit about this because I raised that question to him  ""Has this ever really worked well?"" The one example he gave me was Atlassian  which Atlassian has had co-founders and Co-CEOs for years. To me that's a little different because they started the business together. Again  feel free to email marketfoolery@fool.com  if you've got a great example of an existing CEO saying  ""I'm bringing on a Co-CEO "" and that working out well. With all of my skepticism around that aside  when you look at shares of Salesforce  down 6 percent today  down 10 percent in the last two days  one last thought I had about Salesforce was  I'm not a shareholder  maybe this is a buying opportunity. l don't know. I guess my question is  how good an entry point that Salesforce look at this price  if you're looking to hold this thing for 5-10 years?Maria Gallagher: It's a great question. I think a lot of times with moves like this  you think to yourself  are these spicing moves? Are these mission-critical changes in revenue that are concerning? Or are people just reacting to short-term news? I think a lot of times  especially with Salesforce right now  this is nothing that I saw was super concerning. Everything was really trending in the right direction. They have obviously had incredible performance over the past five  10 years. Marc Benioff has proven time and again to be a really good CEO. I think if you liked it a couple of days ago  you should like it now. I think a lot of people like it  including myself. I also I'm not a shareholder  but a lot of times a company like Salesforce  if someone said to me  why aren't you a shareholder? I don't think I'd have really good response. I would just say  I don't know. Maybe I should be.Chris Hill: Well  now that we're talking about it on this show  we'll have to wait for the internal trading restrictions at our company to blow over and then maybe we can buy a few shares. Let's move on to what appears to be a strong third quarter for Box. Profits and revenue both higher-than-expected for the Cloud storage company. Shares of Box up 12 percent today.Maria Gallagher: I talked to Tim Beyers a little bit this morning about these results from Box  and in his words he's described this as a breath of fresh air from the company. It was their third consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. It's up to 14 percent  which is not crazy high  but it's still 14 percent. Their revenue was 224 million. Their billings grew about 25 percent. They have a net retention rate of 109 percent  which is up from 103 percent a year ago. Those are all things trending in the right direction. They've had a bunch of new products. They're working on deeper integrations with Office  Salesforce  Slack  and Zoom. They've had momentum in their suites products. They are really expanding their wins and they're really excited about them. They're guiding for 15 percent revenue growth  which is for the next quarter and 13 percent for the year  which is an acceleration from the growth of 11 percent last year. I think that Tim described it well  it's just a breath of fresh air. It's not incredible  but it's better than it's been in the past and it's trending in the right direction for Box.Chris Hill: He follows it more closely than I do  but I get his point. This is one of those companies that  at various points in the last few years  has seemingly had a lot of promise. It's still just a four billion dollar company even with the move up today. It seems like it's in that category of businesses that  particularly for shareholders  when they see results like this  they look at it and think  OK  as you mentioned  third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. I'm sure shareholders are like  ""Great. Let's get a couple more. Let's get on a little bit of a hot streak going here "" because this is just been an up and down stock for a few years now.Maria Gallagher: It's pretty volatile. I think that shareholders are really hoping that this catches momentum and that they see growth accelerating. I think that net retention rate accelerating and growing is a really good sign and hopefully some of these new wins with customers and their expansion with customers will be good for them moving forward. Like you said  I think a lot of shareholders are saying  ""Okay  we've got a couple  let's get a couple more. Let's keep it going.""Chris Hill: Allbirds is out with its first report as a public company. This is the company best known for its footwear. Revenue was up 33 percent in the quarter  but the loss was nearly double what it was a year ago  and shares of Allbirds down 8 percent this morning and down nearly 40 percent from where it's finished on opening day.Maria Gallagher: Allbirds is a tricky one. Their revenue was up 33 percent. Their revenue in the US was up 42 percent. Their international revenue was up 10 percent. They opened four stores which ended the quarter with 31 locations. That's part of the reason that loss widened. They're expanding more into physical retail. They're saying that there's a strong response to their new product innovation including performance apparel line  which I think is an interesting route to go. I think it's expected  but also very competitive. You have Nike with about 39-40 percent of that industry  Adidas with about 20 percent  and then up incomers in the performance area are people will talk more about Hoka are on. People aren't really talking that much  in my experience  about this performance apparel lines so I think that that's going to be a little bit tricky for them to gain a lot of traction in. I do really admire the company. They have this uniqueness surrounding their brand and their integration of ESG with inception  which I think helps it standout  but I think that really helps it stand out in terms of leisure wear. I do think that it will be interesting to see how successful they are in that growth because they need that growth in different areas to keep accelerating.Chris Hill: The expanding into the apparel  that makes sense. They appear to be doing it in a smart way. They're just methodically rolling out a few products here and there. That's smart. One of the challenges  I think  for this business is the balance of e-commerce and the store traffic. They really started out as an online brand. There's a way to do that well. Unfortunately  in the same way they are being methodical in how they rollout their apparel  they are being methodical in how they rollout their stores. Four stores is not a lot to rollout at any one period of time. I love their products. These are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned in my life. I've bought several pairs of Allbirds  I love them. But I've made that mistake before as an investor. Particularly in this space with Under Armour  with saying  to my way of thinking  the toughest thing to get right is the product and having a product that truly stands out. The mistake I made with Under Armour was  well  they got the toughest thing right  I'm sure they can figure out the rest.That really hasn't worked out for me as a shareholder. I'm not going to make that mistake with Allbirds  even though I love the product itself and they are a new public company. You mentioned the ESG. As you said  this is a big part of their brand. I think the phrase ESG appears in their S-1 filing nearly 100 times which leads me to this. The fact that they make good products  they've really leaned into ESG. Those things combined to make me think  this is not a big company and I could see someone making an offer to buy them in the next two to three years  before they really get their feet under them  no pun intended  as a public company. I don't know. It's one more reason I'm not going to buy shares of Allbirds because it's not going to surprise me  if someone looks at the products they make and the branding  and the brand halo that comes with the ESG for this company and says  ""Yes  we will buy them for a billion dollars more than whatever their current market cap is.""Maria Gallagher: Yeah. I think that's really interesting and it's so hard  especially with consumer retail. I think investors and consumers are so fickle in their attention. The hot shoes. I think Rothy's a couple of years ago where the shoes everybody had and then I feel like Allbirds has stolen a little bit of their thunder in terms of that sustainable angle of you're getting recycled shoes or shoes made from better material. I do think that that's hard  but I agree. I think that there would be really interesting acquisition target for some bigger companies that are trying to maybe rebrand  try and talk about leaning more into that sustainability which a lot of these brands are doing. I think that especially if they are expanding into their physical retail. When you integrate ESG and sustainability with your core mission  people are going to be a lot more critical of it and so expanding into fiscal retail  that's going to be an interesting thing to see how that impacts their overall environmental footprint.What are those costs and benefits that they're doing and how transparent are they with them? I will give them credit that if you go onto their website  they have a sustainability section right on their branding website. It's really comprehensive  it's really interesting. It's backed by a lot of data  which I think is one of my favorite things to see. You see sometimes a lot of times with these brands  they have a lot of buzz terms  but not a lot of specific data about their company. I really think Allbirds deserves a lot of credit for how transparent they've been thus far. I'll be interested to see how they grow or I wouldn't be surprised either if they become an acquisition target because I think they have the brand loyalty. They have the goods that people like. They are before  they're off to the races  pun intended  and I think that might be something we see.Chris Hill: Before we wrap up  as I mentioned  it's December 1st and if you're relatively new to this show  what we have done starting in 2015  and by we I mean me and Dan Boyd  the man behind the glass. By me and Dan Boyd  I mean it's mostly Dan Boyd because his knowledge of music is vastly superior to mine. We've had a mission in the month of December to celebrate holiday music that never makes it to the radio. All these hundreds of radio stations flipped to the holiday format and they just keep playing the same songs and they're fine. But there are many other great songs out there that we want to celebrate. That's what we do in the month of December. Also I want to wish a happy birthday today to Mikey  one of our listeners. I believe he is in Sweden. The reason I believe that is  he sent me a holiday song that's in Swedish. I don't know if we're going to get that up. We'll see. But thank you Mike  thank you for listening  and happy birthday.Maria Gallagher: Happy birthday.Chris Hill: Maria Gallagher  always great talking to you. Thanks so much for being here.Maria Gallagher: Thanks for having me.Chris Hill: As always  people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about and the Motley Fool may have formal recommendations for or against.

Our strong GRESB performance over the past six years demonstrates the success of our ESG program with the ability of funds to continually implement new ESG practices and perform well against their peers in the U.S. and Europe "" said Jennifer McConkey  senior director of operations and sustainability for Principal Real Estate Investors. “ With ESG continuing to rise in prominence as a key financial and risk management strategy  we are committed to staying on top of the latest developments in the real estate industry to help clients achieve positive performance outcomes.""In total  Principal submitted two U.S. funds and six European funds for participation in GRESB in 2021  six of which were also submitted in 2020. Of the six  four improved performance in 2021 compared to their 2020 GRESB assessments. In general  this improvement was due to better tenant engagement  increased property data coverage  and utility and greenhouse gas data verification. In particular  the “G” rating for governance was especially strong across all eight Principal strategies in GRESB’s ESG breakdown.All eight strategies outperformed the peer average in every scored category for management  which includes leadership  policies  reporting  risk management  and stakeholder engagement. In addition  all strategies scored perfectly on data monitoring and review in the performance category.The overarching ESG framework for Principal Real Estate Investors  called the Pillars of Responsible Property Investing  helps real estate investments demonstrate market resilience  corporate governance  and property performance. Principal has recently integrated industrial properties  additional European properties  and lending efforts into ESG practices  and is currently conducting fund-level climate risk assessments.Each year  GRESB assesses and benchmarks the ESG performance of real assets worldwide. Overall fund participation grew by 24% this year to 1 520. This is the highest percentage increase the assessment has seen since 2012 and the highest ever increase in total numbers. The benchmark now covers $5.7 trillion of AUM (up from $4.8 trillion) and nearly 117 000 individual assets. The increase has been driven mainly by Europe  which saw massive growth for the second year in a row and now accounts for nearly half of the entire benchmark. According to GRESB  high continued growth in Europe is likely driven by both investor interest in ESG data and the industry’s focus on and attention to emerging regulations.Information on the 2021 GRESB Real Estate results can be found at GRESB.com.1 The GRESB star rating is a relative score that ranks all GRESB participants worldwide  broken up into quintiles. Therefore  a GRESB 4-star score indicates performance within the top 40% of all participants.About Principal Real Estate InvestorsPrincipal Real Estate Investors manages or sub-advises $98.4 billion in commercial real estate assets (as of September 30  2021).

Dec. 7  2021 /CNW/ -- LP Building Solutions (LP)  a leading manufacturer of high-performance building products  released its 2021 Sustainability Report today. Serving as LP's inaugural environmental  social  and governance (ESG) report  the document outlines LP's five sustainability pillars—governance  people  environment  products  and community—which represent the foundation of the company's sustainability work and collective commitment to ESG principles.LP Building Solutions (LP)  a leading manufacturer of high-performance building products  released its 2021 Sustainability Report""We are energized and excited to build on LP's 50-year legacy of sustainability."" - Chair and CEO Brad Southern""At LP  we define sustainability as doing the right thing today so that we can build a brighter future for generations to come "" said LP Chair and Chief Executive Officer Brad Southern. ""Our work to support a successful future is inextricably linked to protecting the environment  minimizing waste  manufacturing sustainable products  developing our employees  diversifying our workplace  supporting our communities  and promoting economic prosperity. With a strong track record of sustainability across these areas  LP continues to improve so that we can build a stronger tomorrow.""By Building a Better World™  LP not only cultivates community and sustainability but also helps drive business performance. For example  in 2020  LP achieved $2.8 billion in net sales and $4.31 earnings per share.""We are energized and excited to build on LP's 50-year legacy of sustainability "" Southern continued. ""As this report shows  LP is managing risks and capitalizing on opportunities to establish new leadership standards on ESG matters.""Elevating People and CommunityThe health  safety  and wellness of LP's employees are paramount to sustainable business success. LP's health and safety programs are governed by the LP Environmental Health and Safety Protocol Standard and rely on an advanced form of safety management that measures serious injury and fatality potential to prevent incidents before they occur. LP considers safety so fundamental to its operations that the company uses it as a key metric in evaluating operational excellence.Earlier this year  LP released the LP Diversity  Equity  and Inclusion (DEI) Pledge for Action  which prioritizes gender and racial diversity  equity  and inclusion as critical focus areas for the company. The goal of LP's DEI journey is to cultivate an inclusive work environment that attracts and retains a diverse and high-performing workforce to meet the needs of LP's rapidly diversifying markets and communities.LP has also continued its long-standing history of volunteerism and philanthropy this year. The company strives to build strong relationships in the communities where its employees live and work  with teams volunteering their time and expertise in many ways. In 2021  the LP Foundation donated more than $500 000 through five programs: Disaster Relief  Grants and Sponsorships  Community Mill Grants  Employee Giving Match Program  and Employee Nonprofit Board Sponsorships.Promoting Environmental Stewardship with Responsible Manufacturing and Carbon-Conscious ProductsStory continuesFounded as a commodity forest products company nearly 50 years ago  LP has evolved into a leading specialty building solutions provider that continues to preserve and enhance the environment. LP's commitment to sustainable forestry is highlighted by its third-party forest certification to independent standards from the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI®) and the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification. All of the fiber that LP sources from the U.S and Canada is certified to SFI standards.To minimize waste  LP uses more than 99% of the fiber harvested for manufacturing in products or as an alternative thermal energy source. Nearly 80% of LP's thermal energy is derived from renewable energy sources.Using globally recognized protocols  LP is working to quantify contributions to greenhouse gas emissions related to product manufacturing  including Scope 1 (direct emissions from owned or controlled sources) and Scope 2 (indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity  steam  heating  and cooling consumed by LP)  as well as contributions across its supply chain  including Scope 3 (all other indirect emissions that occur across the company's value chain). This information will provide the initial baseline used to establish measurable targets for carbon emission reductions moving forward.The Value Reporting Foundation's SASB Standards Board oversees the SASB Standards  an ESG guidance framework for the disclosure of relevant and material sustainability information to investors. LP is aligned with SASB's Building Products and Furnishings standards and Forestry Management standards (the full SASB index is provided in LP's 2021 Sustainability Report). LP is also currently undertaking a climate change risk and opportunity assessment using the framework established by the Financial Stability Board's Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures.In 2021  LP released an environmental product declaration (EPD) for LP® SmartSide® Trim & Siding products. The results helped show that SmartSide products store more carbon than is released in the production and distribution of the product. The EPD  along with a supplemental assessment  demonstrates that SmartSide products are carbon negative.Building a Brighter Future Through SustainabilityFor LP  Building a Better World™ is a journey of continuous improvement that can only be achieved through collaboration with stakeholders. To that end  LP initiated an ESG priority assessment in 2021  engaging a broad group of stakeholders to identify the ESG topics most relevant to the long-term sustainability of its business. This discussion also sought to shed light on the material risks and opportunities for the company. LP is currently establishing goals and developing action plans in relation to these ESG priority topics.LP is proud of the steps it has taken in 2021 to implement a holistic sustainability strategy and looks forward to further building upon its ESG program in the years to come.To read LP's 2021 Sustainability Report  visit lpcorp.com/sustainability.About LP Building SolutionsAs a leader in high-performance building solutions  Louisiana-Pacific Corporation (LP Building Solutions  NYSE: LPX) manufactures engineered wood building products that meet the demands of builders  remodelers and homeowners worldwide.

State agencies would then be required to “sell  redeem  divest  or withdraw all publicly traded securities” in qualifying companies unless that would “result in a loss in value or a benchmark deviation.” Attorneys general would be empowered to enforce rules mandating that state agencies report which companies they’ve divested from and the “prohibited investments” they still hold.The legislation is modeled explicitly on “anti-BDS” bills written to counter the Boycott  Divest  Sanctions call from Palestinian civil society groups for economic actions against firms complicit in the Israeli occupation there. But such measures have proven controversial  and in some cases unconstitutional. Arkansas’s version was struck down by the Eighth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals as a violation of the First Amendment. To counter such claims  Isaac—and those presenting the legislation  according to an attendee who spoke with The New Republic—assured lawmakers that the model bill is in fact constitutional and intended to allow each state to “protect its economic interest ” not breach fiduciary responsibility for ideological reasons.The move marks a deepening split between a Republican Party committed to ginning up a culture war and major arms of capital. The GOP’s war on renewables is increasingly at odds with large segments of the utility sector that are ditching coal and gas for economic reasons  as well as the financial sector  where environment  social  and governance  or ESG  assets—a largely undefined umbrella category of vaguely socially conscious investments—are on track to exceed $50 trillion by 2025. Finance titans like Larry Fink have been eager to take advantage of investor interest in indistinctly green-tinged asset classes and for public spending on climate to grease the wheels for (i.e.  “de-risk”) their involvement in infrastructure that will be critical to the twenty-first century: that is  for states to shoulder the risks of climate investments while corporations collect the rewards.But contrary to right-wing rhetoric claiming liberals have it in for Exxon investors  growing private-sector buzz around greening the financial sector hasn’t so far included much of a substantive challenge to banks’ or asset managers’ continued investments in fossil fuels. In the five years since the Paris Agreement  the world’s 60 biggest banks have showered fossil fuel projects with $3.8 trillion worth of financing  according to a report released this spring from the Rainforest Action Network and the Sierra Club. The well-publicized Global Financial Alliance for Net-Zero—the allegedly $130-trillion-strong effort launched by former Bank of England turned green central banking guru Mark Carney at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow last month—included no stipulation that the asset managers involved  including Blackrock  the world’s largest  would need to stop investing in coal  oil  or gas anytime soon.

(NASDAQ:COWN) (“Cowen” or the “Company”)  today announced the release of Themes 2022. This annual handbook identifies themes in which Cowen’s sector knowledge and collaborative approach provide integral insight into trends  policies and advancements that are defining or redefining industries. As in prior years  Themes 2022 builds off Cowen’s flagship Ahead Of The Curve® Series  the preeminent equity and policy research product for institutional investors and corporate decision makers. Themes 2022 is accessible here .Robert Fagin  Cowen’s Director of Research noted  “In Themes 2022  we once again feature areas of investor focus where Cowen’s domain expertise has been central to the discussion and debate. In all cases  Cowen Research offered its hallmark collaborative approach to help inform our viewpoints  working across sector teams to provide valuable perspective.” Each theme highlighted is accompanied by a listing of relevant Cowen reports and events.Bill Bird  Cowen’s Head of Thematic Content  said  “The fundamental viewpoints featured in Themes 2022 are bolstered by the insights of our Washington Research Group. This has become critical in an environment in which divining the outcome of key policy debates has become increasingly crucial to forecasting financial markets. In addition  we overlay a unique perspective on ESG and sustainability. This year  Cowen became the first major Wall Street firm to place company-specific ESG Scores on the cover of its research reports; we added a dedicated ESG policy analyst to our Washington Research Group; and built Wall Street’s most robust coverage of mobility and energy transition.”The table below summarizes the 14 areas of focus addressed in Themes 2022.THEME SUMMARY OF COWEN’S INSIGHT Mobility The auto industry is undergoing multiple transitions. We believe electrification of transport will happen sooner than the market expects  setting off new rounds of innovation. The $7 trillion transportation industry is ripe for disruption. Next-gen mobility will introduce new business models and disrupt many other parts of the economy. Energy Transition We are at a tipping point in the transition to a low carbon economy. We believe many different segments of energy transition will benefit from unprecedented levels of new investment. No single silver bullet will solve the world’s energy crisis. We see room for multiple technologies to succeed. Cryptocurrencies and Digital Assets We believe crypto will be regulated similar to the non-crypto product it is trying to replace. That includes consumer protection  tax  and money laundering. The regulatory framework for crypto will take time to develop. China The Biden Administration and Congress have ambitious plans to challenge China diplomatically  economically  technologically  and militarily. U.S.-China competition/decoupling will be a decades-long strategic competition. Health Care Innovation Biotech and pharmaceutical innovation is accelerating  including cell & gene therapies (C>) and related tools  a reinvigorated focus on certain infectious diseases  psychedelics  potentially disease-modifying therapy for Alzheimer's Disease  and targeted oncology. Precision medicine is in its infancy  ushering in a new wave of innovators  significant investment by incumbents  and addressing very large markets  most notably cancer treatment  a $166B global pharmaceutical therapeutic category. ESG ESG matters not only from a consumer perspective  but also from a capital markets perspective. The flow of dollars seeking ESG-oriented investments is significant. That matters for asset managers and for companies seeking to raise capital. A Cowen survey found that 80% of 18-34 year-olds view sustainability as “somewhat” or “very” important to their purchasing decisions. This will heighten money managers’ focus on sustainability. The Post-COVID Consumer Several consumer behaviors and preferences tipped during the pandemic. Next-gen consumers are rising in importance and gaining clout. A brand’s social impact and consumers’ perception of sustainability will increasingly influence purchase decisions. Sustainable Food & Healthy Living Driven by next-gen consumers  a shift toward more environmentally friendly and healthy products is underway. We believe we are on the cusp of one of the most dramatic changes in packaged food in recent memory. For example  our proprietary work points to a 10x increase in the global oat-based segment to $19 billion by 2026. Cannabis Cannabis has continued to mainstream and we have been consistently raising our total addressable market estimate. There remains a significant opportunity to transition a large illicit market. We have maintained more measured expectations on the timing of Federal action  but we continue to believe legalization is a matter of “when ” not “if.” Health Care Business Model TransformationPayment model innovation  site-of-care delivery transformation  and the digital data revolution are three investable mega-trends. We believe that a migration to value-based care is an incremental $1 trillion market opportunity over the next decade. COVID dramatically accelerated a shift to site-of-care. Software Innovation The COVID pandemic meaningfully accelerated enterprise software innovation and adoption  ushering in a new wave of computing frameworks and applications that will set a compelling course for growth and innovation for years to come. We believe software companies will continue to scale at an unprecedented pace  driven by several factors including faster cycles from cloud  new routes to market such as self-service and “freemium ” and higher visibility into revenue streams from subscription models. Cybersecurity Cyber attacks have continued to escalate. The cost of the average data breach in 2021 was $4.2M. Attacks have increased 4x in just the past two years. Cybersecurity solutions are shifting from “nice-to-have” to “must-have ” particularly as enforcement actions create pressure to implement cyber and compliance protections. We believe the $147B information security and risk management market can compound at 9% over the next five years. Robotics & Automation The Robotics sector stands to benefit from growth in eCommerce logistics demand  labor shortages  an aging U.S. workforce  and defense technology modernization policies. We also see penetration increasing significantly in surgical robotics. Our proprietary survey of end users shows a dramatic upswing in spending plans for robotics. Market Structure We estimate that only 30% of the volume that hits the tape in U.S. equities is single-stock  accessible  non-HFT (high frequency trading) liquidity. “Inaccessible liquidity” introduces a new factor to incorporate in trading decision-making processes and algos.For more information and to read the Cowen 2022 themes report  please click here.Story continuesAbout Cowen ResearchCowen’s research department has 60 senior analysts covering 965 securities across multiple sectors including industrials  consumer  energy  health care  technology  media & telecom  and cross-asset  as well as a deep Washington policy team.About Cowen Inc.Cowen Inc.

The tool supports the 10 principles of the UN Global Compact and was developed by Arabesque.It makes sustainability data more available to multiple users and lets companies be the curators of their own ESG digital platform while providing framework neutral ESG information in real time.Organizations that manage more than $100 trillion of assets are committed to the principles of responsible investment as more large businesses pledge to reach net zero goals. Still  the lack of disclosure and inconsistency of data has slowed the investment toward these objectives.That is where the ESG Book aims to help make sustainability goals more accessible. This comes as many business leaders say ESG is a top priority in their businesses or equally as important as financial success. Additionally  nine out of 10 investors worldwide implement ESG into their business decisions  according to a report from Corbin Advisors.With these market shifts  the biggest factor for improved data may be transparency.The creators of the ESG Book say companies should feel empowered to report on the most important ESG issues to their stakeholders. By doing so it makes the available information clearer and also helps to identify gaps in the data.The tool also allows for ESG data to be mapped across a range of frameworks  which can allow data to be populated from multiple resources at the same time. This can produce improved insights into information companies decide to disclose.That can be important to businesses as more focus is put on ESG efforts because reporting and transparency are areas that seem to be lagging. A survey by ISN earlier in 2021 found that while 60% of companies had invested in environmental management systems  only 7% actively tracked their impacts.As organizations move to improve in this area with their ESG activities  the creators of the tool want more accessibility and impartiality. They say the information should be standard and have equal access to users. This will provide up-to-date information to help guide global capital flows  they say.In that regard the tool aims to provide a level playing field with the data with a standard platform for all users that allows the collection of data from based on sustainability questions across multiple frameworks at the same time while also adjusting to changes in the market.More than 200 businesses and organizations from the United States and Europe recently asked governments to help implement ESG policies and standards  as well.The ESG Book looks to provide all of this to organizations while letting them have control and maintenance of their data.
