Many face culling animals if the situation doesn't improve quickly.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register""This is a family business. My grandfather kept it going during two wars  my dad saw one  but I don't know if we'll get through this one "" Ferrari said.Italy has called for EU rules limiting state aid to the sector to be waived  while Spain has taken steps to allow emergency purchases of corn from Argentina and Brazil.""I hear growing reports of farmers slaughtering their animals  but I want to avoid that "" said Elisabetta Quaini  who keeps 1 300 cows for beef and milk production on her farm in Lombardy  northern Italy. ""I'm determined to keep going  but I am very worried.""""It's not just corn  it's also soya and numerous by-products that are hard to find. There is a tremendous fight to get hold of what is available.""Michele Liverini  vice-president of livestock feed producer Mangimi Liverini S.p.A.  said if dairy cows were slaughtered it would take seven to eight years to build up a barn to produce milk again.Ukraine is among the world's top four corn exporters  and the closure of its ports due to the conflict has had a major impact on shipments.""The problem is that we now have a perfect storm. When the Ukrainian exports stopped  countries like Moldova  Serbia and Hungary tried to stop exporting as a protectionist step and we found ourselves with a big problem in our ports "" Liverini said.""In Italian ports  where ships from these countries arrive every week  there is only a 25-day supply left.""LARGE HERDSSpain has the largest livestock herd in the European Union with about 58.8 million head  according the EU data for 2021 covering pigs  cows  sheep and goats. Italy has the fourth largest with about 22.5 million head.The two countries produce a wide array of internationally renowned farm products  including Mozzarella di Bufala and Prosciutto di Parma in Italy and Jamon Iberico in Spain.Pietro Fusco  chief executive of Cirio Agricola  a milk producer with two farms based near Benevento  southern Italy  said the sector was already stressed after struggling for two years through the COVID-19 pandemic.He said they were considering giving the herd less feed as a first step  but may eventually be forced to slaughter some of the animals to keep the farm going and protect jobs and families.""There is also a problem with transport and therefore the impossibility of having supplies on time "" he said.Maize  or corn  futures on Paris-based Euronext rose to a record 420 euros a tonne earlier this month  up about 50% since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Feed stocks have also become depleted in Spain  a major customer of Ukraine.Agustin de Prada  manager of Spain's ranchers association Asoprovac in Castile and Leon  said the rise in costs had been brutal and raised questions about the viability of farms.""When I sell the animals  will I put new ones in?

Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases – including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure – with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed €3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR® is estimated to be over €5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.The alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.In the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints and a rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life. All patients have been enrolled in the study and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines. Over 900 alfapump systems have been implanted to date.Sequana Medical has combined its proven alfapump and proprietary DSR therapy  and is developing the alfapump DSR  a breakthrough approach to fluid overload due to heart failure. RED DESERT demonstrated that repeated DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients is able to manage their fluid and sodium balance  improve their cardio-renal status and restore their diuretic response for months post-treatment. Interim results from the ongoing SAHARA DESERT study of alfapump DSR in decompensated heart failure patients indicated a safe  effective and rapid elimination of persistent congestion and restoration of euvolemia  together with a considerable benefit in cardio-renal status and a dramatic improvement in diuretic responsiveness. Reporting of top-line data is planned for H2 2022.Sequana Medical is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Study) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to cirrhosis.

Many face culling animals if the situation doesn't improve quickly.""This is a family business. My grandfather kept it going during two wars  my dad saw one  but I don't know if we'll get through this one "" Ferrari said.Italy has called for EU rules limiting state aid to the sector to be waived  while Spain has taken steps to allow emergency purchases of corn from Argentina and Brazil.""I hear growing reports of farmers slaughtering their animals  but I want to avoid that "" said Elisabetta Quaini  who keeps 1 300 cows for beef and milk production on her farm in Lombardy  northern Italy. ""I'm determined to keep going  but I am very worried.""""It's not just corn  it's also soya and numerous by-products that are hard to find. There is a tremendous fight to get hold of what is available.""Michele Liverini  vice-president of livestock feed producer Mangimi Liverini S.p.A.  said if dairy cows were slaughtered it would take seven to eight years to build up a barn to produce milk again.Ukraine is among the world's top four corn exporters  and the closure of its ports due to the conflict has had a major impact on shipments.""The problem is that we now have a perfect storm. When the Ukrainian exports stopped  countries like Moldova  Serbia and Hungary tried to stop exporting as a protectionist step and we found ourselves with a big problem in our ports "" Liverini said.Story continues""In Italian ports  where ships from these countries arrive every week  there is only a 25-day supply left.""LARGE HERDSSpain has the largest livestock herd in the European Union with about 58.8 million head  according the EU data for 2021 covering pigs  cows  sheep and goats. Italy has the fourth largest with about 22.5 million head.The two countries produce a wide array of internationally renowned farm products  including Mozzarella di Bufala and Prosciutto di Parma in Italy and Jamon Iberico in Spain.Pietro Fusco  chief executive of Cirio Agricola  a milk producer with two farms based near Benevento  southern Italy  said the sector was already stressed after struggling for two years through the COVID-19 pandemic.He said they were considering giving the herd less feed as a first step  but may eventually be forced to slaughter some of the animals to keep the farm going and protect jobs and families.""There is also a problem with transport and therefore the impossibility of having supplies on time "" he said.Maize  or corn  futures on Paris-based Euronext rose to a record 420 euros a tonne earlier this month  up about 50% since Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Feed stocks have also become depleted in Spain  a major customer of Ukraine.Agustin de Prada  manager of Spain's ranchers association Asoprovac in Castile and Leon  said the rise in costs had been brutal and raised questions about the viability of farms.""When I sell the animals  will I put new ones in? Well  maybe not  because I can't  the maths doesn't work out.""Producers argue that for them to survive  consumers must pay higher prices for products like meat  milk and eggs  further fuelling food inflation  which has become a major problem across the globe since the COVID-19 pandemic began.Emilio Rial  director of the Coren group  a huge farmers' cooperative in Spain  said the cost of basic food production had jumped 40%.""We will try not to pass it all on to the consumer by negotiating with the big supermarkets  but prices will inevitably rise "" he said.(Additional reporting by Emma Pinedo and Belen Carreno in Madrid; Writing by Nigel Hunt; Editing by Veronica Brown and Jan Harvey)",negative,0.04,0.25,0.72,mixed,0.03,0.13,0.84,True,English,"['South Europe', 'livestock culls', 'Ukraine conflict', 'feed shortage', 'Mangimi Liverini S.p.A.', 'seven to eight years', 'fourth generation family business', 'top four corn exporters', 'Agustin de Prada', 'import-reliant southern Europe', 'major global supplier', 'largest livestock herd', ""huge farmers' cooperative"", 'basic food production', 'livestock feed producer', 'Carlo Vittorio Ferrari', 'two years', 'Michele Liverini', 'food inflation', 'animal feed', 'major impact', 'less feed', 'major customer', 'Gavin Jones', 'Cristiano Corvino', 'two wars', 'EU rules', 'state aid', 'emergency purchases', 'growing reports', 'Elisabetta Quaini', 'milk production', 'numerous by', 'tremendous fight', 'perfect storm', 'protectionist step', '25-day supply', 'LARGE HERDS', 'European Union', '58.8 million head', 'EU data', '22.5 million head', 'wide array', 'Mozzarella di', 'Prosciutto di', 'Jamon Iberico', 'Pietro Fusco', 'chief executive', 'Cirio Agricola', 'milk producer', 'southern Italy', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'first step', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'record 420 euros', 'ranchers association', 'Emilio Rial', 'Coren group', 'big supermarkets', 'Additional reporting', 'Emma Pinedo', 'Belen Carreno', 'Nigel Hunt', 'Veronica Brown', 'Jan Harvey', 'Feed stocks', 'major problem', 'northern Italy', 'Ukrainian exports', 'big problem', 'higher prices', 'dairy cows', 'Italian ports', 'two countries', 'two farms', 'farm products', '1,300 cows', 'ROME', 'Reuters', '2,000 pigs', 'brother', 'town', 'Cremona', 'conflict', 'Ukraine', 'country', 'Hungary', 'Serbia', 'Moldova', 'supplies', 'costs', 'future', 'Many', 'culling', 'animals', 'situation', 'grandfather', 'dad', 'sector', 'Spain', 'steps', 'Argentina', 'Brazil', 'beef', 'Lombardy', 'soya', 'hold', 'vice-president', 'barn', 'world', 'closure', 'shipments', 'Story', 'ships', 'sheep', 'goats', 'internationally', 'Bufala', 'Parma', 'Benevento', 'jobs', 'families', 'transport', 'impossibility', 'time', 'Maize', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'manager', 'Asoprovac', 'Castile', 'Leon', 'rise', 'questions', 'viability', 'new', 'maths', 'Producers', 'consumers', 'meat', 'eggs', 'globe', 'director', 'Madrid', 'Writing', 'Editing']",2022-03-18,2022-03-19,news.yahoo.com

1018,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/corporate-finance-manual/cfm13060,CFM13060 - Understanding corporate finance: derivative: exchange-traded contracts,An introduction to corporate finance legislation covering loan relationships  foreign exchange (FOREX) and derivative contracts,Exchange-traded contractsAn exchange-traded contract is bought or sold directly on a regulated exchange such as the former LIFFE (the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange) or the CBOT (Chicago Board of Trade).To make this possible  an exchange-traded product has a standard contract specification  which sets outexactly what the underlying consists of where and how it is to be delivered (if it is deliverable) how much money the holder will gain or lose as the price of the underlying changes  andwhat each party is obliged to do when the contract matures.Typical exchange-traded instruments include interest rate futures  currency futures and options  and Brent Crude oil futures.In the past  most exchanges traded through open outcry  where each trader signified by shouting and hand signals what trade he was trying to execute. Almost all exchanges have now moved to electronic trading. The open outcry system brought buyers and sellers directly together. By contrast electronic trading is anonymous. An order input into the system is kept in a central order book until a matching order is received.Once a match has been achieved  a clearing house interposes itself in the chain of transactions between buyer and seller. For example  in the past all LIFFE’s contracts are cleared through the London Clearing House (LCH). Both buyer and seller execute contracts with the clearing house  not with each other  and neither party has to worry about the credit rating of the counterparty.There have been significant changes to derivatives exchange  stock exchanges and clearing houses and former alliances have been shaken up. There has been both international and functional consolidation.

Many face culling animals if the situation doesn’t improve quickly.“This is a family business. My grandfather kept it going during two wars  my dad saw one  but I don’t know if we’ll get through this one ” Ferrari said.Italy has called for EU rules limiting state aid to the sector to be waived  while Spain has taken steps to allow emergency purchases of corn from Argentina and Brazil.“I hear growing reports of farmers slaughtering their animals  but I want to avoid that ” said Elisabetta Quaini  who keeps 1 300 cows for beef and milk production on her farm in Lombardy  northern Italy. “I’m determined to keep going  but I am very worried.”“It’s not just corn  it’s also soya and numerous by-products that are hard to find. There is a tremendous fight to get hold of what is available.”Michele Liverini  vice-president of livestock feed producer Mangimi Liverini S.p.A.  said if dairy cows were slaughtered it would take seven to eight years to build up a barn to produce milk again.Ukraine is among the world’s top four corn exporters  and the closure of its ports due to the conflict has had a major impact on shipments.“The problem is that we now have a perfect storm. When the Ukrainian exports stopped  countries like Moldova  Serbia and Hungary tried to stop exporting as a protectionist step and we found ourselves with a big problem in our ports ” Liverini said.“In Italian ports  where ships from these countries arrive every week  there is only a 25-day supply left.”LARGE HERDSSpain has the largest livestock herd in the European Union with about 58.8 million head  according the EU data for 2021 covering pigs  cows  sheep and goats. Italy has the fourth largest with about 22.5 million head.The two countries produce a wide array of internationally renowned farm products  including Mozzarella di Bufala and Prosciutto di Parma in Italy and Jamon Iberico in Spain.Pietro Fusco  chief executive of Cirio Agricola  a milk producer with two farms based near Benevento  southern Italy  said the sector was already stressed after struggling for two years through the COVID-19 pandemic.He said they were considering giving the herd less feed as a first step  but may eventually be forced to slaughter some of the animals to keep the farm going and protect jobs and families.“There is also a problem with transport and therefore the impossibility of having supplies on time ” he said.Maize  or corn  futures on Paris-based Euronext rose to a record 420 euros a tonne earlier this month  up about 50% since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Feed stocks have also become depleted in Spain  a major customer of Ukraine.Agustin de Prada  manager of Spain’s ranchers association Asoprovac in Castile and Leon  said the rise in costs had been brutal and raised questions about the viability of farms.“When I sell the animals  will I put new ones in? Well  maybe not  because I can’t  the maths doesn’t work out.”Producers argue that for them to survive  consumers must pay higher prices for products like meat  milk and eggs  further fuelling food inflation  which has become a major problem across the globe since the COVID-19 pandemic began.Emilio Rial  director of the Coren group  a huge farmers’ cooperative in Spain  said the cost of basic food production had jumped 40%.“We will try not to pass it all on to the consumer by negotiating with the big supermarkets  but prices will inevitably rise ” he said.(Additional reporting by Emma Pinedo and Belen Carreno in Madrid; Writing by Nigel Hunt; Editing by Veronica Brown and Jan Harvey),negative,0.04,0.25,0.72,negative,0.01,0.1,0.89,True,English,"['South Europe', 'livestock culls', 'Ukraine conflict', 'feed shortage', 'Mangimi Liverini S.p.A.', 'seven to eight years', 'top four corn exporters', 'Agustin de Prada', 'import-reliant southern Europe', 'major global supplier', 'largest livestock herd', 'huge farmers’ cooperative', 'basic food production', 'livestock feed producer', 'two years', 'Michele Liverini', 'food inflation', 'animal feed', 'major impact', 'less feed', 'major customer', 'family business', 'two wars', 'EU rules', 'state aid', 'emergency purchases', 'growing reports', 'Elisabetta Quaini', 'milk production', 'numerous by-products', 'tremendous fight', 'perfect storm', 'protectionist step', '25-day supply', 'LARGE HERDS', 'European Union', '58.8 million head', 'EU data', '22.5 million head', 'wide array', 'Mozzarella di', 'Prosciutto di', 'Jamon Iberico', 'Pietro Fusco', 'chief executive', 'Cirio Agricola', 'milk producer', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'first step', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'record 420 euros', 'ranchers association', 'Emilio Rial', 'Coren group', 'big supermarkets', 'Additional reporting', 'Emma Pinedo', 'Belen Carreno', 'Nigel Hunt', 'Veronica Brown', 'Jan Harvey', 'southern Italy', 'Feed stocks', 'major problem', 'Ukrainian exports', 'big problem', 'higher prices', 'northern Italy', 'dairy cows', 'Italian ports', 'two countries', 'two farms', 'farm products', '1,300 cows', 'country', 'Hungary', 'Serbia', 'Moldova', 'supplies', 'costs', 'Ferrari', 'future', 'Many', 'culling', 'animals', 'situation', 'grandfather', 'dad', 'sector', 'Spain', 'steps', 'Argentina', 'Brazil', 'beef', 'Lombardy', 'soya', 'hold', 'vice-president', 'barn', 'Ukraine', 'world', 'closure', 'conflict', 'shipments', 'ships', 'pigs', 'sheep', 'goats', 'internationally', 'Bufala', 'Parma', 'Benevento', 'jobs', 'families', 'transport', 'impossibility', 'time', 'Maize', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'manager', 'Asoprovac', 'Castile', 'Leon', 'rise', 'questions', 'viability', 'new', 'maths', 'Producers', 'consumers', 'meat', 'eggs', 'globe', 'director', 'Madrid', 'Writing', 'Editing']",2022-03-18,2022-03-19,fxempire.com

It added it is considering a listing on the London Stock Exchange in due course.While METR is first to market  it will be interesting to see if METV’s lower fee  recognised name and subsequent listings will allow it to claw back ground over the coming months.SFDR is key tool for evaluating ESGEarlier this week  Brown Brothers Harriman published its annual survey of investor views on the ETF landscape including how they apply ESG metrics in their allocations.Interestingly  the survey found 28% of European investors rely of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR) article classifications when evaluating which ESG ETFs  more than any other tool.Additionally  47% of investors in Europe said they select ETFs classified under the ‘lighter green’ Article 8 of SFDR while 27% select products under the ‘darker green’ Article 9.The influence SFDR has had in its first year since coming into effect highlights how much investors value having a recognised authority when gauging the ESG credentials of a fund. How SFDR is used will also change as phase two of the regulation is implemented next year.Holdings in gold ETFs at one-year highAfter facing difficulty during the pandemic recovery phase of 2021  gold exchange-traded commodities (ETCs) have staged a heroic comeback amid 2022’s inflationary and geopolitics-based market volatility.Highlighting this  four gold ETCs collectively saw in excess of $3.2bn inflows in the week to 14 March alone  taking holdings in gold ETFs to a one-year high  according to Saxo Bank.Despite a correction in oil causing a 7% decline in the price of gold in one week  investors continue to rotate into the precious metal as the Russia-Ukraine situation remains uncertain  Chinese equities continue to display volatility and some anticipate as many as seven rates hikes by the Federal Reserve this year.ETF Wrap is a new  weekly digest of the top stories on ETF StreamRelated articles,negative,0.04,0.38,0.58,mixed,0.21,0.28,0.51,True,English,"['ETF Wrap', 'Issuers', 'metaverse', 'ETC Group Global Metaverse UCITS ETF', '$710m Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF', 'Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation', 'London Stock Exchange', 'total expense ratio', 'Brown Brothers Harriman', 'seven rates hikes', 'new, weekly digest', 'Stream Related articles', 'largest metaverse ETF', 'thematic ETF space', 'gold exchange-traded commodities', 'recent BBH survey', 'pandemic recovery phase', 'white-label ETF issuer', 'four gold ETCs', 'European METV product', 'geopolitics-based market volatility', 'SFDR) article classifications', 'metaverse space', 'ETF Wrap', 'ETF landscape', 'Metaverse ETFs', 'Roundhill investments', 'European version', 'gold ETFs', 'dramatic development', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'due course', 'recognised name', 'subsequent listings', 'coming months', 'key tool', 'annual survey', 'investor views', 'other tool', 'lighter green', 'darker green', 'recognised authority', 'one-year high', 'heroic comeback', '$3.2bn inflows', 'Saxo Bank', 'precious metal', 'Russia-Ukraine situation', 'Chinese equities', 'Federal Reserve', 'top stories', 'ESG metrics', 'ESG credentials', 'next week', 'one week', 'ESG ETFs', 'European investors', 'SFDR adoption', 'lower fee', 'first year', 'Issuers', 'headlines', 'couple', 'years', 'firsts', '10 March', 'HANetf', 'world', 'question', 'ground', 'allocations', 'products', 'influence', 'effect', 'fund', 'Holdings', 'difficulty', 'inflationary', 'excess', '14 March', 'correction', 'oil', '7% decline', 'price', 'many', '2022']",2022-03-18,2022-03-19,etfstream.com

Today marks a major milestone for EUROAPI  a leading European company dedicated to the development  production and marketing of active pharmaceutical ingredients* (API)  as Sanofi’s Board of Directors unanimously proposed  on March 17th  to submit to its shareholders the distribution of circa 58% of the share capital of EUROAPI. In addition to the previously proposed €3.33 cash dividend per Sanofi share  this additional extraordinary dividend  exclusively in kind  is subject to shareholders approvalat Sanofi’s May 3  2022 Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting. If approved  the distribution will take place shortly after the listing of EUROAPI’s shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris  subject to the approval of the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) on EUROAPI’s French prospectus  which will be made available to the public ahead of Sanofi’s Shareholders’ Meeting. Through this transaction  Sanofi is giving its shareholders the opportunity to take part in the success of a leading player in the API market with strong ambitions to become a global champion on a growing and dynamic market  and due to be listed on the regulated market of Euronext Paris.In connection with the proposed spin-off  French Tech Souveraineté has agreed to purchase12% in EUROAPI shares from Sanofi for up to €150 million  with the acquisition price to be determined based upon the thirty day volume weighted average trading price (“VWAP”) of EUROAPI’s shares on Euronext Paris  starting on the first day of trading. As a result  French Tech Souveraineté will become a long-term reference shareholder of EUROAPI and will be represented by two non-executive members on EUROAPI's Board of Directors  including Benjamin Paternot and another member to be determined. French Tech Souveraineté’s investment is subject to approval of the spin-off by Sanofi’s shareholders and other customary conditions.Story continuesPost transaction  Sanofi confirms that it will hold circa 30% of the share capital and voting rights of EUROAPI and will remain a long-term strategic partner  supporting EUROAPI’s growth ambitions as an independent company over the coming years. In addition to its highly diversified customer base of approximately 530 customers  EUROAPI benefits from a strong and long-term customer relationship with Sanofi  which represented nearly half of EUROAPI’s revenues in 2021.In line with its “Play to Win” strategy aiming at simplifying its operations  Sanofi announced in February 2020 its ambition to create a new world leader in APIs to secure significant manufacturing and supply capacities that are critical for patients in Europe and beyond  in a context of increasing shortage of medicines essential to patient care. In 2021  Sanofi announced several critical steps in this journey with the unveiling of the creation of EUROAPI and the appointment of Karl Rotthier as its CEO in January  the appointment of Viviane Monges as Chair of the Supervisory Board in July and the finalization of the carve-out in December 2021.Despite volatile market conditions  Sanofi has decided to move forward with the listing process of EUROAPI. As an independent stand-alone company  EUROAPI will be able to fully unlock its growth potential  offering the best alignment of strategy  value creation and financial objectives for all of Sanofi’s shareholders.With a diversified technology portfolio  EUROAPI is positioned as the world's leading manufacturer of small molecule API (including complex chemical synthesis molecules  biochemical molecules from fermentation and highly potent molecules). It was the world's second largest manufacturer of APIs (including both small and large molecules such as peptides and oligonucleotides) in 2021 and number seven in the global CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) market in 20201.EUROAPI develops  manufactures  markets and distributes APIs and intermediates used in the formulation of medicines for human and veterinary use  both from originators and generics  through its API Solutions business and CDMO activities.Drawing on more than 150 years of experience in the growing API market  EUROAPI has a network of six production sites  all of which are located in Europe  and delivers around 200 APIs to approximately 530 customers in over 80 countries. The company will be able to rely on the expertise of around 3 350 employees and expects to achieve consolidated sales of around EUR 1 billion in the year ending December 31  2022.Further details regarding the specifics of the distribution  including the parity  and the timetable of the spin-off will be set forth in EUROAPI’s French prospectus.Following the AMF’s approval of EUROAPI’s French prospectus  Sanofi and EUROAPI’s management teams will host a dedicated Capital Markets Day on April 1  2022 at 1:30 pm CET to present EUROAPI’s business in greater detail (event registration details are available here).*About Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs)Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are the chemical or biological substances in a medicine that have a therapeutic effect.

Cows stick their heads out of a pen to eat feed at the Cirio Agricola farm in Piana di Monte Verna  Italy  March 16  2022.Ukraine is a major global supplier of animal feed  stocks of which are falling fast across import-reliant southern EuropeROME  Italy – Carlo Vittorio Ferrari  who runs a farm holding 2 000 pigs with his brother near the town of Cremona in northern Italy  fears his fourth-generation family business could be lost due to conflict in Ukraine.The country is a major global supplier of animal feed  stocks of which are falling fast across import-reliant southern Europe.With Hungary  Serbia  and Moldova also banning exports as they safeguard their own supplies  costs for farms like Ferrari’s have spiked  threatening their future. Many face culling animals if the situation doesn’t improve quickly.“This is a family business. My grandfather kept it going during two wars  my dad saw one  but I don’t know if we’ll get through this one ” Ferrari said.Italy has called for European Union rules limiting state aid to the sector to be waived  while Spain has taken steps to allow emergency purchases of corn from Argentina and Brazil.“I hear growing reports of farmers slaughtering their animals  but I want to avoid that ” said Elisabetta Quaini  who keeps 1 300 cows for beef and milk production on her farm in Lombardy  northern Italy. “I’m determined to keep going  but I am very worried.”“It’s not just corn  it’s also soya and numerous by-products that are hard to find. There is a tremendous fight to get hold of what is available.”Michele Liverini  vice president of livestock feed producer Mangimi Liverini  said if dairy cows were slaughtered it would take seven to eight years to build up a barn to produce milk again.Ukraine is among the world’s top four corn exporters  and the closure of its ports due to the conflict has had a major impact on shipments.“The problem is that we now have a perfect storm. When the Ukrainian exports stopped  countries like Moldova  Serbia  and Hungary tried to stop exporting as a protectionist step and we found ourselves with a big problem in our ports ” Liverini said.“In Italian ports  where ships from these countries arrive every week  there is only a 25-day supply left.”Large herdsSpain has the largest livestock herd in the European Union with about 58.8 million head  according to the EU data for 2021 covering pigs  cows  sheep  and goats. Italy has the fourth largest with about 22.5 million head.The two countries produce a wide array of internationally renowned farm products  including Mozzarella di Bufala and Prosciutto di Parma in Italy and Jamon Iberico in Spain.Pietro Fusco  chief executive of Cirio Agricola  a milk producer with two farms based near Benevento  southern Italy  said the sector was already stressed after struggling for two years through the COVID-19 pandemic.He said they were considering giving the herd less feed as a first step  but may eventually be forced to slaughter some of the animals to keep the farm going and protect jobs and families.“There is also a problem with transport and therefore the impossibility of having supplies on time ” he said.Maize  or corn  futures on Paris-based Euronext rose to a record 420 euros a ton earlier this month  up about 50% since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Feed stocks have also become depleted in Spain  a major customer of Ukraine.Agustin de Prada  manager of Spain’s ranchers association Asoprovac in Castile and Leon  said the rise in costs had been brutal and raised questions about the viability of farms.“When I sell the animals  will I put new ones in? Well  maybe not  because I can’t  the maths doesn’t work out.”Producers argue that for them to survive  consumers must pay higher prices for products like meat  milk  and eggs  further fueling food inflation  which has become a major problem across the globe since the COVID-19 pandemic began.Emilio Rial  director of the Coren group  a huge farmers’ cooperative in Spain  said the cost of basic food production had jumped 40%.“We will try not to pass it all on to the consumer by negotiating with the big supermarkets  but prices will inevitably rise ” he said. – Rappler.com,negative,0.04,0.25,0.72,negative,0.01,0.11,0.88,True,English,"['South Europe', 'livestock culls', 'Ukraine conflict', 'feed shortage', 'seven to eight years', 'Piana di Monte Verna', 'top four corn exporters', 'Agustin de Prada', 'import-reliant southern Europe', 'major global supplier', 'fourth-generation family business', 'European Union rules', 'huge farmers’ cooperative', 'basic food production', 'Carlo Vittorio Ferrari', 'largest livestock herd', 'livestock feed producer', 'Cirio Agricola farm', 'two years', 'Mozzarella di', 'Prosciutto di', 'food inflation', 'major impact', 'major customer', 'southern Italy', 'animal feed', 'two wars', 'state aid', 'emergency purchases', 'growing reports', 'Elisabetta Quaini', 'milk production', 'numerous by-products', 'tremendous fight', 'vice president', 'perfect storm', 'protectionist step', '25-day supply', 'Large herds', '58.8 million head', 'EU data', '22.5 million head', 'wide array', 'Jamon Iberico', 'Pietro Fusco', 'chief executive', 'milk producer', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'less feed', 'first step', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'record 420 euros', 'ranchers association', 'Emilio Rial', 'Coren group', 'big supermarkets', 'major problem', 'Michele Liverini', 'Mangimi Liverini', 'Ukrainian exports', 'big problem', 'higher prices', 'northern Italy', 'Italian ports', 'two countries', 'two farms', 'Feed stocks', 'dairy cows', 'farm products', '1,300 cows', 'heads', 'pen', 'Ukraine', 'ROME', '2,000 pigs', 'brother', 'town', 'Cremona', 'conflict', 'country', 'Hungary', 'Serbia', 'Moldova', 'supplies', 'costs', 'future', 'Many', 'culling', 'animals', 'situation', 'grandfather', 'dad', 'sector', 'Spain', 'steps', 'Argentina', 'Brazil', 'beef', 'Lombardy', 'soya', 'hold', 'barn', 'world', 'closure', 'shipments', 'ships', 'sheep', 'goats', 'internationally', 'Bufala', 'Parma', 'Benevento', 'jobs', 'families', 'transport', 'impossibility', 'time', 'Maize', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'manager', 'Asoprovac', 'Castile', 'Leon', 'rise', 'questions', 'viability', 'new', 'maths', 'Producers', 'consumers', 'meat', 'eggs', 'globe', 'director', 'Rappler']",2022-03-19,2022-03-19,rappler.com
