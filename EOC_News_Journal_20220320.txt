Cows stick their heads out of a pen to eat feed at the Cirio Agricola farm in Piana di Monte Verna  Italy  March 16  2022.Ukraine is a major global supplier of animal feed  stocks of which are falling fast across import-reliant southern EuropeROME  Italy – Carlo Vittorio Ferrari  who runs a farm holding 2 000 pigs with his brother near the town of Cremona in northern Italy  fears his fourth-generation family business could be lost due to conflict in Ukraine.The country is a major global supplier of animal feed  stocks of which are falling fast across import-reliant southern Europe.With Hungary  Serbia  and Moldova also banning exports as they safeguard their own supplies  costs for farms like Ferrari’s have spiked  threatening their future. Many face culling animals if the situation doesn’t improve quickly.“This is a family business. My grandfather kept it going during two wars  my dad saw one  but I don’t know if we’ll get through this one ” Ferrari said.Italy has called for European Union rules limiting state aid to the sector to be waived  while Spain has taken steps to allow emergency purchases of corn from Argentina and Brazil.“I hear growing reports of farmers slaughtering their animals  but I want to avoid that ” said Elisabetta Quaini  who keeps 1 300 cows for beef and milk production on her farm in Lombardy  northern Italy. “I’m determined to keep going  but I am very worried.”“It’s not just corn  it’s also soya and numerous by-products that are hard to find. There is a tremendous fight to get hold of what is available.”Michele Liverini  vice president of livestock feed producer Mangimi Liverini  said if dairy cows were slaughtered it would take seven to eight years to build up a barn to produce milk again.Ukraine is among the world’s top four corn exporters  and the closure of its ports due to the conflict has had a major impact on shipments.“The problem is that we now have a perfect storm. When the Ukrainian exports stopped  countries like Moldova  Serbia  and Hungary tried to stop exporting as a protectionist step and we found ourselves with a big problem in our ports ” Liverini said.“In Italian ports  where ships from these countries arrive every week  there is only a 25-day supply left.”Large herdsSpain has the largest livestock herd in the European Union with about 58.8 million head  according to the EU data for 2021 covering pigs  cows  sheep  and goats. Italy has the fourth largest with about 22.5 million head.The two countries produce a wide array of internationally renowned farm products  including Mozzarella di Bufala and Prosciutto di Parma in Italy and Jamon Iberico in Spain.Pietro Fusco  chief executive of Cirio Agricola  a milk producer with two farms based near Benevento  southern Italy  said the sector was already stressed after struggling for two years through the COVID-19 pandemic.He said they were considering giving the herd less feed as a first step  but may eventually be forced to slaughter some of the animals to keep the farm going and protect jobs and families.“There is also a problem with transport and therefore the impossibility of having supplies on time ” he said.Maize  or corn  futures on Paris-based Euronext rose to a record 420 euros a ton earlier this month  up about 50% since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Feed stocks have also become depleted in Spain  a major customer of Ukraine.Agustin de Prada  manager of Spain’s ranchers association Asoprovac in Castile and Leon  said the rise in costs had been brutal and raised questions about the viability of farms.“When I sell the animals  will I put new ones in? Well  maybe not  because I can’t  the maths doesn’t work out.”Producers argue that for them to survive  consumers must pay higher prices for products like meat  milk  and eggs  further fueling food inflation  which has become a major problem across the globe since the COVID-19 pandemic began.Emilio Rial  director of the Coren group  a huge farmers’ cooperative in Spain  said the cost of basic food production had jumped 40%.“We will try not to pass it all on to the consumer by negotiating with the big supermarkets  but prices will inevitably rise ” he said. – Rappler.com,negative,0.04,0.25,0.72,negative,0.01,0.11,0.88,True,English,"['South Europe', 'livestock culls', 'Ukraine conflict', 'feed shortage', 'seven to eight years', 'Piana di Monte Verna', 'top four corn exporters', 'Agustin de Prada', 'import-reliant southern Europe', 'major global supplier', 'fourth-generation family business', 'European Union rules', 'huge farmers’ cooperative', 'basic food production', 'Carlo Vittorio Ferrari', 'largest livestock herd', 'livestock feed producer', 'Cirio Agricola farm', 'two years', 'Mozzarella di', 'Prosciutto di', 'food inflation', 'major impact', 'major customer', 'southern Italy', 'animal feed', 'two wars', 'state aid', 'emergency purchases', 'growing reports', 'Elisabetta Quaini', 'milk production', 'numerous by-products', 'tremendous fight', 'vice president', 'perfect storm', 'protectionist step', '25-day supply', 'Large herds', '58.8 million head', 'EU data', '22.5 million head', 'wide array', 'Jamon Iberico', 'Pietro Fusco', 'chief executive', 'milk producer', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'less feed', 'first step', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'record 420 euros', 'ranchers association', 'Emilio Rial', 'Coren group', 'big supermarkets', 'major problem', 'Michele Liverini', 'Mangimi Liverini', 'Ukrainian exports', 'big problem', 'higher prices', 'northern Italy', 'Italian ports', 'two countries', 'two farms', 'Feed stocks', 'dairy cows', 'farm products', '1,300 cows', 'heads', 'pen', 'Ukraine', 'ROME', '2,000 pigs', 'brother', 'town', 'Cremona', 'conflict', 'country', 'Hungary', 'Serbia', 'Moldova', 'supplies', 'costs', 'future', 'Many', 'culling', 'animals', 'situation', 'grandfather', 'dad', 'sector', 'Spain', 'steps', 'Argentina', 'Brazil', 'beef', 'Lombardy', 'soya', 'hold', 'barn', 'world', 'closure', 'shipments', 'ships', 'sheep', 'goats', 'internationally', 'Bufala', 'Parma', 'Benevento', 'jobs', 'families', 'transport', 'impossibility', 'time', 'Maize', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'manager', 'Asoprovac', 'Castile', 'Leon', 'rise', 'questions', 'viability', 'new', 'maths', 'Producers', 'consumers', 'meat', 'eggs', 'globe', 'director', 'Rappler']",2022-03-19,2022-03-20,rappler.com

The two underdogs both racked up three wins and a draw to finish unbeaten on 10/12 points. World Champion Magnus Carlsen  meanwhile  ended on a sour note with a loss to the Chinese No.1 Ding Liren.The Norwegian suffered yet another slow start to a Meltwater Champions Chess Tour event as he closed on 7/12 and way down in sixth on the Prelim stage leaderboard. Carlsen had begun the Charity Cup supported by NEAR Foundation in solid form with a draw against the Pole Jan-Krzysztof Duda and then a win over Indian star Pentala Harikrishna.Carlsen then won again in Round 3 against Eric Hansen - but only after the Canadian streamer made a one-move endgame mistake in time trouble. The World Champion then spoiled his day with a Round 4 hiccup against Ding. Just like the start of the last event  the Airthings Masters  Carlsen has left himself work to do.Meanwhile  18-year-old Niemann - the third-lowest ranked player in the event - was overjoyed with his performance.Sporting a new shaven haircut  the world No.123 said: ""With the experience from the first [event]  I really didn't feel any nerves at all.""He added: ""When I'm relaxed  good things happen.""Next up for Niemann  it's Carlsen in Round 5 tomorrow. The world No.1 will be looking to get moving quickly against his young opponent.As the games were going on  the event was raising money for UNICEF to help its humanitarian work in and around Ukraine. By the end of play  more than $17 000 had been donated including $1 100 from Grandmaster and Tour commentator David Howell auctioning off his ""lucky"" chess tie.Tour commentator Jovanka Houska thanked viewers for contributing the cause.She said: ""It's a wonderful thing to show we are part of a chess community and to help a country that is in need.""My heart goes out to every single one of you who donated and I hope we can raise even more in the next few days.""The Prelim stage ends at Round 15 on Monday.

Factoring in its capacity for innovation and the maturity of its technologies and markets  Parrot has assessed the potential of its assets and chosen to focus its resources on quadricopter microdrones and image metrics and analytics software.Within this framework  two divestment operations were carried out in 2021  aimed specifically at further strengthening the Group’s financing capacity and reducing its operating expenditure. They generated a €32.0m capital gain on disposals in the 2021 consolidated accounts. The subsidiary Micasense (sensors) was sold in January and did not contribute to 2021 revenues  while the subsidiaries SenseFly SA and SenseFly Inc (fixed-wing drones) were divested in October and contributed to revenues until October 19  2021.The changes in scope resulting from these divestments account for the contraction in consolidated revenues to €54.3m in 2021  compared with €57.3m at end-2020. The subsidiaries divested generated €7.7m of revenues (excluding intragroup billing) in 2021  compared with €16.1m in 2020.Based on the new reference scope from 2022  i.e. excluding sales from the companies divested and end-of-life consumer products  the Group’s revenues for 2021 came to around €40.4m  with year-on-year growth of +17% (+19% at constant exchange rates).In 2021  the Group benefited from growth in its offering  realigned around professional drone technologies. On the one hand  the expansion of the range of solutions  launched in 2020 in the inspection  civil security and precision farming fields  initially focused on mapping and geomatics  paved the way for Pix4D to record revenues of €26.2m  up 12% (+15% at constant exchange rates). On the other hand  the ramping up of sales of professional microdrones  and particularly the ANAFI USA  enabled Parrot Drones* to achieve revenues of €20.9m  up 12% (+13% at constant exchange rates). This performance was offset by the finalization of the sales of legacy consumer products (-€0.4m) in the third quarter of 2021  and the non-recurrence of funded R&D projects (-€2.4m).In the fourth quarter  still based on the new reference scope  Group revenues came to approximately €15.7m  up +48% (+44% at constant exchange rates)  thanks in particular to the start of ANAFI USA deliveries for the French armed forces and the robust commercial trend for Pix4D software solutions at the end of the year. The consolidated and restated information is presented below  while an identical table for the fourth quarter is appended.Revenues (€m) 2020 2021 Change A Parrot Drones 18.7 33% 20.9 38% +12% B Of which  consumer products(2) 6.6 12% 6.2 11% -6% C Pix4D 23.3 41% 26.2 48% +12% D Parrot SA 0.3 0% 0.3 1% 0% E Intragroup eliminations -1.1 -2% -0.8 -2% -25% F SenseFly (activity divested in October 2021) 10.8 19% 7.7 14% -28% G MicaSense (activity divested in January 2021) 5.3 9% 0.0 0% -100% CONSOLIDATED PARROT GROUP TOTAL 57.3 100% 54.3 100% -5% NEW SCOPE TOTAL(1) (=A-B+C+D+E) 34.6 60% 40.4 74% +17%(1) “New scope total” is a performance indicator reflecting the impacts of the strategy rolled out since the end of 2018. It corresponds to the Parrot Group’s consolidated revenues less revenues from consumer products (cf. 2) and revenues from the subsidiaries divested. Note that intragroup eliminations are not reallocated and therefore include a relatively insignificant amount of sales from the subsidiaries divested.(2) Consumer products: consumer drones (all ranges)   legacy automotive products (car kit  plug & play) and connected devices.2021 earnings(1)Condensed consolidated accounts – IFRS (€m) 2020 2021 Change Consolidated revenues 57.3 54.3 -5% Gross margin 40.2 39.1 –3% % of revenues 70.2% 72.0% Research and development costs -40.2 -40.2 -0% Sales and marketing costs -16.3 -14.0 -14% Administrative costs and overheads -13.6 -13.6 – Production and industrialization costs -6.1 -5.4 -12% Income from ordinary operations -36.0 -34.2 +5% % of revenues -62.9% -62.9% Other operating income and expenses 0.5 30.4 – EBIT -35.6 -3.7 – % of revenues -62.1% -6.9% Net income (Group share) -38.4 -1.9 – % of revenues -67.0% -3.6%(1) Micasense is no longer consolidated since January 1  2021  while SenseFly is consolidated until October 19  2021.In 2021  the Parrot Group continued to strengthen its product mix  focusing on professional drones and solutions  with a gross margin of 72.0%  up 1.8pts from 2020  despite the completion of the stock clearance process for consumer drones in the third quarter of 2021.In 2021  the Parrot Group’s consolidated operating expenditure totaled €73.2m  compared with €76.2m in 2020. The subsidiaries divested represent around €9.1m of operating costs in 2021 and €13.6m in 2020. The additional capacity freed up in this way will make it possible to increase the resources allocated to professional drones and solutions  supporting their capacity for developing new uses and attracting new clients. The expenditure figures for 2021 also take into account the non-recurrence of the support measures linked to the health crisis (€0.4m in 2021  versus €2.4m in 2020).More specifically  the resources allocated to R&D (€40.2m) paved the way for the successful launch of the new professional drone ANAFI Ai  while helping drive the development of software solutions for new activities. Sales and marketing spending came to €14.0m (-14%)  benefiting from the optimization measures made possible by the realignment around professional drones. The range’s realignment is also reflected in the reduction in production spending to €5.4m (-12%). Overheads are stable at €13.6m. At end-2021  the Group’s workforce (permanent and fixed-term contracts) represented 448 people (521 at December 31  2020)  in addition to 49 external contractors (42 at December 31  2020)  with a reduction linked to the transfer of 111 people.Thanks primarily to the sale of Micasense during the first quarter and SenseFly in the fourth quarter  the Group recorded €30.4m of non-current operating income  taking EBIT for 2021 to -€3.7m. After €1.5m of financial income and expenses and a €0.4m share of income from associates  consolidated net income (Group share) totaled -€1.9m  compared with-€38.4m for 2020.Changes in the cash position and balance sheet in 2021The Group had €82.0m of net cash at end-December 2021 excluding the impact of IFRS 16  and €72.6m including IFRS 16. Cash and cash equivalents came to €82.8m  with €5.1m consumption versus 2020.Cash flow from operations totaled -€31.2m  corresponding to the loss for income from ordinary operations  primarily adjusted for the IFRS 16 restatement of lease charges (+€2.7m). Factoring in the change in working capital requirements  cash from operating activities totaled -€25.3m.The change in working capital requirements reflects the following developments: (i) a -€3.2m impact for the change in trade and other receivables; (ii) a +€5.1m change in trade and other payables; (iii) a +€4.4m change in inventories  notably linked to the clearance of stock of older generations of consumer drones.Cash flow from investment activities came to +€23.0m  linked primarily to the €24.0m payment from the disposal of SenseFly and Micasense  less investments of €1.6m in equipment  particularly for ANAFI Ai production.Cash flow from financing activities came to -€4.1m  including €3.4m for the repayment of lease liabilities with the application of IFRS 16.Since the 2021 year-endIn February 2022  the Group carried out a CHF 10m capital increase for its subsidiary Pix4D  with CHF 8m invested by Parrot and CHF 2m invested by Pix4D’s founder-manager and minority shareholder. This investment aims to increase the resources available for technological developments  looking in particular to expand the analytical capabilities of the software developed by Pix4D to benefit other equipment  dovetailing effectively with the drones.The Group has launched sales of the ANAFI Ai  a 4G-connected microdrone designed to overcome the limitations of wifi  with autopilot features developed on a fully open source platform  making it easier to customize its missions  presented at the end of June 2021. ANAFI Ai is currently available at a price starting from €4 000 (ex VAT) and includes a range of advanced photogrammetry features based on the integration of Pix4D solutions.Outlook for 2022Realigned  streamlined and driven by its professional solutions at the forefront of innovation  Parrot is looking ahead to 2022 with confidence in its strategy and vigilance concerning the changes in the international environment.The Group is continuing to allocate its resources to an ambitious R&D roadmap. Supported by its progress in the field of artificial intelligence and the growing integration between hardware and software  Parrot aims to continue facilitating the adoption of drone technologies and offer new use cases that are aligned with the needs of professionals  businesses and institutions  focused on (i) 3D Mapping  Geomatics and Inspection  (ii) Defense and Security  and (iii) Precision Farming.To secure its production capacity over the medium and long term  and respond to the growing interest in its microdrones at the start of this year  Parrot is further strengthening the synergies between R&D  procurement and production management. The increase in the resources allocated to these operations will be combined with an agile sourcing management. These strategic initiatives could limit the reduction in costs in 2022  and their effectiveness are still strongly correlated to the health context in China  where the situation is deteriorating at the start of this year.Looking beyond the disruption linked to the economic and geopolitical environment  which is difficult to predict  the Group plans to move forward with its revenue growth trajectory on its “new scope” and capitalize on the opportunities opened up by the growing adoption of drone technologies in businesses and the public sector. The Group will continue to closely monitor the allocation of its cash  and will be ready to respond and adapt to potential changes in the conditions.Next financial dates2022 first-quarter business: Thursday May 12  2022Parrot’s general shareholders’ meeting: Wednesday June 15  20222022 first-half earnings: Thursday July 28  2022ABOUT PARROTFounded in 1994 by Henri Seydoux  Parrot is today the leading European drone manufacturer in this rapidly expanding market.Visionary  at the forefront of innovation Parrot has a complementary range of equipment and software adapted to the needs of companies  large groups and government organizations.
