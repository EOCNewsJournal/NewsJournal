1174,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-sends-66-million-coupon-091316562.html,Russia‚Äôs $66 Million Coupon Moves a Step Closer to Bondholders,(Bloomberg) -- Foreign holders of Russia‚Äôs sovereign bond maturing in 2029 are watching as the latest debt payment from the sanctioned nation draws closer to...,(Bloomberg) -- Foreign holders of Russia‚Äôs sovereign bond maturing in 2029 are watching as the latest debt payment from the sanctioned nation draws closer to completion.Most Read from BloombergThe $66 million coupon due March 21 was processed Tuesday by Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository  it said in a statement. Earlier in the day  the Finance Ministry said it had transferred the cash to the NSD  thus meeting its obligations ‚Äúin full.‚Äù Four bondholders in Europe said they hadn‚Äôt received the payment as of 3.40 p.m. in London.From this point  the cash would typically journey to custodian banks  which hold assets for safekeeping  then to bondholders‚Äô accounts. But given the sweeping sanctions in place against Russia following President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine  concerns will remain until the money actually lands in investors‚Äô accounts.Billions of dollars of Russian government and company debt have been put in question after as much as two thirds of the country‚Äôs foreign currency reserves were frozen  as well as the overseas assets of numerous billionaires. Russia has at least $400 million of interest payments coming due over the next 10 weeks  as well as a $2 billion bond it must repay next month  data compiled by Bloomberg show. Last week  the government paid $117 million in coupon payments.‚ÄúUsing up their very finite foreign-currency reserves could be a good long term investment -- but that thinking clearly hasn‚Äôt been applied to the management of their reputation anywhere else ‚Äù said Gordon Shannon  a portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management.Financial PlumbingUnlike the terms of the bonds with coupon payments last week  the March 2029 prospectus has a ruble-fallback option  which allows Russia to make the transfer in its local currency. That‚Äôs raised questions about the ultimate denomination of the payment and prompted investors to track it from the start.Story continuesREAD MORE: Inside Russia‚Äôs 96-Hour Cliffhanger to Sidestep Bond DefaultRussia sent the cash to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  which processed the payment after getting approvals from the U.S. Treasury Department  according to a person familiar with the matter  confirming a Reuters report earlier. Unlike the payment of the previous week  this bond‚Äôs prospectus states that the coupon settlement would be done through Russia‚Äôs central securities depository and Euroclear  one of the world‚Äôs biggest clearing houses. JPMorgan declined to comment earlier.It‚Äôs not a process investors typically follow. The back-office moves took center stage after sanctions and capital controls were imposed on Russia  and investors braced for a default. For now  the process is working  and not just for the sovereign.Credit Bank of Moscow  a lender the Russian central bank has designated systemically important  said it fulfilled an obligation to make a $9.7 million coupon payment on its $500 million September 2026 bond. Two bondholders  who declined to be named as they aren‚Äôt authorized to speak publicly about the matter  said they had received payment.Online lender Tinkoff Bank also paid its debt interest on time on its perpetual dollar-denominated notes. Multiple bondholders confirmed they had received a $6.94 million coupon due March 15  and a $9 million coupon due March 20.Corporates and the sovereign have shown willingness to meet their financial obligations -- a relief to investors who thought they wouldn‚Äôt see their cash after a presidential decree earlier in the month said some investors could be paid in rubles.The government is ‚Äúpaying because they have significant western assets that creditors would lay a claim on if they go to bankruptcy ‚Äù said Phillip Torres  a senior portfolio manager of emerging market debt at Aegon Asset Management in Chicago. ‚ÄúThey are going to pay as long as they are able to. There is a real cost in going to bankruptcy that they would want to avoid.‚Äù(Updates with details throughout)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek¬©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.1,0.16,0.73,True,English,"['$66 Million Coupon', 'Russia', 'Step', 'Bondholders', 'good long term investment', 'U.S. Treasury Department', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'finite foreign-currency reserves', 'central securities depository', 'biggest clearing houses', 'perpetual dollar-denominated notes', 'National Settlement Depository', 'emerging market debt', 'TwentyFour Asset Management', 'Aegon Asset Management', 'foreign currency reserves', 'significant western assets', 'senior portfolio manager', 'Russian central bank', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', '$500 million September 2026 bond', 'Sidestep Bond Default', 'latest debt payment', '$9.7 million coupon payment', 'coupon settlement', '$66 million coupon', '$6.94 million coupon', '$9 million coupon', 'Foreign holders', 'company debt', 'local currency', 'debt interest', 'Credit Bank', 'Tinkoff Bank', '$2 billion bond', 'coupon payments', 'Finance Ministry', 'Four bondholders', 'custodian banks', 'bondholders‚Äô accounts', 'two thirds', 'overseas assets', 'numerous billionaires', 'interest payments', 'next 10 weeks', 'Gordon Shannon', 'Financial Plumbing', 'ruble-fallback option', 'ultimate denomination', '96-Hour Cliffhanger', 'Reuters report', 'previous week', 'back-office moves', 'center stage', 'capital controls', 'Two bondholders', 'Multiple bondholders', 'presidential decree', 'Phillip Torres', 'real cost', 'Russian government', 'Bloomberg show', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'sovereign bond', 'sweeping sanctions', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'Online lender', 'financial obligations', 'investors‚Äô accounts', 'March 2029 prospectus', 'completion', 'statement', 'day', 'cash', 'NSD', 'Europe', 'London', 'point', 'safekeeping', 'place', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'concerns', 'money', 'Billions', 'dollars', 'question', 'country', 'data', 'thinking', 'reputation', 'terms', 'bonds', 'transfer', 'start', 'Story', 'Co.', 'approvals', 'person', 'matter', 'Euroclear', 'world', 'process', 'Moscow', 'time', 'Corporates', 'willingness', 'relief', 'month', 'rubles', 'creditors', 'claim', 'bankruptcy', 'Chicago', 'Updates', 'details', '3.40']",2022-03-22,2022-03-23,finance.yahoo.com
1176,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4497032-profit-with-xrp-token-from-ripple,Ripple: Buy The SEC Uncertainty  Sell The Settlement News (XPR-USD),Investors can buy now and sell when Ripple has settled or won the SEC's lawsuit alleging the illegal sale of unregistered securities. See more on XPR-USD here.,"gopixa/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesRipple's (XRP-USD) XRP token represents a classic opportunity to buy during the market headwinds from the SEC lawsuit and sell on news of a settlement or outright legal victory. Despite hyped claims about the coin's future use for central banking  my research shows no reason to hold XRP for the long term.Ripple and XRP BackgroundRipple Labs is a U.S.-based technology company that develops the Ripple payment protocol and exchange network. About 10 years ago  it also created its own digital currency called XRP to enable money transfers over the internet. Then CEO Chris Larsen said at the time  ""We think this is the first viable alternative to correspondent banking.""According to the company:Ripple provides one frictionless experience to send money globally using the power of blockchain technology. By joining Ripple's growing  global network RippleNet  financial institutions can process their customers' payments anywhere in the world instantly  reliably and cost-effectively. Banks and payment providers can use the digital asset XRP to further reduce their costs and access new markets.Ripple is a privately funded company with many well-known angel investors  including Andreessen Horowitz  Lightspeed Venture Partners  Google Ventures  and IDG Capital Partners. It's important to understand that these companies have invested in Ripple the company  not necessarily XRP the token.Revenue comes from professional services provided to financial network operators  software built to integrate legacy financial systems with Ripple  and by regular sales of the XRP token. In December 2020  the SEC sued Ripple and executives Brad Garlinghouse (the CEO) and Chris Larsen (executive chairman of Ripple's board of directors and former CEO and co-founder of Ripple) for alleged illegal sales of unregistered securities related to the XRP token. Ripple has an immense financial war chest to fund their legal defense and is giving the SEC all it can handle in the ongoing back and forth battle.Of course  the SEC suit overhang has taken a toll on the price of the XRP token. But with any minor Ripple court victory  we see signs of relief.Examining the case to hold XRP long termTwitter is often not the place to find rational  evenhanded posts on any subject. But XRP Twitter inhabits a class of its own. The swarm of Ripple devotees is called the ""#XRPArmy"" and they are quick to defend the company and promote the token. Many claims are amazingly outlandish: ""XRP All The Monye"" makes the assumption that the token will become the standard for all finance in the future. But is there any supporting evidence for this?At the time of writing  XRP's price is around $0.77. One investment firm's managing director has said (with a straight face) that $10 000 to $35 000 a coin is possible because all central banks will use XRP as a bridge currency. But will they?There are four common misunderstandings about Ripple and XRP that cloud understanding of the token's adoption in the real world. We need to carefully scrutinize any announcements of institutions or central banks employing these products. Can we really infer XRP use in these cases?The first error is that RippleNet guarantees XRP use. Most announcements of Ripple deals are referring to the RippleNet global payment network. RippleNet is an established product that enables 200+ financial institutions worldwide to make faster  lower-cost payments across 40 countries. However  RippleNet does not automatically use XRP; that requires implementation of another dedicated product called ODL. As per Ripple:Through the On-Demand Liquidity (ODL) service  RippleNet leverages the digital asset XRP as a bridge between two currencies  allowing you to eliminate pre-funding of destination accounts  reduce operational costs and unlock capital.Ripple hopes that RippleNet will be a Trojan Horse for ODL and XRP adoption  but I've found little evidence of this happening. Conversely  there are strong reasons banks would not adopt XRP. First  utilizing an instrument in the U.S. government's regulatory crosshairs would be an ill-advised strategy. Also  since XRP is a public and transparent blockchain  financial organizations would be sensitive about broadcasting their transactions. Finally  most institutions would avoid committing themselves to a public market asset with a history of wild price swings driven by retail investors.The next fallacy is that any mention of R3 implies XRP usage. R3 Corda is perhaps the most popular tech partner for central bank digital currency (CBDC) trials  and has been tested by Riksbank (the central bank of Sweden)  Banque de France  the Swiss National Bank  the BIS Innovation Hub  the Reserve Bank of Australia  Bank Negara Malaysia  the Monetary Authority of Singapore  and the South African Reserve Bank. Their Token SDK Toolkit  which allows free and private transactions with the ability to prevent fraud  is much better suited for banking projects. R3‚Ä≤s platform was also chosen by the SWIFT Network over Ripple for its new payments standards framework Global Payments Innovation.R3 once had a partnership with Ripple  and integrated XRP into their Settler product  but had a major falling out over the terms of the agreement. Although the partnership has dissolved  many still conflate Corda implementations with XRP use  which is just not warranted.As per Todd McDonald  chief product officer and one of the R3 Founders:Corda Settler does not require the use of XRP... XRP happened to be the first sample integration... The SWIFT work is not in any way associated with XRP.Another misconception is that since Ripple is an ISO 20022 participant therefore every ISO 20022 project must use XRP. ISO 20022 is a multipart international standard prepared by ISO Technical Committee TC68 Financial Services. It describes a common platform for the development of messages. In essence  this is a standard way for disparate systems to integrate and produce more efficient financial transactions. Every major financial institution has adopted ISO 20022 in principle and is quickly moving toward implementation. The SWIFT Network itself is slated to switch to the protocol starting in November 2022.ISO 20022 has many member entities  including RippleNet. But it makes no sense to assume RippleNet is involved with every ISO 20022 implementation  or to believe XRP usage must be implied.Finally  there's the erroneous notion that Interledger also implies XRP use. Interledger is not a blockchain  a token  or a central service. Interledger is a standard way of bridging financial systems. Interledger is a protocol for sending packets of money across different payment networks or ledgers. One of the stated design goals for the protocol is neutrality. Therefore  it is not tied to any company  currency  or network. XRP is supported - just like many other coins and currencies - but is not required by the protocol for operation.Here are examples of supposed proof of real-world XRP use that fail under further scrutiny:This World Economic Forum document mentions XRP on page 17. But this is simply a list of examples  not an endorsement. SWIFT GPI and JPM Coin are also cited in the same paragraph. Published long before the SEC suit  one wonders if XRP would have still been considered a credible example if the WEF wrote this today.Banque de France did list both Ripple and Ethereum (along with other options) in their 2020 research paper  but later clarified the participants as Accenture (ACN)  Euroclear  HSBC (HSBC)  fund management platform Iznes  Liquidshare  ProsperUS  Seba Bank  and Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale (SocGen) (OTCPK:SCGLF) Forge.This blockchain deal announcement with the Saudi Arabia Central Bank and Ripple initially looked promising  but was later revealed to be a ""nothingburger."" For the subsequent Project Aber CBDC pilot  XRP was totally ruled out:Note that public blockchain protocols such as Ripple and Stellar  which are often positioned for cross-border remittance use cases  were ruled out because of the obvious need for permissioning and privacy for an interbank payment use case (which these protocols didn't support). Application of the qualification criteria resulted in shortlisting of the following three DLT platforms or protocols: R3 Corda  Hyperledger Fabric (HLF)  JPMC Quorum.This finding underscores how CBDC pilots have rejected public blockchains and instead substituted private tech like R3 Corda.Did the Royal Bank of Canada (RY) consider Ripple's tech for payment? Maybe  but there's no evidence that Canada actually ever used Ripple or XRP. In their 2019 Project Jasper-Ubin  a cross-border (Canada and Singapore) and cross-currency (CAD and SGD) trial  Corda and Quorum were used for atomic transactions based on HTLC. This is another example of Corda's popularity in the CBDC space.Did the Bank of England use XRP in a proof of concept? The devil is in the details here. The BoE did do a proof of concept with Ripple in 2017. From the project summary document:The Ripple solution utilized by the Bank was built around the open source Interledger Protocol that enables payments to be made across different ledgers and networks across the world. A ledger is essentially a file used to record transactions measured in terms of a monetary unit of account. The solution used Ripple Connect  which acted as the interface that enables an institution's internal systems to integrate with the Ripple network.Ripple Connect was the old name for a product that (as far as I can determine) did not use XRP. But either way  there's no evidence of any current usage of XRP by the Bank of England since that proof of concept ended.However  this Palau announcement is recent and real. From the Ripple press release:The partnership will initially focus on developing strategies for cross-border payments and a USD-backed digital currency for Palau. This could see the implementation of the world's first government-backed national stablecoin in the first half of 2022 for which Ripple would provide Palau with technical  business  design and policy support. Meanwhile  exploring a USD-backed stablecoin and associated use cases-such as a corporate registry-on the XRP Ledger could provide a viable alternative to central bank digital currencies (CBDCs) for countries like Palau. 'As part of our commitment to lead in financial innovation and technologies  we are delighted to partner with Ripple ' said President Surangel Whipps Jr. 'The first phase of the partnership will focus on a cross-border payments strategy and exploring options to create a national digital currency  providing the citizens of Palau with greater financial access.'I'll be tracking any the next phases of this project closely. Will Palau actually deploy the XRP Ledger?The second verified project and the only one I've found that plans the use of Ripple's CBDC Private Ledger is with the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan. From the announcement:Ripple  the leading provider of enterprise blockchain and crypto solutions for cross-border payments  today announced a collaboration with Bhutan's central bank  the Royal Monetary Authority  to pilot a central bank digital currency CBDC using Ripple's CBDC Private Ledger. 'Our collaboration with Ripple is testament to the potential of CBDCs to provide an alternative and sustainable digital payment instrument in Bhutan ' said Yangchen Tshogyel  deputy governor of the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan. 'Ripple's groundbreaking technology will allow for the experimentation of a CBDC with our existing payments infrastructure-while ensuring efficient and cost-effective cross-border transfers.'Ripple developed the Private Ledger product after it became obvious that public blockchains were totally unsuitable for CBDCs. The product intends to allow the creation of private ledger instances but retain links to the public XRP Ledger. There are open questions about how this linkage will be accomplished and what that means for the circulating supply of XRP.Bhutan is a small nation tucked between China and India that has about 750 000 citizens. I'll be tracking their CBDC progress especially in light of China pushing its own digital currency initiative.The three most influential players are China  the U.S.  and Europe. China is far down the path to launch its digital yuan. The Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and the Digital Currency Initiative at MIT recently released their initial technological research for a U.S. CBDC  with XRP nowhere to be found. Europe's efforts are fractured but zero documented CBDC pilots use XRP.Additionally  I attended (virtually) the BIS Innovation Summit in 2021 and am registered for the 2022 venue. As per BIS  the ""Innovation Summit brings together global policymakers  senior executives from the financial and technology industries  and academics to discuss technology and innovation."" Just like the 2021 summit  there are no presenters or speakers from Ripple in any sessions. The 2021 BIS Hackathon competition yielded three winning companies who presented solutions for synchronizing foreign exchange payments  bridging the last mile of cross-border payments  and resolving data correction and validation difficulties  all without using XRP.This summit represents the leading edge of Fintech activity for the established financial community - those who should be Ripple's target audience. Ripple's complete absence speaks volumes.In summary  despite the small trials with Palau and Bhutan  there's just not enough real-world verification of XRP adoption. CBDC trial projects are typically very well documented  along with specific technologies employed and participating partners. If XRP was being considered for any other trials  we'd know about it.Buy during uncertainty  sell on lawsuit resolution newsDo I see benefits from holding this token long term? No. But in the short to medium term  there is an opportunity. If the SEC suit is resolved either by a settlement or outright victory  there will likely be intense retail action. History shows a distinct and repeated pattern of price increases with any glimmer of good news in the SEC case.For example  in April 2021  Ripple won a legal battle for access to SEC discussions on defining crypto assets as securities. That news coincided with an explosive 75% rally in 30 hours. Then  XRP jumped 13% on May 30  2021  when Ripple stopped the SEC from accessing certain legal records. In October 2021  Judge Sarah Netburn issued a ruling in favor of Ripple Labs  which triggered a 17% rally in XRP's price.Again  we saw XRP quickly gain 30% in early February this year after Ripple got permission to explain the fair notice defense versus the SEC. And  most recently  the price increased 8% on March 11 when the SEC's motion to strike Ripple's fair notice affirmative defense was denied by Judge Analisa Torres.Of course  past performance is no guarantee for the future. But if winning minor legal battles against the SEC can spark significant increases  XRP investors could benefit immensely if Ripple is victorious in the war. Holders must watch for the news and be prepared; based on the examples from the past year  we can probably expect the gains to rapidly peak and then decline.Risks and LogisticsGarlinghouse says Ripple is confident the SEC's case will ultimately be dismissed  and Joseph Hall - a former managing executive for policy at the SEC - believes the regulator has a good chance of losing the lawsuit on the merits of the case. But it's still possible the SEC prevails.If that happens  any premium built into the price from the expectation of victory will immediately be lost. The amount of price decrease could depend on the specific outcome details and whether there's any path for further legal action by Ripple. However  it's doubtful the token would ever go to zero for several reasons.Since the SEC suit was announced  most U.S.-based exchanges have halted XRP trading for fear of selling an unregistered security if the government's position is upheld. But Asian exchanges are minimally influenced by SEC actions  and investors there are less sensitive to U.S. regulatory news. After U.S. exchanges had delisted XRP in early January 2021  data indicates the markets in Asia were the main driver of the price rally that powered a 50% gain. I would expect the Asian base of investors to remain relatively unaffected by a negative court outcome.Moreover  Japan-based financial services company SBI Holdings released a statement shortly after the suit was announced claiming XRP was a cryptocurrency asset under Japanese law  not a security. Disclosure: SBI is by no means a neutral party. They have financial relationships with Ripple  including investments and a joint venture blockchain payments firm called MoneyTap.In preceding crypto cases  the SEC focused on punishing the companies  not individual investors. It's true that Telegram canceled their Telegram Open Network project due to the company's ongoing legal fight with the SEC  but that token had not yet launched.In October 2020  Kik and the SEC settled their year-long legal battle with an agreement that levied a $5 million fine but preserved the token. Block.One paid $24 million after settling charges that it operated an unregistered securities sale with its $4.1 billion EOS raise. Interestingly  the settlement only applied to the original ERC-20 tokens that were swapped by holders for the current EOS token. Thus  that coin was not required to be registered as a security with the SEC and is still trading unrestricted today.Ripple does not have that same token swap option  so what would happen if XRP is deemed a security? Rather than continuing to suffer in the U.S. regulatory environment  Garlinghouse has publicly discussed the possibility of moving the company to a friendlier jurisdiction:The reality is what we'd probably do is just say  'OK  in order to provide certainty and clarity on a going-forward basis we would want to look at other markets and other jurisdictions where there is that clarity.' Earlier in this conversation  I highlighted the UK. I highlighted Japan. I highlighted Singapore.Any remaining U.S.-based exchanges offering XRP at that point might simply delist it rather than jump through the regulatory hoops required to offer a security. Large institutions with broker-dealer licenses might end up being the off-ramp for individual U.S. investors divesting themselves of XRP. However  this is speculation on my part as the process is yet undefined. The bottom line is that even in the scenario of an SEC victory  Ripple has options and the token will still have value outside the U.S.The SEC case has already been active for over a year; is a conclusion in sight? Jeremy Hogan as well as James Filan are good follows on Twitter for news about the proceedings. Hogan recently posted the following:When will Ripple vs. SEC case end? Ripple thinks it will end sometime between Aug. 26 and Nov. 18. In its pending class action  Ripple agreed to move the case start back to Nov. 18 in belief that the SEC case will be finished before then. Of course  it can settle anytime.Ripple court documents reveal their expected timeline for resolution - a window between Aug. 26 and Nov. 18  2022. He also notes that a settlement could end the case at any time  but from Ripple's perspective  regulatory clarity for the token is essential:Garlinghouse has revealed that a settlement is likely to occur on one condition  that the regulator is expected to clearly define the regulatory status of XRP.Garlinghouse states  'To the extent we can find a constructive path forward with the SEC  we  of course  want to find that. There's no scenario  though  that we're going to settle unless there's absolute certainty about what XRP is on a go-forward basis.'Where should you buy XRP? If Ripple prevails  U.S. investors using major exchanges like Coinbase  Binance  and Kraken may be caught flat footed in the middle of a rally waiting while these exchanges scramble to relist XRP.One of the few that still offer XRP right now is Uphold  and I have successfully transacted on the platform. Their daily maximum ACH bank transfer is limited to $2 500 per day  but crypto transfer amounts are much higher. So one strategy is to transfer the value you want to trade in ETH and exchange that directly for XRP. Other exchanges that say they serve U.S. customers and offer XRP are Gate.io  Kucoin  and BitYard. (Note that I have not used these services and make no claims about them.)As always  think for yourself and only invest what you can afford to lose. Especially in the wild world of crypto  there are no guarantees.

The Annual General Meeting elects three members to the Nomination Committee. These shall represent shareholders that at the end of the month preceding the issue of the notice for the Annual General Meeting are the three largest shareholders and who have consented to participate in the work of the Nomination Committee (""Large Shareholders"").

At the end of the year  the net debt/equity ratio was minus 2 per cent  which means that the balance sheet is stronger than Boliden's target of about 20 per cent at economic peaks. The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on an automatic share redemption  which will not jeopardise the ability to handle any deterioration in market terms nor the ability to finance additional growth. Through this  each existing share is split into two shares (share split 2:1)  whereof one of those shares will automatically be redeemed at SEK 15.50. In addition to the proposed ordinary dividend of approximately SEK 2 872 million  approximately SEK 4 239 million will be distributed to the shareholders through this procedure. The dividend and the redemption amount to a total of approximately SEK 7 111 million  or SEK 26.00 per share. To achieve a quick and efficient redemption procedure the Board further proposes that the company's share capital is restored to its current amount by means of a bonus issue. In view hereof  the Board proposes that the meeting resolves in accordance with the following proposal.22 a) share split 2:1The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a share split 2:1  meaning that each existing share is divided into two shares  of which one is to be referred to as redemption share in the Euroclear system and be redeemed in the manner described under item b) below. The suggested record date at Euroclear for the share split is May 12  2022. The last trading day for the company's shares including the right to receive redemption shares will therefore be May 10  2022 and the first trading day for the company's shares excluding the right to receive redemption shares will be May 11  2022. After the share split  the number of shares in the company will increase from 273 511 169 to 547 022 338  each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 1.06.22 b) reduction of the share capital through redemption of sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that the company's share capital shall be reduced by SEK 289 457 169 (the reduction amount) for repayment to the shareholders. The reduction of the share capital will be made by means of redemption of 273 511 169 shares.The shares to be redeemed shall be those shares that  after the share split in accordance with item a) above  are referred to as redemption shares in the Euroclear system  whereby the record date for the right to receive redemption shares according to item a) above is May 12  2022. Trading in the redemption shares is estimated to take place as from May 13  2022 up to June 3  2022.For each redeemed share a redemption amount of SEK 15.50 will be paid in cash  of which approximately SEK 14.44 exceeds the quota value of the share. The total redemption amount is estimated to SEK 4 239 423 119.50. In addition to the reduction amount of SEK 289 457 169  an estimated amount of SEK 3 949 965 950.50 will be distributed  by use of the company's non-restricted equity. The record date for the right to receive the redemption amount is proposed to be June 8  2022. Payment of the redemption amount is estimated to be made by Euroclear on June 13  2022.Following the reduction  the company's share capital will amount to SEK 289 457 169  allocated on in total 273 511 169 shares  each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 1.06. Apart from the reduction of the share capital  the company's restricted equity will not be affected.Pursuant to Chapter 20  Section 13  fourth paragraph of the Swedish Companies Act  the Board hereby states the following.It follows from the proposal on reduction of share capital that the Board proposes that the company's share capital shall be reduced by SEK 289 457 169 through redemption of 273 511 169 shares  for repayment to the shareholders.To achieve a quick and efficient redemption procedure without the requirement of obtaining the Swedish Companies Registration Office's or a general court's permission  the Board has also proposed that the Annual General Meeting resolves on restoring the company's share capital to its current amount by increasing the share capital with SEK 289 457 169 by way of a bonus issue without issuance of new shares. The amount is to be transferred from the company's non-restricted equity to the company's share capital  in accordance with item c) below.Through the reduction of the share capital for repayment to the shareholders  the company's share capital is reduced by SEK 289 457 169 and through the bonus issue the company's share capital is increased by the same amount. The company's restricted equity and share capital will therefore remain unchanged after the implementation of the bonus issue22 c) increase of the share capital through a bonus issueFurther  to achieve a quick and efficient redemption procedure without the requirement of obtaining the Swedish Companies Registration Office's or a general court's permission  the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a bonus issue to increase the company's share capital by SEK 289 457 169  to SEK 578 914 338  through a transfer of SEK 289 457 169 from the company's non-restricted equity. No new shares are to be issued in connection with the bonus issue.The number of shares in the company will  after implementation of the increase of the share capital  be 273 511 169  each share with a quota value of approximately SEK 2.12.-------------------The resolutions by the Annual General Meeting in accordance with items a) ‚Äì c) above are conditional upon each other and shall therefore be adopted as one resolution. In order for the resolution by the Annual General Meeting to be valid  the resolution must be approved by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.Finally  the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the company's President to make the minor adjustments to the resolutions in this item 22 that may be required in connection with the registration of the resolutions with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or Euroclear.The Board's statement pursuant to Chapter 20  Section 8 of the Swedish Companies Act as well as the Auditor's statements pursuant to Chapter 20  Section 8 and Section 14 of the Swedish Companies Act are provided separately.A separate information brochure regarding the proposed automatic share redemption procedure in accordance with this item will be provided before the Annual General Meeting.Shares and VotesThe company's share capital amounts to SEK 578 914 338 distributed among 273 511 169 shares and votes. The company holds no own shares.Further InformationInformation regarding all the proposed Board members of Boliden AB and the Nomination Committee's motivated statement are available on the company's website www.boliden.com.The annual report and the auditor's report  the auditor's statement on compliance with the guidelines for remuneration  etc. for the Group Management  the auditor's statements in accordance with Chapter 20  Section 8 and Chapter 20  Section 14 of the Swedish Companies Act  the Board's motivated statement in accordance with Chapter 18  Section 4 and Chapter 20  Section 8 of the Swedish Companies Act  and the Board's remuneration report  are available on www.boliden.com and at the company's head office  Klarabergsviadukten 90 in Stockholm  Sweden  as of Thursday  April 7  2022.

At the end of the year  the net debt/equity ratio was minus 2 per cent  which means that the balance sheet is stronger than Boliden's target of about 20 per cent at economic peaks. The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on an automatic share redemption  which will not jeopardise the ability to handle any deterioration in market terms nor the ability to finance additional growth. Through this  each existing share is split into two shares (share split 2:1)  whereof one of those shares will automatically be redeemed at SEK 15.50. In addition to the proposed ordinary dividend of approximately SEK 2 872 million  approximately SEK 4 239 million will be distributed to the shareholders through this procedure. The dividend and the redemption amount to a total of approximately SEK 7 111 million  or SEK 26.00 per share. To achieve a quick and efficient redemption procedure the Board further proposes that the company's share capital is restored to its current amount by means of a bonus issue. In view hereof  the Board proposes that the meeting resolves in accordance with the following proposal.22 a) share split 2:1The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a share split 2:1  meaning that each existing share is divided into two shares  of which one is to be referred to as redemption share in the Euroclear system and be redeemed in the manner described under item b) below.

At the end of the year  the net debt/equity ratio was minus 2 per cent  which means that the balance sheet is stronger than Boliden's target of about 20 per cent at economic peaks. The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on an automatic share redemption  which will not jeopardise the ability to handle any deterioration in market terms nor the ability to finance additional growth. Through this  each existing share is split into two shares (share split 2:1)  whereof one of those shares will automatically be redeemed at SEK 15.50. In addition to the proposed ordinary dividend of approximately SEK 2 872 million  approximately SEK 4 239 million will be distributed to the shareholders through this procedure. The dividend and the redemption amount to a total of approximately SEK 7 111 million  or SEK 26.00 per share. To achieve a quick and efficient redemption procedure the Board further proposes that the company's share capital is restored to its current amount by means of a bonus issue.

Trading in the redemption shares is estimated to take place as from May 13  2022 up to June 3  2022.For each redeemed share a redemption amount of SEK 15.50 will be paid in cash  of which approximately SEK 14.44 exceeds the quota value of the share. The total redemption amount is estimated to SEK 4 239 423 119.50.

The sister company of Luxembourg-based European trade repository REGIS-TR  which was first founded in 2010  the UK branch was launched specifically to provide continuity of service to UK clients post-Brexit  with an initial focus on EMIR reporting.‚ÄúThe UK continues to be a major player in European and global finance even when separated from the EU  and it is paramount that we maintain continuous and unified services for our UK clients and the market ‚Äù said Phil Brown  chairman of the board of directors at REGIS-TR  at the time of launch.John Kernan  CEO of REGIS-TR UK said: ‚ÄúWe have had a successful start to UK EMIR reporting since it began in January last year  and we are delighted to be the first TR to receive our full license from the FCA. In the interest of stability for both our clients and the market  it was a natural expansion of REGIS-TR to set up a TR in the UK prior to Brexit and we have also been pleased to see how our offering has resonated with new clients as well as existing ones. We are looking forward to continuing this growth with a full license.‚ÄùRegis-TR was founded by Clearstream  as part of a joint venture with Iberclear. In September 2021  SIX acquired a 50% stake in REGIS-TR from Clearstream  with the transaction expected to close in the first half of 2022.

1219,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.etfstream.com/features/why-opportunity-knocks-in-european-listed-etf-options/,Why opportunity knocks in European-listed ETF options,1 day ago,Why opportunity knocks in European-listed ETF optionsThe ETF options market in Europe remains small; however  do not underestimate their role in portfolio construction and risk managementThe versatility of the ETF structure has always been one of its greatest strengths and this is no less true when it comes to options markets. Put and call options on ETFs ‚Äì and more broadly ETPs ‚Äì in Europe have received far less attention than what their ingenuity and usefulness would suggest.As financial markets move into a new regime of higher rates with spikes in volatility more likely  ETP options can be a very valuable tool for investors looking to achieve specific investment outcomes or to manage risk. Below we introduce some of the key strategies that we have used for clients of our options advisory service.The European ETP options landscape consists of options on 23 equity ETFs  six fixed income ETFs and nine exchange-traded commodities ‚Äì from four ETP issuers (BlackRock  DWS  WisdomTree and a gold ETC from Deutsche Boerse).The options landscape is distinct from ETFs which have an embedded options strategy such as the increasingly popular Global X NASDAQ 100 Covered Call ETF (QYLD).With a notional open interest on listed ETP options of over ‚Ç¨830m  as at the end of January  investors have only just begun to utilise this opportunity in Europe. This open interest  while far from a perfect measure of product adoption  is dwarfed by notional open interest of over ‚Ç¨1.2trn on listed European equity index options.US popularityETP options in the US are also significantly more popular and liquid  with notional open interest on the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) alone being over $680nm  as at December 2020. In Europe  the key reason for the relative insignificance of ETP options is largely legacy in nature; however  there are several differences between index and ETP options:Liquidity (index options are generally more liquid than ETP options)Settlement (index options are cash-settled  ETP options are physically settled)Exercise (index options are European-style  exercisable on expiry  while ETP options are a mix of European-style and American-style  exercisable at any time before expiry)Dividends (some ETFs pay dividends  and this may prompt early exercise by the option holder to receive the dividend if it is larger than the remaining time value of the option)The physical settlement of ETP options can be an important benefit  as this can help reduce both execution risk and trading costs on date of exercise of the option.Assuming investors want to receive ‚Äì or deliver ‚Äì an ETP  physical settlement may be preferable to cash settlement  which then requires an extra trade to purchase ‚Äì or ‚Äì the ETP itself  which comes with trading costs (bid/offer spreads and brokerage) and execution risk that the trade may not execute at the desired time or price.Removing emotionPhysical settlement may work well in a cash-covered put writing strategy where an investor sells out-the-money put options generating a premium but has a desire to own the ETP at a lower price. If the ETP price falls  the investor is put into the ETP (physically settled)  as cash held in the investor‚Äôs account is automatically used to fund the exercise (purchase).From a behavioural perspective  implementing a cash-covered put writing strategy removes the emotional aspects of having to decide to buy the underlying ETP when markets fall as the investor is forced to exercise. It therefore also requires the investor to be comfortable owning the underlying exposure represented by the ETP.The opportunistic use of cash-covered put writing strategy can yield very respectable premiums  especially when the writing of the options coincides with a spike in volatility ‚Äì which have been frequent and relatively large in magnitude as seen in the VIX chart. With a view of continued spikes in volatility ‚Äì not least driven by geopolitics and reserve bank rhetoric ‚Äì this may remain an attractive strategy.Covered call writing on long ETP positions  generating extra income  is another useful strategy for ETP options  although physical settlement may trigger tax consequences if the existing position has unrealised gains and needs to be delivered. There are many other useful option strategies  some more suited to physical settlement  although they all require careful risk management.Another benefit is that ETP options can allow for investment strategies to be more accurately implemented. An investment strategy  such as hedging  can be most accurately implemented when using a derivative on the exact same underlying instrument. For example  when hedging exposure to fixed income ETFs using credit default swaps  it may be less effective than using an ETF option on the exact same underlying ETF (with the same index and the same risks).Changing strategiesWhile the current selection of ETP options in Europe is largely based on some of the more established ETPs  the strategies can and do change over time. They may track a new index (we have seen a flurry of ETFs changing to track equivalent ESG indices) the index itself may change its methodology (the DAX index went from tracking 30 to 40 of the largest companies in Germany in September 2021) or other changes may arise.While ETP options volumes in Europe are relatively low  US ETF options markets are currently telling several interesting stories  some of which are also showing up in European markets. Put option open interest on US corporate investment grade and high yield are at near all-time highs  which is unsurprising given negative market views on duration and widening credit spreads.One of the biggest challenges that ETP options face in Europe is their relative lack of liquidity.The simplicity and transparency of options listed on Eurex  for example  is appealing but on-screen liquidity can often appear poor (i.e. wide bid/offer spreads). Therefore  as with trading ETPs themselves  better execution might be achieved using Request for Quote (RFQ).This critical conversation about liquidity is no different ‚Äì and no less important ‚Äì than it is with the execution of ETPs themselves. Prices and volume as seen on order books are not representative of true liquidity.With a proliferation of different strike prices and expiry dates  it is common to have no open interest across parts of the chain in European ETP options.Another key challenge is the limited range of ETPs on which there are options  however  this goes hand-in-hand with investor demand and is something that we hope will broaden as the adoption of ETPs and ETP options improves.ETP options in Europe  while currently largely under the radar  present investors with an interesting opportunity to help achieve their investment risk and return objectives.They have their challenges  principally around liquidity and breadth of available underlying ETPs but the unique non-linear payoff profile of options and their physical settlement (meaning reduced execution risk and trading costs on exercise) allows them to be very effective instruments for portfolio construction and risk management.Andrew Limberis is investment manager at Omba Advisory & InvestmentsThis article first appeared in ETF Insider  ETF Stream's monthly ETF magazine for professional investors in Europe.

This approval is strong validation of our R&D capabilities and the result of many years of effort by our team in close collaboration with our partner  Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma ‚Äù stated Thomas Kuhn  CEO of Poxel. ‚ÄúSecondly  Poxel initiated its strategic shift with a new emphasis on rare metabolic diseases  starting with ALD. We have made significant progress preparing for our Phase 2a Proof-of-Concept clinical studies for PXL065 and PXL770 in ALD. These studies  subject to additional funding  are planned to start in the middle of 2022  with results expected in early 2023. We are also extremely pleased that the FDA recently granted Fast Track status to PXL065 in ALD which confirms our strategic direction and has the potential to substantially accelerate the approval timeline for PXL065 in ALD.‚Äù‚ÄúIn 2022  we look forward to sharing topline results of DESTINY-1  our Phase 2 study in NASH for PXL065  expected in the third quarter. We are actively pursuing a number of funding initiatives in parallel to extend our cash runway  prioritizing non-dilutive options. We are in advanced discussions with several parties and are confident that we will close a transaction in a reasonable timeframe to execute our strategic plan with the goal of bringing innovative treatments to patients with chronic serious metabolic diseases ‚Äù continued Thomas Kuhn.Commercial UpdateTWYMEEG¬Æ (Imeglimin)As of December 31  2021  royalty revenue to Poxel based on TWYMEEG net sales in Japan under the Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma (‚ÄúSumitomo‚Äù) license agreement has been limited following TWYMEEG‚Äôs recent commercial launch on September 16  2021. TWYMEEG‚Äôs initial commercial uptake has been impacted by prescribing restrictions for new products during the first year of sales and COVID-19 conditions. This has also impacted the frequency of physician visits and limited the significant market education efforts required for an innovative new product with a new mechanism of action.Sumitomo has made significant progress establishing high awareness of TWYMEEG amongst prescribing physicians  thanks to its comprehensive launch activities and ongoing promotional efforts. TWYMEEG has the potential to be used both in combination with other treatments  such as DPP4i‚Äôs  which are the most prescribed treatments for Japanese Type-2-Diabetes patients  and as monotherapy.Moreover  based on the Phase 3 TIMES program having shown robust efficacy with a favorable safety and tolerability profile  TWYMEEG offers potential for populations with limited treatment options  including elderly and patients with renal impairment. Sumitomo recently initiated a Phase 4 study targeting Type-2-Diabetes patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) 3b/4 / 5.In accordance with the Sumitomo license agreement  Poxel is entitled to receive escalating royalties of 8 - 18% on net sales of TWYMEEG and sales-based payments of up to JPY 26.5 billion (approximately EUR 200 million) 1 . In parallel  as part of the Merck Serono licensing agreement 2   Poxel will pay Merck Serono a fixed 8% royalty based on the net sales of Imeglimin  independent of the level of sales. As a result  based on the current forecast  Poxel expects net royalties to be cash neutral through Sumitomo FY2022 (through March 2023). Once TWYMEEG achieves the next commercial threshold  the royalty rate will increase to double-digits and Poxel will retain all net royalties above 8%.. In parallel  as part of the Merck Serono licensing agreement   Poxel will pay Merck Serono a fixed 8% royalty based on the net sales of Imeglimin  independent of the level of sales. As a result  based on the current forecast  Poxel expects net royalties to be cash neutral through Sumitomo FY2022 (through March 2023). Once TWYMEEG achieves the next commercial threshold  the royalty rate will increase to double-digits and Poxel will retain all net royalties above 8%. Throughout 2021  Poxel and Sumitomo have continued to pursue strong patent protection for Imeglimin. The patent estate for TWYMEEG would extend to 2036 (including potential 5-year patent term extension)  with other patent applications ongoing.In 2021  the Company conducted and completed a comprehensive evaluation of partnering options for the U.S. and Europe and does not expect to enter into a broad strategic partnership for these geographies in the near term. The Company is now considering opportunities to leverage the Imeglimin data package in specific territories  including those resulting from inbound interest.Results from all three Phase 3 clinical trials of Imeglimin were published in the medical journals Diabetes Care and Diabetes Obesity and Metabolism : The TIMES 1 publication entitled: "" Efficacy and safety of Imeglimin monotherapy vs. placebo in Japanese patients with Type 2 diabetes (TIMES 1) : A Double-Blind  Randomized  Placebo-Controlled  Parallel-Group  Multicenter Phase 3 Trial ‚Äù was published in April 2021. The TIMES 2 publication entitled: ‚Äú Long-term safety and efficacy of Imeglimin as monotherapy or in combination with existing antidiabetic agents in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (TIMES 2): A 52-week  open-label  multicentre phase 3 trial The TIMES 3 publication entitled: ‚Äú Efficacy and safety of Imeglimin add-on to insulin monotherapy in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes (TIMES 3): A randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled phase 3 trial with a 36-week open-label extension periodand :Clinical Development UpdatesNASH (PXL065 and PXL770)In September 2021  the PXL065 Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1) in NASH completed enrollment with 123 noncirrhotic biopsy-proven NASH patients across multiple clinical sites in the US. Results from this 36-week  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  dose-ranging study designed to assess efficacy and safety are anticipated in Q3 2022. The goal of DESTINY-1 is to identify the optimal dose or doses of PXL065 to advance into a Phase 3 registration trial for the treatment of noncirrhotic biopsy-proven NASH patients.In November 2021  Poxel presented new clinical analysis on PXL065 DESTINY-1 screening data at the AASLD The Liver Meeting ¬Æ 2021.2021. PXL770  a first-in-class  oral direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator  has successfully completed a Phase 2a Proof-of-Concept trial for the treatment of NASH  which met its objectives. Future development of PXL770 in NASH will be assessed pending results from the PXL065 Phase 2 trial in NASH and the Phase 2a POC studies in ALD.Rare metabolic diseases (PXL065 and PXL770)The Phase 2a clinical Proof-of-Concept (POC) biomarker program in X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)  subject to additional funding  is anticipated to begin midyear  followed by results in early 2023.In December 2021  Poxel announced the formation of its Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) for rare metabolic diseases as part of its strategy to increase its focus on rare diseases. The first meeting of this SAB included productive discussions that informed the design of the upcoming ALD POC Phase 2a studies and provided insights into pivotal trial concepts.Poxel participated in several scientific and patient advocacy conferences related to ALD and presented its programs  including the comprehensive preclinical pharmacological package  targeting this severe orphan neurometabolic disease with no approved therapies. This included presentations at three major advocacy organizations  Alex The Leukodystrophy Charity in the United Kingdom  United Leukodystrophy Foundation and ALD Connect in the U.S.Early Stage DevelopmentDuring the year  Poxel pursued its evaluation of internal opportunities from its adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator platform and deuterated TZD platform and completed a series of studies  including a preclinical assessment of PXL770 and AMPK activation for an orphan kidney disease  autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)  which demonstrated a robust effect to attenuate disease in established model systems. Additionally  the Company is conducting studies in other rare diseases including mitochondrial disorders.Corporate UpdateIn July 2021  Poxel announced a new strategic direction to focus its pipeline on high value  rare metabolic indications and NASH  with the goal of creating pipeline synergies  maximizing resources  and driving shareholder value. Rare metabolic indications represent the intersection of high unmet medical need  promising pre-clinical and clinical data  opinion leader enthusiasm  significant commercial opportunity  and attractive time horizons.In 2021  Poxel finalized a one year review and comprehensive evaluation of its existing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) actions. As a result  the Company has defined a solid CSR strategy supported by three pillars (social  governance and environmental) and will commit to measure  assess and communicate its progress over time  starting with the publication of its new CSR report which will be included in the 2021 Universal Registration Document.

These financing options include dilutive and non-dilutive sources  as well as discussions with IPF partners  and the Company reasonably expects that at least one of the pursued options would be completed before Q3 2022.

ABC arbitrage thus achieved one of its best results ever with a ROE of nearly 18%.Dividend Policy - A quarterly distribution policy has been in place for over two years.Distribution of ‚Ç¨0.10 per share in October 2021;Distribution of ‚Ç¨0.10 per share in December 2021;Interim dividend of ‚Ç¨0.10 per share on April 20  2022 for payment on April 22;Proposition at the General Meeting of June 10  2022 of a final dividend of ‚Ç¨0.10 per share;If the meeting votes in favor of this final dividend  the total distribution for fiscal year 2021 will be ‚Ç¨0.40 per share  i.e. a distribution rate of more than 80%.Retained earnings will be invested in the development of new products with significant profitability prospects. The terms and timetable of this final dividend will be presented at a later date.Story continuesOutlook - It is important to contextualize this outlook with respect to events in Ukraine.After a 10 year record of almost uninterrupted increase in equity indices  this war could prevent a return to normalized financial markets. Faced with the potential impacts of this war and despite the fact that inflation is off the charts  central banks could delay their exit from support programs. The major difference with 2020 is  for the time being  the strong decorrelation of markets between geographical areas  with the US economy seemingly less affected than Europe.The start of capital flight from Europe to seemingly safer areas may make it more difficult to achieve the group's objectives for the development of its assets under management in 2022.This situation also means a return to a period of sustained volatility despite the presence of accommodative monetary policies  and probably for several months. This should benefit a large part of the group's activities.After a quiet month of January  the average pace of activity in the first quarter is close to 80% of the average pace for the 2021 financial year on a rising trend that should continue with the recent increase in volatility.In a year 2022 that promises to be complex from a geopolitical point of view  ABC arbitrage  by recording its 27th positive fiscal year  confirms that it has all the assets to produce performance consistent with current volatility and is therefore pursuing its recruitment and investment objectives to achieve the ambitions of its ABC 2022 strategic plan.1 At this date  the audit procedures carried out by the statutory auditors are still in progress.Contacts: abc-arbitrage.comRelations actionnaires: actionnaires@abc-arbitrage.comRelations presse: VERBATEE / v.sabineu@verbatee.com EURONEXT Paris - Compartiment BISIN: FR0004040608Reuters BITI.PA / Bloomberg ABCA FPISIN : FR0004040608Reuters BITI.PA / Bloomberg ABCA FPAttachment,neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,mixed,0.25,0.14,0.61,True,English,"['ABC arbitrage', 'Results', 'The M&A market', 'Bloomberg ABCA FP Attachment', '27th positive fiscal year', 'Chairman Dominique Ceolin', 'significant profitability prospects', 'accommodative monetary policies', 'consolidated financial statements', 'financial market parameters', 'Compartiment B ISIN', 'various geographical areas', 'ABC 2022 strategic plan', 'normalized financial markets', 'quarterly distribution policy', 'market context', 'financial data', '2021 financial year', 'Dividend Policy', 'safer areas', 'Press release', 'Net revenues', 'Net income', 'atypical year', 'economic point', 'historical average', 'strong dynamic', 'first half', 'highest levels', 'successive waves', 'unfavorable decorrelation', 'two years', 'Interim dividend', 'final dividend', 'new products', '10 year record', 'uninterrupted increase', 'potential impacts', 'central banks', 'support programs', 'major difference', 'strong decorrelation', 'US economy', 'capital flight', 'several months', 'large part', 'quiet month', 'average pace', 'first quarter', 'rising trend', 'recent increase', 'geopolitical point', 'audit procedures', 'statutory auditors', 'Relations presse', 'Reuters BITI', 'total distribution', 'distribution rate', 'Business Performance', 'best results', 'General Meeting', 'Retained earnings', 'later date', 'equity indices', 'sustained volatility', 'current volatility', 'investment objectives', 'Relations actionnaires', 'EURONEXT Paris', 'client assets', 'ABC arbitrage', 'IFRS Dec.', '2021 Results', 'March', '07h00', 'ROE', '2021 Distributions', 'Board', 'Directors', 'share', 'EPS', 'Return', 'health', 'view', 'normality', 'COVID', 'situations', 'group', 'activities', 'know-how', 'place', 'October', 'December', 'April', 'payment', 'Proposition', 'June', 'development', 'terms', 'timetable', 'Story', 'Outlook', 'respect', 'events', 'Ukraine', 'war', 'fact', 'inflation', 'charts', 'exit', 'Europe', 'start', 'management', 'period', 'presence', 'January', 'activity', 'recruitment', 'ambitions', 'progress', 'Contacts', 'VERBATEE', 'sabineu', 'FR0004040608', '29']",2022-03-22,2022-03-23,finance.yahoo.com

Generating ‚Ç¨23.2m  exceeding the target of ‚Ç¨22m that it had set for the financial year.Over the period  the Group benefited from the sustained increase (+69%) of the existing countries (France  Spain  Switzerland and ML2Grow) demonstrating that  although in an advanced stage  these countries still had strong development potential.The countries in the scale-up phase (Germany  United Kingdom  Italy  Belgium) also posted very strong growth in 2021 (x 5.2)  just one year after their launch  again illustrating the strength of Invibes Advertising's international development model. This is based on its proven ability to roll out its activity rapidly and successfully in a new country so that it becomes a contributor to the business.In this respect  the new countries recently opened (Netherlands  Nordic countries  South Africa and UAE)  which are currently in the start-up phase  should in turn rapidly gain momentum to contribute to the Group's growth from 2022.Story continuesSustained EBITDA growth in 2021The strong international expansion recorded by the Group in 2021 was characterised by the continued structuring of teams to support this growth. In total  new recruitments in 2021 brought the total workforce  in full-time equivalence  to 124 in 2021 compared with 84 in 2020.The Group's experience in successfully launching its business in more than 10 countries worldwide has resulted in a controlled and rigorous management of its cost structure over the period  enabling it to post a sustained increase in EBITDA to ‚Ç¨1 422k in 2021 from ‚Ç¨236k in 2020.The breakdown of EBITDA by country maturity is as follows:Consolidated data Audited  in K‚Ç¨. 2021 2020 Existing countries (1) Turnover 17 802 10 504 EBITDA 5 080 2 969 EBITDA margin 29 % 28 % Scale-up (2) Turnover 5 379 1 026 EBITDA 579 (685) EBITDA margin 11% na New countries (start-ups) (3) Turnover 19 - EBITDA (479) - EBITDA margin na - Group overheads (4) (3 758) (2 048) Consolidated EBITDA 1 422 236(1) France  Spain  Switzerland and ML2GROW(2) Germany  UK  Italy  Belgium  and Invibes International(3) Sweden  Norway  Denmark  South Africa  Netherlands  Dubai(4) General expenses excluding CAPEXAfter accounting for depreciation of ‚Ç¨958k  Invibes Advertising posted an operating profit of ‚Ç¨464k  compared with an operating loss of -‚Ç¨578k in 2020.Including in 2021 a financial charge of -‚Ç¨354k  and a tax credit of ‚Ç¨259k linked to the activation of deferred taxes  the net result is positive at ‚Ç¨369k against a net loss of -‚Ç¨876k in 2020.Ambition: to reach a turnover of ‚Ç¨100 million by 2024To continue its development  the Group can rely on a financial structure that includes a net cash position2 which has more than doubled over the period and amounts to ‚Ç¨8.4m at the end of December 2021  compared to ‚Ç¨3.9m at the end of 2020. This amount does not include the capital increase of ‚Ç¨17m which was successfully completed by private placement last January.With these strengthened financial resources  the Group has the means to pursue its ambitious roadmap  which is based on six strategic levers:Acceleration of existing countries.Expanding to new countries.Strengthening its technology platform.Deployment of technology services for its strategic clients.The launch of a 100% self-service platform dedicated to SMEs.The development of its subsidiary ML2Grow  which specialises in services to companies for Big Data and artificial intelligence projects.This offensive strategy should enable Invibes Advertising to reach a turnover of ‚Ç¨100m by 2024  representing a weighted average annual growth rate (CAGR) between 2020 and 2024 of around +72%. While a significant proportion of this growth will be achieved through organic growth  it could also include a proportion through external growth.Next publication: Q1 2022 turnover  on 20 April 2022  after the close of tradingAbout Invibes AdvertisingInvibes Advertising is an advanced technology company specialising in digital advertising.

More than 70% of surveyed‚Ä¶,LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Cloudreach  an Atos company  the leading multi-cloud services provider  released new data highlighting the latest cloud technology trends  underscoring the impact the cloud skills gap is having on businesses. More than 70% of surveyed IT leaders internationally saw the skills gap as an urgent concern. More than half of respondents claimed it either slowed them down (46%) or posed an existential crisis to the company (9%).The data was published in an IDC Infobrief ‚ÄòHow to be a Digital Leader in 2022‚Äô 1 commissioned by Cloudreach  and Amazon Web Services (AWS)  ultimately supporting the Atos OneCloud strategic initiative. The research also delves into cloud technology‚Äôs present and expanding role in supporting business growth and sustainability efforts.As more organizations rush to adopt cloud technology to improve efficiency and sustainability  the report shines a light on how the industry needs more skilled professionals than ever to maintain operations. Business leaders are finding that their cloud transformation initiatives are increasingly hampered by a lack of skilled professionals  with 34% of respondents explaining that the shortage has reduced their ability to operate and launch services.Low supply of cloud skills is also hitting innovation  causing high staff turnover and wage inflation. Multi-cloud capabilities  cloud system development  and cloud governance were the top three areas most impacted by the skills gap  according to respondents.‚ÄúThis research confirms that there is a shortage of cloud talent today  threatening cloud transformation projects that are essential to business survival ‚Äù said Brooks Borcherding  CEO  Cloudreach. ‚ÄúTalented architects and engineers are vital to delivering on the promise of cloud for businesses  and the opportunities are huge for their careers. This skills gap poses a challenge for organizations to find new ways of recruiting  hiring and upskilling talent; including removing barriers of entry that have historically limited diversity within the industry.‚ÄúBusinesses recognize the importance of cloud infrastructure to help them grow and become more effective  and this study confirms the demand for cloud services continues to grow ‚Äù said Vittorio Sanvito  Director of EMEA Partner Development at AWS. ‚ÄúThat is why we are working so hard to help close the skills gap in EMEA and worldwide with our partners like Cloudreach and Atos. AWS has also made a commitment to help 29 million people around the world grow their tech skills with free cloud computing training by 2025. We are bringing more people into professional cloud careers and increasing the diversity of the cloud workforce.‚ÄùThe concern about the skills gap remained consistent across cloud organizations in both North America and Europe. The World Economic Forum estimates that by 2025  half of the global workforce will need reskilling  and 97 million new roles will emerge because of digitization. With fewer skilled workers than open jobs  and growing demand on the horizon  cloud organizations will fight to maintain their teams and operations.The study revealed other trends in cloud technology  including the essential role it can play in business operations  growth  and sustainability efforts.‚óè 48% of respondents are now engaged in business transformation through cloud adoption  driving broader changes in organizational thinking.‚óè 71% of respondents see cloud strategy as the biggest driver of sustainability today  with this percentage rising to 85% in 2023.‚ÄúThis study shows that cloud is crucial to achieve carbon emissions targets. Enterprises consume less energy and reduce their environmental footprint when migrating to a cloud environment ‚Äù said Carla Arend  Senior Program Director and Lead Analyst  Cloud in Europe at IDC. ‚ÄúTo be impactful  sustainability practices need to be embedded in the enterprise business processes. These go beyond tracking CO2 emissions or utilities consumption but look for greener practices across the entire asset lifecycle.‚ÄùThe IDC survey collected data from 610 IT business leaders in North America and Europe at large enterprises across a wide range of industries.For more details on these insights  plus additional findings  download the report here.Notes to Editors: Countries surveyed: United States (150  Canada (50)  United Kingdom (100)  France (80)  Germany (80)  Italy (50)  Spain (50)  Nordics (50)***About CloudreachCloudreach  an Atos company  is the world‚Äôs leading multi-cloud services provider.

This agreement will add two‚Ä¶,SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Spaceflight Inc.  the leading global launch services provider  today announced an extended multi-launch agreement (MLA) with long-time customer  Internet of Things (IoT) constellation developer  Astrocast. This agreement will add two missions to accommodate Astrocast‚Äôs fast-growing IoT constellation which helps track assets in some of the world‚Äôs most remote regions.In February of 2020  Astrocast and Spaceflight signed an MLA for the launch of 10 additional IoT nanosatellites  representing the sixth launch booked with Spaceflight. In total  Spaceflight is now set to launch a majority of the satellites that will complete the Astrocast IoT Nanosatellite Network.Spaceflight has already managed the successful launch of 10 Astrocast spacecraft  including demonstration models on Spaceflight‚Äôs historic SSO-A mission in 2018 and PSLV-C45 in 2019. The companies most recently partnered and successfully launched an additional five nanosatellites on Spaceflight‚Äôs SXRS-5 in January 2021.‚ÄúFlexibility is a key differentiator going forward ‚Äù said Astrocast CFO Kjell Karlsen. ‚ÄúSpaceflight has already demonstrated their flexibility in launch timing and availability across multiple vehicles in our existing contract. Assured access to space is critical for Astrocast to grow our constellation and we‚Äôre looking forward to working with Spaceflight to continue to efficiently build out our constellation in orbit.‚ÄùThe uniqueness of Astrocast‚Äôs constellation lies in a very low signal and small antenna and terminal with long battery life. The small size lets the company put the terminal on everything from fishing buoys to animals. For example  Astrocast is helping its customers track illegal fishing  endangered animal species  and heavy machinery in remote locations. By default  IoT solutions implemented in many of these situations are deployed in remote locations ‚Äì from mines to farmland  ships to oil platforms. Astrocast‚Äôs solution minimizes the need for human intervention and repair  wherever possible  safeguarding the business case.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre pleased to expand our relationship with Astrocast ‚Äù said Curt Blake  president and CEO of Spaceflight. ‚ÄúHaving a portfolio of launch options and the expertise to move quickly to accommodate changes is something we‚Äôre very proud of  and one that fast-growing constellation builders like Astrocast rely on.‚ÄùDuring Satellite 2022 this week in Washington DC  both companies have been nominated for prestigious industry awards. Spaceflight is being honored as one of Via Satellite‚Äôs 10 Hottest Companies in Satellite and its Sherpa orbital transfer vehicle (OTV) is a finalist for Via Satellite‚Äôs 2021 Satellite Technology of the Year award.

The following items are adjusted: fixed asset impairment (‚Ç¨41.7 million)  provision for risks and charges (- ‚Ç¨1.7 million)  provisions related to employee benefits (- ‚Ç¨1.1 million)  and the other expenses and income without any impact on cash position (‚Ç¨0.6 million)  and the impacts related to divestments (+ ‚Ç¨3.0 million).6 Including the impacts of the final decision of the IFRS IC of March 2021 on the configuration and customization costs of software used as part of an SaaS-type contract as described in the accounting principles and methods (net impact - ‚Ç¨1.4 million).The accounts were audited by the statutory auditors and examined by the board of directors on March 18  2022. The report of the statutory auditors is in the process of being issued. The statements and detailed presentation of annual profits are available on the corporate site at corporate.virbac.com.Story continuesThanks to the constant mobilization of the Virbac teams for animal health  in a particularly dynamic market  we posted annual revenue of ‚Ç¨1.064 billion  an increase of +17.4% over 2020 excluding Sentinel (+13.9% at real scope) compared to the same period in 2020. Excluding the negative effect of exchange rates  revenue rose by +18.4% excluding Sentinel (+14.9% at real scope). All areas had double-digit organic growth  reflecting both the sector‚Äôs momentum and the successful execution of our strategic plan. In Europe  the main contributors to this performance were France  area Export activities  the United Kingdom  Germany  Benelux  Italy and Spain  driven by strong growth in the companion animal range. In Asia-Pacific  India continues to drive the area‚Äôs growth  accounting for approximately 45% of it; Australia  New Zealand  South Africa  Vietnam  and China also contribute to the area‚Äôs very strong growth. The United States benefited from sustained growth across all product lines  including specialty products  the dental and dermatology ranges  recently launched products (Clomicalm  Itrafungol  Senergy and Stelfonta) and  lastly  the manufacturing of Sentinel Spectrum for Merck. In Latin America  Brazil and Mexico drove growth. Lastly  in Chile  the strong second half-year performance helped us achieve organic growth over the year. In terms of species  the companion animal business was essentially driven by the remarkable double-digit growth of the specialty ranges (including Clomicalm  Movoflex  Stelfonta)  petfood  parasiticides  dermatology and dental products  and by the rebound of the vaccine range for dogs and cats  compared to the same period in 2020. It should be noted that sales of Clomicalm and Itrafungol  products acquired in March 2021  and the US petfood range iVet  acquired in July 2021  represented approximately ‚Ç¨14 million in sales (or 1.6 percentage points of revenue growth) over the period. The food producing animals segment also showed significant growth due in particular to the ruminant sector.The current operating profit before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions amounts to ‚Ç¨173.2 million  up significantly from 2020 (‚Ç¨127.0 million). This improvement in performance is mainly due to the exceptional growth in our revenue  driven by a very strong performance in all areas and good market dynamics. It is partially offset by a rebound in our expenses  in particular the staff expenses related to the high activity  the commercial expenses in anticipation of product launches  and the acceleration of our R&D investments. Note also  that this annual profit benefits from the recognition of exceptional items in the amount of ‚Ç¨5.1 million (‚Ç¨2.4 million in compensation net of costs incurred in 2021  for the continuation of R&D projects acquired in the 1st quarter of 2021 from Elanco  and the additional margin on the transferred inventories of the Clomicalm and Itrafungol products that have benefited from a zero cost of sales as part of the acquisition  and ‚Ç¨2.7 million for the reversal of provision for disputes  which have become irrelevant). All of these items represent a positive impact of 0.5 percentage point on the ‚Äúcurrent operating profit  before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions‚Äù to ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù for the period.Current net profit (net consolidated profit adjusted for non-recurring expenses and income and for non-current taxes) totaled ‚Ç¨117.8 million  up 53.3% from 2020. This very strong improvement in our current net profit is explained by the reasons given above  in particular the excellent growth of our business and the very strong control of our costs  despite the rebound observed in 2021. It should be noted that our financial result corresponds to a charge of ‚Ç¨8.5 million  which is significantly down from the same period in 2020 (charge of ‚Ç¨10.4 million). This is explained by the decrease in the cost of net debt of ‚Ç¨5.1 million resulting from the repayment of our bank financing following divestment of the Sentinel range; the latter is offset by the decrease in foreign exchange profit of ‚Ç¨3.1 million due to the impairment of the Chilean peso against the euro and the US dollar in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.Net profit - Group Share amounted to ‚Ç¨113.2 million  down from the previous year (‚Ç¨136.0 million)  which is explained by the divestment of Sentinel in July 2020.On the financial side  our net debt amounts to - ‚Ç¨73.8 million at the end of December 2021  compared to - ‚Ç¨63.4 million at the end of December 2020. This positive change in our cash position over the year is mainly due to strong cash generation  which enabled the financing of more sustained capital expenditures (current and acquisitions including the redemption of minority shares of Centrovet)  higher working capital requirements in 2021 given the strong increase in our revenue  and finally the payment of dividends with respect to the 2020 profit.OutlookIn line with our strategic plan  and in a more standardized market  in 2022 we anticipate revenue growth of between 5% and 8% at constant rates and scope. While the ratio of ‚Äúcurrent operating profit before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions‚Äù to ‚Äúrevenue‚Äù  as previously announced  should consolidate around 15% at constant exchange rates (with a voluntary over-investment in R&D of approximately 1 percentage point of revenue compared to 2021). Our debt relief should be around ‚Ç¨60 million  excluding dividends  at constant scope and exchange rates. In addition  the distribution of a net dividend of ‚Ç¨1.25 per share for the 2021 financial year will be proposed to the next general meeting of shareholders.Covid-19 Health CrisisWe continue to face significant production  logistical and supply constraints with regard to certain intermediaries  and more recently  the impact of inflation on our costs.Conflict between Ukraine and RussiaWe are deeply touched and saddened by what is currently happening in Ukraine  and the humanitarian disaster generated by this war  and we would like to express our support for all the victims. In terms of our business  any direct exposure to this crisis situation is minimal  as our sales to Russia and Ukraine account for less than 0.5% of our total revenue. It should also be noted that we do not have a subsidiary in these two countries  instead we work with distributors. However  we remain vigilant and have formed an internal team to monitor the situation closely  and the possible indirect consequences for our Group  in particular with regard to energy costs (sharply increasing)  and certain raw materials.PR√âSENTATION ANALYSTES ‚Äì VIRBACNous tiendrons une r√©union analystes le mercredi 23 mars 2022 √† 14h30 (heure de Paris - CET) dans l‚ÄôAuditorium l'Edouard VII Business Center  23 square Edouard VII - 75 009 Paris (France).Les participants pourront arriver 15 minutes avant le d√©but de la r√©union.

1251,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220321005941/en/argenx-Announces-Positive-Topline-Phase-3-Data-From-ADAPT-SC-Study-Evaluating-Subcutaneous-Efgartigimod-for-Generalized-Myasthenia-Gravis,argenx Announces Positive Topline Phase 3 Data From ADAPT-SC Study Evaluating Subcutaneous Efgartigimod for Generalized Myasthenia Gravis,BREDA  the Netherlands--(BUSINESS WIRE)--argenx Announces Positive Topline Phase 3 Data from ADAPT-SC Study Evaluating Subcutaneous Efgartigimod for Generalized Myasthenia Gravis,BREDA  the Netherlands--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:argenx SE (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX)  a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases  today announced positive topline data from the Phase 3 ADAPT-SC study evaluating subcutaneous (SC) efgartigimod (1000mg efgartigimod-PH20) for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG). SC efgartigimod achieved the primary endpoint of total IgG reduction from baseline at day 29  demonstrating statistical noninferiority to VYVGART¬Æ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) intravenous (IV) formulation in gMG patients. Based on these results  argenx plans to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by the end of 2022.SC efgartigimod is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme's ENHANZE¬Æ drug delivery technology. ENHANZE facilitates subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics that are typically administered via infusion  providing additional treatment options to patients based on individual preferences.‚Äú Every person living with gMG experiences the disease in their own way  including how they manage symptoms ‚Äù said James F. Howard Jr.  M.D.  Professor of Neurology (Neuromuscular Disease)  Medicine and Allied Health  Department of Neurology  The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and Principal Investigator for the ADAPT-SC trial. ‚Äú For many years  patients lacked sufficient treatment options  let alone those that were tailored to their unique needs. These data  along with the recent approval of the intravenous formulation  VYVGART  represent exciting advancements in the management of this debilitating  unpredictable disease by offering patients and physicians the option to select treatment based on individual needs and preferences.‚Äù‚Äú Our goal is to redefine and deliver targeted treatment options for people living with gMG globally. By listening to the gMG community  we heard the importance of creating optionality and flexibility for patients. The ADAPT-SC results mark another important step toward achieving this  and further support our vision of delivering a broad array of treatment options for gMG ‚Äù said Tim Van Hauwermeiren  Chief Executive Officer of argenx. ‚Äú We‚Äôre excited about the potential to deliver two best-in-class options that provide flexibility around route of administration and dosing schedule  and look forward to collaborating with the FDA to bring another innovative treatment option to people living with gMG.‚ÄùHighlights of Topline ADAPT-SC DataPrimary endpoint of noninferiority was met (p< 0.0001); SC efgartigimod demonstrated mean total IgG reduction of 66.4% from baseline at day 29  compared to 62.2% with VYVGART. Results were consistent across the overall population  including those with acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies and patients where AChR antibodies were not detected.Additional key secondary endpoints were met  consistent with clinical efficacy results seen in the VYVGART Phase 3 ADAPT study  including: 69.1% of patients treated with SC efgartigimod were responders on the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Responders are defined as having at least a two-point improvement on the MG-ADL score for at least four consecutive weeks. 65.5% of treated patients were responders on the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score. Responders are defined as having at least a three-point improvement on the QMG score for at least four consecutive weeks.Onset of effect and minimal symptom expression (defined as MG-ADL score of 0 or 1) were also consistent with ADAPT.SC efgartigimod demonstrated a safety profile consistent with the Phase 3 ADAPT study. It was generally well-tolerated; the most frequent adverse event being injection site reactions (ISRs)  commonly observed with biologics administered subcutaneously. All ISRs were mild to moderate and resolved over time.Detailed data from the ADAPT-SC trial will be submitted for presentation at a future medical meeting.Phase 3 ADAPT-SC Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADAPT-SC trial was a randomized  open-label  parallel-group  multicenter trial evaluating the noninferiority of the pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of SC efgartigimod (1000mg efgartigimod-PH20) as compared with IV efgartigimod (10mg/kg) in patients with gMG. The pharmacodynamic effect as measured by percent change from baseline in total IgG levels at day 29  one week after the last dose of IV or SC efgartigimod  served as the primary endpoint in the ADAPT-SC trial. The correlation between total IgG reduction and clinical benefit in gMG was demonstrated in a Phase 2 and the Phase 3 ADAPT trial  which served as the basis for approval of VYVGART in the U.S. and Japan. Safety  clinical efficacy  immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics (PK) were also assessed.A total of 110 adult patients with gMG in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the ADAPT-SC trial and were treated. Inclusion criteria of the trial were the same as the Phase 3 ADAPT trial of VYVGART; enrolled patients had a confirmed gMG diagnosis and an MG-ADL total score of at least 5 with greater than 50% of the total score attributed to non-ocular symptoms  at screening and baseline. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one gMG treatment prior to randomization  including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors  corticosteroids or nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  and were required to remain on that stable dose throughout the primary trial.Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive SC efgartigimod or IV efgartigimod for one treatment cycle consisting of four doses at weekly intervals. The total study duration was approximately 12 weeks  including seven weeks of follow-up after the treatment cycle.Conference Call and WebcastA webcast of the live call may be accessed on the Investors section of the argenx website at argenx.com/investors.

Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.About Generalized Myasthenia GravisMG is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where IgG antibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. More than 85% of people with MG progress to generalized MG (gMG) within 18 months  where muscles throughout the body may be affected  resulting in extreme fatigue and difficulties with facial expression  speech  swallowing and mobility. In more life-threatening cases  MG can affect the muscles responsible for breathing. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for 80-90% of the total gMG population.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases  in both an intravenous and subcutaneous (SC) formulation. SC efgartigimod is co-formulated with recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme's ENHANZE¬Æ drug delivery technology.About VYVGART¬ÆVYVGART¬Æ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

Severstal  Russia's top steelmaker NLMK  state-owned Russian Railways and fertiliser producer Eurochem are all struggling to get payments to Russian bondholders  the firms themselves and ITI Capital say.NLMK said on Tuesday it had paid a coupon on a 2024 bond but while foreigners had started to receive their money  Russian holders hadn't.""This is due to the fact that... Euroclear and Clearstream are no longer settling transactions with Russia's NSD "" NLMK said. ""We currently see no legal grounds prohibiting Euroclear and Clearstream to process payments to Russian residents.""NSD confirmed it was receiving payments from Euroclear  but said it will not process these until Euroclear gets clarifications from European regulators.""After curbs are lifted  payments will be processed...as usual "" it said.The daily Kommersant newspaper  citing a source at a large brokerage firm  said some Russian holders of Moscow's sovereign bonds also hadn't received payments. A source at a European-based fund told Reuters it too had not received a sovereign bond payment due on Monday.The Russian finance ministry  Russian Railways and Eurochem did not reply to requests for comment.""Delays are possible for payments cleared via international depositories "" NSD added in a statement to Reuters.""This could be linked to 'manual' processing of the orders linked to Russian companies as well as with a need to get clarifications from European regulators"".(Reporting by Reuters; Editing by Alexander Smith  Kirsten Donovan)",negative,0.02,0.2,0.78,mixed,0.04,0.2,0.76,True,English,"['Steel giant Severstal', 'first major default', 'Russia-Ukraine crisis', ""overdue $12.6 million loan 'coupon' payment"", 'next international sovereign bond payment', 'Seaport Global credit analyst', 'foreign currency sovereign bonds', 'most international market bonds', 'March 16 coupon due date', 'Moscow International Business Center', 'first major corporate default', 'Russian steel giant Severstal', 'international clearing houses', 'National Settlement Depository', 'daily Kommersant newspaper', 'international payment lines', 'first major default', 'Russian finance ministry', 'ITI Capital analysts', 'state-owned Russian Railways', 'major Russian company', 'large brokerage firm', 'international bond payments', 'latest Western sanctions', 'corporate bonds', 'first default', 'international bondholders', 'international depositories', 'steel firm', 'global exchanges', 'large stake', 'Russian government', 'Russian securities', 'Russian companies', 'Russian bondholders', 'Russian holders', 'Russian residents', 'Severstal default', 'General view', 'main shareholder', 'wealthy Russians', 'European Union', 'paying agent', 'Himanshu Porwal', 'coming days', 'constant discussions', 'special ""licences', 'legal terms', 'asset ownership', 'domestic bondholders', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'legal action', 'unpaid amounts', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Polyus Gold', 'top steelmaker', 'fertiliser producer', 'legal grounds', 'European regulators', 'European-based fund', ""manual' processing"", 'Alexander Smith', 'Kirsten Donovan', 'Russia-Ukraine crisis', 'Alexey Mordashov', 'DELAYS POSSIBLE', '2024 bond', 'Reuters', 'clock', 'Wednesday', 'country', 'number', 'end', 'creditors', 'source', 'money', 'Citibank', 'people', 'deadline', 'issues', 'application', 'Event', 'countersanctions', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'NSD', 'group', 'banks', 'part', 'trades', 'result', 'Story', 'requests', 'comment', 'Investors', 'right', 'laws', 'Gazprom', 'problems', 'NLMK', 'Eurochem', 'firms', 'Tuesday', 'foreigners', 'fact', 'transactions', 'clarifications', 'curbs', 'The', 'Monday', 'statement', 'orders', 'need', 'Editing']",2022-03-23,2022-03-23,finance.yahoo.com

Severstal  Russia‚Äôs top steelmaker NLMK  state-owned Russian Railways and fertiliser producer Eurochem are all struggling to get payments to Russian bondholders  the firms themselves and ITI Capital say.NLMK said on Tuesday it had paid a coupon on a 2024 bond but while foreigners had started to receive their money  Russian holders hadn‚Äôt.‚ÄúThis is due to the fact that‚Ä¶ Euroclear and Clearstream are no longer settling transactions with Russia‚Äôs NSD ‚Äù NLMK said. ‚ÄúWe currently see no legal grounds prohibiting Euroclear and Clearstream to process payments to Russian residents.‚ÄùNSD confirmed it was receiving payments from Euroclear  but said it will not process these until Euroclear gets clarifications from European regulators.‚ÄúAfter curbs are lifted  payments will be processed‚Ä¶as usual ‚Äù it said.The daily Kommersant newspaper  citing a source at a large brokerage firm  said some Russian holders of Moscow‚Äôs sovereign bonds also hadn‚Äôt received payments. A source at a European-based fund told Reuters it too had not received a sovereign bond payment due on Monday.The Russian finance ministry  Russian Railways and Eurochem did not reply to requests for comment.‚ÄúDelays are possible for payments cleared via international depositories ‚Äù NSD added in a statement to Reuters.‚ÄúThis could be linked to ‚Äòmanual‚Äô processing of the orders linked to Russian companies as well as with a need to get clarifications from European regulators‚Äù.(Reporting by Reuters; Editing by Alexander Smith  Kirsten Donovan),negative,0.02,0.2,0.78,negative,0.01,0.22,0.77,True,English,"['Steel giant Severstal', 'first major default', 'Russia-Ukraine crisis', 'next international sovereign bond payment', 'Seaport Global credit analyst', 'foreign currency sovereign bonds', 'most international market bonds', 'March 16 coupon due date', 'international clearing houses', 'National Settlement Depository', 'daily Kommersant newspaper', 'Russian finance ministry', 'ITI Capital analysts', 'state-owned Russian Railways', 'latest Western sanctions', 'large brokerage firm', 'international bond payments', 'major Russian company', 'international bondholders', 'international depositories', 'global exchanges', 'corporate bonds', 'large stake', 'Russian government', 'Russian securities', 'Russian companies', 'Russian bondholders', 'Russian holders', 'Russian residents', 'steel firm', 'paying agent', 'Himanshu Porwal', 'coming days', 'constant discussions', 'special ‚Äúlicences', 'legal terms', 'asset ownership', 'domestic bondholders', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'legal action', 'unpaid amounts', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Polyus Gold', 'top steelmaker', 'fertiliser producer', 'legal grounds', 'European regulators', 'European-based fund', 'manual‚Äô processing', 'Alexander Smith', 'Kirsten Donovan', 'first default', 'DELAYS POSSIBLE', '2024 bond', 'Severstal default', 'source', 'money', 'Citibank', 'crisis', 'people', 'Mordashov', 'Wednesday', 'deadline', 'issues', 'application', 'Event', 'countersanctions', 'Moscow', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'NSD', 'group', 'banks', 'part', 'trades', 'result', 'requests', 'comment', 'Ukraine', 'year-end', 'Investors', 'right', 'laws', 'Gazprom', 'problems', 'NLMK', 'Eurochem', 'firms', 'Tuesday', 'foreigners', 'fact', 'transactions', 'clarifications', 'curbs', 'The', 'Reuters', 'Monday', 'statement', 'orders', 'need', 'Editing']",2022-03-23,2022-03-23,fxempire.com

LTI 2022 is based on similar principles as LTI 2019  LTI 2020 and LTI 2021.LTI 2022 is proposed to include a maximum of 150 senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group. In order to participate in LTI 2022 the participants will have to hold Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY within the scope of LTI 2022 (saving shares). For every saving share held  the company will grant so called performance awards free-of-charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2022 is to strengthen the ASSA ABLOY Group's ability to retain and recruit competent employees  to contribute to ASSA ABLOY providing a total remuneration that is on market conditions and competitive  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the employees concerned. Through a share-based long-term incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to ASSA ABLOY's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board of Directors believes that the implementation of LTI 2022 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group  including its sustainability  and consequently that LTI 2022 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personal investment in saving sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2022  the participants will have to hold saving shares. The saving shares can either be Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY that have vested or been used as saving shares under LTI 2019 or previous years' long-term incentive programs  or Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY purchased on the market in connection with the notification to participate in LTI 2022.The personal investment shall amount to a value corresponding to a minimum of 5 percent (all participants) and a maximum of 15 percent (CEO and other senior executives) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's fixed base salary. If the participant has access to inside information and is therefore prevented from making the personal investment in connection with the application to participate in LTI 2022  the personal investment shall be made as soon as possible  but no later than before the next Annual General Meeting.For employees who have not participated in previous LTI programs  the participation in LTI 2022 is  in addition  subject to renunciation of customary salary review for the year 2022.Participants in LTI 2022 and allocationLTI 2022 is proposed to include a maximum of 150 senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group  divided in three categories.For each saving share that the CEO of the Group holds under LTI 2022  the company will grant six performance awards. For each saving share that other senior executives (currently eight individuals) hold under LTI 2022  each such individual will be awarded five performance awards. For each saving share that other participants (approximately 140 individuals) hold under LTI 2022  each such individual will be awarded four performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of performance awards that gives right to receive Series B shares in the company depends on the annual development of ASSA ABLOY's earnings per share[1] based on the target levels  as defined by the Board of Directors  during the measurement period 1 January 2022 ‚Äì 31 December 2024  where each year during the measurement period is compared to the previous year. The outcome is calculated yearly  whereby one third of the performance awards is measured against the outcome for 2022  one third is measured against the outcome for 2023 and one third is measured against the outcome for 2024.The outcome for each year is measured linearly. Unless the minimum level is achieved for the year  none of the relevant performance awards will give right to Series B shares  and if the maximum level is achieved each performance award linked to the relevant year will give right to one Series B share. The Board of Directors intends to present the fulfilment of the performance based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2024.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.- The performance awards shall be granted free-of-charge after the 2022 Annual General Meeting.- Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free-of-charge three years after allotment of the award (vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  at the time of the release of the interim report for the first quarter 2025 still is employed by the ASSA ABLOY Group and has maintained the saving shares held under LTI 2022.- To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the vesting period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award gives right to after the vesting period.- The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.- The performance awards can be granted by the company or by any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board of Directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2022  in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the ASSA ABLOY Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2022 no longer are appropriate.In the event that the Board of Directors considers that the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2022 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2022 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 90 percent (CEO)  75 percent (other senior executives) or 40 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to a maximum personal investment  meaning that the participant must hold saving shares at a value that corresponds to 15 percent (CEO and other senior executives) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved. Full vesting is further subject to the saving shares being retained and that the participant  with some exceptions  is still employed during the vesting period.The total number of saving shares  which corresponds to the participant's total maximum personal investment  and thus the total number of performance awards being allotted  depends on the share price for the company's Series B share at the time of allotment of performance awards under LTI 2022. The total number of outstanding shares in the company amounts to 1 112 576 334 shares.Provided that the share price for the company's Series B share is traded at aroundSEK 265 at the time of allotment of performance awards under LTI 2022  LTI 2022 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise a maximum of 650 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.1 percent of the total outstanding shares and votes in the company.LTI 2022 shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Provided that the performance based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2022 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 160 million  allocated over the vesting period. Estimated social security costs and financing cost are included in such amount.The costs are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the ASSA ABLOY Group.The Board of Directors deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior executives and persons in senior managerial positions  which may be further increased through LTI 2022  outweighs the costs related to LTI 2022.Delivery of shares under LTI 2022To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2022  the company intends to enter into an agreement with a third party  under which the third party shall  in its own name  buy and transfer Series B shares in the company to the participants in accordance with LTI 2022.Preparation of the proposalLTI 2022 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of ASSA ABLOY  and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive programs. LTI 2022 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board of Directors.Previous incentive programsThe company's other share-based incentive programs LTI 2019  LTI 2020 and LTI 2021 are based on the similar principles as LTI 2022.

Cars drive along Tverskaya street with the towers of the State Historical Museum and the Kremlin in the background  in central Moscow  Russia  March 23  2022.Western sanctions and countersanctions by Moscow mean that the payment process on hard currency bonds issued by Russia or Russian companies has become much more complicatedRussian holders of domestic corporate Eurobonds face delays in receiving payments settled through international agents  as transactions get snarled up by sanctions  Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository (NSD)  companies  and analysts said.Western sanctions and countersanctions by Moscow mean that the payment process on hard currency bonds issued by Russia or Russian companies has become much more complicated  with some payments delayed or getting stuck in transit.Russian sovereign and corporate Eurobond payments were previously processed by international clearing and settlement firms such as Clearstream and Euroclear  which process payments and confirm ownership of assets before sending cash to Western bondholders and then to NSD for domestic holders.Euroclear  owned by exchanges and banks  and Clearstream  part of Deutsche Boerse  said they would stop settling trades in Russian securities in response to European Union sanctions after last month‚Äôs Russian invasion of Ukraine  which Moscow describes as a ‚Äústrategic military operation.‚Äù‚ÄúDelays are possible for payments cleared via international depositories ‚Äù NSD said in a statement to Reuters.‚ÄúThis could be linked to ‚Äòmanual‚Äô processing of the orders linked to Russian companies as well as with a need to get clarifications from European regulators ‚Äù NSD added.Clearstream and Euroclear did not respond to requests for comment.Payments affectedRussian companies are due to pay $18.5 billion in external debt  including interest payments known as coupons  by year-end  ITI Capital analysts estimate  and the Russian finance ministry is due to pay another $3.4 billion in sovereign Eurobonds.Russian holders of at least four corporate Eurobonds are struggling to get payments  the firms themselves and ITI Capital say  namely steelmakers NLMK and Severstal  state-owned Russian Railways  and fertilizer producer Eurochem.NLMK  Russia‚Äôs top steelmaker  said in a statement on Tuesday  March 22  that had it paid a coupon on its Eurobond due in 2024 and foreign noteholders started to receive their coupon payments  while Russian holders did not.‚ÄúThis is due to the fact that‚Ä¶Euroclear and Clearstream are no longer settling transactions with Russia‚Äôs NSD. We currently see no legal grounds prohibiting Euroclear and Clearstream to process payments to Russian residents ‚Äù it said.Severstal  whose main shareholder  Alexei Mordashov  was sanctioned by the EU on February 28  is also having trouble with the processing of its Eurobond coupon payment.The payment sent last week by Severstal for the coupon on its 2024 loan participation notes (LPN) has yet to be processed by Citibank  with the grace period set to expire on Wednesday  March 23  a source close to Severstal told Reuters on Tuesday.Russian Railways and Eurochem did not reply to Reuters requests for a comment.In a separate statement  NSD said that it is receiving Eurobond payments from Euroclear  but will not process these until Euroclear gets clarification from European regulators.NSD said it is not getting payments from Clearstream.‚ÄúAfter curbs are lifted  payments will be processed‚Ä¶as usual ‚Äù NSD said.Dmitry Lesnov  head of the customer service department at Finam  said that his company is not receiving payments made via Euroclear or Clearstream and is awaiting further clarification.Coupon payments due over the next few days include from Gazprom and SIBUR on Wednesday  Russian Railways on Friday  March 25  and Polyus Gold on Monday  March 28  the same day Russia is due to make its next international bond payment.The Russian finance ministry made a $117-million and a $66-million Eurobond coupon payment recently  with foreign bondholders receiving their funds.Kommersant daily newspaper  citing a source at a large brokerage firm  said on Wednesday that some Russian holders of sovereign Eurobonds had not received coupon payments.The finance ministry did not reply to a request for a comment. ‚Äì Rappler.com,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,negative,0.01,0.24,0.75,True,English,"['Russian corporate Eurobond holders', 'Sanctions', 'payments', 'next international bond payment', '$66-million Eurobond coupon payment', 'State Historical Museum', 'hard currency bonds', 'strategic military operation', '2024 loan participation notes', 'customer service department', 'Kommersant daily newspaper', 'large brokerage firm', 'National Settlement Depository', 'four corporate Eurobonds', 'domestic corporate Eurobonds', 'Russian finance ministry', 'state-owned Russian Railways', 'European Union sanctions', 'corporate Eurobond payments', 'ITI Capital analysts', 'payment process', 'international agents', 'international clearing', 'domestic holders', 'international depositories', 'sovereign Eurobonds', 'European regulators', 'Russian holders', 'Russian sovereign', 'Russian securities', 'Russian invasion', 'Russian residents', 'Tverskaya street', 'Western sanctions', 'settlement firms', 'Western bondholders', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'last month', 'external debt', 'fertilizer producer', 'top steelmaker', 'foreign noteholders', 'legal grounds', 'main shareholder', 'Alexei Mordashov', 'grace period', 'Dmitry Lesnov', 'Polyus Gold', 'foreign bondholders', 'Russian companies', 'coupon payments', 'manual‚Äô processing', 'interest payments', 'separate statement', 'central Moscow', 'Reuters requests', 'Cars', 'towers', 'Kremlin', 'background', 'countersanctions', 'delays', 'transactions', 'NSD', 'transit', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'ownership', 'assets', 'cash', 'exchanges', 'banks', 'trades', 'response', 'Ukraine', 'orders', 'need', 'clarifications', 'comment', 'coupons', 'year-end', 'steelmakers', 'NLMK', 'Severstal', 'Eurochem', 'Tuesday', 'March', 'fact', 'February', 'trouble', 'LPN', 'Citibank', 'Wednesday', 'source', 'curbs', 'head', 'Finam', 'company', 'days', 'Gazprom', 'SIBUR', 'Friday', 'Monday', 'funds', 'Rappler']",2022-03-23,2022-03-23,rappler.com

The Board of Directors considers that these programs fulfill their purpose of aligning the interests of the participants and the shareholders  strengthening the Sandvik Group's ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees and strengthening Sandvik's focus and objective to meet its long-term business goals. Accordingly  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve on a long-term incentive program for senior executives and key employees for 2022 (""LTI 2022"") on the below terms and conditions.GeneralLTI 2022 encompasses approximately 350 senior executives and key contributors in the Sandvik Group. Due to the planned spin-off and subsequent listing of Sandvik's business area Sandvik Materials Technology (""SMT listing"")  SMT employees will not be offered participation in LTI 2022. The maximum number of Sandvik shares that can be allocated pursuant to LTI 2022 is 1.9 million shares  which corresponds to approximately 0.15 percent of the number of outstanding shares in Sandvik.In order to participate in LTI 2022 the employee is required to invest in Sandvik shares at market price no later than June 30  2022 (""Investment Shares""). In the event that the employee is not able to invest before this date due to being entered in an insider list (logbook) kept by Sandvik  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to postpone the date of investment for such employee. The employee may within the scope of LTI 2022 invest up to an amount corresponding to 10 percent of the employee's fixed annual salary before tax at the time of the investment.Provided such acquisition of Investment Shares is made  participants of LTI 2022 will be entitled to allotment of Sandvik shares  free of charge  after a period of three years on the terms and conditions set forth below.Performance SharesEach acquired Investment Share entitles participants to be allotted Sandvik shares provided certain performance targets are met (""Performance Shares""). The maximum number of Performance Shares that may be allotted for each acquired Investment Share depends on the Participant's program category as follows:8 for the President 7 for each additional member of the Group Executive Management (currently 9persons) persons)  6 for each senior manager (approximately 60 persons)  and5 for each key contributor (approximately 280 persons).Each member of the Group Executive Management  with the exception of SMT's President  shall nominate the persons that are to be offered participation in LTI 2022 and that are to be classified as senior manager and key contributor  respectively  based on position  qualification and individual performance. All nominations are to be approved by the President and CEO.The number of Performance Shares that will finally be allotted to the participant for each acquired Investment Share is dependent on the development of the Sandvik Group adjusted Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")  excluding amortizations and other accounting effects arising from business combinations  during the financial year 2022 (""EPS 2022"")  compared to adjusted EPS  excluding amortizations and other accounting effects arising from business combinations  for the financial year 2021 (""EPS 2021""). Subject to the SMT listing taking place  EPS 2021 and EPS 2022 will exclude SMT. The Board of Directors establishes the levels regarding adjusted EPS that must be attained for allotment of a certain number of Performance Shares. Allotment will take place as follows:One Performance Share will be allotted for each acquired Investment Share if EPS 2022 exceeds EPS 2021.In order for any remaining Performance Shares to be allotted EPS 2022 growth must exceed 5 percent in relation to EPS 2021. The EPS growth required for the maximum number of Performance Shares to be allotted for each acquired Investment Share is established by the Board of Directors.The level required for maximum allotment and the extent to which the established levels are attained will be disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report.Prerequisites for allotmentThe allotment of Performance Shares requires continuous employment and that all Investment Shares be held during a period of three years from the acquisition of the Investment Shares (""Vesting Period""). The Chairman of the Board of Directors may in special cases grant exemptions from these requirements for individual participants  whereas the Board of Directors may decide on any such exemption concerning groups of participants.If the prerequisites for allotment set forth for LTI 2022 are met  allotment of Performance Shares will take place during 2025  and no later than June 30  2025. The allotment will take place free of charge  subject to tax.Adjustment of the number of Performance Shares etc.Before the allotment of Performance Shares takes place  the Board of Directors shall consider whether the number of Performance Shares is reasonable taking into account the financial results and position of Sandvik  the impact of larger acquisitions  divestments and other significant capital transactions  stock market conditions and other circumstances. If the Board of Directors deems that this is not the case  the Board of Directors shall reduce the number of Performance Shares to the lower number the Board of Directors finds appropriate or decide that no allotment should take place.In the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue and/or other similar events in Sandvik  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to decide on the recalculation of the terms of LTI 2022.An alternative cash based incentive solution may be implemented for participants incountries where the acquisition of Investment Shares or allotment of Performance Shares is not appropriate  or if such solution is otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive solution shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTI 2022. The President and CEO shall be authorized to decide which persons that should be offered participation in the cash based incentive solution.The Board of Directors  or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors for this purpose  shall be responsible for the detailed design and administration of LTI 2022 based on the main terms set forth herein.The right to be allotted Performance Shares cannot be transferred and does not give the participant a right to compensation for dividend distributed during the Vesting Period with respect to the underlying shares.Costs of LTI 2022 and hedging arrangementsThe number of Sandvik shares that will be needed for LTI 2022 will depend on the Sandvik share price at investment and the participation rate. To secure an adequate number of shares  given the increased market volatility  a Sandvik share price of SEK 160 has been used when calculating the maximum number of shares needed. Based on this share price the total cost of LTI 2022 is estimated at up to SEK 333 million. The costs have been calculated as the sum of personnel costs  including social security costs of SEK 55 million  and administration costs of approximately SEK 2 million for the program. Based on a share price of SEK 235 (which would result in fewer Sandvik shares being needed) the total cost is estimated at up to SEK 346 million  of which SEK 57 million constitutes social security cost and approximately SEK 2 million constitutes administration costs. The costs for LTI 2022 will be allocated over the years 2022‚Äì2024.Sandvik intends to secure its commitment to deliver Sandvik shares under LTI 2022 through a share swap agreement with a third party. The interest cost for such a share swap is estimated at approximately SEK 1.4 million per year based on the current interest levels  regardless of whether the calculation is based on a share price of SEK 160 or SEK 235. Against this cost  however  stands the value of possible dividends.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal has been prepared by the Board's Remuneration Committee and has been discussed and resolved on by the Board of Directors. The President has not taken part in the Board of Directors' discussion and resolution with respect to the proposal.Majority requirementThe resolution regarding LTI 2022 requires a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Meeting.OtherFor a description of other long-term incentive programs within Sandvik reference is made to note G4 in Sandvik's 2021 Annual Report and to the Company's website.Item 19 ‚Äì Authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of the Company's own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to  for the period until the 2023 Annual General Meeting  resolve on acquisitions of the Company's own shares in accordance with the following conditions.Acquisitions shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm.Acquisitions may only be made at a price per share within the price range (spread) applicable from time to time  meaning the spread between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price prevailing and disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time.The Company may acquire a maximum number of shares so that the Company's holding at any time does not exceed 10 per cent of the total number of shares in the Company.The authorization may be utilized on one or several occasions up to the 2023 Annual General Meeting.The purpose of the authorization is to enable the Board of Directors to continuously adapt the Company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value.In order for the resolution on authorization to be valid  it must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.Item 20 ‚Äì Resolution on amendment to the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve to amend the Articles of Association as proposed below:¬ß 6Insofar as it is elected at a General Meeting of the Shareholders  the Board shall consist of not less than five and not more than eight Directors and not more than five Deputy Directors. ¬ß 6Insofar as it is elected at a General Meeting of the Shareholders  the Board shall consist of not less than five and not more than ten Directors. ¬ß 11 The following matters shall be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting:[‚Ä¶]10. determination of the number of Directors and Deputy Directors;[‚Ä¶] ¬ß 11 The following matters shall be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting:[‚Ä¶]10. determination of the number of Directors;[‚Ä¶]The Board of Directors currently consists of eight Board members elected by the General Meeting  i.e. the maximum permitted by the Articles of Association.

This will provide near-real-time 24/7 settlement capability for central bank money-like digital cash assets  and facilitate interoperability with other platforms. The aim is to allow banks to significantly reduce intraday liquidity requirements  and unlock the institutional potential of tokenized financial markets.Recently Euroclear led an experiment using central bank digital currency (CBDC) to settle French government bond transactions using DLT. The project  commissioned by the French central bank  showed it is possible to manage post-trade operations in CBDC  the report said.BIS Innovation HubEuroclear's announcement comes the same day the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said its innovation hub developed two prototypes for a common international settlement platform for using multiple central bank digital currencies (mCBDCs).The project  dubbed Dunbar  also showed that financial institutions could use CBDCs issued by participating central banks to transact directly with each other on a shared platform  according to BIS.¬´Project Dunbar marks a key milestone in advancing the efficiency of cross border payments globally. The strong collaboration between participating central banks  commercial banks and technology solution providers has established the foundation for developing future ready payment rails ¬ª said Sopnendu Mohanty  the chief fintech officer of the Monetary Authority of SingaporeSwiss Banks ParticipateFounded in 2019  Fnality‚Äôs shareholders include UBS  Credit Suisse  ING and Nasdaq  among others.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,True,English,"['Blockchain Capabilities', 'Euroclear', 'multiple central bank digital currencies', 'future ready payment rails', 'French government bond transactions', 'real-time 24/7 settlement capability', 'distributed Financial Market Infrastructures', 'central bank digital currency', 'Post trade services provider', 'common international settlement platform', 'French central bank', 'central bank money', 'distributed ledger technology', 'cross-border securities transactions', 'intraday liquidity requirements', 'cross border payments', 'technology solution providers', 'chief fintech officer', 'participating central banks', 'international banking consortium', 'tokenized financial markets', 'digital cash assets', 'BIS Innovation Hub', 'digital securities', 'custody services', 'tokenized assets', 'International Settlements', 'financial institutions', 'blockchain consortium', 'shared platform', 'commercial banks', 'Swiss Banks', 'innovative solutions', 'Test Phase', 'global roll-out', 'other platforms', 'institutional potential', 'post-trade operations', 'two prototypes', 'key milestone', 'strong collaboration', 'Sopnendu Mohanty', 'Monetary Authority', 'Credit Suisse', 'Project Dunbar', 'BIS.', 'Euroclear', 'trades', 'domestic', 'Tuesday', 'investment', 'Fnality', 'adoption', 'partnership', 'DLT', 'dFMIs', 'network', 'interoperability', 'aim', 'experiment', 'CBDC', 'report', 'announcement', 'efficiency', 'foundation', 'Singapore', 'shareholders', 'UBS', 'Nasdaq', 'others']",2022-03-22,2022-03-23,finews.com

We currently see no legal grounds prohibiting Euroclear and Clearstream to process payments to Russian residents ‚Äù it said.Severstal  whose main shareholder  Alexey Mordashov  was sanctioned by the EU on Feb. 28  is also having trouble with the processing of its Eurobond coupon payment.The payment sent last week by Severstal for the coupon on its 2024 loan participation notes (LPN) has yet to be processed by Citibank  with the grace period set to expire on Wednesday  a source close to Severstal told Reuters on Tuesday.Russian Railways and Eurochem did not reply to Reuters requests for a comment.In a separate statement  NSD said that it is receiving Eurobond payments from Euroclear  but will not process these until Euroclear gets clarification from European regulators.NSD said it is not getting payments from Clearstream.‚ÄúAfter curbs are lifted  payments will be processed‚Ä¶ as usual ‚Äù NSD said.Dmitry Lesnov  head of the customer service department at Finam  said that his company is not receiving payments made via Euroclear or Clearstream and is awaiting further clarification.Coupon payments due over the next few days include from Gazprom and SIBUR on Wednesday  Russian Railways on March 25 and Polyus Gold on March 28  the same day Russia is due to make its next international bond payment.The Russian finance ministry made a $117 million and a $66 million Eurobond coupon payment recently  with foreign bondholders receiving their funds.Kommersant daily newspaper  citing a source at a large brokerage firm  said on Wednesday that some Russian holders of sovereign Eurobonds had not received coupon payments.The finance ministry did not reply to a request for a comment.(Reporting by Reuters; additional reporting by Karin Strohecker and Marc Jones in London; Editing by Alexander Smith),negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,negative,0.01,0.24,0.75,True,English,"['Russian corporate Eurobond holders', 'Sanctions', 'payments', 'next international bond payment', '$66 million Eurobond coupon payment', 'hard currency bonds', 'strategic military operation', '2024 loan participation notes', 'customer service department', 'Kommersant daily newspaper', 'large brokerage firm', 'National Settlement Depository', 'four corporate Eurobonds', 'domestic corporate Eurobonds', 'state-owned Russian Railways', 'Russian finance ministry', 'European Union sanctions', 'corporate Eurobond payments', 'ITI Capital analysts', 'payment process', 'international agents', 'international clearing', 'domestic holders', 'international depositories', 'sovereign Eurobonds', 'European regulators', 'Russian holders', 'Russian sovereign', 'Russian securities', 'Russian invasion', 'Russian residents', 'Western sanctions', 'settlement firms', 'Western bondholders', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'last month', 'external debt', 'fertilizer producer', 'top steelmaker', 'foreign noteholders', 'legal grounds', 'main shareholder', 'Alexey Mordashov', 'grace period', 'Dmitry Lesnov', 'Polyus Gold', 'foreign bondholders', 'additional reporting', 'Karin Strohecker', 'Marc Jones', 'Alexander Smith', 'Russian companies', 'coupon payments', 'manual‚Äô processing', 'interest payments', 'separate statement', 'Reuters requests', 'delays', 'transactions', 'NSD', 'countersanctions', 'Moscow', 'transit', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'ownership', 'assets', 'cash', 'exchanges', 'banks', 'trades', 'response', 'Ukraine', 'orders', 'need', 'clarifications', 'comment', 'coupons', 'year-end', 'steelmakers', 'NLMK', 'Severstal', 'Eurochem', 'Tuesday', 'fact', 'Feb.', 'trouble', 'LPN', 'Citibank', 'Wednesday', 'source', 'curbs', 'head', 'Finam', 'company', 'days', 'Gazprom', 'SIBUR', 'March', 'funds', 'London', 'Editing']",2022-03-23,2022-03-23,kfgo.com

LTI 2022 is based on similar principles as LTI 2019  LTI 2020 and LTI 2021.LTI 2022 is proposed to include a maximum of 150 senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group. In order to participate in LTI 2022 the participants will have to hold Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY within the scope of LTI 2022 (saving shares). For every saving share held  the company will grant so called performance awards free-of-charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2022 is to strengthen the ASSA ABLOY Group's ability to retain and recruit competent employees  to contribute to ASSA ABLOY providing a total remuneration that is on market conditions and competitive  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the employees concerned. Through a share-based long-term incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to ASSA ABLOY's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board of Directors believes that the implementation of LTI 2022 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group  including its sustainability  and consequently that LTI 2022 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personal investment in saving sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2022  the participants will have to hold saving shares. The saving shares can either be Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY that have vested or been used as saving shares under LTI 2019 or previous years' long-term incentive programs  or Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY purchased on the market in connection with the notification to participate in LTI 2022.The personal investment shall amount to a value corresponding to a minimum of 5 percent (all participants) and a maximum of 15 percent (CEO and other senior executives) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's fixed base salary. If the participant has access to inside information and is therefore prevented from making the personal investment in connection with the application to participate in LTI 2022  the personal investment shall be made as soon as possible  but no later than before the next Annual General Meeting.For employees who have not participated in previous LTI programs  the participation in LTI 2022 is  in addition  subject to renunciation of customary salary review for the year 2022.Participants in LTI 2022 and allocationLTI 2022 is proposed to include a maximum of 150 senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group  divided in three categories.For each saving share that the CEO of the Group holds under LTI 2022  the company will grant six performance awards. For each saving share that other senior executives (currently eight individuals) hold under LTI 2022  each such individual will be awarded five performance awards. For each saving share that other participants (approximately 140 individuals) hold under LTI 2022  each such individual will be awarded four performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of performance awards that gives right to receive Series B shares in the company depends on the annual development of ASSA ABLOY's earnings per share[1] based on the target levels  as defined by the Board of Directors  during the measurement period 1 January 2022 ‚Äì 31 December 2024  where each year during the measurement period is compared to the previous year. The outcome is calculated yearly  whereby one third of the performance awards is measured against the outcome for 2022  one third is measured against the outcome for 2023 and one third is measured against the outcome for 2024.The outcome for each year is measured linearly. Unless the minimum level is achieved for the year  none of the relevant performance awards will give right to Series B shares  and if the maximum level is achieved each performance award linked to the relevant year will give right to one Series B share. The Board of Directors intends to present the fulfilment of the performance based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2024.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.- The performance awards shall be granted free-of-charge after the 2022 Annual General Meeting.- Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free-of-charge three years after allotment of the award (vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  at the time of the release of the interim report for the first quarter 2025 still is employed by the ASSA ABLOY Group and has maintained the saving shares held under LTI 2022.- To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the vesting period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award gives right to after the vesting period.- The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.- The performance awards can be granted by the company or by any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board of Directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2022  in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the ASSA ABLOY Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2022 no longer are appropriate.In the event that the Board of Directors considers that the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2022 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2022 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 90 percent (CEO)  75 percent (other senior executives) or 40 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to a maximum personal investment  meaning that the participant must hold saving shares at a value that corresponds to 15 percent (CEO and other senior executives) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved. Full vesting is further subject to the saving shares being retained and that the participant  with some exceptions  is still employed during the vesting period.The total number of saving shares  which corresponds to the participant's total maximum personal investment  and thus the total number of performance awards being allotted  depends on the share price for the company's Series B share at the time of allotment of performance awards under LTI 2022.

March. 23  2022 07:48. weappon@donga.com.With the Joe Biden administration issuing a series of warnings about China‚Äôs material support to Russia  Foreign Affairs reported on Tuesday (local time) there are signs that China helped Russia hide billions of dollars in Treasury securities offshore. U.S. President Biden plans to visit Europe on Thursday to discuss countermeasures against China‚Äôs support to Russia.Benn Steil  a senior fellow and director of international economics at Council on Foreign Relations (CFR)  and CFR analyst Benjamin Della Rocca argued in the contributing article that Russia may have ‚Äúsecluded up to $80 billion in Treasury securities offshore‚Äù in mid-2018 and in late 2021.They pointed out that Russia‚Äôs holdings of Treasury securities plunged from $96 billion to $15 billion in 2018  but in fact  Russia only sold about $43 billion of them. During the same period  however  there were rises in holdings of Treasuries in the Cayman Islands and Belgium‚Äôs international custodial bank Euroclear  which are the two most notorious tax havens on earth  by $20 billion and $25 billion  respectively.In December last year  when Russia was preparing for an invasion into Ukraine  Euroclear‚Äôs Treasury bond holdings surged by $47 billion. According to the article  it coincides with the time  when Russia‚Äôs central bank reported an increase of $41 billion in its currency and deposits held at ‚Äúother national central banks.‚Äù Based on this  the article raised a possibility that Russia deposited $41 billion with the People‚Äôs Bank of China (PBOC) and the Chinese central bank exchanged it for dollars  allowing Russia to hide the money at Euroclear.‚ÄúSuch an arrangement would explain why the PBOC‚Äôs currency and deposits with China-headquartered banks jumped by an unprecedented $13 billion last December ‚Äù wrote Steil  pointing out that Russia would be able to withdraw the dollars whenever it pleases.ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥,negative,0.04,0.44,0.52,negative,0.01,0.24,0.74,True,English,"['Treasury securities', 'Evidence', 'China', 'Russia', 'two most notorious tax havens', 'CFR analyst Benjamin Della Rocca', 'U.S. President Biden', 'other national central banks', 'international custodial bank Euroclear', 'Joe Biden administration', 'Chinese central bank', 'Treasury bond holdings', 'international economics', 'China-headquartered banks', 'Treasury securities', 'Foreign Affairs', 'Foreign Relations', 'same period', 'Cayman Islands', 'material support', 'local time', 'Benn Steil', 'contributing article', 'Evidence', 'Russia', 'March', 'donga', 'series', 'warnings', 'Tuesday', 'signs', 'billions', 'dollars', 'Europe', 'Thursday', 'countermeasures', 'senior', 'fellow', 'director', 'Council', 'mid', 'late', 'fact', 'rises', 'Treasuries', 'Belgium', 'earth', 'December', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'increase', 'currency', 'deposits', 'possibility', 'People', 'PBOC', 'money', 'arrangement', 'unprecedented', 'ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥']",2022-03-23,2022-03-23,donga.com

The Company has duly performed its obligations under the Notes in accordance with their terms.The Company has received a confirmation that foreign noteholders started to receive their coupon payments.However  the coupon payments did not reach the noteholders based in Russia. This is due to the fact that International Central Securities Depositories Euroclear and Clearstream are no longer settling transactions with Russia's National Settlement Depository. We currently see no legal grounds prohibiting Euroclear and Clearstream to process payments to Russian residents.Novolipetsk Steel remains fully committed to perform its obligations towards noteholders irrespective of the jurisdiction.

1292,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/russia-makes-us-66m-coupon-transfer-as-investors-wait-1.1741066,Russia‚Äôs US$66M coupon moves a step closer to bondholders,1 day ago,Foreign holders of Russia‚Äôs sovereign bond maturing in 2029 are watching as the latest debt payment from the sanctioned nation draws closer to completion.The US$66 million coupon due March 21 was processed Tuesday by Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository  it said in a statement. Earlier in the day  the Finance Ministry said it had transferred the cash to the NSD  thus meeting its obligations ‚Äúin full.‚Äù Four bondholders in Europe said they hadn‚Äôt received the payment as of 3.40 p.m. in London.From this point  the cash would typically journey to custodian banks  which hold assets for safekeeping  then to bondholders‚Äô accounts. But given the sweeping sanctions in place against Russia following President Vladimir Putin‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine  concerns will remain until the money actually lands in investors‚Äô accounts.Billions of dollars of Russian government and company debt have been put in question after as much as two thirds of the country‚Äôs foreign currency reserves were frozen  as well as the overseas assets of numerous billionaires. Russia has at least US$400 million of interest payments coming due over the next 10 weeks  as well as a US$2 billion bond it must repay next month  data compiled by Bloomberg show. Last week  the government paid US$117 million in coupon payments.‚ÄúUsing up their very finite foreign-currency reserves could be a good long term investment -- but that thinking clearly hasn‚Äôt been applied to the management of their reputation anywhere else ‚Äù said Gordon Shannon  a portfolio manager at TwentyFour Asset Management.FINANCIAL PLUMBINGUnlike the terms of the bonds with coupon payments last week  the March 2029 prospectus has a ruble-fallback option  which allows Russia to make the transfer in its local currency. That‚Äôs raised questions about the ultimate denomination of the payment and prompted investors to track it from the start.Russia sent the cash to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  which processed the payment after getting approvals from the U.S. Treasury Department  according to a person familiar with the matter  confirming a Reuters report earlier. Unlike the payment of the previous week  this bond‚Äôs prospectus states that the coupon settlement would be done through Russia‚Äôs central securities depository and Euroclear  one of the world‚Äôs biggest clearing houses. JPMorgan declined to comment earlier.It‚Äôs not a process investors typically follow. The back-office moves took center stage after sanctions and capital controls were imposed on Russia  and investors braced for a default. For now  the process is working  and not just for the sovereign.Credit Bank of Moscow  a lender the Russian central bank has designated systemically important  said it fulfilled an obligation to make a US$9.7 million coupon payment on its US$500 million September 2026 bond. Two bondholders  who declined to be named as they aren‚Äôt authorized to speak publicly about the matter  said they had received payment.Online lender Tinkoff Bank also paid its debt interest on time on its perpetual dollar-denominated notes.

1293,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.metro.us/steel-giant-severstal-scrambles/,Steel giant Severstal scrambles to avoid first major default of Russia-Ukraine crisis ‚Äì Metro US,"""at-above-post addthis_tool"" data-url="" -Russian steel giant Severstal was racing against the clock on Wednesday to avoid becoming the country‚Äôs first major corporate default since the Ukraine crisis began ",(Reuters) -Russian steel giant Severstal was racing against the clock on Wednesday to avoid becoming the country‚Äôs first major corporate default since the Ukraine crisis began  with international payment lines snarled by sanctions.Severstal  whose main shareholder Alexey Mordashov is one of a number of wealthy Russians now sanctioned by the European Union  has until the end of the day to get an already overdue $12.6 million loan ‚Äòcoupon‚Äô payment to its creditors.A source close to the steel firm said the money had been transferred last week but was yet to be processed and passed on by its paying agent Citibank.‚ÄúThis will technically be the first default since the crisis began to unfold ‚Äù Seaport Global credit analyst Himanshu Porwal said.‚ÄúBut people will know it is driven by the way the sanctions have been formulated  rather than the company‚Äôs fault ‚Äù adding Severstal might find a way to make the payment in the coming days  especially if Mordashov were to cut or relinquish his large stake in the firm  which itself is not sanctioned.With Wednesday‚Äôs deadline fast approaching Severstal said it had been in constant discussions about the issues  and that it was looking at an application for special ‚Äúlicences‚Äù that may be required to make the payment.The legal terms of the bonds state an ‚ÄúEvent of Default‚Äù can be formally declared five working days after the March 16 coupon due date.The latest Western sanctions and countersanctions by Moscow mean that transferring payments on Russian government and corporate bonds has become complex.Previously payments like Severstal‚Äôs would have been processed by international clearing houses such as Clearstream or Euroclear  which confirm asset ownership  and also funnel payments for domestic bondholders to Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository (NSD).However both Euroclear  owned by a group of global exchanges and banks  and Clearstream  part of Deutsche Boerse  have said they will stop settling trades in Russian securities as a result of the EU‚Äôs sanctions.Neither Clearstream  Euroclear nor Citigroup responded to requests for comment.DELAYS POSSIBLEA Severstal default would be the first by a major Russian company since Moscow was blanketed by sanctions for what it calls its ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù in Ukraine  but it may not be alone.Russian companies need to make $18.5 billion of international bond payments by year-end  ITI Capital analysts estimate  while Moscow needs to pay another $3.4 billion on its foreign currency sovereign bonds.Investors would have the right to take legal action to reclaim unpaid amounts  most likely in the United Kingdom or the United States ‚Äì under whose laws most international market bonds are issued.Payments due in coming days include from Gazprom  which made a payment without problems earlier this month  Russian Railways on March 25 and Polyus Gold on March 28  the same day as Russia‚Äôs next international sovereign bond payment falls due.It‚Äôs not just international bondholders who are affected. Severstal  Russia‚Äôs top steelmaker NLMK  state-owned Russian Railways and fertiliser producer Eurochem are all struggling to get payments to Russian bondholders  the firms themselves and ITI Capital say.NLMK said on Tuesday it had paid a coupon on a 2024 bond but while foreigners had started to receive their money  Russian holders hadn‚Äôt.‚ÄúThis is due to the fact that‚Ä¶ Euroclear and Clearstream are no longer settling transactions with Russia‚Äôs NSD ‚Äù NLMK said. ‚ÄúWe currently see no legal grounds prohibiting Euroclear and Clearstream to process payments to Russian residents.‚ÄùNSD confirmed it was receiving payments from Euroclear  but said it will not process these until Euroclear gets clarifications from European regulators.‚ÄúAfter curbs are lifted  payments will be processed‚Ä¶as usual ‚Äù it said.The daily Kommersant newspaper  citing a source at a large brokerage firm  said some Russian holders of Moscow‚Äôs sovereign bonds also hadn‚Äôt received payments. A source at a European-based fund told Reuters it too had not received a sovereign bond payment due on Monday.The Russian finance ministry  Russian Railways and Eurochem did not reply to requests for comment.‚ÄúDelays are possible for payments cleared via international depositories ‚Äù NSD added in a statement to Reuters.‚ÄúThis could be linked to ‚Äòmanual‚Äô processing of the orders linked to Russian companies as well as with a need to get clarifications from European regulators‚Äù.(Reporting by Reuters; Editing by Alexander Smith  Kirsten Donovan),negative,0.02,0.34,0.64,negative,0.01,0.2,0.78,True,English,"['Steel giant Severstal', 'first major default', 'Russia-Ukraine crisis', 'Metro US', 'overdue $12.6 million loan ‚Äòcoupon‚Äô payment', 'next international sovereign bond payment', 'Seaport Global credit analyst', 'foreign currency sovereign bonds', 'most international market bonds', 'March 16 coupon due date', 'first major corporate default', 'Russian steel giant Severstal', 'international clearing houses', 'National Settlement Depository', 'daily Kommersant newspaper', 'international payment lines', 'Russian finance ministry', 'ITI Capital analysts', 'major Russian company', 'state-owned Russian Railways', 'large brokerage firm', 'latest Western sanctions', 'international bond payments', 'corporate bonds', 'first default', 'international bondholders', 'international depositories', 'steel firm', 'global exchanges', 'large stake', 'Russian government', 'Russian securities', 'Russian companies', 'Russian bondholders', 'Russian holders', 'Russian residents', 'main shareholder', 'wealthy Russians', 'European Union', 'paying agent', 'Himanshu Porwal', 'coming days', 'constant discussions', 'special ‚Äúlicences', 'legal terms', 'asset ownership', 'domestic bondholders', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'legal action', 'unpaid amounts', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Polyus Gold', 'top steelmaker', 'fertiliser producer', 'legal grounds', 'European regulators', 'European-based fund', 'manual‚Äô processing', 'Alexander Smith', 'Kirsten Donovan', 'Severstal default', 'Alexey Mordashov', 'DELAYS POSSIBLE', 'Ukraine crisis', '2024 bond', 'Reuters', 'clock', 'Wednesday', 'country', 'number', 'end', 'creditors', 'source', 'money', 'Citibank', 'people', 'deadline', 'issues', 'application', 'Event', 'countersanctions', 'Moscow', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'NSD', 'group', 'banks', 'part', 'trades', 'result', 'requests', 'comment', 'Investors', 'right', 'laws', 'Gazprom', 'problems', 'NLMK', 'Eurochem', 'firms', 'Tuesday', 'foreigners', 'fact', 'transactions', 'clarifications', 'curbs', 'The', 'Monday', 'statement', 'orders', 'need', 'Editing']",2022-03-23,2022-03-23,metro.us

The Board of Directors considers that these programs fulfill their purpose of aligning the interests of the participants and the shareholders  strengthening the Sandvik Group's ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees and strengthening Sandvik's focus and objective to meet its long-term business goals. Accordingly  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve on a long-term incentive program for senior executives and key employees for 2022 (""LTI 2022"") on the below terms and conditions.GeneralLTI 2022 encompasses approximately 350 senior executives and key contributors in the Sandvik Group. Due to the planned spin-off and subsequent listing of Sandvik's business area Sandvik Materials Technology (""SMT listing"")  SMT employees will not be offered participation in LTI 2022. The maximum number of Sandvik shares that can be allocated pursuant to LTI 2022 is 1.9 million shares  which corresponds to approximately 0.15 percent of the number of outstanding shares in Sandvik.In order to participate in LTI 2022 the employee is required to invest in Sandvik shares at market price no later than June 30  2022 (""Investment Shares""). In the event that the employee is not able to invest before this date due to being entered in an insider list (logbook) kept by Sandvik  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to postpone the date of investment for such employee. The employee may within the scope of LTI 2022 invest up to an amount corresponding to 10 percent of the employee's fixed annual salary before tax at the time of the investment.Provided such acquisition of Investment Shares is made  participants of LTI 2022 will be entitled to allotment of Sandvik shares  free of charge  after a period of three years on the terms and conditions set forth below.Performance SharesEach acquired Investment Share entitles participants to be allotted Sandvik shares provided certain performance targets are met (""Performance Shares""). The maximum number of Performance Shares that may be allotted for each acquired Investment Share depends on the Participant's program category as follows:8 for the President 7 for each additional member of the Group Executive Management (currently 9persons) persons)  6 for each senior manager (approximately 60 persons)  and5 for each key contributor (approximately 280 persons).Each member of the Group Executive Management  with the exception of SMT's President  shall nominate the persons that are to be offered participation in LTI 2022 and that are to be classified as senior manager and key contributor  respectively  based on position  qualification and individual performance. All nominations are to be approved by the President and CEO.The number of Performance Shares that will finally be allotted to the participant for each acquired Investment Share is dependent on the development of the Sandvik Group adjusted Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")  excluding amortizations and other accounting effects arising from business combinations  during the financial year 2022 (""EPS 2022"")  compared to adjusted EPS  excluding amortizations and other accounting effects arising from business combinations  for the financial year 2021 (""EPS 2021""). Subject to the SMT listing taking place  EPS 2021 and EPS 2022 will exclude SMT. The Board of Directors establishes the levels regarding adjusted EPS that must be attained for allotment of a certain number of Performance Shares. Allotment will take place as follows:One Performance Share will be allotted for each acquired Investment Share if EPS 2022 exceeds EPS 2021.In order for any remaining Performance Shares to be allotted EPS 2022 growth must exceed 5 percent in relation to EPS 2021. The EPS growth required for the maximum number of Performance Shares to be allotted for each acquired Investment Share is established by the Board of Directors.The level required for maximum allotment and the extent to which the established levels are attained will be disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report.Prerequisites for allotmentThe allotment of Performance Shares requires continuous employment and that all Investment Shares be held during a period of three years from the acquisition of the Investment Shares (""Vesting Period""). The Chairman of the Board of Directors may in special cases grant exemptions from these requirements for individual participants  whereas the Board of Directors may decide on any such exemption concerning groups of participants.If the prerequisites for allotment set forth for LTI 2022 are met  allotment of Performance Shares will take place during 2025  and no later than June 30  2025. The allotment will take place free of charge  subject to tax.Adjustment of the number of Performance Shares etc.Before the allotment of Performance Shares takes place  the Board of Directors shall consider whether the number of Performance Shares is reasonable taking into account the financial results and position of Sandvik  the impact of larger acquisitions  divestments and other significant capital transactions  stock market conditions and other circumstances. If the Board of Directors deems that this is not the case  the Board of Directors shall reduce the number of Performance Shares to the lower number the Board of Directors finds appropriate or decide that no allotment should take place.In the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue and/or other similar events in Sandvik  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to decide on the recalculation of the terms of LTI 2022.An alternative cash based incentive solution may be implemented for participants incountries where the acquisition of Investment Shares or allotment of Performance Shares is not appropriate  or if such solution is otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive solution shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTI 2022. The President and CEO shall be authorized to decide which persons that should be offered participation in the cash based incentive solution.The Board of Directors  or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors for this purpose  shall be responsible for the detailed design and administration of LTI 2022 based on the main terms set forth herein.The right to be allotted Performance Shares cannot be transferred and does not give the participant a right to compensation for dividend distributed during the Vesting Period with respect to the underlying shares.Costs of LTI 2022 and hedging arrangementsThe number of Sandvik shares that will be needed for LTI 2022 will depend on the Sandvik share price at investment and the participation rate. To secure an adequate number of shares  given the increased market volatility  a Sandvik share price of SEK 160 has been used when calculating the maximum number of shares needed. Based on this share price the total cost of LTI 2022 is estimated at up to SEK 333 million. The costs have been calculated as the sum of personnel costs  including social security costs of SEK 55 million  and administration costs of approximately SEK 2 million for the program. Based on a share price of SEK 235 (which would result in fewer Sandvik shares being needed) the total cost is estimated at up to SEK 346 million  of which SEK 57 million constitutes social security cost and approximately SEK 2 million constitutes administration costs. The costs for LTI 2022 will be allocated over the years 2022‚Äì2024.Sandvik intends to secure its commitment to deliver Sandvik shares under LTI 2022 through a share swap agreement with a third party. The interest cost for such a share swap is estimated at approximately SEK 1.4 million per year based on the current interest levels  regardless of whether the calculation is based on a share price of SEK 160 or SEK 235. Against this cost  however  stands the value of possible dividends.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal has been prepared by the Board's Remuneration Committee and has been discussed and resolved on by the Board of Directors. The President has not taken part in the Board of Directors' discussion and resolution with respect to the proposal.Majority requirementThe resolution regarding LTI 2022 requires a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Meeting.OtherFor a description of other long-term incentive programs within Sandvik reference is made to note G4 in Sandvik's 2021 Annual Report and to the Company's website.Item 19 ‚Äì Authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of the Company's own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to  for the period until the 2023 Annual General Meeting  resolve on acquisitions of the Company's own shares in accordance with the following conditions.Acquisitions shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm.Acquisitions may only be made at a price per share within the price range (spread) applicable from time to time  meaning the spread between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price prevailing and disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time.The Company may acquire a maximum number of shares so that the Company's holding at any time does not exceed 10 per cent of the total number of shares in the Company.The authorization may be utilized on one or several occasions up to the 2023 Annual General Meeting.The purpose of the authorization is to enable the Board of Directors to continuously adapt the Company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value.In order for the resolution on authorization to be valid  it must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.Item 20 ‚Äì Resolution on amendment to the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve to amend the Articles of Association as proposed below:¬ß 6Insofar as it is elected at a General Meeting of the Shareholders  the Board shall consist of not less than five and not more than eight Directors and not more than five Deputy Directors. ¬ß 6Insofar as it is elected at a General Meeting of the Shareholders  the Board shall consist of not less than five and not more than ten Directors. ¬ß 11 The following matters shall be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting:[‚Ä¶]10. determination of the number of Directors and Deputy Directors;[‚Ä¶] ¬ß 11 The following matters shall be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting:[‚Ä¶]10. determination of the number of Directors;[‚Ä¶]The Board of Directors currently consists of eight Board members elected by the General Meeting  i.e. the maximum permitted by the Articles of Association.

Thermal Coal market. Producers are experiencing almost unprecedented demand for thermal coal resulting in forward curves for benchmark coal prices across all coal benchmarks and is currently in excess of US$300/tonne for benchmark Newcastle 6000 kCal/kg coal.2. Debt reduction and capital management: TerraCom‚Äôs management have made significant inroads in paying down the amount owing on the Euroclear bond facility. The strong thermal coal price environment along with the announcement of the US$60million prepayment agreement indicates that by our analysis the bond facility could be repaid by the end of May 2022 ‚Äì 7 months ahead of schedule. This paves the way for new capital management initiatives and the reintroduction of dividend payments to shareholders.3.

REUTERS/Maxim ZmeyevMarch 23 (Reuters) - Russian steel giant Severstal (CHMF.MM) was racing against the clock on Wednesday to avoid becoming the country's first major corporate default since the Ukraine crisis began  with international payment lines snarled by sanctions.Severstal  whose main shareholder Alexey Mordashov is one of a number of wealthy Russians now sanctioned by the European Union  has until the end of the day to get an already overdue $12.6 million loan 'coupon' payment to its creditors.A source close to the steel firm said the money had been transferred last week but was yet to be processed and passed on by its paying agent Citibank.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register""This will technically be the first default since the crisis began to unfold "" Seaport Global credit analyst Himanshu Porwal said.""But people will know it is driven by the way the sanctions have been formulated  rather than the company's fault "" adding Severstal might find a way to make the payment in the coming days  especially if Mordashov were to cut or relinquish his large stake in the firm  which itself is not sanctioned.With Wednesday's deadline fast approaching Severstal said it had been in constant discussions about the issues  and that it was looking at an application for special ""licences"" that may be required to make the payment. read moreThe legal terms of the bonds state an ""Event of Default"" can be formally declared five working days after the March 16 coupon due date.The latest Western sanctions and countersanctions by Moscow mean that transferring payments on Russian government and corporate bonds has become complex.Previously payments like Severstal's would have been processed by international clearing houses such as Clearstream or Euroclear  which confirm asset ownership  and also funnel payments for domestic bondholders to Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD).However both Euroclear  owned by a group of global exchanges and banks  and Clearstream  part of Deutsche Boerse  have said they will stop settling trades in Russian securities as a result of the EU's sanctions. read moreNeither Clearstream  Euroclear nor Citigroup responded to requests for comment.DELAYS POSSIBLEA Severstal default would be the first by a major Russian company since Moscow was blanketed by sanctions for what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine  but it may not be alone.Russian companies need to make $18.5 billion of international bond payments by year-end  ITI Capital analysts estimate  while Moscow needs to pay another $3.4 billion on its foreign currency sovereign bonds.Investors would have the right to take legal action to reclaim unpaid amounts  most likely in the United Kingdom or the United States - under whose laws most international market bonds are issued.Payments due in coming days include from Gazprom (GAZP.MM)  which made a payment without problems earlier this month  Russian Railways on March 25 and Polyus Gold (PLZL.MM) on March 28  the same day as Russia's next international sovereign bond payment falls due.It's not just international bondholders who are affected.

It‚Äôs even paintable  so you can paint it to match your wall or nearby d√©cor. The 12-foot coaxial cable also gives you plenty of options to place the antenna away from your TV.The model is rated for signals up to 35 miles away  and Antenna‚Äôs Direct has an Antenna Point app that can help you locate nearby TV towers to see what signals you are most likely to pick up at this range. There aren‚Äôt a lot of extra bells or whistles here  but the ease of placement is unparalleled.Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse Blends in with any decor MoreMohu Leaf Supreme ProBest for no-fuss setupPros Full range of features including amplifierBuilt-in signal indicator to detect best placementFits nearly anywhere Cons Requires extra USB connection to connect the power injector.Mohu is another favored brand of our for indoor antenna products.

This 1byone antenna goes the opposite direction. It has a massive 200-mile range that attempts to pick up signals from as many towers as possible  a much better choice for those living in small towns or more rural areas.The antenna is also one of the more affordable on our list and comes with an extra-long 17-foot cable. The downside to this immense range is that the antenna is bulkier than most with its dual fold-out sections  and you really want to place it as high as possible for the best results  so it may end up being more noticeable.1byone Amplified Antenna Best for signal rangeAntop Smart Bar AntennaBest for extra featuresPros Impressive 80-mile rangeIntegrated FM radioAdjustable amplifier Cons Not designed to hide awayFor those who still want excellent range but don‚Äôt like the idea of attaching anything to their walls or windows  this indoor antenna offers an alternative.

That includes a smart boost system to amplify signals that can be turned on with a button  an integrated FM antenna for picking up radio channels  and amplifier modulation so you can control the strength of the amplifier to find the best settings for each channel.Antop Smart Bar Antenna Best for extra features MoreMohu BladeBest affordable TV antennaPros Great budget pick50-mile rangeBuilt-in amplifier Cons Not as easy to place as some antennasIf you don‚Äôt want to spend much money at all on a TV antenna but still want results  Mohu has an option for you: The Blade  which falls under $20 while still offering a 50-mile range and built-in amplifier. This will get you the stations available in your area without breaking the bank. While it‚Äôs not a large bar  it‚Äôs also not as thin as the peel-and-paste options on our list  so you will need to make a little room for it behind or under your TV  or perhaps on a nearby window sill. Fortunately  the included 10-foot coaxial cable does give you a variety of placement options.Mohu Blade Best affordable TV antennaEditors' Recommendations,positive,0.65,0.35,0.01,mixed,0.8,0.1,0.1,True,English,"['best indoor TV antennas', 'many indoor TV antenna devices', 'best indoor TV antenna models', 'Best overall indoor TV antenna', 'The Leaf Supreme Pro', 'Antop Smart Bar Antenna', 'Mohu Leaf Supreme Pro', 'power injector USB attachment', 'Strong 60-mile radius rating', 'Cons Limited 35-mile range', 'user-friendly Winegard Amped Pro', 'The Amped Pro', 'similar indoor spots', 'The ClearStream Eclipse', 'indoor antenna designs', 'indoor antenna products', 'complicated outdoor placements', 'Clear Circuit technology', 'ClearStream Eclipse Blends', 'time-consuming channel check', 'dual fold-out sections', 'Integrated FM radio', 'long 17-foot cable', 'other antenna lists', 'UHF/Hi-VHF multi-directional antenna', 'accompanying app Software', 'nearby d√©cor', 'basic rectangle design', '12-foot coaxial cable', 'many channel options', 'extra USB connection', 'Amazing 200 mile range', 'massive 200-mile range', 'Impressive 80-mile range', '1byone Amplified Antenna', 'Extra-long cable Cons', 'Antenna Point app', 'This Winegard antenna', 'friendly setup app', 'nearby TV towers', 'high-powered, compact antennas', 'Adjustable amplifier Cons', 'strong rating', 'many towers', 'Indoor antennas', '60-mile range', 'best work', 'best results', '1byone antenna', 'coaxial connection', 'best placement', 'user-friendly options', 'Amped‚Äù part', 'cable bill', 'TV problems', 'TV tuners', 'TV setups', 'Antenna Direct', '65-mile antenna', 'Direct antenna', 'nearby surface', 'Larger design', 'extra bells', 'fuss setup', 'Full range', 'wide range', 'signal range', 'smaller range', 'immense range', 'excellent range', 'compact amplifier', 'TV area', 'one swipe', 'right regions', 'nearby window', 'home theater', 'Most TVs', 'rural users', 'free channels', 'Bluetooth pairing', 'new users', 'key moments', 'nearby wall', 'simple circle', 'signal indicator', 'great fits', 'living rooms', 'signal strength', 'signal quality', 'great option', 'urban areas', 'opposite direction', 'small towns', 'rural areas', 'extra features', 'placement options', '4K broadcasts', 'HD+ broadcasts', 'perfect choice', 'good idea', '4K signals', 'number', 'box', 'today', 'need', 'shelf', 'hunt', 'Note', 'ports', 'Pros', 'energy', 'confusion', 'exaggeration', 'back', 'decor', 'Tons', 'color', 'walls', 'space', 'plenty', 'lot', 'whistles', 'ease', 'brand', 'apartments', 'dorms', 'connections', 'Affordable', 'Picks', '35 miles', 'overlap', 'downside']",2022-03-22,2022-03-23,digitaltrends.com

Severstal  Russia's top steelmaker NLMK  state-owned Russian Railways and fertiliser producer Eurochem are all struggling to get payments to Russian bondholders  the firms themselves and ITI Capital say.NLMK said on Tuesday it had paid a coupon on a 2024 bond but while foreigners had started to receive their money  Russian holders hadn't.""This is due to the fact that...

1318,Clearstream,Google API,https://finovate.com/exploring-tokenized-assets-collaborative-innovation-in-action/,Exploring Tokenized Assets: Collaborative Innovation in Action,1 day ago,This is a sponsored blog post by Nick Kerigan  Head of Innovation  Swift.Working with Clearstream  Northern Trust  SETL and others  SWIFT plans experiments in 2022 to explore how it can support interoperability in the development of the tokenized asset market.Relative to cryptocurrencies and stablecoins  the current market capitalization of tokenized assets is small  but momentum for these digital assets is expected to accelerate rapidly in the coming years. By some estimates  volumes could reach some 24 trillion USD by 2027.Tokenization can be applied to stocks and bonds  but also to illiquid assets  including commodities  property or even art. For example  a share or bond with a high value per unit (say over $500) can be divided into digital pieces that each have ownership and value. This increases the liquidity of the overall asset  and accessibility  by enabling a wider demographic of people to invest in assets that may historically have been unavailable to them.Banks and securities firms are responding to tokenization by developing services ‚àí including fractionalization  a process whereby assets are broken into smaller value digital tokens ‚àí amongst other digital asset servicing capabilities  such as private key safekeeping. Financial market infrastructures also are embracing tokenization by supporting the full lifecycle of digital securities.As interest increases  SWIFT is exploring how it can enable and improve interoperability between participants and systems during the transactional lifecycle of tokenized assets. To this end  SWIFT plans a series of experiments throughout 2022 leveraging its trusted role as a central platform to explore the issuance  delivery versus payment (DVP)  and redemption processes  to support a frictionless and seamless tokenized asset market. These experiments will use both established forms of payment and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).Asset tokenization ‚àí a trend and challenge for securities marketsOver the coming decade  tokenized and traditional assets will likely co-exist  and this poses potential challenges. One major risk is that a variety of technologies  platforms and regulatory environments will create a thicket of connections for securities market participants. This could result in inefficiencies and fragmentation  as well as rising costs and risks across the industry.SWIFT is uniquely placed to help solve this challenge. As a neutral  global cooperative with a strong focus on ensuring interoperability and setting standards for the industry  we are able to interconnect market participants and simplify operations by completing activities centrally that otherwise would be performed bilaterally between institutions. This role relies on SWIFT‚Äôs strong identity and security frameworks  alongside our unparalleled reach and record of reliability.With this in mind  we are looking at how we can support both traditional and tokenized assets flows  with a focus on regulated assets only. We would not become a crypto-custodian nor perform direct settlement of tokenized assets as a financial market infrastructure would. Rather  we see our role as helping to connect all entities as efficiently as possible and enabling our customers to provide better services to their end-users.Collaborative innovation in actionSWIFT  Clearstream  Northern Trust  SETL and other industry participants are exploring the feasibility and benefits of SWIFT as an interconnector  linking up multiple tokenization platforms and various cash-leg payment types. This will build on SWIFT‚Äôs successes in achieving interoperability for CBDCs outlined in our whitepaper published last year.In the experiments  Clearstream and Northern Trust  alongside other industry players  will represent key parts of the tokenized ‚àí and traditional ‚àí asset ecosystem  including securities market infrastructures  as well a local and global custodians. SETL and Northern Trust will support SWIFT and the participants in the integration between the various DLT environments and with transaction orchestrations using their respective capabilities. Results of the experiments will be shared with the financial community afterwards.‚ÄúAs a neutral cooperative with a reach across 11 500 institutions in more than 200 countries  and oversight by central banks globally  SWIFT is uniquely placed to engage closely in the future of securities ‚Äù says Thomas Zschach  Chief Innovation Officer  SWIFT. ‚ÄúWe look forward to this set of new experiments and innovating collaboratively with market participants on the emerging trend of tokenized assets.‚Äù‚ÄúOur vision for instant and frictionless transactions not only applies to traditional securities instruments but also to new asset classes as well ‚Äù adds Vikesh Patel  Head of Securities Strategy  SWIFT. ‚ÄúThe insights from this exercise with leading capital markets participants will help us define and prioritize the concrete steps required to enable seamless processes for tokenized assets.‚ÄùAnthony Culligan  Chief Engineer at SETL  stated: ‚ÄúWe are very pleased to be contributing to this important initiative. We see significant innovation in securities tokenization at the moment and these experiments have the potential to create broader accessibility and interoperability between the emerging networks.‚ÄùKeep an eye out for the results of our experiments ‚Äì we‚Äôll be publishing them later in 2022.

This act of aggression has required the Ukrainian government to take immediate and decisive measures to resist the attack and to stabilise and support the functioning of the state  especially its military. Therefore  one of the key priorities is the financing of the Ukrainian army.To raise the required financing and support the army  the Ministry of Finance has decided to issue series of war bonds that can be purchased both by Ukrainian legal entities and individuals  and foreign investors who want to support Ukraine. These bonds can be nominated and purchased either in UAH or USD with a payback period of one year.The most recent auction on 15 March 2022 generated huge interest. During the auction  the Ministry of Finance issued and placed bonds worth a total of UAH 5.1 billion and USD 12 million. The interest rate for the military bonds in UAH was set at 11%  and the rate for USD was at 3.7%.Military bonds are traded through primary dealers that participate in auctions held by the Ministry of Finance in the interests of their clients. Among the primary dealers are two international and two local banks. In particular  the local banks include –ûschadbank and PrivatBank. International banks acting as primary dealers are Citibank and Raiffeisen Bank. More detailed information on the list of the primary dealers can be found at this link: https://mof.gov.ua/en/perelik-pervinnih-dileriv.For direct purchases  a foreign investor has to follow these steps:choose and conclude an agreement with a Ukrainian broker with primary dealer status (the Broker);open a securities account in one of the Ukrainian depository institutions;place an order with the Broker.If they do not have direct access to Ukrainian depositary system or brokers  foreign investors can also consider using their foreign custodians as intermediaries in the process. Several foreign custodians have access to the Ukrainian depositary system through nominee accounts foreign custodians hold with Ukrainian custodians. These foreign custodians are able to purchase and hold Ukrainian securities on behalf of their clients without the need for their clients to open Ukrainian accounts. Ukrainian war bonds can also be purchased via Clearstream.Ukrainian war bonds are attractive financial instruments that significantly support Ukraine and its army  while at the same time providing good yields to investors.,neutral,0.06,0.65,0.28,mixed,0.4,0.07,0.52,True,English,"['War Bonds', 'Ukraine', 'unprecedented full-scale military assault', 'nominee accounts foreign custodians', 'More detailed information', 'attractive financial instruments', 'Ukrainian legal entities', 'Ukrainian depository institutions', 'Ukrainian depositary system', 'primary dealer status', 'Several foreign custodians', 'two local banks', 'Ukrainian war bonds', 'Ukrainian accounts', 'Ukrainian custodians', 'Ukrainian government', 'two international', 'Ukrainian securities', 'foreign investor', 'International banks', 'military bonds', 'primary dealers', 'Russian Federation', 'illegal, unprovoked', 'decisive measures', 'key priorities', 'payback period', 'one year', 'huge interest', 'Raiffeisen Bank', 'mof.gov', 'direct purchases', 'securities account', 'same time', 'good yields', 'Ukrainian army', 'Ukrainian broker', 'recent auction', 'interest rate', 'direct access', 'investors', '24 February', 'Ukraine', 'aggression', 'immediate', 'attack', 'functioning', 'state', 'financing', 'Ministry', 'Finance', 'series', 'individuals', 'UAH', 'USD', '15 March', 'total', 'auctions', 'interests', 'clients', '–ûschadbank', 'PrivatBank', 'Citibank', 'list', 'link', 'perelik', 'pervinnih', 'dileriv', 'steps', 'agreement', 'order', 'brokers', 'intermediaries', 'process', 'behalf', 'need', 'Clearstream']",2022-03-23,2022-03-23,lexology.com

(Kirill Kudryavtsev /AFP via Getty Images)Severstal Could Become First Russian Company to Default on Foreign-Currency DebtSeverstal  a steel and mining company  could become the first Russian company to fail to make a critical interest payment on foreign-currency debt.The domestic firm had a $12.6 million coupon payment due on March 16  but it was granted a five-business-day grace period. The industrial giant possesses $800 million in loan participation notes that mature in 2024. The company has urged bondholders to contact Citigroup since it is the financial institution that blocked the payment and requested an ironclad permit from the U.S. Treasury to cover these obligations.Should it default on its debt  Severstal‚Äôs global operations and claims would only cover less than one-fifth of its foreign unsecured debt  JPMorgan Chase analysts estimated earlier this month.If interest payments are not processed  Severstal officials announced that the company would search for alternative options to pay its creditors.Payments for bonds issued by Russian companies have turned into a complicated process. Because of Western sanctions and the Kremlin‚Äôs retaliatory sanctions  many bond payments could be delayed or become frozen in transit.A photo taken on March 14  2022  shows the logos of Visa  Mastercard  and Russian Mir payment systems on bank cards in Moscow. (AFP via Getty Images)Russian investors holding domestic corporate eurobonds could experience delays in receiving payments complete through international agents amid Western sanctions  Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository (NSD) said in a statement to Reuters.Russian firms would need to manually process orders and receive clarifications from European regulators in this restrictive environment.Clearstream and Euroclear  two international clearing and settlement organizations  had previously processed Russian sovereign and corporate eurobond payments. However  the two entities confirmed that they would stop settling transactions in Russian securities due to sanctions from the European Union.It is estimated that Russian corporations are scheduled to pay approximately $18.5 billion in external debt  including interest payments  by the end of 2022. The Ministry of Finance is also poised to pay about $3.4 billion in sovereign Eurobonds after recently executing $117 million and $66 million Eurobond coupon payments  with foreign investors receiving their funds.Other companies are bracing for challenges to execute coupon payments on foreign-currency debt.NLMK  Russia‚Äôs top steelmaker  confirmed that it had paid a coupon on its eurobond due in 2024. The business stated that foreign noteholders began receiving interest payments  while domestic investors did not.It is widely anticipated that state-owned Russian Railways  Polyus Gold  and fertilizer producer Eurochem will struggle to send payments to corporate bondholders in this current marketplace.Russian Railways and Polyus Gold are scheduled to make coupon payments on March 25 and March 28  respectively. The Russian government is also expected to make an international bond payment on March 28.‚ÄúPerhaps the bigger risk is that it may be a prelude to defaults by Russian corporates  whose external debts are more than four times larger than those of the sovereign ‚Äù said William Jackson  the Chief Emerging Markets Economist at Capital Economics  in a note last week.Last week  rating agency S&P Global downgraded the creditworthiness of the government and a plethora of companies into junk territory because of Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. This makes it harder for the government and companies to raise capital on international markets.S&P Global cut the country‚Äôs credit rating to ‚ÄúCC.‚Äù This is defined as ‚Äúdefault imminent with little prospect for recovery.‚ÄùThirty ‚Äúfallen angels‚Äù have already occurred due to the Ukraine-Russia military conflict. This refers to a firm with a credit rating that has been cut from investment grade to speculative grade (junk).Many of these corporations have stopped trading in London or New York  or they have witnessed their shares collapse to nearly $0.But S&P Global analysts warn that there is still plenty of uncertainty regarding how damaging Moscow‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine will be for the future of domestic companies.‚ÄúIn terms of creditworthiness  the Russian-Ukraine conflict has had the largest impact on banks  with 28% of total related rating actions ‚Äù the agency noted.‚ÄúIrrespective of the duration of military hostilities  sanctions and related political risks are likely to remain in place for some time. Potential effects could include dislocated commodities markets‚Äìnotably for oil and gas‚Äìsupply chain disruptions  inflationary pressures  weaker growth  and capital market volatility.‚ÄùWill It Be 1998 All Over Again?Many U.S. financial institutions have some exposure to Russian corporate debt.Citigroup confirmed that its investment in Russian sovereign and corporate debt could result in losses totaling as much as $9.8 billion.‚ÄúWe have been managing that [exposure] very proactively to bring that number down ‚Äù Citi CFO Mark Mason told attendees at an investor event.Pimco  a California-based asset manager  amassed around $1.5 billion of Russian debt. With this immense exposure  it could face tremendous losses in the coming years.Flags are seen outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City  where markets roiled after Russia continues to attack Ukraine  in New York  on Feb. 24  2022. (Caitlin Ochs/Reuters)Goldman Sachs has approximately $650 million in exposure  a small percentage of its overall $2.8 trillion credit balance.Could it be 1998 all over again? This was the last time that Russia defaulted on its debt  causing Wall Street to suffer tremendous losses. However  despite market analysts‚Äô glowing forecasts for the country‚Äôs economy  banks have been more cautious about investing too much into the nation.Morgan Stanley warned that the Russian economy is in such a terrible state that it could default on its foreign debts soon.Earlier this month  Simon Waever  Morgan Stanley‚Äôs global head of emerging-market sovereign credit strategy  said in a note that the Eastern European economy is edging closer to default amid talks of additional Western sanctions and expectations of a deep recession.‚ÄúWe see a default as the most likely scenario ‚Äù Waever explained. ‚ÄúIn case of default  it is unlikely to be like a normal one  with Venezuela instead perhaps the most relevant comparison.‚ÄùJPMorgan analysts echoed these sentiments in a note  writing that ‚Äúsanctions have significantly increased the likelihood of a Russia government hard currency bond default.‚ÄùSo far  Russia has averted technical defaults by making coupon payments on dollar bonds that are set to mature in 2023 and 2043.,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,negative,0.01,0.12,0.87,True,English,"['First Russian Company', 'Foreign-Currency Debt', 'Severstal', 'Many U.S. financial institutions', 'Chief Emerging Markets Economist', 'total related rating actions', 'S&P Global analysts', 'Russian Mir payment systems', '$66 million Eurobond coupon payments', 'U.S. Treasury', 'JPMorgan Chase analysts', 'related political risks', 'many bond payments', 'five-business-day grace period', 'loan participation notes', 'Thirty ‚Äúfallen angels', 'supply chain disruptions', '$12.6 million coupon payment', 'National Settlement Depository', 'Russian ruble coins', 'Russian ruble sign', 'international bond payment', 'critical interest payment', 'two international clearing', 'Ukraine-Russia military conflict', 'capital market volatility', 'state-owned Russian Railways', 'corporate eurobond payments', 'First Russian Company', 'foreign unsecured debt', 'domestic corporate eurobonds', 'Russian corporate debt', 'international markets', 'global operations', 'eurobond due', 'commodities markets', 'international agents', 'settlement organizations', 'two entities', 'credit rating', 'Russian-Ukraine conflict', 'military hostilities', 'Russian investors', 'Russian firms', 'Russian securities', 'Russian corporates', 'interest payments', 'foreign investors', 'foreign noteholders', 'sovereign Eurobonds', 'domestic investors', 'Russian sovereign', 'Foreign-Currency Debt', 'external debt', 'corporate bondholders', 'Russian companies', 'Kirill Kudryavtsev', 'Getty Images', 'mining company', 'industrial giant', 'ironclad permit', 'alternative options', 'complicated process', 'bank cards', 'European regulators', 'restrictive environment', 'European Union', 'top steelmaker', 'Polyus Gold', 'fertilizer producer', 'current marketplace', 'bigger risk', 'William Jackson', 'Capital Economics', 'rating agency', 'little prospect', 'speculative grade', 'New York', 'largest impact', 'Potential effects', 'inflationary pressures', 'weaker growth', 'Russian corporations', 'domestic companies', 'Russian government', 'domestic firm', 'Western sanctions', 'retaliatory sanctions', 'Other companies', 'junk territory', 'investment grade', 'Severstal officials', 'banknotes', 'Moscow', 'Aug.', 'AFP', 'March', 'Citigroup', 'obligations', 'claims', 'less', 'one-fifth', 'creditors', 'Kremlin', 'transit', 'photo', 'logos', 'Visa', 'Mastercard', 'delays', 'NSD', 'statement', 'Reuters', 'orders', 'clarifications', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'transactions', 'end', 'Ministry', 'Finance', 'funds', 'challenges', 'NLMK', 'Eurochem', 'prelude', 'defaults', 'creditworthiness', 'plethora', 'invasion', 'country', 'CC', 'recovery', 'London', 'shares', 'plenty', 'uncertainty', 'future', 'terms', 'banks', 'duration', 'time', 'oil', 'gas', 'exposure', '2022']",2022-03-23,2022-03-23,m.theepochtimes.com

1332,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.ledgerinsights.com/deutsche-borse-invests-in-blockchain-based-aircarbon-exchange/,Deutsche B√∂rse invests in blockchain-based AirCarbon Exchange,7 hours ago,Today AirCarbon Exchange (ACX)  a blockchain-based Voluntary Carbon market  announced it had received significant funding from the Deutsche B√∂rse group.At the same time  it announced a partnership with the Deutsche Boerse subsidiary  the European Energy Exchange (EEX). The EEX operates the common auction platform for the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).ACX trades carbon credits in a similar way to a commodity market  with a conventional trade matching engine. However  the carbon credit certificates are tokenized on the public Binance Smart Chain blockchain  making their ownership easier to trace and allowing for real-time settlement.The majority of the transactions on the ACX platform so far are for CORSIA tokens which support carbon offsets in the aviation sector. During the first half of 2021  the transaction volumes across all its markets represented 3 603 284 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. The company says it has more than 130 corporate clients.‚ÄúI am confident that our 15 years of experience in operating spot and derivatives markets within the European Emissions Trading Scheme  coupled with ACX‚Äôs unique carbon solutions  will lead to a greater level of standardization required to successfully scale up Voluntary Carbon Markets ‚Äù said Tobias Paulun  Chief Strategy Officer of EEX.The Binance cryptocurrency exchange initiated Binance Smart Chain. It‚Äôs based on Ethereum code but with some modifications which enable faster consensus. The trade-off is that it‚Äôs far less decentralized compared to Ethereum  with just 21 validator nodes.Numerous initiatives are targeting voluntary carbon markets  some of them using cryptocurrencies and others on private blockchains. Several major banks  including the National Bank of Australia  Natwest  BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered  are collaborating on Carbonplace. And in Singapore  where ACX first launched  Standard Chartered alongside DBS Bank  the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and Temasek are involved in the Climate Impact X (CIX).,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,True,English,"['Deutsche B√∂rse', 'blockchain-based AirCarbon Exchange', 'public Binance Smart Chain blockchain', 'conventional trade matching engine', 'Deutsche B√∂rse group', 'European Emissions Trading Scheme', 'EU Emissions Trading System', 'The Binance cryptocurrency exchange', 'blockchain-based Voluntary Carbon market', 'Deutsche Boerse subsidiary', 'European Energy Exchange', 'Chief Strategy Officer', 'Several major banks', 'Climate Impact X', 'carbon credit certificates', 'carbon dioxide equivalent', 'unique carbon solutions', 'common auction platform', 'Voluntary Carbon Markets', 'EU ETS', 'commodity market', 'carbon credits', 'carbon offsets', 'AirCarbon Exchange', 'The EEX', 'derivatives markets', 'Singapore Exchange', 'significant funding', 'same time', 'similar way', 'real-time settlement', 'CORSIA tokens', 'aviation sector', 'first half', 'transaction volumes', '3,603,284 metric tons', '130 corporate clients', 'operating spot', 'greater level', 'Tobias Paulun', 'faster consensus', '21 validator nodes', 'Numerous initiatives', 'private blockchains', 'National Bank', 'BNP Paribas', 'Standard Chartered', 'DBS Bank', 'ACX platform', 'Ethereum code', 'partnership', 'ownership', 'majority', 'transactions', 'company', '15 years', 'experience', 'standardization', 'modifications', 'trade-off', 'cryptocurrencies', 'others', 'Australia', 'Natwest', 'Carbonplace', 'SGX', 'Temasek', 'CIX']",2022-03-23,2022-03-23,ledgerinsights.com
1333,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.reuters.com/article/ukraine-crisis-russia-settlement-idUSL5N2VQ1BQ,UPDATE 1-Russia warns of possible payment delays for domestic corporate Eurobond holders,13 hours ago,"(Reuters) -Russian steel giant Severstal was racing against the clock on Wednesday to avoid becoming the country‚Äôs first major corporate default since the Ukraine crisis began  with international payment lines snarled by sanctions.A general view shows the Moscow International Business Center also known as ""Moskva-City""  in Moscow  Russia  October 6  2016. REUTERS/Maxim ZmeyevSeverstal  whose main shareholder Alexey Mordashov is one of a number of wealthy Russians now sanctioned by the European Union  has until the end of the day to get an already overdue $12.6 million loan ‚Äòcoupon‚Äô payment to its creditors.A source close to the steel firm said the money had been transferred last week but was yet to be processed and passed on by its paying agent Citibank.‚ÄúThis will technically be the first default since the crisis began to unfold ‚Äù Seaport Global credit analyst Himanshu Porwal said.‚ÄúBut people will know it is driven by the way the sanctions have been formulated  rather than the company‚Äôs fault ‚Äù adding Severstal might find a way to make the payment in the coming days  especially if Mordashov were to cut or relinquish his large stake in the firm  which itself is not sanctioned.With Wednesday‚Äôs deadline fast approaching Severstal said it had been in constant discussions about the issues  and that it was looking at an application for special ‚Äúlicences‚Äù that may be required to make the payment.The legal terms of the bonds state an ‚ÄúEvent of Default‚Äù can be formally declared five working days after the March 16 coupon due date.The latest Western sanctions and countersanctions by Moscow mean that transferring payments on Russian government and corporate bonds has become complex.Previously payments like Severstal‚Äôs would have been processed by international clearing houses such as Clearstream or Euroclear  which confirm asset ownership  and also funnel payments for domestic bondholders to Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository (NSD).However both Euroclear  owned by a group of global exchanges and banks  and Clearstream  part of Deutsche Boerse  have said they will stop settling trades in Russian securities as a result of the EU‚Äôs sanctions.Neither Clearstream  Euroclear nor Citigroup responded to requests for comment.DELAYS POSSIBLEA Severstal default would be the first by a major Russian company since Moscow was blanketed by sanctions for what it calls its ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù in Ukraine  but it may not be alone.Russian companies need to make $18.5 billion of international bond payments by year-end  ITI Capital analysts estimate  while Moscow needs to pay another $3.4 billion on its foreign currency sovereign bonds.Investors would have the right to take legal action to reclaim unpaid amounts  most likely in the United Kingdom or the United States - under whose laws most international market bonds are issued.Payments due in coming days include from Gazprom  which made a payment without problems earlier this month  Russian Railways on March 25 and Polyus Gold on March 28  the same day as Russia‚Äôs next international sovereign bond payment falls due.It‚Äôs not just international bondholders who are affected. Severstal  Russia‚Äôs top steelmaker NLMK  state-owned Russian Railways and fertiliser producer Eurochem are all struggling to get payments to Russian bondholders  the firms themselves and ITI Capital say.NLMK said on Tuesday it had paid a coupon on a 2024 bond but while foreigners had started to receive their money  Russian holders hadn‚Äôt.‚ÄúThis is due to the fact that...

Severstal  Russia‚Äôs top steelmaker NLMK  state-owned Russian Railways and fertiliser producer Eurochem are all struggling to get payments to Russian bondholders  the firms themselves and ITI Capital say.NLMK said on Tuesday it had paid a coupon on a 2024 bond but while foreigners had started to receive their money  Russian holders hadn‚Äôt.‚ÄúThis is due to the fact that‚Ä¶ Euroclear and Clearstream are no longer settling transactions with Russia‚Äôs NSD ‚Äù NLMK said. ‚ÄúWe currently see no legal grounds prohibiting Euroclear and Clearstream to process payments to Russian residents.‚ÄùNSD confirmed it was receiving payments from Euroclear  but said it will not process these until Euroclear gets clarifications from European regulators.‚ÄúAfter curbs are lifted  payments will be processed‚Ä¶as usual ‚Äù it said.The daily Kommersant newspaper  citing a source at a large brokerage firm  said some Russian holders of Moscow‚Äôs sovereign bonds also hadn‚Äôt received payments. A source at a European-based fund told Reuters it too had not received a sovereign bond payment due on Monday.The Russian finance ministry  Russian Railways and Eurochem did not reply to requests for comment.‚ÄúDelays are possible for payments cleared via international depositories ‚Äù NSD added in a statement to Reuters.‚ÄúThis could be linked to ‚Äòmanual‚Äô processing of the orders linked to Russian companies as well as with a need to get clarifications from European regulators‚Äù.(Reporting by Reuters; Editing by Alexander Smith  Kirsten Donovan),negative,0.02,0.34,0.64,negative,0.01,0.2,0.78,True,English,"['Steel giant Severstal', 'first major default', 'Russia-Ukraine crisis', 'Metro US', 'overdue $12.6 million loan ‚Äòcoupon‚Äô payment', 'next international sovereign bond payment', 'Seaport Global credit analyst', 'foreign currency sovereign bonds', 'most international market bonds', 'March 16 coupon due date', 'first major corporate default', 'Russian steel giant Severstal', 'international clearing houses', 'National Settlement Depository', 'daily Kommersant newspaper', 'international payment lines', 'Russian finance ministry', 'ITI Capital analysts', 'major Russian company', 'state-owned Russian Railways', 'large brokerage firm', 'latest Western sanctions', 'international bond payments', 'corporate bonds', 'first default', 'international bondholders', 'international depositories', 'steel firm', 'global exchanges', 'large stake', 'Russian government', 'Russian securities', 'Russian companies', 'Russian bondholders', 'Russian holders', 'Russian residents', 'main shareholder', 'wealthy Russians', 'European Union', 'paying agent', 'Himanshu Porwal', 'coming days', 'constant discussions', 'special ‚Äúlicences', 'legal terms', 'asset ownership', 'domestic bondholders', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'legal action', 'unpaid amounts', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Polyus Gold', 'top steelmaker', 'fertiliser producer', 'legal grounds', 'European regulators', 'European-based fund', 'manual‚Äô processing', 'Alexander Smith', 'Kirsten Donovan', 'Severstal default', 'Alexey Mordashov', 'DELAYS POSSIBLE', 'Ukraine crisis', '2024 bond', 'Reuters', 'clock', 'Wednesday', 'country', 'number', 'end', 'creditors', 'source', 'money', 'Citibank', 'people', 'deadline', 'issues', 'application', 'Event', 'countersanctions', 'Moscow', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'NSD', 'group', 'banks', 'part', 'trades', 'result', 'requests', 'comment', 'Investors', 'right', 'laws', 'Gazprom', 'problems', 'NLMK', 'Eurochem', 'firms', 'Tuesday', 'foreigners', 'fact', 'transactions', 'clarifications', 'curbs', 'The', 'Monday', 'statement', 'orders', 'need', 'Editing']",2022-03-23,2022-03-23,metro.us

In fact  one in five (21%) have experienced a ransomware attack in the last year; with 43% of those experienc‚Ä¶,PARIS LA D√âFENSE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--New research from Thales has found that malware  ransomware and phishing continues to plague global organisations. In fact  one in five (21%) have experienced a ransomware attack in the last year; with 43% of those experiencing a significant impact on operations.First seen in the late 1980‚Äôs  with the PC Cyborg Virus  the frequency and impact of ransomware attacks has now accelerated due to the rise of cryptocurrency as the preferred ransomware payment method. In fact  the 2022 Thales Data Threat Report  conducted by 451 Research  part of S&P Global Market Intelligence  including more than 2 700 IT decision-makers worldwide  found a fifth (22%) of organisations have admitted that they have paid or would pay a ransom for their data. Despite this  41% of respondents said they had no plans to change security spending  even with greater ransomware impacts.Additionally  less than half of respondents (48%) have implemented a formal ransomware plan. Healthcare was the most prepared at 57% with a formal ransomware plan; energy the least at 44%. Despite both sectors experiencing significant breaches over the past twelve months.Data Visibility is a ChallengeAs more companies adopt multicloud strategies and hybrid work remains the norm  IT leaders continue to be challenged by the sprawl of data across their organizations and find it more difficult to locate all of their data. Just over half (56%) of IT leaders were very confident or had complete knowledge of where their data was being stored  down from 64% the previous year1  and only a quarter (25%) stated they were able to classify all their data.Threats & Compliance ChallengesThroughout 2021  security incidents remained high  with almost a third (29%) of businesses experiencing a breach in the past 12 months. Additionally  almost half (43%) of IT Leaders admitted to having failed a compliance audit.Globally  IT leaders ranked malware (56%)  ransomware (53%) and phishing (40%) as the leading source of security attacks. Managing these risks is an ongoing challenge  with almost half (45%) of IT leaders reporting an increase in the volume  severity and/or scope of cyberattacks in the past 12 months.The Cloud is Increasing Complexity & RiskCloud adoption is increasing with more than a third (34%) of respondents saying they used more than 50 Software as a Service (SaaS) apps and 16% used more than 100 apps. However  51% of IT leaders agreed that it is more complex to manage privacy and data protection regulations in a cloud environment than in on-premises networks within their organization  up from 46% last year.The 2022 Data Threat Report also revealed significant momentum amongst businesses to store data in the cloud  with 32% of respondents stating that around halfi of their workloads and data resides in external clouds  and a quarter (23%) reporting more than 60%. However  44% reported that they had experienced a breach or failed an audit in their cloud environments.Additionally  the use of encryption to protect sensitive data is low  with only half of respondents (50%) disclosing that more than 40% of their sensitive data has been encrypted  and a fifth (22%) stating more than 60%. Representing a significant ongoing risk for businesses.Remote Work WorriesAnother full year of remote working demonstrated that navigating security risks is proving a significant challenge for businesses. Worryingly  the majority of businesses (79%) are still concerned about the security risks and threats that posed by remote working. Only half of IT leaders (55%) reported to have implemented multi factor authentication (MFA)  a figure unchanged from the previous year2.Threats on the HorizonHowever  the report also showed that IT leaders have significant diversity of spending technology priorities ‚Äì suggesting they are serious about tackling complex threat environments. A quarter (26%) stated that broad cloud security toolsets are the greatest future spending priority. Additionally  a similar number of IT leaders (25%) stated they were prioritising key management  with Zero Trust3 an important strategy for 23%.IT leaders are also increasingly aware of the future challenges on the horizon. Looking ahead  when asked to identify security threats from quantum computing  52% said they were concerned with ‚Äòtomorrow‚Äôs decryption of today‚Äôs data‚Äô  a concern that will likely be intensified by the increasing complexity of cloud environments.Sebastien Cano  Senior Vice President for Cloud Protection and Licensing activities at Thales  comments: ‚ÄúAs the pandemic continues to affect both our business and personal lives  any expectation of a ‚Äòreturn‚Äô to pre-pandemic conditions have faded. Whilst teams around the world have continued to face challenges in securing their data  our findings indicate that urgent action is needed by businesses to develop more robust cybersecurity strategies. The attack surface  as well as the asset management challenges  are only set to increase in the coming year  and it is vital that businesses deploy a robust security strategy based on discovery  protection and control.‚ÄùThales and 451 Research will discuss the findings in more detail during a webinar on 31 March 2022.

The gross proceeds of the transaction amount to EUR 620 million. This completion is an important step towards the full closing of the sale of Aegon‚Äôs insurance  pension  and asset management businesses in Central and Eastern Europe to VIG for EUR 830 million  as announced in November 2020. The sales of Aegon‚Äôs businesses in Poland  Romania and Turkey are expected to be completed in the course of 2022  subject to required local regulatory approvals.‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement marks an important step in the transformation of Aegon as we narrow our strategic focus to select core and growth markets  and further strengthen our balance sheet‚Äù  said Lard Friese  CEO Aegon. ‚ÄúI would like to sincerely thank our employees in Hungary for their significant contribution to Aegon over the years.‚ÄùThe closing of the sale of the Hungarian businesses will result in a significant increase of Aegon‚Äôs Cash Capital at the Holding ‚Äì which amounted to EUR 1.3 billion at the end of 2021 ‚Äì and brings it above the stated operating range of EUR 0.5 billion to EUR 1.5 billion. This provides Aegon with the financial flexibility to announce today a reduction of its debt through a EUR 375 million tender offer  as well as the intention to return surplus cash capital to its shareholders via a EUR 300 million share buyback  barring unforeseen circumstances. These actions are in line with the ambitions stated at the Capital Markets Day in December 2020.‚ÄúI am very pleased that by further reducing our debt  we are able to deliver on our deleveraging goal well ahead of our 2023 target date‚Äù  Lard Friese added. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announced share buyback also underscores our intention to return surplus cash capital to shareholders.‚ÄùDebt tender offer and share buybackThe debt repayment will be executed through a EUR 375 million tender offer for six subordinated bonds. Details of the debt tender offer will be disclosed via a separate press release today. After completion of the tender offer  Aegon will have reduced its gross financial leverage to the range of EUR 5.0 billion to EUR 5.5 billion  a target that was set to be accomplished by 2023.Story continuesAdditionally  Aegon intends to return EUR 300 million of surplus cash capital to shareholders via a share buyback in the course of 2022. The share buyback will be executed in three tranches of EUR 100 million each  with each tranche conditional on maintaining the capital positions of Aegon's main units in line with its stated ambitions  and the Cash Capital at the Holding being above the middle of the operating range.The EUR 300 million share buyback program will commence on April 1  2022 and is expected to be completed on or before December 15  2022. The first tranche of EUR 100 million is expected to be completed on or before June 30  2022. For each tranche Aegon will engage a third party to execute the buyback transactions on its behalf. The common shares will be repurchased at a maximum of the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices during the repurchase period  and will subsequently be proposed to be cancelled at Aegon‚Äôs 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.Following the divestment of Aegon‚Äôs businesses in Hungary  Aegon‚Äôs IFRS equity will increase by approximately EUR 400 million in the first quarter of 2022  of which approximately EUR 375 million will be recognized as a book gain  based on the balance sheet position on December 31  2021. The combination of the completion of the sale of Aegon‚Äôs Hungarian businesses  the repayment of the debt and the share buyback will not have a material impact on the Group Solvency II ratio.About AegonAegon is an integrated  diversified  international financial services group.

The ‚ÄúUnione 0‚Äù real estate fund  managed by Prelios SGR...,MILAN ‚Äì Hines  the global real estate firm  and Accor  a world leader in the hospitality sector  announce plans for a hotel at MilanoSesto via an agreement with the ‚ÄúUnione 0‚Äù real estate fund.The ‚ÄúUnione 0‚Äù real estate fund  managed by Prelios SGR and ultimately invested in by Hines and Cale Street  has entered into a binding agreement with Accor for a hotel to be developed on the Unione 0 private lot at MilanoSesto  on a 25-year lease  via the hotel group's partner  Amapa. Hines is also a strategic advisor and development manager of the entire MilanoSesto 13-year project. Prelios  meanwhile  acts as manager of the ‚ÄúUnione 0‚Äù real estate fund and asset and project manager of the overall initiative.Currently  construction continues on the Unione 0 private lot section at MilanoSesto  which spans 250 000 square metres  bordering the former Falck area railway station. Excavation work for the hotel will start in August 2022 with construction set to begin on the buildings by the end of 2022. The buildings include the hotel (301 rooms)  office space covering c. 48 000 square metres  student accommodation catering for approximately 700 people  affordable housing units (285 apartments) and free-market residential units (480 apartments). The area will also feature an initial 13-hectare section of the 45-hectare park  designed by international architecture firm LAND.The hotel will have 301 rooms that will operate under two Accor Group brands: 204 rooms will be managed by Novotel and offer facilities like short-stay  rental accommodations  while a total of 97 serviced apartments will be managed by Adagio and used as medium-long stay accommodation. The hotel will span 19 floors covering approximately 16 000 square metres and will maintain the highest environmental  sustainability and energy efficiency standards  with the aim of achieving LEED Gold certification.The hotel  designed by international architecture and design firm Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel (ACPV)  will stand alongside the new Sesto San Giovanni station  designed by Renzo Piano Building Workshop together with Ottavio Di Blasi & Partners  located near the future City of Health and Research (Citt√† della Salute e della Ricerca - CdSR)  a public clinical research and training healthcare complex  entirely funded by the Italian state and the Lombardy Region. It will also become home to the National Cancer Institute and the ‚ÄúCarlo Besta‚Äù Neurological Institute  with both centres of excellence expected to receive approximately 4 000 visitors each day.The signing of this agreement is scheduled for early 2026 and is a testament to Hines‚Äô ability to partner with major companies for the projects it manages and develops. Such projects are characterised by a long-term approach and ESG vision with a focus on economic viability to ensure their success.‚ÄúWorking with an operator like Accor who is known for its great vision in the hospitality and accommodation sector is gratifying for us because we are fully confident that they can make the most of the opportunities that MilanoSesto will bring to the area.

Following our lowest ever Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate in 2021  we have continued to achieve new safety milestones  passing eight million hours without a Lost Time Injury in early March 2022.

In addition to setting a short-term carbon reduction target  the Board has also approved our ambition to be Net Zero by 2040.The positive momentum we saw in all our product markets in 2021 has continued into 2022. Global demand for ilmenite  our primary product  continues to exceed supply and our production volumes are being well received by the market.In light of this continuing market strength and our record performance  the Board is recommending a 2021 dividend of USc32.71 per share  up from USc10.00 per share in 2020.

Listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Euronext Dublin  Kenmare operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine in Mozambique. Moma‚Äôs production accounts for approximately 8% of global titanium feedstocks and the Group supplies to customers in more than 15 countries. Kenmare produces raw materials that are ultimately consumed in everyday ‚Äúquality-of life‚Äù items such as paints  plastics and ceramic tiles.All monetary amounts refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.Forward Looking StatementsThis announcement contains some forward-looking statements that represent Kenmare's expectations for its business  based on current expectations about future events  which by their nature involve risks and uncertainties. Kenmare believes that its expectations and assumptions with respect to these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However  because they involve risk and uncertainty  which are in some cases beyond Kenmare's control  actual results or performance may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information.CHAIRMAN‚ÄôS STATEMENTDear shareholders 2021 was the first full year of operations at the high grade Pilivili ore zone  in addition to our original Namalope area. Significant increases in production and shipments were achieved  while our product markets exhibited strong demand throughout the year. As a result  revenue increased by 87% to $455.9 million  and profit after tax by 669% to $128.5 million  vindicating our strategy of investing in additional production capacity in anticipation of a tight market.As we began 2021  while we had largely completed the last of our three growth projects  operational effectiveness continued to be impacted by COVID-19. Our vaccination  testing  and quarantine protocols mitigated the worst effects of the virus  however  and we also achieved a truly outstanding safety performance. Nevertheless  we remain vigilant as the pandemic continues to evolve. The health and safety of our colleagues and host communities remain our highest priorities.Shareholder returnsKenmare committed to increase shareholder returns after the completion of the major capital projects executed during 2018-2020. Accordingly  we have recommended a dividend payout of 25% of profit after tax for 2021  higher than the 20% minimum policy. Subject to shareholder approval  our 2021 full year dividend will be USc32.71  an increase of 227% compared to 2020.Despite robust operational and financial performance  our share price during 2021 did not fully reflect Kenmare‚Äôs intrinsic value  and the Board concluded that a share buy-back was therefore a prudent use of capital. A share buy-back was completed in December 2021  returning $81.6 million to eligible shareholders while reducing the number of shares in issue by 13.5%.I am pleased that Kenmare has been able to return almost $100 million in aggregate to shareholders during 2021  through dividends and the share buy-back  whilst also maintaining a robust balance sheet.At the 2022 Annual General Meeting (‚ÄúAGM‚Äù) Kenmare will ask shareholders to approve resolutions to implement an Odd-lot Offer at some point during the next 18 months. This will enable the Company to purchase  at a 5% premium  the shares held by eligible certificated shareholders who hold fewer than 200 shares in the Company. This will help small shareholders who would otherwise have difficulty selling their holdings due to disproportionate trading costs. Further details of the Odd-lot Offer scheme will be included in the Notice of AGM to be distributed to shareholders in due course.Outlook and strategyIn 2021 we benefitted from strong product markets for all our products and this positive momentum has continued into 2022. Our increased production has been well absorbed by our markets and demand for Kenmare ilmenite remains strong. However  the tragic conflict in Ukraine has created significant uncertainties in global trade routes and the wider economy. It is too soon to speculate on the overall effects on our business  but Ukraine is a significant supplier of titanium feedstocks  while lower global growth could reduce demand for our products.In 2025  Wet Concentrator Plant (‚ÄúWCP‚Äù) A will move to the Nataka ore zone. Field tests of mining methods and planning studies are making good progress and a Pre-Feasibility Study for the move is expected to be completed later in 2022. This will include details of the mining method  relocation  provision of water and power  an HMC pumping system  and plans for tailings disposal.Our overall strategy is to operate responsibly to deliver long-life low-cost production  allocating capital efficiently  including towards developing accretive growth opportunities. The Kenmare team is committed to achieving these strategic goals  while also becoming a first quartile producer on the industry revenue to cost curve. Achievement of these long-term strategic goals will support further increases in free cash flow and higher dividends  as well as improving resilience in case of potential cyclical commodity market downturns.SustainabilityKenmare has always placed sustainability at the heart of its business practices  working responsibly to achieve ambitious environment  social  and governance goals. In 2021  we published our inaugural Sustainability Report  which set out guiding principles  together with some examples of our approach to responsible environmental management  and constructive community and other stakeholder relations. We will publish our second Sustainability Report in the coming weeks  including commentary on our performance against public sustainability targets for the first time.The Board has ratified an inaugural Climate Policy and we will shortly publish our first Climate Strategy Report  aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‚ÄúTCFD‚Äù).During 2021 we launched a Portuguese version of our corporate website to ensure all information is easily accessible for Mozambicans. For the second consecutive year  we were pleased to be named as the most transparent extractive industry company in Mozambique by the Centre for Public Integrity‚Äôs Extractive Industry Transparency Index.Board developmentIn 2021  an external performance evaluation of the Board and all of its Committees was conducted by Board Excellence  in accordance with the provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. I am pleased to report that the evaluation concluded that Kenmare‚Äôs Board operates efficiently  ‚Äúwith a deep commitment to do the right thing and excel on behalf of shareholders  employees and stakeholders.‚Äù A summary of outcomes and actions from the evaluation will be published in our 2021 Annual Report.A number of important changes in the composition of the Board took place during the year  and further changes will occur in 2022 when I plan to retire  after nine years on Kenmare‚Äôs Board  almost eight of them as Chairman.Gabriel Smith  Tim Keating  and Peter Bacchus stepped down and I would like to thank them sincerely for their important contributions to Kenmare‚Äôs success in recent years. Graham Martin has assumed the role of Senior Independent Director following Peter‚Äôs departure.In March 2021  we were pleased to welcome Sameer Oundhakar to replace Tim as the representative Director of our largest shareholder  African Acquisition S.√†.r.l.  an investment vehicle owned by the Oman Investment Authority.In October 2021  we announced that Mette Dobel had agreed to join the Board as an independent Non-Executive Director effective 1 January 2022. Her significant leadership experience both as a senior executive and director of FLSmidth A/S  at the cutting edge of mining technology and automation  will be invaluable as we strive to achieve further operational efficiencies and build a positive social and environmental legacy.In December 2021  Andrew Webb joined the Board as an independent Non-Executive Director and Chair Designate. Andrew brings extensive natural resources and financial advisory experience  having previously served as a Managing Director at Rothschild & Co in the Global Advisory team  where he worked for 25 years. I have enjoyed working with him through the transition period and am confident that Andrew‚Äôs skills and enormous mining industry and finance experience position him well to play a key role in driving the future success of the business.I plan to step down following the 2022 AGM and Andrew will become Chairman. I look forward with confidence to Andrew and the rest of the Board taking Kenmare to even higher levels of achievement in future yearsAfter these changes  the composition of the Board will provide a strong and diverse mix of talents  skills and experience  well suited to the business and challenges ahead  while achieving our gender diversity target with female Directors representing one third of the Board.AcknowledgementsI would like to end my final statement as Chairman by thanking all of Kenmare‚Äôs key stakeholders for their support and commitment to the Company and the Board  not only during the unprecedented challenges we have all experienced during the past two years of COVID-19 disruption  but also throughout my nine-year tenure. I look back on the Company‚Äôs achievements with a sense of pride and I am pleased to be leaving Kenmare in the strongest position in its history.It has been a privilege to work with my fellow Board members  and particularly Michael Carvill who founded the company and has led it selflessly and courageously for more than 20 years. Kenmare has an outstanding management team and a remarkable workforce. I feel privileged to have worked with such a talented group and I will follow the Company‚Äôs continued progress with keen interest.With capacity to deliver 1.2 million tonnes per annum (‚ÄúMtpa‚Äù) of ilmenite on a sustainable basis  buoyant product markets  and a first class team  I am confident that Kenmare will continue to generate value for all stakeholders in 2022 and beyond.Steven McTiernanChairmanMANAGING DIRECTOR‚ÄôS STATEMENTKenmare delivered a record year for safety  production  and shipments in 2021. The Company demonstrated its resilience and agility  protecting our employees and host communities against a second year of heightened risk due to COVID-19. I would like to thank all our team for their hard work and dedication  particularly during H1 2021 when we faced huge challenges as a result of the virus.Our record operational performance in 2021 was supported by strong market conditions for all our products. We increased production of ilmenite  our main product  by almost 50% compared to 2020 and this was well received by the product market  with quarter-on-quarter price increases. This enabled us to generate EBITDA of $216.1 million  up 182% on 2020  and gave us the confidence to return almost $100 million to shareholders during the year  increasing our 2021 dividend payout to 25% of profit after tax  above the 20% minimum policy  and completing a share buy-back of 13.5% of our issued share capital.We are targeting production of 1.2 Mtpa of ilmenite  plus co-products  on a sustainable basis and reduced unit costs. We remain focused on delivering strong free cash flow and shareholder returns  while continuing to raise the standards to which we hold ourselves in terms of environment  social  and governance performance. We believe we are achieving our purpose of responsibly meeting global demand for quality-of-life minerals.SafetyIt is testimony to our strong safety culture that Kenmare reported its best ever safety performance in 2021. This achievement is particularly significant given the additional pressure put on our mining operations by COVID-19  which had the potential to increase safety risks.We delivered our lowest ever Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate of 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 31 December 2021  which also represented more than six million hours worked without a Lost Time Injury (‚ÄúLTI‚Äù) and an 88% reduction compared to 2020. Our Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (‚ÄúTRIFR‚Äù) relative to the 2020 International Council on Mining and Metals TRIFR was in the top quintile. On 6 January 2022 we achieved one year without a LTI and we are working hard to maintain this record performance. We also retained our five-star NOSA safety accreditation for the sixth consecutive year.SustainabilityOur commitment to working responsibly is enshrined in Kenmare‚Äôs purpose and we are particularly focused on protecting our employees and our host communities in Mozambique. In mid-2021 we began vaccinating our workforce against COVID-19 and by the end of the year  96% had been double vaccinated. We also donated 12 000 vaccines to local communities.Through the Kenmare Moma Development Association (‚ÄúKMAD‚Äù)  we completed the construction of a new health centre for the communities living near our Pilivili operations and constructed seven school blocks in the Namalope and Pilivili areas. By the end of the year  over 1 000 farmers were registered in our Conservation Agriculture programme to improve crop yields and 75 small businesses were benefitting from KMAD support.We recognise the role and responsibility all businesses must take in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and as such  in December 2021  the Board approved Kenmare‚Äôs Climate Policy. We will publish our first Climate Strategy Report in the coming weeks  which follows recommendations made by the TCFD. We have an ambition of becoming Net Zero (Scope 1 and 2) by 2040  with a short-term carbon emissions reduction target of 12% by 2024  contingent on receiving a reliable power supply from the Mozambican state power provider  Electricidade de Mo√ßambique.In early 2021 we approved the development of a RUPS. It is expected to deliver increased power stability for the Mineral Separation Plant  an important risk mitigation measure  and is anticipated to be the main contributor towards our reduced emissions through lower diesel consumption. At an estimated cost of $18 million  the RUPS is a Net Present Value positive project  using conservative assumptions  and commissioning commenced in Q1 2022.We also continued to invest in our people. The Moma workforce received 21 100 hours of training during the year as we believe that providing continuous development opportunities is key to attracting and retaining the best people and maintaining our strong safety culture. At the end of 2021  we had 1 551 employees at the Moma Mine and over 97% of them were Mozambican  with 70% from the local district or province. 12.5% of our Moma employees were women  compared with 10.6% in 2020  reflecting our successful initiatives to encourage women to join and remain in our workforce.Operational performance2021 was a record year for production and the first time we have produced more than one million tonnes of ilmenite. Total production of finished products was up 46% compared to 2020  driven by the higher ore grades mined in Pilivili by WCP B following its relocation in Q3 2020. We achieved Moma‚Äôs nameplate capacity of 1.2 Mtpa ilmenite production in Q3 2021  which set a new quarterly production record  and demonstrated our ability to produce at our targeted rate. We are now focused on achieving this run rate on a consistent basis. 2021 was also a record year for shipments  which were up 51% compared to 2020.We achieved this compelling performance despite the impact of COVID-19 on our operations  particularly in H1 2021. Ilmenite production was below the midpoint of guidance due to the challenges of operating with a reduced workforce  including senior management  and power supply disruptions in Q4. Operating costs per tonne were 3% above the top end of our guidance range due mainly to additional costs associated with repairs and maintenance  HMC haulage  and COVID-19 management. In 2022  we will look to progress towards becoming a first quartile producer on the industry revenue to cost curve.Product marketKenmare is the world‚Äôs largest supplier of ilmenite and the Moma Mine is one of the largest titanium minerals deposits globally. The titanium feedstocks we produce are principally used to make pigment  which is essential for imparting whiteness and opacity in the production of paints  paper  plastic  and a range of other items we use in our everyday lives.2021 was a strong year for all of Kenmare‚Äôs product markets  with increased volumes sold at a 21% higher average price than in 2020. Robust demand for titanium feedstocks  like ilmenite  was driven primarily by global pigment production reaching a record high and the titanium metal market improving. Following softer demand in 2020  the market for zircon  our main co-product  stabilised in Q1 2021 and then saw price increases throughout the remainder of 2021. The positive pricing momentum for all our products has continued into 2022  with global inventories remaining low.OutlookAlthough the pandemic continued to create huge challenges in 2021  I believe we have built a stronger business. The past two years have shown us what we are all capable of  particularly when we pull together and look out for each other. I would like to thank all our stakeholders  particularly those in Mozambique  for their invaluable support.I would also like to thank Steven McTiernan for his outstanding contribution to Kenmare. He led the Company as Chairman during a period of significant change  providing constructive challenge  wise counsel  and strong support. I look forward to working with Andrew Webb and ensuring we continue to deliver positive returns and create value for all our stakeholders.As we look to the months and years ahead  we know we have a lot of hard work ahead of us to live up to our strategy of operating responsibly  delivering long-life  low-cost production  and allocating capital efficiently  including developing accretive growth opportunities. However  we can be proud that our operations are safe and performing well  our balance sheet is strong  our product markets are tight  and our employees have proven they can succeed even in the most difficult conditions.Michael CarvillManaging DirectorUNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021Notes 2021$‚Äô000 2020$‚Äô000 Revenue 2 455 944 243 746 Cost of sales 4 (244 986) (179 103) Gross profit 210 958 64 643 Other operating costs 5 (57 977) (30 250) Operating profit 152 981 34 393 Finance income 6 265 642 Finance costs 7 (12 053) (11 301) Foreign exchange loss (3 897) (980) Profit before tax 137 296 22 754 Income tax expense 8 (8 770) (6 015) Profit for the financial year and total comprehensive income for the financial year 128 526 16 739 Attributable to equity holders 128 526 16 739 $ per share $ per share Profit per share: Basic 9 1.18 0.15 Profit per share: Diluted 9 1.16 0.15The accompanying notes form part of these financial statements.UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITIONAS AT 31 DECEMBER 2021Notes 2021$‚Äô000 2020$‚Äô000 Assets Non-current assets Property  plant and equipment 10 954 558 958 508 Right of use assets 11 2 136 3 220 Deferred tax asset -

Statement of accounting policiesKenmare Resources plc (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) is domiciled in the Republic of Ireland. The Company‚Äôs registered address is Styne House  Hatch Street Upper  Dublin 2. The Company has a premium listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin. These unaudited consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù). The principal activity of the Group is the operation and further development of the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine in Mozambique.On 22 March 2022  the Directors approved the preliminary results for publication. While the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021  from which the preliminary results have been extracted  are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union  these preliminary results do not contain sufficient information to comply with IFRS. The Directors expect to publish on 7 April 2022 the full financial statements that comply with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.The auditor  KPMG  has not yet issued their audit opinion on the financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021. The financial information included within this unaudited preliminary results statement for the year ended 31 December 2021 does not constitute the statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of section 293 of the Companies Act 2014. The Group financial information in this preliminary statement for the year ended 31 December 2021 is unaudited. A copy of the statutory financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021 will be annexed to the next annual return and filed with the Registrar of Companies.The Group financial information for the year ended 31 December 2020 included in this preliminary statement represents an abbreviated version of the Group‚Äôs financial statements for that year. The statutory financial statements for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020  upon which the auditor  KPMG  has issued an unqualified opinion  were annexed to the annual return of the Company and filed with the Registrar of Companies.None of the new and revised standards and interpretations which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021  have a material effect on the Group‚Äôs financial statements.Going concernThe Directors have evaluated the appropriateness of the going concern basis in preparing the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements (the ‚Äòperiod of assessment‚Äô). The evaluation is based on the Group‚Äôs cash flow forecast (‚Äúthe Group Forecast‚Äù).The Group Forecast has been prepared by management with best estimates of production  pricing and cost assumptions over the period of assessment. The Group recognises the principal risks which can impact on the outcome of the Group Forecast and have therefore applied sensitivity analysis to the assumptions to test the robustness of the cash flow forecast for changes in market prices  shipments  operating and capital cost assumptions.Changes in these assumptions affect the level of sales and profitability of the Group and the amount of capital required to deliver the projected production levels. Debt covenants are complied with and Group liquidity is maintained  although at lower levels  in each of these scenarios.Having assessed the principal risks facing the Group  together with the Group‚Äôs cash flow forecast  the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for the foreseeable future and can continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 20212.

An adjustment to the mine closure cost of $2.2 million (2020: $11.0 million) was made during the year as a result of an update in the discount rate as detailed in Note 16.At each reporting date  the Group assesses whether there is any indication that property  plant and equipment may be impaired. The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value  among other factors  when reviewing for indicators for impairment. As at 31 December 2021  the market capitalisation of the Group was below the book value of net assets which is considered an indicator of impairment of assets. The Group carried out an impairment review of property  plant and equipment as at 31 December 2021. As a result of the review and given the performance and outlook of the Group no impairment provision was recognised in the current financial year. No impairment was recognised in the prior financial year. Given the historic volatility in product pricing and sensitivities of the forecast to the discount rate and to a lesser extent operating costs  the impairment loss of $64.8 million which was recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in 2014 was not reversed.The cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing is the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine. The basis on which the Mine is assessed is its value-in-use. The cash flow forecast employed for the value-in-use computation is from a life of mine financial model. The recoverable amount obtained from the financial model represents the present value of the future discounted pre-tax  pre-finance cash flows discounted at 10.5% (2020: 10.0%).UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202110. Property  plant and equipment (continued)Key assumptions include the following:‚Ä¢ The discount rate is based on the Group‚Äôs weighted average cost of capital. This rate is a best estimate of the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Mine  taking into consideration country risk  currency risk and price risk. The factors making up the cost of equity  cost of debt and capital structure have changed from the prior year review (in particular the risk-free rate) resulting in a discount rate of 10.5% (2020: 10.0%). The Group‚Äôs estimation of the country risk premium included in the discount rate has remained unchanged from the prior year. The Group does not consider it appropriate to apply the full current country risk premium for Mozambique to the calculation of the Group‚Äôs weighted average cost of capital as it believes the specific circumstances which have resulted in the risk premium increase over the past number of years are not relevant to the specific circumstances of the Moma Mine. Hence  country risk premium applicable to the calculation of the cost of equity has been adjusted accordingly. Using a discount rate of 10.5%  the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying amount by $384.0 million (2020: $260.2 million). The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the recoverable amount. A 5.8% increase in the discount rate to 16.3% reduces the recoverable amount by $384 million. The increase in the recoverable amount from the prior year is a result of increased cash flows over the life of mine due to the factors detailed below partially offset by an increase in the discount rate from 10.0% to 10.5%.‚Ä¢ A mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi proved probable reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine life assumption of 40 years has not changed from the prior year review. Average annual production is approximately 1.2 million tonnes (2020: 1.2 million tonnes) of ilmenite and co-products zircon  rutile and concentrates over the life of the Mine and remains unchanged from the prior year review. This mine plan does not include investment in additional mining capacity. Certain minimum stocks of final and intermediate products are assumed to be maintained at period ends.‚Ä¢ Product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers  or where contracts are based on market prices or production is not currently contracted  prices are forecast by the Group taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise provided by TiPMC Solutions and management expectations including general inflation of 2% per annum. Forecast prices provided by TiPMC Solutions have been reviewed and found to be consistent with other external sources of information. Average forecast product sales prices have increased over the life of mine from the prior year end review as a result of revised forecast pricing. A 12% reduction in average sales prices over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $384.0 million.‚Ä¢ Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2022 taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and estimated forecast inflation for 2022. From 2023 onwards operating costs are escalated by 2% per annum. Average forecast operating costs have increased from the prior year end review as a result of increased production and inflation. A 14% increase in operating costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $384.0 million.‚Ä¢ Capital costs are based on a life of mine capital plan including inflation at 2% per annum from 2022. Average forecast capital costs have increased from the prior year end review based on updated sustaining and development capital plans required to maintain the existing plant over the life of mine. The forecast takes into account reasonable cost increases and therefore a sensitivity to this assumption which would give rise to a reduction in the recoverable amount has not been applied.11.

The finance documentation also contemplates a Mine Closure Guarantee Facility (provided by either the existing lenders or other finance providers) of up to $40 million  with the provider(s) of such a facility sharing in the common security package. The potential total aggregate principal amount of indebtedness secured under the finance documentation is therefore $190 million. The transaction costs for arrangement of the debt facilities amounted to $6.5 million.The Term Loan Facility has a final maturity date of 11 March 2025. Interest is at LIBOR plus 5.40% per annum. Repayment is in seven equal semi-annual instalments  beginning 11 March 2022.The Revolving Credit Facility has a final maturity date of 11 December 2022 extendable by up to 24 months at the lenders‚Äô discretion. Interest is at LIBOR plus 5.00% per annum.During the period the Group entered into a mine closure guarantee with Absa Bank Mo√ßambique SA for $11.4 million. This guarantee shares the security package with the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility on a pro rata and pari passu basis.The security package consists of (a) security over the Group‚Äôs bank accounts (subject to certain exceptions)  (b) pledges of the shares of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited and Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (the ‚ÄúProject Companies‚Äù)  (c) security over intercompany loans and (d) Mozambican law security interests over certain rights and agreements with Mozambican authorities  including over the Implementation Agreement  the Mineral Licensing Contract and the Mining Licence.The carrying amount of the secured bank accounts of the Group was $66.9 million as at 31 December 2021 (2020:$87.0 million). The shares of the Project Companies and intercompany loans are not included in the consolidated statement of financial position as they are eliminated on consolidation. They therefore do not have a carrying amount but  upon enforcement of the pledges on behalf of the lender group  the shares in the Project Companies would cease to be owned or controlled by the Group. The secured rights and agreements do not have a carrying amount. They are  however  necessary for the Project Companies to operate the Mine in Mozambique.The finance documents contain a number of representations  covenants and events of default on customary terms  the breach of which could lead to the secured parties under the finance documentation accelerating the outstanding loans and taking other enforcement steps  such as the enforcement of some or all of the security interests  which could lead  in extremis  with the Group losing its interest in the Mine. The most salient of the relevant terms that could lead to acceleration of the loans and/or enforcement of security are the financial covenants.At 31 December 2021 total debt of $148.1 million (2020: $145.8 million) was recognised by the Group  being the drawdown of $150.0 million before unamortised transaction costs of $3.8 million (2020: $5.4 million) plus interest amortised of $2.0 million (2020: $1.2 million).UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202115.

A corresponding amount equal to the provision is recognised as part of property  plant and equipment. The costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan  are subject to regular review and are estimated based on the net present value of estimated future cost. Mine closure costs are a normal consequence of mining  and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the life of the Mine. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost and $0.7 million (2020: $0.7 million) has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the financial year.The main assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated future costs include:‚Ä¢ a discount rate of 2.9% (2020: 2.0%);‚Ä¢ an inflation rate of 2% (2020: 2%);‚Ä¢ an estimated life of mine of 40 years (2020: 40 years). It is assumed that all licences and permits required to operate will be renewed or extended during the life of mine; and‚Ä¢ an estimated closure cost of $34.1 million (2020: $34.1 million) and an estimated post-closure monitoring provision of $3.9 million (2020: $3.9 million).The life of mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources as set out in the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resources table. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine closure provision has decreased by $1.0 million to reflect a change in the discount rate from 2.0% to 2.9%.The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the Mine closure provision. The discount rate increased to 2.9% (2020: 2.0%) as a result of movements in the US Treasury rates. Thirty-year US Treasury yields are the longest period for which yields are quoted. A forty-year rate to align with the estimated life of mine has been calculated by taking the average of the increase in yield from ten to twenty years and the increase in yield from twenty to thirty years and adding this average to the thirty-year treasury rate to arrive at an estimated extrapolated rate for forty years. This discount rate is deemed to provide the best estimate of the current market assessment of risk-free time value of the money. Risks specific to the liability are included in the cost estimate. A reasonable possible increase of 1% in the estimated discount rate results in the Mine closure provision decreasing to $24.0 million. A 1% decrease in the estimated discount rate results in the Mine closure provision increasing to $54.0 million.The Mine rehabilitation provision represents the Directors‚Äô best estimate of the Company‚Äôs liability for rehabilitating areas disturbed by mining activities. Rehabilitation costs are recognised based on the area disturbed and estimated cost of rehabilitation per hectare which is reviewed regularly against actual rehabilitation cost per hectare. Actual rehabilitation expenditure is incurred approximately twelve months after the area has been disturbed. During the financial year there was a release of $0.4 million (2020: $0.8 million) to reflect the actual mine rehabilitation costs incurred  and an addition to the provision of $0.4 million (2020: $1.4 million) for areas newly disturbed.Other provisions comprise an amount of $2.3 million (2020: $nil million) in relation to a potential indirect tax liability. As the matter is still outstanding it is possible that on conclusion the final outcome may differ from management‚Äôs estimate.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117.

The table does not include fair value information for other receivables  prepayments  trade payables and accruals as these are not measured at fair value as the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Trade receivables which are factored through the Absa Bank facility or letters of credit which are always confirmed and discounted through the Barclays Bank facility are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Trade receivables or letters or credit where it is not known at initial recognition if they will be factored are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Group derecognises the original receivable to which the arrangement applies when payment is received from the bank as the terms of the arrangement are non-recourse. The payment to the bank by the Group‚Äôs customers are considered non-cash transactions. Trade receivables not measured at fair value are receivables whose payment is received under the sale contract credit terms.The valuation technique used in measuring Level 2 fair values is discounted cash flows which considers the expected receipts or payments discounted using adjusted market discount rates or where these rates are not available estimated discount rates. The Group has exposure to credit risk  liquidity risk and market risk arising from financial instruments.Risk management frameworkThe Board is ultimately responsible for risk management within the Group. It has delegated responsibility for the monitoring of the effectiveness of the Group‚Äôs risk management and internal control systems to the Audit & Risk Committee. The Board and Audit & Risk Committee receive reports from executive management on the key risks to the business and the steps being taken to mitigate such risks. The Audit & Risk Committee is assisted in its role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures  the results of which are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee.Credit RiskCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet it contractual obligations  and arises principally from the Group‚Äôs trade receivables from customers. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.Trade receivablesThe Group‚Äôs exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual circumstances of each customer. The Group also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base  including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate. Before entering into sales contracts with new customers  the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer‚Äôs credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits attributed to customers are reviewed regularly during the year.The Group‚Äôs customers have been transacting with the Group for a significant number of years  and no customers‚Äô balances have been written off or are credit-impaired at the financial year end. In monitoring customer credit risk  customers are reviewed individually and the Group has not identified any factors which would merit reducing exposure to any particular customer. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade receivables.At 31 December 2021  $41.3 million (2020: $7.2 million) is due from the Group‚Äôs three largest customers.

For deposits in excess of $50 million the Group requires that the institution has an A- (S&P)/A3 (Moody‚Äôs) long-term rating. For deposits in excess of $15 million  the Group requires that the institution has a BB- (S&P)/Ba3 (Moody‚Äôs) long-term rating.At 31 December 2021 and 2020 cash was deposited with the following banks:2021 2020 Long-term credit rating Long-term credit rating $ million S&P Moody‚Äôs $ million S&P Moody‚Äôs Barclays Bank plc 60.8 A Positive A-1 Stable 60.0 A Negative A-1 Stable FirstRand Bank Limited 5.1 BBB - Stable Ba2 Negative 15.0 BBB- Stable Ba2 Negative Nedbank Limited - BB- Stable Ba2 Negative 10.0 BB- Stable Ba2 Negative HSBC Bank plc 0.8 A+ Stable A1 Stable 1.7 A+ Stable A1 Stable Absa Bank Limited 2.0 BBB- Stable Ba2 Negative - BBB- Stable Ba2 NegativeLiquidity riskLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled in cash payments. The Group‚Äôs objective when managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due.The Group monitors mine payment forecasts  both operating and capital  which assist it in monitoring cash flow requirements and optimising its cash return on investments. The Group aims to maintain the level of its cash and cash equivalents at an amount in excess of expected cash outflows on financial liabilities. The Group monitors the level of expected cash inflows on trade receivables together with expected cash outflows on trade and other payables.The Group has a trade finance facility with Absa Bank for three of the Group‚Äôs largest customers. In accordance with this facility the bank purchases 80% of the receivable without recourse and so the bank takes on the credit risk. The facility is $30 million with limits on the maximum amount that can be factored for each of the customers named in the facility. During the period no trade receivables were factored under this agreement. At the year end  trade receivables amounting to $14.5 million (2020: $8.9 million) may be factored under this facility and are therefore included in trade receivables as at 31 December 2021. The cost of this facility for the period  which amounted to $0.2 million (2020: $0.2 million)  is included in finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income and in net cash from operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117. Financial Instruments (continued)The Group has a trade facility with Barclays Bank for customers which it sells to under letter of credit terms. Under this facility  Barclays Bank confirms the letter of credit from the issuing bank and therefore takes the credit risk that the issuing bank will not pay. Barclays Bank can also discount these letters of credit thereby providing early payment of receivables to the Group. There is no limit under the Barclays Bank facility. During the period trade receivables of $224.4 million (2020: $88.3 million) were discounted under this facility. At the year-end there were $37.1 million (2020: $6.2 million) which may be discounted under this facility. The cost of this facility for the period  which amounted to $0.1 million (2020: $0.1 million)  is included in finance costs in the condensed statement of comprehensive income and in net cash from operating activities in the condensed statement of consolidated cash flows.The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group‚Äôs financial liabilities at 31 December 2021 based on the gross contractual undiscounted payments:Financial liabilities Total$‚Äô000 Less thanone year$‚Äô000 Between2 and 5 years$‚Äô000 More than5 years$‚Äô000 Bank loans 164 331 79 136 85 195 - Lease liabilities 2 684 1 207 1 317 160 Trade & other payables 32 768 32 768 - - 199 783 113 111 86 512 160The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group‚Äôs financial liabilities at 31 December 2020 based on the gross contractual undiscounted payments:Financial liabilities Total$‚Äô000 Less thanone year$‚Äô000 Between2 and 5 years$‚Äô000 More than5 years$‚Äô000 Bank loans 171 479 7 149 164 330 - Lease liabilities 4 044 1 359 2 251 434 Trade & other payables 50 122 50 122 ‚Äì ‚Äì 225 645 58 630 166 581 434As disclosed in Note 15 the Group has bank loans that contain loan covenants. A future breach of covenant may require the Group to repay the loan earlier than indicated in the above table. Under the loan agreement  the covenants are monitored on a regular basis by Group finance and regularly reported to management and the lenders to ensure compliance with the agreement.Risk ConcentrationConcentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities  or activities in the same geographical region  or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic  political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group‚Äôs performance to developments affecting a particular industry.The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables and contract assets as low  as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets. Details of concentration of revenue are included in Note 2.Market riskMarket risk is risk that changes in market prices for foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Group‚Äôs income statement. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures while optimising returns.Currency riskThe Group is exposed to transactional foreign currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales  purchases  receivables and borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of Group companies. The functional currencies of all Group are US Dollars. The presentational currency of the Group is US Dollars. Sales and bank loans are denominated in US Dollars which significantly reduces the exposure of the Group to foreign currency risk. Payables transactions are denominated in Mozambican Metical  South African Rand  Euro  Sterling  Australian Dollar and Renminbi.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117. Financial Instruments (continued)The Group‚Äôs risk management policy is to match the estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecast purchases over the following three to six months at any point in time to the extent that funds are available to do so.Exposure to currency riskThe Group‚Äôs exposure to currency risk as at 31 December 2021 is as follows.US Dollar$‚Äô000 Mozambican Metical$‚Äô000 South African Rand$‚Äô000 Euro$‚Äô000 Sterling$‚Äô000 Australian Dollar$‚Äô000 Renminbi$‚Äô000 Trade and other receivables 69 408 2 717 1 275 928 55 364 - Cash and cash equivalents 64 837 1 030 2 337 479 338 6 36 Bank loans (151 914) - - - - - - Leases (650) - - (1 528) - - - Trade & other payables (14 283) (14 082) (1 905) (2 395) (35) (68) - Net exposure (32 602) (10 335) 1 707 (2 516) 358 302 36The Group‚Äôs exposure to currency risk as at 31 December 2020 is as follows.US Dollar$‚Äô000 Mozambican Metical$‚Äô000 South African Rand$‚Äô000 Euro$‚Äô000 Sterling$‚Äô000 Australian Dollar$‚Äô000 Renminbi$‚Äô000 Trade and other receivables 28 059 ‚Äì 444 740 38 634 ‚Äì Cash and cash equivalents 81 969 130 4 406 441 256 21 21 Bank loans (151 217) ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì Leases (2 217) ‚Äì ‚Äì (1 815) ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì Trade & other payables (31 185) (8 371) (8 186) (712) (62) (1 606) ‚Äì Net exposure (74 591) (8 241) (3 336) (1 346) 232 (951) 21Sensitivity analysisA reasonably possible strengthening or weakening of the Mozambique Metical  South African Rand  Euro  Sterling  Australian Dollar and Renminbi by 1% against US Dollar would have affected profit or loss by the amounts shown below.

Financial Instruments (continued)Interest rate riskThe loan facilities are arranged at variable rates and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Variable rates are based on six-month LIBOR. The borrowing rate at financial year end was 5.8% (2020: 5.8%). The interest rate profile of the Group‚Äôs loan balances at the financial year end was as follows:2021$‚Äô000 2020$‚Äô000 Variable rate debt 151 914 151 217Under the assumption that all other variables remain constant  a reasonable possible change of 1% in the six-month LIBOR rate results in a $1.5 million (2020: $1.5 million) change in finance costs for the financial year.The above sensitivity analyses are estimates of the impact of market risks assuming the specified change occurs. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global financial markets  which may cause fluctuations in interest rates to vary from the assumptions made above and therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events.Interest rate benchmark reformA fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally  including the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as ‚ÄúIBOR reform‚Äù). The group has exposure to IBORs on its financial instruments that will be reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives. The Group‚Äôs main IBOR exposure at the reporting date is US LIBOR  which is administered by ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA). The alternative reference rate for US LIBOR is the US Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).On 5 March 2021  IBA stated that it will cease the publication of (i) the overnight and 1  3  6 and 12 months USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on Friday  June 30  2023 and (ii) all other LIBOR settings  including the 1 week and 2 months USD LIBOR settings  immediately following the LIBOR publication on Friday  December 31  2021. IBA stated that it will not have access to input data necessary to calculate LIBOR settings on a representative basis after those dates. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a separate announcement confirming that IBA had notified the FCA of its intent to cease providing all LIBOR settings. The FCA confirmed that all 35 LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative as of the dates set out by IBA.The Group anticipates that IBOR reform will impact its operational and risk management processes. The main risk to which the Group is exposed as a result of IBOR reform is in the amendment to the Senior Facility Agreement with negotiation with the lender group to reflect the migration from USD LIBOR to SOFR  updating contractual terms and revising operational controls related to the migration. Financial risk is predominantly limited to interest rate risk.The Audit & Risk Committee monitors while the executive and senior management manages the migration to alternative rates. Such management includes evaluation of the extent to which contracts reference IBOR  whether such contracts will need to be amended as a result of IBOR reform and how to manage communication about IBOR reform to counterparties.The Group plans to amend contractual terms for purposes of migrating from USD LIBOR to SOFR prior to the discontinuance of the administration and publication of the relevant LIBOR rates by IBA.The carrying amount of financial liabilities with unreformed contracts at 31 December 2021 was $148.1 million (31 December 2020: $145.8 million).18. Contingent liabilitiesThe Group  like other businesses operating in Mozambique  is subject to tax audits by the Mozambican Tax Authorities. These audits may review a range of matters including corporate income tax  indirect taxes and transaction related issues  and can take a number of years to complete. The Mozambican Tax Authority conducted an audit of the tax obligations of the Branch in relation to the years 2015 to 2017. The Group is liaising with the Tax Authority to address matters raised during the audit. It is not possible to estimate with certainty the timing of any future resolution or possible outcomes.A provision of $2.3 million (2020: $nil) is included in the financial statements in relation to a potential indirect tax liability. As the matter is still outstanding it is possible that on conclusion the outcome may differ from management‚Äôs estimates. Other tax matters raised during the audit are likewise still outstanding. No provision has been made in these financial statements in relation to the other tax matters as the Group does not consider that there is any material future probable loss.GLOSSARY ‚Äì ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURESCertain financial measures set out in the 2021 Preliminary Results are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  but represent additional measures used by the Board to assess performance and for reporting both internally and to shareholders and other external users.

Our financial results were driven by record production volumes and higher average prices received for our products  with revenues up 87% and EBITDA up 182%. Following our lowest ever Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate in 2021  we have continued to achieve new safety milestones  passing eight million hours without a Lost Time Injury in early March 2022. Production in Q1 2022 has been impacted by poor weather conditions but we remain on track to achieve our 2022 guidance.We are pleased to be publishing our first Climate Strategy Report in the coming weeks  along with our second Sustainability Report. In addition to setting a short-term carbon reduction target  the Board has also approved our ambition to be Net Zero by 2040.The positive momentum we saw in all our product markets in 2021 has continued into 2022. Global demand for ilmenite  our primary product  continues to exceed supply and our production volumes are being well received by the market.In light of this continuing market strength and our record performance  the Board is recommending a 2021 dividend of USc32.71 per share  up from USc10.00 per share in 2020. This is in line with our 2021 dividend target payout of 25% of profit after tax and follows the $81.6 million share buy-back we completed in December as part of our strategy to deliver compelling shareholder returns.‚Äù2021 overviewFinancialRecommended 2021 dividend of $32.1 million or USc32.71 per share (2020: USc10.00)  up 227% on 2020  comprising an interim dividend of USc7.29 per share (paid in October 2021) and a final dividend of USc25.42 per share (expected to be paid in June 2022)87% increase in revenue to $455.9 million in 2021 (2020: $243.7 million)  driven by record shipments and a 21% increase in the average price received for Kenmare‚Äôs products20% increase in total cash operating costs to $189.7 million (2020: $158.0 million) as a result of a 46% increase in finished product production  plus increased costs relating to repairs and maintenance  Heavy Mineral Concentrate (‚ÄúHMC‚Äù) haulage from the Pilivili operations  and COVID-19 management18% decrease in cash operating costs per tonne to $154 per tonne (2020: $188 per tonne)  benefitting from increased product volumes. 26% decrease in net ilmenite unit costs to $93 per tonne (2020: $125 per tonne)  due to increased ilmenite production and higher co-product revenues182% increase in EBITDA to $216.1 million (2020: $76.7 million)  due to increased production  stronger product pricing and lower unit costs  representing a 51% EBITDA margin (2020: 33%)669% increase in profit after tax to $128.5 million (2020: $16.7 million) due to higher EBITDA  partially offset by increased depreciation chargesNet debt position of $82.8 million at year-end 2021  compared to $64.0 million at year-end 2020  following the completion of the $81.6 million share buy-backStory continuesOperationalRecord annual HMC production of 1 555 900 tonnes  representing a 30% increase compared to 2020 (1 201 100 tonnes)  benefitting from increased tonnes mined and higher ore grades48% increase in ilmenite production to 1 119 400 tonnes (2020: 756 000 tonnes) benefitting from increased HMC processed51% increase in shipments of finished products to 1 285 300 tonnes (2020: 853 100 tonnes)  reflecting increased production and benefitting from improved transshipment capacityCommissioning commenced of Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply (‚ÄúRUPS‚Äù)  which is expected to deliver benefits in terms of power stability  operating cost reductions  and lower carbon emissions through reduced usage of diesel generatorsKenmare is on track to achieve 2022 guidance  although production in Q1 2022 is expected to be below the anticipated annual run rate due to poor weather conditions during the quarterDividend timetableThe Company confirms the dates for the 2021 final dividend are as follows:Ex-dividend date 28 April 2022 Record date 29 April 2022 Currency election date 4 May 2022 at noon AGM date for shareholder approval 26 May 2022 Payment date 1 June 2022Irish Dividend Withholding Tax (25%) must be deducted from dividends paid by the Company  unless a shareholder is entitled to an exemption and has submitted a properly completed exemption form to the Company‚Äôs Registrar.Analyst and investor briefing and conference callKenmare will host a briefing and a conference call for analysts  institutional investors  and media today at 9:00am UK time.

Listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Euronext Dublin  Kenmare operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine in Mozambique. Moma‚Äôs production accounts for approximately 8% of global titanium feedstocks and the Group supplies to customers in more than 15 countries. Kenmare produces raw materials that are ultimately consumed in everyday ‚Äúquality-of life‚Äù items such as paints  plastics and ceramic tiles.All monetary amounts refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.Forward Looking StatementsThis announcement contains some forward-looking statements that represent Kenmare's expectations for its business  based on current expectations about future events  which by their nature involve risks and uncertainties. Kenmare believes that its expectations and assumptions with respect to these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However  because they involve risk and uncertainty  which are in some cases beyond Kenmare's control  actual results or performance may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information.CHAIRMAN‚ÄôS STATEMENTDear shareholders 2021 was the first full year of operations at the high grade Pilivili ore zone  in addition to our original Namalope area. Significant increases in production and shipments were achieved  while our product markets exhibited strong demand throughout the year. As a result  revenue increased by 87% to $455.9 million  and profit after tax by 669% to $128.5 million  vindicating our strategy of investing in additional production capacity in anticipation of a tight market.As we began 2021  while we had largely completed the last of our three growth projects  operational effectiveness continued to be impacted by COVID-19. Our vaccination  testing  and quarantine protocols mitigated the worst effects of the virus  however  and we also achieved a truly outstanding safety performance. Nevertheless  we remain vigilant as the pandemic continues to evolve. The health and safety of our colleagues and host communities remain our highest priorities.Shareholder returnsKenmare committed to increase shareholder returns after the completion of the major capital projects executed during 2018-2020. Accordingly  we have recommended a dividend payout of 25% of profit after tax for 2021  higher than the 20% minimum policy. Subject to shareholder approval  our 2021 full year dividend will be USc32.71  an increase of 227% compared to 2020.Despite robust operational and financial performance  our share price during 2021 did not fully reflect Kenmare‚Äôs intrinsic value  and the Board concluded that a share buy-back was therefore a prudent use of capital. A share buy-back was completed in December 2021  returning $81.6 million to eligible shareholders while reducing the number of shares in issue by 13.5%.I am pleased that Kenmare has been able to return almost $100 million in aggregate to shareholders during 2021  through dividends and the share buy-back  whilst also maintaining a robust balance sheet.At the 2022 Annual General Meeting (‚ÄúAGM‚Äù) Kenmare will ask shareholders to approve resolutions to implement an Odd-lot Offer at some point during the next 18 months. This will enable the Company to purchase  at a 5% premium  the shares held by eligible certificated shareholders who hold fewer than 200 shares in the Company. This will help small shareholders who would otherwise have difficulty selling their holdings due to disproportionate trading costs. Further details of the Odd-lot Offer scheme will be included in the Notice of AGM to be distributed to shareholders in due course.Outlook and strategyIn 2021 we benefitted from strong product markets for all our products and this positive momentum has continued into 2022. Our increased production has been well absorbed by our markets and demand for Kenmare ilmenite remains strong. However  the tragic conflict in Ukraine has created significant uncertainties in global trade routes and the wider economy. It is too soon to speculate on the overall effects on our business  but Ukraine is a significant supplier of titanium feedstocks  while lower global growth could reduce demand for our products.In 2025  Wet Concentrator Plant (‚ÄúWCP‚Äù) A will move to the Nataka ore zone. Field tests of mining methods and planning studies are making good progress and a Pre-Feasibility Study for the move is expected to be completed later in 2022. This will include details of the mining method  relocation  provision of water and power  an HMC pumping system  and plans for tailings disposal.Our overall strategy is to operate responsibly to deliver long-life low-cost production  allocating capital efficiently  including towards developing accretive growth opportunities. The Kenmare team is committed to achieving these strategic goals  while also becoming a first quartile producer on the industry revenue to cost curve. Achievement of these long-term strategic goals will support further increases in free cash flow and higher dividends  as well as improving resilience in case of potential cyclical commodity market downturns.SustainabilityKenmare has always placed sustainability at the heart of its business practices  working responsibly to achieve ambitious environment  social  and governance goals. In 2021  we published our inaugural Sustainability Report  which set out guiding principles  together with some examples of our approach to responsible environmental management  and constructive community and other stakeholder relations. We will publish our second Sustainability Report in the coming weeks  including commentary on our performance against public sustainability targets for the first time.The Board has ratified an inaugural Climate Policy and we will shortly publish our first Climate Strategy Report  aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‚ÄúTCFD‚Äù).During 2021 we launched a Portuguese version of our corporate website to ensure all information is easily accessible for Mozambicans. For the second consecutive year  we were pleased to be named as the most transparent extractive industry company in Mozambique by the Centre for Public Integrity‚Äôs Extractive Industry Transparency Index.Board developmentIn 2021  an external performance evaluation of the Board and all of its Committees was conducted by Board Excellence  in accordance with the provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. I am pleased to report that the evaluation concluded that Kenmare‚Äôs Board operates efficiently  ‚Äúwith a deep commitment to do the right thing and excel on behalf of shareholders  employees and stakeholders.‚Äù A summary of outcomes and actions from the evaluation will be published in our 2021 Annual Report.A number of important changes in the composition of the Board took place during the year  and further changes will occur in 2022 when I plan to retire  after nine years on Kenmare‚Äôs Board  almost eight of them as Chairman.Gabriel Smith  Tim Keating  and Peter Bacchus stepped down and I would like to thank them sincerely for their important contributions to Kenmare‚Äôs success in recent years. Graham Martin has assumed the role of Senior Independent Director following Peter‚Äôs departure.In March 2021  we were pleased to welcome Sameer Oundhakar to replace Tim as the representative Director of our largest shareholder  African Acquisition S.√†.r.l.  an investment vehicle owned by the Oman Investment Authority.In October 2021  we announced that Mette Dobel had agreed to join the Board as an independent Non-Executive Director effective 1 January 2022. Her significant leadership experience both as a senior executive and director of FLSmidth A/S  at the cutting edge of mining technology and automation  will be invaluable as we strive to achieve further operational efficiencies and build a positive social and environmental legacy.In December 2021  Andrew Webb joined the Board as an independent Non-Executive Director and Chair Designate. Andrew brings extensive natural resources and financial advisory experience  having previously served as a Managing Director at Rothschild & Co in the Global Advisory team  where he worked for 25 years. I have enjoyed working with him through the transition period and am confident that Andrew‚Äôs skills and enormous mining industry and finance experience position him well to play a key role in driving the future success of the business.I plan to step down following the 2022 AGM and Andrew will become Chairman. I look forward with confidence to Andrew and the rest of the Board taking Kenmare to even higher levels of achievement in future yearsAfter these changes  the composition of the Board will provide a strong and diverse mix of talents  skills and experience  well suited to the business and challenges ahead  while achieving our gender diversity target with female Directors representing one third of the Board.AcknowledgementsI would like to end my final statement as Chairman by thanking all of Kenmare‚Äôs key stakeholders for their support and commitment to the Company and the Board  not only during the unprecedented challenges we have all experienced during the past two years of COVID-19 disruption  but also throughout my nine-year tenure. I look back on the Company‚Äôs achievements with a sense of pride and I am pleased to be leaving Kenmare in the strongest position in its history.It has been a privilege to work with my fellow Board members  and particularly Michael Carvill who founded the company and has led it selflessly and courageously for more than 20 years. Kenmare has an outstanding management team and a remarkable workforce. I feel privileged to have worked with such a talented group and I will follow the Company‚Äôs continued progress with keen interest.With capacity to deliver 1.2 million tonnes per annum (‚ÄúMtpa‚Äù) of ilmenite on a sustainable basis  buoyant product markets  and a first class team  I am confident that Kenmare will continue to generate value for all stakeholders in 2022 and beyond.Steven McTiernanChairmanMANAGING DIRECTOR‚ÄôS STATEMENTKenmare delivered a record year for safety  production  and shipments in 2021. The Company demonstrated its resilience and agility  protecting our employees and host communities against a second year of heightened risk due to COVID-19. I would like to thank all our team for their hard work and dedication  particularly during H1 2021 when we faced huge challenges as a result of the virus.Our record operational performance in 2021 was supported by strong market conditions for all our products. We increased production of ilmenite  our main product  by almost 50% compared to 2020 and this was well received by the product market  with quarter-on-quarter price increases. This enabled us to generate EBITDA of $216.1 million  up 182% on 2020  and gave us the confidence to return almost $100 million to shareholders during the year  increasing our 2021 dividend payout to 25% of profit after tax  above the 20% minimum policy  and completing a share buy-back of 13.5% of our issued share capital.We are targeting production of 1.2 Mtpa of ilmenite  plus co-products  on a sustainable basis and reduced unit costs. We remain focused on delivering strong free cash flow and shareholder returns  while continuing to raise the standards to which we hold ourselves in terms of environment  social  and governance performance. We believe we are achieving our purpose of responsibly meeting global demand for quality-of-life minerals.SafetyIt is testimony to our strong safety culture that Kenmare reported its best ever safety performance in 2021. This achievement is particularly significant given the additional pressure put on our mining operations by COVID-19  which had the potential to increase safety risks.We delivered our lowest ever Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate of 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 31 December 2021  which also represented more than six million hours worked without a Lost Time Injury (‚ÄúLTI‚Äù) and an 88% reduction compared to 2020. Our Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (‚ÄúTRIFR‚Äù) relative to the 2020 International Council on Mining and Metals TRIFR was in the top quintile. On 6 January 2022 we achieved one year without a LTI and we are working hard to maintain this record performance. We also retained our five-star NOSA safety accreditation for the sixth consecutive year.SustainabilityOur commitment to working responsibly is enshrined in Kenmare‚Äôs purpose and we are particularly focused on protecting our employees and our host communities in Mozambique. In mid-2021 we began vaccinating our workforce against COVID-19 and by the end of the year  96% had been double vaccinated. We also donated 12 000 vaccines to local communities.Through the Kenmare Moma Development Association (‚ÄúKMAD‚Äù)  we completed the construction of a new health centre for the communities living near our Pilivili operations and constructed seven school blocks in the Namalope and Pilivili areas. By the end of the year  over 1 000 farmers were registered in our Conservation Agriculture programme to improve crop yields and 75 small businesses were benefitting from KMAD support.We recognise the role and responsibility all businesses must take in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and as such  in December 2021  the Board approved Kenmare‚Äôs Climate Policy. We will publish our first Climate Strategy Report in the coming weeks  which follows recommendations made by the TCFD. We have an ambition of becoming Net Zero (Scope 1 and 2) by 2040  with a short-term carbon emissions reduction target of 12% by 2024  contingent on receiving a reliable power supply from the Mozambican state power provider  Electricidade de Mo√ßambique.In early 2021 we approved the development of a RUPS. It is expected to deliver increased power stability for the Mineral Separation Plant  an important risk mitigation measure  and is anticipated to be the main contributor towards our reduced emissions through lower diesel consumption. At an estimated cost of $18 million  the RUPS is a Net Present Value positive project  using conservative assumptions  and commissioning commenced in Q1 2022.We also continued to invest in our people. The Moma workforce received 21 100 hours of training during the year as we believe that providing continuous development opportunities is key to attracting and retaining the best people and maintaining our strong safety culture. At the end of 2021  we had 1 551 employees at the Moma Mine and over 97% of them were Mozambican  with 70% from the local district or province. 12.5% of our Moma employees were women  compared with 10.6% in 2020  reflecting our successful initiatives to encourage women to join and remain in our workforce.Operational performance2021 was a record year for production and the first time we have produced more than one million tonnes of ilmenite. Total production of finished products was up 46% compared to 2020  driven by the higher ore grades mined in Pilivili by WCP B following its relocation in Q3 2020. We achieved Moma‚Äôs nameplate capacity of 1.2 Mtpa ilmenite production in Q3 2021  which set a new quarterly production record  and demonstrated our ability to produce at our targeted rate. We are now focused on achieving this run rate on a consistent basis. 2021 was also a record year for shipments  which were up 51% compared to 2020.We achieved this compelling performance despite the impact of COVID-19 on our operations  particularly in H1 2021. Ilmenite production was below the midpoint of guidance due to the challenges of operating with a reduced workforce  including senior management  and power supply disruptions in Q4. Operating costs per tonne were 3% above the top end of our guidance range due mainly to additional costs associated with repairs and maintenance  HMC haulage  and COVID-19 management. In 2022  we will look to progress towards becoming a first quartile producer on the industry revenue to cost curve.Product marketKenmare is the world‚Äôs largest supplier of ilmenite and the Moma Mine is one of the largest titanium minerals deposits globally. The titanium feedstocks we produce are principally used to make pigment  which is essential for imparting whiteness and opacity in the production of paints  paper  plastic  and a range of other items we use in our everyday lives.2021 was a strong year for all of Kenmare‚Äôs product markets  with increased volumes sold at a 21% higher average price than in 2020. Robust demand for titanium feedstocks  like ilmenite  was driven primarily by global pigment production reaching a record high and the titanium metal market improving. Following softer demand in 2020  the market for zircon  our main co-product  stabilised in Q1 2021 and then saw price increases throughout the remainder of 2021. The positive pricing momentum for all our products has continued into 2022  with global inventories remaining low.OutlookAlthough the pandemic continued to create huge challenges in 2021  I believe we have built a stronger business. The past two years have shown us what we are all capable of  particularly when we pull together and look out for each other. I would like to thank all our stakeholders  particularly those in Mozambique  for their invaluable support.I would also like to thank Steven McTiernan for his outstanding contribution to Kenmare. He led the Company as Chairman during a period of significant change  providing constructive challenge  wise counsel  and strong support. I look forward to working with Andrew Webb and ensuring we continue to deliver positive returns and create value for all our stakeholders.As we look to the months and years ahead  we know we have a lot of hard work ahead of us to live up to our strategy of operating responsibly  delivering long-life  low-cost production  and allocating capital efficiently  including developing accretive growth opportunities. However  we can be proud that our operations are safe and performing well  our balance sheet is strong  our product markets are tight  and our employees have proven they can succeed even in the most difficult conditions.Michael CarvillManaging DirectorUNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021Notes 2021$‚Äô000 2020$‚Äô000 Revenue 2 455 944 243 746 Cost of sales 4 (244 986) (179 103) Gross profit 210 958 64 643 Other operating costs 5 (57 977) (30 250) Operating profit 152 981 34 393 Finance income 6 265 642 Finance costs 7 (12 053) (11 301) Foreign exchange loss (3 897) (980) Profit before tax 137 296 22 754 Income tax expense 8 (8 770) (6 015) Profit for the financial year and total comprehensive income for the financial year 128 526 16 739 Attributable to equity holders 128 526 16 739 $ per share $ per share Profit per share: Basic 9 1.18 0.15 Profit per share: Diluted 9 1.16 0.15The accompanying notes form part of these financial statements.UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITIONAS AT 31 DECEMBER 2021Notes 2021$‚Äô000 2020$‚Äô000 Assets Non-current assets Property  plant and equipment 10 954 558 958 508 Right of use assets 11 2 136 3 220 Deferred tax asset -

A copy of the statutory financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021 will be annexed to the next annual return and filed with the Registrar of Companies.The Group financial information for the year ended 31 December 2020 included in this preliminary statement represents an abbreviated version of the Group‚Äôs financial statements for that year. The statutory financial statements for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020  upon which the auditor  KPMG  has issued an unqualified opinion  were annexed to the annual return of the Company and filed with the Registrar of Companies.None of the new and revised standards and interpretations which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021  have a material effect on the Group‚Äôs financial statements.Going concernThe Directors have evaluated the appropriateness of the going concern basis in preparing the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements (the ‚Äòperiod of assessment‚Äô). The evaluation is based on the Group‚Äôs cash flow forecast (‚Äúthe Group Forecast‚Äù).The Group Forecast has been prepared by management with best estimates of production  pricing and cost assumptions over the period of assessment. The Group recognises the principal risks which can impact on the outcome of the Group Forecast and have therefore applied sensitivity analysis to the assumptions to test the robustness of the cash flow forecast for changes in market prices  shipments  operating and capital cost assumptions.Changes in these assumptions affect the level of sales and profitability of the Group and the amount of capital required to deliver the projected production levels. Debt covenants are complied with and Group liquidity is maintained  although at lower levels  in each of these scenarios.Having assessed the principal risks facing the Group  together with the Group‚Äôs cash flow forecast  the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for the foreseeable future and can continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 20212.

An adjustment to the mine closure cost of $2.2 million (2020: $11.0 million) was made during the year as a result of an update in the discount rate as detailed in Note 16.At each reporting date  the Group assesses whether there is any indication that property  plant and equipment may be impaired. The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value  among other factors  when reviewing for indicators for impairment. As at 31 December 2021  the market capitalisation of the Group was below the book value of net assets which is considered an indicator of impairment of assets. The Group carried out an impairment review of property  plant and equipment as at 31 December 2021. As a result of the review and given the performance and outlook of the Group no impairment provision was recognised in the current financial year. No impairment was recognised in the prior financial year. Given the historic volatility in product pricing and sensitivities of the forecast to the discount rate and to a lesser extent operating costs  the impairment loss of $64.8 million which was recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in 2014 was not reversed.The cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing is the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine. The basis on which the Mine is assessed is its value-in-use. The cash flow forecast employed for the value-in-use computation is from a life of mine financial model. The recoverable amount obtained from the financial model represents the present value of the future discounted pre-tax  pre-finance cash flows discounted at 10.5% (2020: 10.0%).UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202110. Property  plant and equipment (continued)Key assumptions include the following:‚Ä¢ The discount rate is based on the Group‚Äôs weighted average cost of capital. This rate is a best estimate of the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Mine  taking into consideration country risk  currency risk and price risk. The factors making up the cost of equity  cost of debt and capital structure have changed from the prior year review (in particular the risk-free rate) resulting in a discount rate of 10.5% (2020: 10.0%). The Group‚Äôs estimation of the country risk premium included in the discount rate has remained unchanged from the prior year. The Group does not consider it appropriate to apply the full current country risk premium for Mozambique to the calculation of the Group‚Äôs weighted average cost of capital as it believes the specific circumstances which have resulted in the risk premium increase over the past number of years are not relevant to the specific circumstances of the Moma Mine. Hence  country risk premium applicable to the calculation of the cost of equity has been adjusted accordingly. Using a discount rate of 10.5%  the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying amount by $384.0 million (2020: $260.2 million). The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the recoverable amount. A 5.8% increase in the discount rate to 16.3% reduces the recoverable amount by $384 million. The increase in the recoverable amount from the prior year is a result of increased cash flows over the life of mine due to the factors detailed below partially offset by an increase in the discount rate from 10.0% to 10.5%.‚Ä¢ A mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi proved probable reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine life assumption of 40 years has not changed from the prior year review. Average annual production is approximately 1.2 million tonnes (2020: 1.2 million tonnes) of ilmenite and co-products zircon  rutile and concentrates over the life of the Mine and remains unchanged from the prior year review. This mine plan does not include investment in additional mining capacity. Certain minimum stocks of final and intermediate products are assumed to be maintained at period ends.‚Ä¢ Product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers  or where contracts are based on market prices or production is not currently contracted  prices are forecast by the Group taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise provided by TiPMC Solutions and management expectations including general inflation of 2% per annum. Forecast prices provided by TiPMC Solutions have been reviewed and found to be consistent with other external sources of information. Average forecast product sales prices have increased over the life of mine from the prior year end review as a result of revised forecast pricing. A 12% reduction in average sales prices over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $384.0 million.‚Ä¢ Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2022 taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and estimated forecast inflation for 2022. From 2023 onwards operating costs are escalated by 2% per annum. Average forecast operating costs have increased from the prior year end review as a result of increased production and inflation. A 14% increase in operating costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $384.0 million.‚Ä¢ Capital costs are based on a life of mine capital plan including inflation at 2% per annum from 2022. Average forecast capital costs have increased from the prior year end review based on updated sustaining and development capital plans required to maintain the existing plant over the life of mine. The forecast takes into account reasonable cost increases and therefore a sensitivity to this assumption which would give rise to a reduction in the recoverable amount has not been applied.11.

The finance documentation also contemplates a Mine Closure Guarantee Facility (provided by either the existing lenders or other finance providers) of up to $40 million  with the provider(s) of such a facility sharing in the common security package. The potential total aggregate principal amount of indebtedness secured under the finance documentation is therefore $190 million. The transaction costs for arrangement of the debt facilities amounted to $6.5 million.The Term Loan Facility has a final maturity date of 11 March 2025. Interest is at LIBOR plus 5.40% per annum. Repayment is in seven equal semi-annual instalments  beginning 11 March 2022.The Revolving Credit Facility has a final maturity date of 11 December 2022 extendable by up to 24 months at the lenders‚Äô discretion. Interest is at LIBOR plus 5.00% per annum.During the period the Group entered into a mine closure guarantee with Absa Bank Mo√ßambique SA for $11.4 million. This guarantee shares the security package with the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility on a pro rata and pari passu basis.The security package consists of (a) security over the Group‚Äôs bank accounts (subject to certain exceptions)  (b) pledges of the shares of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited and Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (the ‚ÄúProject Companies‚Äù)  (c) security over intercompany loans and (d) Mozambican law security interests over certain rights and agreements with Mozambican authorities  including over the Implementation Agreement  the Mineral Licensing Contract and the Mining Licence.The carrying amount of the secured bank accounts of the Group was $66.9 million as at 31 December 2021 (2020:$87.0 million). The shares of the Project Companies and intercompany loans are not included in the consolidated statement of financial position as they are eliminated on consolidation. They therefore do not have a carrying amount but  upon enforcement of the pledges on behalf of the lender group  the shares in the Project Companies would cease to be owned or controlled by the Group. The secured rights and agreements do not have a carrying amount. They are  however  necessary for the Project Companies to operate the Mine in Mozambique.The finance documents contain a number of representations  covenants and events of default on customary terms  the breach of which could lead to the secured parties under the finance documentation accelerating the outstanding loans and taking other enforcement steps  such as the enforcement of some or all of the security interests  which could lead  in extremis  with the Group losing its interest in the Mine. The most salient of the relevant terms that could lead to acceleration of the loans and/or enforcement of security are the financial covenants.At 31 December 2021 total debt of $148.1 million (2020: $145.8 million) was recognised by the Group  being the drawdown of $150.0 million before unamortised transaction costs of $3.8 million (2020: $5.4 million) plus interest amortised of $2.0 million (2020: $1.2 million).UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202115.

A corresponding amount equal to the provision is recognised as part of property  plant and equipment. The costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan  are subject to regular review and are estimated based on the net present value of estimated future cost. Mine closure costs are a normal consequence of mining  and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the life of the Mine. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost and $0.7 million (2020: $0.7 million) has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the financial year.The main assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated future costs include:‚Ä¢ a discount rate of 2.9% (2020: 2.0%);‚Ä¢ an inflation rate of 2% (2020: 2%);‚Ä¢ an estimated life of mine of 40 years (2020: 40 years). It is assumed that all licences and permits required to operate will be renewed or extended during the life of mine; and‚Ä¢ an estimated closure cost of $34.1 million (2020: $34.1 million) and an estimated post-closure monitoring provision of $3.9 million (2020: $3.9 million).The life of mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources as set out in the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resources table. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine closure provision has decreased by $1.0 million to reflect a change in the discount rate from 2.0% to 2.9%.The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the Mine closure provision. The discount rate increased to 2.9% (2020: 2.0%) as a result of movements in the US Treasury rates. Thirty-year US Treasury yields are the longest period for which yields are quoted. A forty-year rate to align with the estimated life of mine has been calculated by taking the average of the increase in yield from ten to twenty years and the increase in yield from twenty to thirty years and adding this average to the thirty-year treasury rate to arrive at an estimated extrapolated rate for forty years. This discount rate is deemed to provide the best estimate of the current market assessment of risk-free time value of the money. Risks specific to the liability are included in the cost estimate. A reasonable possible increase of 1% in the estimated discount rate results in the Mine closure provision decreasing to $24.0 million. A 1% decrease in the estimated discount rate results in the Mine closure provision increasing to $54.0 million.The Mine rehabilitation provision represents the Directors‚Äô best estimate of the Company‚Äôs liability for rehabilitating areas disturbed by mining activities. Rehabilitation costs are recognised based on the area disturbed and estimated cost of rehabilitation per hectare which is reviewed regularly against actual rehabilitation cost per hectare. Actual rehabilitation expenditure is incurred approximately twelve months after the area has been disturbed. During the financial year there was a release of $0.4 million (2020: $0.8 million) to reflect the actual mine rehabilitation costs incurred  and an addition to the provision of $0.4 million (2020: $1.4 million) for areas newly disturbed.Other provisions comprise an amount of $2.3 million (2020: $nil million) in relation to a potential indirect tax liability. As the matter is still outstanding it is possible that on conclusion the final outcome may differ from management‚Äôs estimate.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117.

The table does not include fair value information for other receivables  prepayments  trade payables and accruals as these are not measured at fair value as the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Trade receivables which are factored through the Absa Bank facility or letters of credit which are always confirmed and discounted through the Barclays Bank facility are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Trade receivables or letters or credit where it is not known at initial recognition if they will be factored are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Group derecognises the original receivable to which the arrangement applies when payment is received from the bank as the terms of the arrangement are non-recourse. The payment to the bank by the Group‚Äôs customers are considered non-cash transactions. Trade receivables not measured at fair value are receivables whose payment is received under the sale contract credit terms.The valuation technique used in measuring Level 2 fair values is discounted cash flows which considers the expected receipts or payments discounted using adjusted market discount rates or where these rates are not available estimated discount rates. The Group has exposure to credit risk  liquidity risk and market risk arising from financial instruments.Risk management frameworkThe Board is ultimately responsible for risk management within the Group. It has delegated responsibility for the monitoring of the effectiveness of the Group‚Äôs risk management and internal control systems to the Audit & Risk Committee. The Board and Audit & Risk Committee receive reports from executive management on the key risks to the business and the steps being taken to mitigate such risks. The Audit & Risk Committee is assisted in its role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures  the results of which are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee.Credit RiskCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet it contractual obligations  and arises principally from the Group‚Äôs trade receivables from customers. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.Trade receivablesThe Group‚Äôs exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual circumstances of each customer. The Group also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base  including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate. Before entering into sales contracts with new customers  the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer‚Äôs credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits attributed to customers are reviewed regularly during the year.The Group‚Äôs customers have been transacting with the Group for a significant number of years  and no customers‚Äô balances have been written off or are credit-impaired at the financial year end. In monitoring customer credit risk  customers are reviewed individually and the Group has not identified any factors which would merit reducing exposure to any particular customer. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade receivables.At 31 December 2021  $41.3 million (2020: $7.2 million) is due from the Group‚Äôs three largest customers. The exposure to credit risk for trade receivables by geographic region was as follows:UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117.

For deposits in excess of $50 million the Group requires that the institution has an A- (S&P)/A3 (Moody‚Äôs) long-term rating. For deposits in excess of $15 million  the Group requires that the institution has a BB- (S&P)/Ba3 (Moody‚Äôs) long-term rating.At 31 December 2021 and 2020 cash was deposited with the following banks:2021 2020 Long-term credit rating Long-term credit rating $ million S&P Moody‚Äôs $ million S&P Moody‚Äôs Barclays Bank plc 60.8 A Positive A-1 Stable 60.0 A Negative A-1 Stable FirstRand Bank Limited 5.1 BBB - Stable Ba2 Negative 15.0 BBB- Stable Ba2 Negative Nedbank Limited - BB- Stable Ba2 Negative 10.0 BB- Stable Ba2 Negative HSBC Bank plc 0.8 A+ Stable A1 Stable 1.7 A+ Stable A1 Stable Absa Bank Limited 2.0 BBB- Stable Ba2 Negative - BBB- Stable Ba2 NegativeLiquidity riskLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled in cash payments. The Group‚Äôs objective when managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due.The Group monitors mine payment forecasts  both operating and capital  which assist it in monitoring cash flow requirements and optimising its cash return on investments. The Group aims to maintain the level of its cash and cash equivalents at an amount in excess of expected cash outflows on financial liabilities. The Group monitors the level of expected cash inflows on trade receivables together with expected cash outflows on trade and other payables.The Group has a trade finance facility with Absa Bank for three of the Group‚Äôs largest customers. In accordance with this facility the bank purchases 80% of the receivable without recourse and so the bank takes on the credit risk. The facility is $30 million with limits on the maximum amount that can be factored for each of the customers named in the facility. During the period no trade receivables were factored under this agreement. At the year end  trade receivables amounting to $14.5 million (2020: $8.9 million) may be factored under this facility and are therefore included in trade receivables as at 31 December 2021. The cost of this facility for the period  which amounted to $0.2 million (2020: $0.2 million)  is included in finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income and in net cash from operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117. Financial Instruments (continued)The Group has a trade facility with Barclays Bank for customers which it sells to under letter of credit terms. Under this facility  Barclays Bank confirms the letter of credit from the issuing bank and therefore takes the credit risk that the issuing bank will not pay. Barclays Bank can also discount these letters of credit thereby providing early payment of receivables to the Group. There is no limit under the Barclays Bank facility. During the period trade receivables of $224.4 million (2020: $88.3 million) were discounted under this facility. At the year-end there were $37.1 million (2020: $6.2 million) which may be discounted under this facility. The cost of this facility for the period  which amounted to $0.1 million (2020: $0.1 million)  is included in finance costs in the condensed statement of comprehensive income and in net cash from operating activities in the condensed statement of consolidated cash flows.The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group‚Äôs financial liabilities at 31 December 2021 based on the gross contractual undiscounted payments:Financial liabilities Total$‚Äô000 Less thanone year$‚Äô000 Between2 and 5 years$‚Äô000 More than5 years$‚Äô000 Bank loans 164 331 79 136 85 195 - Lease liabilities 2 684 1 207 1 317 160 Trade & other payables 32 768 32 768 - - 199 783 113 111 86 512 160The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group‚Äôs financial liabilities at 31 December 2020 based on the gross contractual undiscounted payments:Financial liabilities Total$‚Äô000 Less thanone year$‚Äô000 Between2 and 5 years$‚Äô000 More than5 years$‚Äô000 Bank loans 171 479 7 149 164 330 - Lease liabilities 4 044 1 359 2 251 434 Trade & other payables 50 122 50 122 ‚Äì ‚Äì 225 645 58 630 166 581 434As disclosed in Note 15 the Group has bank loans that contain loan covenants. A future breach of covenant may require the Group to repay the loan earlier than indicated in the above table. Under the loan agreement  the covenants are monitored on a regular basis by Group finance and regularly reported to management and the lenders to ensure compliance with the agreement.Risk ConcentrationConcentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities  or activities in the same geographical region  or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic  political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group‚Äôs performance to developments affecting a particular industry.The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables and contract assets as low  as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets. Details of concentration of revenue are included in Note 2.Market riskMarket risk is risk that changes in market prices for foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Group‚Äôs income statement. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures while optimising returns.Currency riskThe Group is exposed to transactional foreign currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales  purchases  receivables and borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of Group companies. The functional currencies of all Group are US Dollars. The presentational currency of the Group is US Dollars. Sales and bank loans are denominated in US Dollars which significantly reduces the exposure of the Group to foreign currency risk. Payables transactions are denominated in Mozambican Metical  South African Rand  Euro  Sterling  Australian Dollar and Renminbi.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117.

Financial Instruments (continued)Interest rate riskThe loan facilities are arranged at variable rates and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Variable rates are based on six-month LIBOR. The borrowing rate at financial year end was 5.8% (2020: 5.8%). The interest rate profile of the Group‚Äôs loan balances at the financial year end was as follows:2021$‚Äô000 2020$‚Äô000 Variable rate debt 151 914 151 217Under the assumption that all other variables remain constant  a reasonable possible change of 1% in the six-month LIBOR rate results in a $1.5 million (2020: $1.5 million) change in finance costs for the financial year.The above sensitivity analyses are estimates of the impact of market risks assuming the specified change occurs. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global financial markets  which may cause fluctuations in interest rates to vary from the assumptions made above and therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events.Interest rate benchmark reformA fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally  including the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as ‚ÄúIBOR reform‚Äù). The group has exposure to IBORs on its financial instruments that will be reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives. The Group‚Äôs main IBOR exposure at the reporting date is US LIBOR  which is administered by ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA). The alternative reference rate for US LIBOR is the US Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).On 5 March 2021  IBA stated that it will cease the publication of (i) the overnight and 1  3  6 and 12 months USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on Friday  June 30  2023 and (ii) all other LIBOR settings  including the 1 week and 2 months USD LIBOR settings  immediately following the LIBOR publication on Friday  December 31  2021. IBA stated that it will not have access to input data necessary to calculate LIBOR settings on a representative basis after those dates. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a separate announcement confirming that IBA had notified the FCA of its intent to cease providing all LIBOR settings. The FCA confirmed that all 35 LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative as of the dates set out by IBA.The Group anticipates that IBOR reform will impact its operational and risk management processes. The main risk to which the Group is exposed as a result of IBOR reform is in the amendment to the Senior Facility Agreement with negotiation with the lender group to reflect the migration from USD LIBOR to SOFR  updating contractual terms and revising operational controls related to the migration. Financial risk is predominantly limited to interest rate risk.The Audit & Risk Committee monitors while the executive and senior management manages the migration to alternative rates. Such management includes evaluation of the extent to which contracts reference IBOR  whether such contracts will need to be amended as a result of IBOR reform and how to manage communication about IBOR reform to counterparties.The Group plans to amend contractual terms for purposes of migrating from USD LIBOR to SOFR prior to the discontinuance of the administration and publication of the relevant LIBOR rates by IBA.The carrying amount of financial liabilities with unreformed contracts at 31 December 2021 was $148.1 million (31 December 2020: $145.8 million).18. Contingent liabilitiesThe Group  like other businesses operating in Mozambique  is subject to tax audits by the Mozambican Tax Authorities. These audits may review a range of matters including corporate income tax  indirect taxes and transaction related issues  and can take a number of years to complete. The Mozambican Tax Authority conducted an audit of the tax obligations of the Branch in relation to the years 2015 to 2017. The Group is liaising with the Tax Authority to address matters raised during the audit. It is not possible to estimate with certainty the timing of any future resolution or possible outcomes.A provision of $2.3 million (2020: $nil) is included in the financial statements in relation to a potential indirect tax liability. As the matter is still outstanding it is possible that on conclusion the outcome may differ from management‚Äôs estimates. Other tax matters raised during the audit are likewise still outstanding.

By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.Story continuesThis breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world‚Äôs first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infections  one of the world‚Äôs first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH¬Æ (ALDEI - code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010.

Today marks a major milestone for EUROAPI  a leading European company dedicated to the development  production and marketing of active pharmaceutical ingredients* (API)  as Sanofi‚Äôs Board of Directors unanimously proposed  on March 17th  to submit to its shareholders the distribution of circa 58% of the share capital of EUROAPI. In addition to the previously proposed ‚Ç¨3.33 cash dividend per Sanofi share  this additional extraordinary dividend  exclusively in kind  is subject to shareholders approvalat Sanofi‚Äôs May 3  2022 Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders‚Äô Meeting. If approved  the distribution will take place shortly after the listing of EUROAPI‚Äôs shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris  subject to the approval of the French Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers (AMF) on EUROAPI‚Äôs French prospectus  which will be made available to the public ahead of Sanofi‚Äôs Shareholders‚Äô Meeting. Through this transaction  Sanofi is giving its shareholders the opportunity to take part in the success of a leading player in the API market with strong ambitions to become a global champion on a growing and dynamic market  and due to be listed on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. In connection with the proposed spin-off  French Tech Souverainet√© has agreed to purchase12% in EUROAPI shares from Sanofi for up to ‚Ç¨150 million  with the acquisition price to be determined based upon the thirty day volume weighted average trading price (‚ÄúVWAP‚Äù) of EUROAPI‚Äôs shares on Euronext Paris  starting on the first day of trading. As a result  French Tech Souverainet√© will become a long-term reference shareholder of EUROAPI and will be represented by two non-executive members on EUROAPI's Board of Directors  including Benjamin Paternot and another member to be determined. French Tech Souverainet√©‚Äôs investment is subject to approval of the spin-off by Sanofi‚Äôs shareholders and other customary conditions. Post transaction  Sanofi confirms that it will hold circa 30% of the share capital and voting rights of EUROAPI and will remain a long-term strategic partner  supporting EUROAPI‚Äôs growth ambitions as an independent company over the coming years. In addition to its highly diversified customer base of approximately 530 customers  EUROAPI benefits from a strong and long-term customer relationship with Sanofi  which represented nearly half of EUROAPI‚Äôs revenues in 2021. In line with its ‚ÄúPlay to Win‚Äù strategy aiming at simplifying its operations  Sanofi announced in February 2020 its ambition to create a new world leader in APIs to secure significant manufacturing and supply capacities that are critical for patients in Europe and beyond  in a context of increasing shortage of medicines essential to patient care. In 2021  Sanofi announced several critical steps in this journey with the unveiling of the creation of EUROAPI and the appointment of Karl Rotthier as its CEO in January  the appointment of Viviane Monges as Chair of the Supervisory Board in July and the finalization of the carve-out in December 2021. Despite volatile market conditions  Sanofi has decided to move forward with the listing process of EUROAPI. As an independent stand-alone company  EUROAPI will be able to fully unlock its growth potential  offering the best alignment of strategy  value creation and financial objectives for all of Sanofi‚Äôs shareholders. With a diversified technology portfolio  EUROAPI is positioned as the world's leading manufacturer of small molecule API (including complex chemical synthesis molecules  biochemical molecules from fermentation and highly potent molecules). It was the world's second largest manufacturer of APIs (including both small and large molecules such as peptides and oligonucleotides) in 2021 and number seven in the global CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization) market in 20201. EUROAPI develops  manufactures  markets and distributes APIs and intermediates used in the formulation of medicines for human and veterinary use  both from originators and generics  through its API Solutions business and CDMO activities. Drawing on more than 150 years of experience in the growing API market  EUROAPI has a network of six production sites  all of which are located in Europe  and delivers around 200 APIs to approximately 530 customers in over 80 countries. The company will be able to rely on the expertise of around 3 350 employees and expects to achieve consolidated sales of around EUR 1 billion in the year ending December 31  2022. Further details regarding the specifics of the distribution  including the parity  and the timetable of the spin-off will be set forth in EUROAPI‚Äôs French prospectus. Following the AMF‚Äôs approval of EUROAPI‚Äôs French prospectus  Sanofi and EUROAPI‚Äôs management teams will host a dedicated Capital Markets Day on April 1  2022 at 1:30 pm CET to present EUROAPI‚Äôs business in greater detail (event registration details are available here). *About Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are the chemical or biological substances in a medicine that have a therapeutic effect.
