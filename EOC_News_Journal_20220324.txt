As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to deviate from the guidelines.Description of material changes of the guidelines and how the views of shareholders' have been taken into considerationThese guidelines  which are proposed for the 2022 Annual General Meeting  correspond to a large extent with the guidelines resolved upon by the 2020 Annual General Meeting. However  in the guidelines now proposed  an option to pay additional variable cash remuneration has been introduced and  in addition  the maximum level for variable cash remuneration for members of the Executive Team employed in the US has been adjusted. Please be referred to the section ""Types of remuneration"" above.No comments or questions on the remuneration guidelines have emerged in connection with general meeting proceedings.Item 16 ‚Äì Resolution regarding authorization to repurchase and transfer Series B shares in the companyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to pass a resolution  on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  on repurchasing Series B shares in the company in accordance with the following.- The repurchase may as a maximum comprise so many Series B shares that the company after each repurchase holds a maximum of 10 percent of the total number of shares in the company.- The repurchase of Series B shares shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm.- The repurchase of Series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price.- Payment of the Series B shares shall be made in cash.Furthermore  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to pass a resolution  on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  on transferring Series B shares in the company in accordance with the following.- The maximum number of Series B shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of shares held by the company at the time of the Board of Directors resolution.- Transfers of Series B shares shall take place:(i) on Nasdaq Stockholm  or(ii) in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses  on market terms.- Transfers of Series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price.- The authorization includes the right to resolve on deviation of the preferential rights of shareholders and that payment may be made in other forms than cash.The purpose of the authorizations is to make possible the ability for the Board of Directors to continuously adapt the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value  to be able to exploit attractive acquisition opportunities by fully or partly financing future acquisitions with the company's own shares  and to ensure the company's undertakings  including social security costs  in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal for a long-term incentive program under Item 17.The Board of Directors has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act  the statement is available at the company and on the company's website www.assaabloy.com.The proposal in this Item 16 requires an approval of shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting to be valid.Item 17 ‚Äì Resolution regarding long-term incentive programSummary of the programThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a new long-term incentive program for senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group (LTI 2022). LTI 2022 is based on similar principles as LTI 2019  LTI 2020 and LTI 2021.LTI 2022 is proposed to include a maximum of 150 senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group. In order to participate in LTI 2022 the participants will have to hold Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY within the scope of LTI 2022 (saving shares). For every saving share held  the company will grant so called performance awards free-of-charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2022 is to strengthen the ASSA ABLOY Group's ability to retain and recruit competent employees  to contribute to ASSA ABLOY providing a total remuneration that is on market conditions and competitive  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the employees concerned. Through a share-based long-term incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to ASSA ABLOY's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board of Directors believes that the implementation of LTI 2022 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group  including its sustainability  and consequently that LTI 2022 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personal investment in saving sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2022  the participants will have to hold saving shares. The saving shares can either be Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY that have vested or been used as saving shares under LTI 2019 or previous years' long-term incentive programs  or Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY purchased on the market in connection with the notification to participate in LTI 2022.The personal investment shall amount to a value corresponding to a minimum of 5 percent (all participants) and a maximum of 15 percent (CEO and other senior executives) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's fixed base salary. If the participant has access to inside information and is therefore prevented from making the personal investment in connection with the application to participate in LTI 2022  the personal investment shall be made as soon as possible  but no later than before the next Annual General Meeting.For employees who have not participated in previous LTI programs  the participation in LTI 2022 is  in addition  subject to renunciation of customary salary review for the year 2022.Participants in LTI 2022 and allocationLTI 2022 is proposed to include a maximum of 150 senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group  divided in three categories.For each saving share that the CEO of the Group holds under LTI 2022  the company will grant six performance awards. For each saving share that other senior executives (currently eight individuals) hold under LTI 2022  each such individual will be awarded five performance awards. For each saving share that other participants (approximately 140 individuals) hold under LTI 2022  each such individual will be awarded four performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of performance awards that gives right to receive Series B shares in the company depends on the annual development of ASSA ABLOY's earnings per share[1] based on the target levels  as defined by the Board of Directors  during the measurement period 1 January 2022 ‚Äì 31 December 2024  where each year during the measurement period is compared to the previous year. The outcome is calculated yearly  whereby one third of the performance awards is measured against the outcome for 2022  one third is measured against the outcome for 2023 and one third is measured against the outcome for 2024.The outcome for each year is measured linearly. Unless the minimum level is achieved for the year  none of the relevant performance awards will give right to Series B shares  and if the maximum level is achieved each performance award linked to the relevant year will give right to one Series B share. The Board of Directors intends to present the fulfilment of the performance based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2024.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.- The performance awards shall be granted free-of-charge after the 2022 Annual General Meeting.- Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free-of-charge three years after allotment of the award (vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  at the time of the release of the interim report for the first quarter 2025 still is employed by the ASSA ABLOY Group and has maintained the saving shares held under LTI 2022.- To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the vesting period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award gives right to after the vesting period.- The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.- The performance awards can be granted by the company or by any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board of Directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2022  in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the ASSA ABLOY Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2022 no longer are appropriate.In the event that the Board of Directors considers that the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2022 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2022 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 90 percent (CEO)  75 percent (other senior executives) or 40 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to a maximum personal investment  meaning that the participant must hold saving shares at a value that corresponds to 15 percent (CEO and other senior executives) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved. Full vesting is further subject to the saving shares being retained and that the participant  with some exceptions  is still employed during the vesting period.The total number of saving shares  which corresponds to the participant's total maximum personal investment  and thus the total number of performance awards being allotted  depends on the share price for the company's Series B share at the time of allotment of performance awards under LTI 2022. The total number of outstanding shares in the company amounts to 1 112 576 334 shares.Provided that the share price for the company's Series B share is traded at aroundSEK 265 at the time of allotment of performance awards under LTI 2022  LTI 2022 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise a maximum of 650 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.1 percent of the total outstanding shares and votes in the company.LTI 2022 shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Provided that the performance based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2022 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 160 million  allocated over the vesting period. Estimated social security costs and financing cost are included in such amount.The costs are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the ASSA ABLOY Group.The Board of Directors deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior executives and persons in senior managerial positions  which may be further increased through LTI 2022  outweighs the costs related to LTI 2022.Delivery of shares under LTI 2022To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2022  the company intends to enter into an agreement with a third party  under which the third party shall  in its own name  buy and transfer Series B shares in the company to the participants in accordance with LTI 2022.Preparation of the proposalLTI 2022 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of ASSA ABLOY  and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive programs. LTI 2022 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board of Directors.Previous incentive programsThe company's other share-based incentive programs LTI 2019  LTI 2020 and LTI 2021 are based on the similar principles as LTI 2022. For a description of LTI 2019  LTI 2020 and LTI 2021  reference is made to the Annual Report 2021  Note 34  and the company's website www.assaabloy.com.Shares and votesThe total number of shares in the company at the time for the notice to the Annual General Meeting amount to 1 112 576 334 shares  of which 57 525 969 are Series A shares and 1 055 050 365 Series B shares  which is equivalent to a total of 1 630 310 055 votes. ASSA ABLOY AB is holding at the time of the notice to the Annual General Meeting  1 800 000 own Series B shares  corresponding to 1 800 000 votes that may not be represented at the Annual General Meeting.Shareholders' right to request informationThe Board of Directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so requests and the Board of Directors believes that it can be done without material harm to the company  at the Annual General Meeting provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda and circumstances that can affect the assessment of the company's or its subsidiaries' financial situation and the company's relation to other companies within the Group and the Group accounts.Documentation etc.The Annual Report and the Auditor's Report  the Board of Directors' remuneration report and all other supporting documentation for the Annual General Meeting are available at the company and on the company's website www.assaabloy.com no later than three weeks before the Annual General Meeting.Further  the Nomination Committee's complete proposals including motivated statement  are available at the company and on the company's website www.assaabloy.com no later than four weeks before the Annual General Meeting.Copies of the documents will be sent free of charge to shareholders who so request and state their address to the company.Processing of personal dataFor information on how your personal data is processed  see:https://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfThis notice is a translation of the Swedish notice and in case of any deviations between the language versions  the Swedish version shall prevail.Welcome!Stockholm in March 2022The Board of DirectorsASSA ABLOY AB (publ)For more information  please contact:Nico Delvaux  President and CEO  tel. no: +46 8 506 485 82Erik Pieder  CFO and Executive Vice President  tel. no: +46 8 506 485 72Bj√∂rn Tibell  Head of Investor Relations  tel. no: +46 70 275 67 68The ASSA ABLOY Group is the global leader in access solutions.

The Board of Directors considers that these programs fulfill their purpose of aligning the interests of the participants and the shareholders  strengthening the Sandvik Group's ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees and strengthening Sandvik's focus and objective to meet its long-term business goals. Accordingly  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve on a long-term incentive program for senior executives and key employees for 2022 (""LTI 2022"") on the below terms and conditions.GeneralLTI 2022 encompasses approximately 350 senior executives and key contributors in the Sandvik Group. Due to the planned spin-off and subsequent listing of Sandvik's business area Sandvik Materials Technology (""SMT listing"")  SMT employees will not be offered participation in LTI 2022. The maximum number of Sandvik shares that can be allocated pursuant to LTI 2022 is 1.9 million shares  which corresponds to approximately 0.15 percent of the number of outstanding shares in Sandvik.In order to participate in LTI 2022 the employee is required to invest in Sandvik shares at market price no later than June 30  2022 (""Investment Shares""). In the event that the employee is not able to invest before this date due to being entered in an insider list (logbook) kept by Sandvik  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to postpone the date of investment for such employee. The employee may within the scope of LTI 2022 invest up to an amount corresponding to 10 percent of the employee's fixed annual salary before tax at the time of the investment.Provided such acquisition of Investment Shares is made  participants of LTI 2022 will be entitled to allotment of Sandvik shares  free of charge  after a period of three years on the terms and conditions set forth below.Performance SharesEach acquired Investment Share entitles participants to be allotted Sandvik shares provided certain performance targets are met (""Performance Shares""). The maximum number of Performance Shares that may be allotted for each acquired Investment Share depends on the Participant's program category as follows:8 for the President 7 for each additional member of the Group Executive Management (currently 9persons) persons)  6 for each senior manager (approximately 60 persons)  and5 for each key contributor (approximately 280 persons).Each member of the Group Executive Management  with the exception of SMT's President  shall nominate the persons that are to be offered participation in LTI 2022 and that are to be classified as senior manager and key contributor  respectively  based on position  qualification and individual performance. All nominations are to be approved by the President and CEO.The number of Performance Shares that will finally be allotted to the participant for each acquired Investment Share is dependent on the development of the Sandvik Group adjusted Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")  excluding amortizations and other accounting effects arising from business combinations  during the financial year 2022 (""EPS 2022"")  compared to adjusted EPS  excluding amortizations and other accounting effects arising from business combinations  for the financial year 2021 (""EPS 2021""). Subject to the SMT listing taking place  EPS 2021 and EPS 2022 will exclude SMT. The Board of Directors establishes the levels regarding adjusted EPS that must be attained for allotment of a certain number of Performance Shares. Allotment will take place as follows:One Performance Share will be allotted for each acquired Investment Share if EPS 2022 exceeds EPS 2021.In order for any remaining Performance Shares to be allotted EPS 2022 growth must exceed 5 percent in relation to EPS 2021. The EPS growth required for the maximum number of Performance Shares to be allotted for each acquired Investment Share is established by the Board of Directors.The level required for maximum allotment and the extent to which the established levels are attained will be disclosed in the 2022 Annual Report.Prerequisites for allotmentThe allotment of Performance Shares requires continuous employment and that all Investment Shares be held during a period of three years from the acquisition of the Investment Shares (""Vesting Period""). The Chairman of the Board of Directors may in special cases grant exemptions from these requirements for individual participants  whereas the Board of Directors may decide on any such exemption concerning groups of participants.If the prerequisites for allotment set forth for LTI 2022 are met  allotment of Performance Shares will take place during 2025  and no later than June 30  2025. The allotment will take place free of charge  subject to tax.Adjustment of the number of Performance Shares etc.Before the allotment of Performance Shares takes place  the Board of Directors shall consider whether the number of Performance Shares is reasonable taking into account the financial results and position of Sandvik  the impact of larger acquisitions  divestments and other significant capital transactions  stock market conditions and other circumstances. If the Board of Directors deems that this is not the case  the Board of Directors shall reduce the number of Performance Shares to the lower number the Board of Directors finds appropriate or decide that no allotment should take place.In the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue and/or other similar events in Sandvik  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to decide on the recalculation of the terms of LTI 2022.An alternative cash based incentive solution may be implemented for participants incountries where the acquisition of Investment Shares or allotment of Performance Shares is not appropriate  or if such solution is otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive solution shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTI 2022. The President and CEO shall be authorized to decide which persons that should be offered participation in the cash based incentive solution.The Board of Directors  or a committee appointed by the Board of Directors for this purpose  shall be responsible for the detailed design and administration of LTI 2022 based on the main terms set forth herein.The right to be allotted Performance Shares cannot be transferred and does not give the participant a right to compensation for dividend distributed during the Vesting Period with respect to the underlying shares.Costs of LTI 2022 and hedging arrangementsThe number of Sandvik shares that will be needed for LTI 2022 will depend on the Sandvik share price at investment and the participation rate. To secure an adequate number of shares  given the increased market volatility  a Sandvik share price of SEK 160 has been used when calculating the maximum number of shares needed. Based on this share price the total cost of LTI 2022 is estimated at up to SEK 333 million. The costs have been calculated as the sum of personnel costs  including social security costs of SEK 55 million  and administration costs of approximately SEK 2 million for the program. Based on a share price of SEK 235 (which would result in fewer Sandvik shares being needed) the total cost is estimated at up to SEK 346 million  of which SEK 57 million constitutes social security cost and approximately SEK 2 million constitutes administration costs. The costs for LTI 2022 will be allocated over the years 2022‚Äì2024.Sandvik intends to secure its commitment to deliver Sandvik shares under LTI 2022 through a share swap agreement with a third party. The interest cost for such a share swap is estimated at approximately SEK 1.4 million per year based on the current interest levels  regardless of whether the calculation is based on a share price of SEK 160 or SEK 235. Against this cost  however  stands the value of possible dividends.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal has been prepared by the Board's Remuneration Committee and has been discussed and resolved on by the Board of Directors. The President has not taken part in the Board of Directors' discussion and resolution with respect to the proposal.Majority requirementThe resolution regarding LTI 2022 requires a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Meeting.OtherFor a description of other long-term incentive programs within Sandvik reference is made to note G4 in Sandvik's 2021 Annual Report and to the Company's website.Item 19 ‚Äì Authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of the Company's own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to  for the period until the 2023 Annual General Meeting  resolve on acquisitions of the Company's own shares in accordance with the following conditions.Acquisitions shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm.Acquisitions may only be made at a price per share within the price range (spread) applicable from time to time  meaning the spread between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price prevailing and disseminated by Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time.The Company may acquire a maximum number of shares so that the Company's holding at any time does not exceed 10 per cent of the total number of shares in the Company.The authorization may be utilized on one or several occasions up to the 2023 Annual General Meeting.The purpose of the authorization is to enable the Board of Directors to continuously adapt the Company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value.In order for the resolution on authorization to be valid  it must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.Item 20 ‚Äì Resolution on amendment to the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve to amend the Articles of Association as proposed below:¬ß 6Insofar as it is elected at a General Meeting of the Shareholders  the Board shall consist of not less than five and not more than eight Directors and not more than five Deputy Directors. ¬ß 6Insofar as it is elected at a General Meeting of the Shareholders  the Board shall consist of not less than five and not more than ten Directors. ¬ß 11 The following matters shall be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting:[‚Ä¶]10. determination of the number of Directors and Deputy Directors;[‚Ä¶] ¬ß 11 The following matters shall be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting:[‚Ä¶]10. determination of the number of Directors;[‚Ä¶]The Board of Directors currently consists of eight Board members elected by the General Meeting  i.e. the maximum permitted by the Articles of Association.

We currently see no legal grounds prohibiting Euroclear and Clearstream to process payments to Russian residents ‚Äù it said.Severstal  whose main shareholder  Alexey Mordashov  was sanctioned by the EU on Feb. 28  is also having trouble with the processing of its Eurobond coupon payment.The payment sent last week by Severstal for the coupon on its 2024 loan participation notes (LPN) has yet to be processed by Citibank  with the grace period set to expire on Wednesday  a source close to Severstal told Reuters on Tuesday.Russian Railways and Eurochem did not reply to Reuters requests for a comment.In a separate statement  NSD said that it is receiving Eurobond payments from Euroclear  but will not process these until Euroclear gets clarification from European regulators.NSD said it is not getting payments from Clearstream.‚ÄúAfter curbs are lifted  payments will be processed‚Ä¶ as usual ‚Äù NSD said.Dmitry Lesnov  head of the customer service department at Finam  said that his company is not receiving payments made via Euroclear or Clearstream and is awaiting further clarification.Coupon payments due over the next few days include from Gazprom and SIBUR on Wednesday  Russian Railways on March 25 and Polyus Gold on March 28  the same day Russia is due to make its next international bond payment.The Russian finance ministry made a $117 million and a $66 million Eurobond coupon payment recently  with foreign bondholders receiving their funds.Kommersant daily newspaper  citing a source at a large brokerage firm  said on Wednesday that some Russian holders of sovereign Eurobonds had not received coupon payments.The finance ministry did not reply to a request for a comment.(Reporting by Reuters; additional reporting by Karin Strohecker and Marc Jones in London; Editing by Alexander Smith),negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,negative,0.01,0.24,0.75,True,English,"['Russian corporate Eurobond holders', 'Sanctions', 'payments', 'next international bond payment', '$66 million Eurobond coupon payment', 'hard currency bonds', 'strategic military operation', '2024 loan participation notes', 'customer service department', 'Kommersant daily newspaper', 'large brokerage firm', 'National Settlement Depository', 'four corporate Eurobonds', 'domestic corporate Eurobonds', 'state-owned Russian Railways', 'Russian finance ministry', 'European Union sanctions', 'corporate Eurobond payments', 'ITI Capital analysts', 'payment process', 'international agents', 'international clearing', 'domestic holders', 'international depositories', 'sovereign Eurobonds', 'European regulators', 'Russian holders', 'Russian sovereign', 'Russian securities', 'Russian invasion', 'Russian residents', 'Western sanctions', 'settlement firms', 'Western bondholders', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'last month', 'external debt', 'fertilizer producer', 'top steelmaker', 'foreign noteholders', 'legal grounds', 'main shareholder', 'Alexey Mordashov', 'grace period', 'Dmitry Lesnov', 'Polyus Gold', 'foreign bondholders', 'additional reporting', 'Karin Strohecker', 'Marc Jones', 'Alexander Smith', 'Russian companies', 'coupon payments', 'manual‚Äô processing', 'interest payments', 'separate statement', 'Reuters requests', 'delays', 'transactions', 'NSD', 'countersanctions', 'Moscow', 'transit', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'ownership', 'assets', 'cash', 'exchanges', 'banks', 'trades', 'response', 'Ukraine', 'orders', 'need', 'clarifications', 'comment', 'coupons', 'year-end', 'steelmakers', 'NLMK', 'Severstal', 'Eurochem', 'Tuesday', 'fact', 'Feb.', 'trouble', 'LPN', 'Citibank', 'Wednesday', 'source', 'curbs', 'head', 'Finam', 'company', 'days', 'Gazprom', 'SIBUR', 'March', 'funds', 'London', 'Editing']",2022-03-23,2022-03-24,kfgo.com

As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to deviate from the guidelines.Description of material changes of the guidelines and how the views of shareholders' have been taken into considerationThese guidelines  which are proposed for the 2022 Annual General Meeting  correspond to a large extent with the guidelines resolved upon by the 2020 Annual General Meeting. However  in the guidelines now proposed  an option to pay additional variable cash remuneration has been introduced and  in addition  the maximum level for variable cash remuneration for members of the Executive Team employed in the US has been adjusted. Please be referred to the section ""Types of remuneration"" above.No comments or questions on the remuneration guidelines have emerged in connection with general meeting proceedings.Item 16 ‚Äì Resolution regarding authorization to repurchase and transfer Series B shares in the companyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to pass a resolution  on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  on repurchasing Series B shares in the company in accordance with the following.- The repurchase may as a maximum comprise so many Series B shares that the company after each repurchase holds a maximum of 10 percent of the total number of shares in the company.- The repurchase of Series B shares shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm.- The repurchase of Series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price.- Payment of the Series B shares shall be made in cash.Furthermore  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to pass a resolution  on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  on transferring Series B shares in the company in accordance with the following.- The maximum number of Series B shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of shares held by the company at the time of the Board of Directors resolution.- Transfers of Series B shares shall take place:(i) on Nasdaq Stockholm  or(ii) in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses  on market terms.- Transfers of Series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price.- The authorization includes the right to resolve on deviation of the preferential rights of shareholders and that payment may be made in other forms than cash.The purpose of the authorizations is to make possible the ability for the Board of Directors to continuously adapt the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value  to be able to exploit attractive acquisition opportunities by fully or partly financing future acquisitions with the company's own shares  and to ensure the company's undertakings  including social security costs  in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal for a long-term incentive program under Item 17.The Board of Directors has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act  the statement is available at the company and on the company's website www.assaabloy.com.The proposal in this Item 16 requires an approval of shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting to be valid.Item 17 ‚Äì Resolution regarding long-term incentive programSummary of the programThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a new long-term incentive program for senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group (LTI 2022). LTI 2022 is based on similar principles as LTI 2019  LTI 2020 and LTI 2021.LTI 2022 is proposed to include a maximum of 150 senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group. In order to participate in LTI 2022 the participants will have to hold Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY within the scope of LTI 2022 (saving shares). For every saving share held  the company will grant so called performance awards free-of-charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2022 is to strengthen the ASSA ABLOY Group's ability to retain and recruit competent employees  to contribute to ASSA ABLOY providing a total remuneration that is on market conditions and competitive  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the employees concerned. Through a share-based long-term incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to ASSA ABLOY's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board of Directors believes that the implementation of LTI 2022 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group  including its sustainability  and consequently that LTI 2022 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personal investment in saving sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2022  the participants will have to hold saving shares. The saving shares can either be Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY that have vested or been used as saving shares under LTI 2019 or previous years' long-term incentive programs  or Series B shares in ASSA ABLOY purchased on the market in connection with the notification to participate in LTI 2022.The personal investment shall amount to a value corresponding to a minimum of 5 percent (all participants) and a maximum of 15 percent (CEO and other senior executives) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's fixed base salary. If the participant has access to inside information and is therefore prevented from making the personal investment in connection with the application to participate in LTI 2022  the personal investment shall be made as soon as possible  but no later than before the next Annual General Meeting.For employees who have not participated in previous LTI programs  the participation in LTI 2022 is  in addition  subject to renunciation of customary salary review for the year 2022.Participants in LTI 2022 and allocationLTI 2022 is proposed to include a maximum of 150 senior executives and key employees within the ASSA ABLOY Group  divided in three categories.For each saving share that the CEO of the Group holds under LTI 2022  the company will grant six performance awards. For each saving share that other senior executives (currently eight individuals) hold under LTI 2022  each such individual will be awarded five performance awards. For each saving share that other participants (approximately 140 individuals) hold under LTI 2022  each such individual will be awarded four performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of performance awards that gives right to receive Series B shares in the company depends on the annual development of ASSA ABLOY's earnings per share[1] based on the target levels  as defined by the Board of Directors  during the measurement period 1 January 2022 ‚Äì 31 December 2024  where each year during the measurement period is compared to the previous year. The outcome is calculated yearly  whereby one third of the performance awards is measured against the outcome for 2022  one third is measured against the outcome for 2023 and one third is measured against the outcome for 2024.The outcome for each year is measured linearly. Unless the minimum level is achieved for the year  none of the relevant performance awards will give right to Series B shares  and if the maximum level is achieved each performance award linked to the relevant year will give right to one Series B share. The Board of Directors intends to present the fulfilment of the performance based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2024.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.- The performance awards shall be granted free-of-charge after the 2022 Annual General Meeting.- Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free-of-charge three years after allotment of the award (vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  at the time of the release of the interim report for the first quarter 2025 still is employed by the ASSA ABLOY Group and has maintained the saving shares held under LTI 2022.- To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the vesting period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award gives right to after the vesting period.- The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.- The performance awards can be granted by the company or by any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board of Directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2022  in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the ASSA ABLOY Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2022 no longer are appropriate.In the event that the Board of Directors considers that the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2022 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2022 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 90 percent (CEO)  75 percent (other senior executives) or 40 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to a maximum personal investment  meaning that the participant must hold saving shares at a value that corresponds to 15 percent (CEO and other senior executives) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved. Full vesting is further subject to the saving shares being retained and that the participant  with some exceptions  is still employed during the vesting period.The total number of saving shares  which corresponds to the participant's total maximum personal investment  and thus the total number of performance awards being allotted  depends on the share price for the company's Series B share at the time of allotment of performance awards under LTI 2022. The total number of outstanding shares in the company amounts to 1 112 576 334 shares.Provided that the share price for the company's Series B share is traded at aroundSEK 265 at the time of allotment of performance awards under LTI 2022  LTI 2022 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise a maximum of 650 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.1 percent of the total outstanding shares and votes in the company.LTI 2022 shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Provided that the performance based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2022 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 160 million  allocated over the vesting period. Estimated social security costs and financing cost are included in such amount.The costs are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the ASSA ABLOY Group.The Board of Directors deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior executives and persons in senior managerial positions  which may be further increased through LTI 2022  outweighs the costs related to LTI 2022.Delivery of shares under LTI 2022To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2022  the company intends to enter into an agreement with a third party  under which the third party shall  in its own name  buy and transfer Series B shares in the company to the participants in accordance with LTI 2022.Preparation of the proposalLTI 2022 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of ASSA ABLOY  and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive programs. LTI 2022 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board of Directors.Previous incentive programsThe company's other share-based incentive programs LTI 2019  LTI 2020 and LTI 2021 are based on the similar principles as LTI 2022. For a description of LTI 2019  LTI 2020 and LTI 2021  reference is made to the Annual Report 2021  Note 34  and the company's website www.assaabloy.com.Shares and votesThe total number of shares in the company at the time for the notice to the Annual General Meeting amount to 1 112 576 334 shares  of which 57 525 969 are Series A shares and 1 055 050 365 Series B shares  which is equivalent to a total of 1 630 310 055 votes.

WaterWipes¬Æ baby wipes are even made using 100% green energy (wind). This change  which has also been rolled out globally  will mean WaterWipes¬Æ will save the equivalent of 228 million plastic bottles and 3.28 Olympic-sized swimming pools of water a year and most importantly  be part of the movement to help reduce the amount of waste filling our landfills.1‚ÄúAs the world has grown more environmentally conscious  so has WaterWipes ‚Äù said Lindsay Martin  Vice President  WaterWipes North America. ‚ÄúWith the U.S. launch of biodegradable and plastic-free wipes we‚Äôre excited to offer a product that is better for the planet  without compromising the quality of our wipes. This launch marks another step forward in WaterWipes‚Äô commitment to sustainability.‚ÄùWaterWipes¬Æ baby wipes will continue to be made with just two ingredients  99.9% purified water and a drop of fruit extract. The new launch means parents and healthcare professionals no longer need to compromise between cleansing and helping protect their baby‚Äôs skin and choosing the better option for the environment.Billions of baby wipes are used in the U.S. each year -- imagine the impact WaterWipes¬Æ could make if every American switched to biodegradable wipes  helping to reduce overall impact on the environment one small step at a time. Additionally  baby wipes are often made with or from plastic materials such as PET  polypropylene  or cotton woven together with plastic resin2  and 8 million metric tons of plastic waste enter the ocean each year.3 WaterWipes¬Æ biodegradable and plastic-free wipes are USDA Certified Biobased made with viscose  are 100% compostable and take only four weeks to biodegrade.4 Like cotton and linen  viscose is highly absorbent  soft and strong for effective cleaning  but gentle enough for even the most delicate skin. When switching to biodegradable and plastic-free wipes  consumers are taking a step towards a more sustainable life.Like all WaterWipes¬Æ formulations  the new biodegradable and plastic-free wipes have undergone rigorous testing which included product quality  safety  biodegradability and compostability testing to ensure only the highest standard of product.WaterWipes¬Æ are available in the United States across all major retailers  including Target  Walmart and Amazon.For more information  visit www.waterwipes.com.About WaterWipes¬ÆWaterWipes¬Æ  the world's purest baby wipes  are made using unique water technology  and contain just two ingredients  99.9% purified water and a drop of fruit extract. They have been specially developed to be purer than cloth and water while offering the convenience of a wipe.

(Kirill Kudryavtsev /AFP via Getty Images)Severstal Could Become First Russian Company to Default on Foreign-Currency DebtSeverstal  a steel and mining company  could become the first Russian company to fail to make a critical interest payment on foreign-currency debt.The domestic firm had a $12.6 million coupon payment due on March 16  but was granted a five-business-day grace period. The industrial giant possesses $800 million in loan participation notes that mature in 2024. The company has urged bondholders to contact Citigroup  the financial institution that blocked the payment and requested an ironclad permit from the U.S. Treasury to cover the obligations  Bloomberg reported  citing two people familiar with the discussions.Should it default on its debt  Severstal‚Äôs global operations and claims would cover less than one-fifth of its foreign unsecured debt  JPMorgan Chase analysts estimated earlier this month.If interest payments aren‚Äôt processed  Severstal officials announced that the company would search for alternative options to pay its creditors.Making payments for bonds issued by Russian companies has turned into a complicated process. Because of Western sanctions and the Kremlin‚Äôs retaliatory sanctions  many bond payments could be delayed or become frozen in transit.A photo taken on March 14  2022  shows the logos of Visa  Mastercard  and Russian Mir payment systems on bank cards in Moscow. (AFP via Getty Images)Russian investors holding domestic corporate Eurobonds could experience delays in receiving payments completed through international agents amid Western sanctions  Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository (NSD) said in a statement to Reuters.Russian firms would need to manually process orders and receive clarifications from European regulators in this restrictive environment.Clearstream and Euroclear  two international clearing and settlement organizations  had previously processed Russian sovereign and corporate Eurobond payments. However  the two entities confirmed that they would stop settling transactions in Russian securities because of sanctions from the European Union.It‚Äôs estimated that Russian corporations are scheduled to pay approximately $18.5 billion in external debt  including interest payments  by the end of 2022. The Russian Ministry of Finance is also poised to pay about $3.4 billion in sovereign Eurobonds after recently executing $117 million and $66 million Eurobond coupon payments  with foreign investors receiving their funds.Other companies are bracing for challenges to execute coupon payments on foreign-currency debt.NLMK  Russia‚Äôs top steelmaker  confirmed that it had paid a coupon on its Eurobond due in 2024. The business stated that foreign noteholders started receiving interest payments  while domestic investors didn‚Äôt.It‚Äôs widely anticipated that state-owned Russian Railways  Polyus Gold  and fertilizer producer EuroChem will struggle to send payments to corporate bondholders in this current marketplace.Russian Railways and Polyus Gold are scheduled to make coupon payments on March 25 and March 28  respectively. The Russian government is also expected to make an international bond payment on March 28.‚ÄúPerhaps the bigger risk is that it may be a prelude to defaults by Russian corporates  whose external debts are more than four times larger than those of the sovereign ‚Äù William Jackson  chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics  wrote in a note last week.Last week  rating agency S&P Global downgraded the creditworthiness of the Russian government and a plethora of companies into junk territory because of the country‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. This makes it harder for the government and companies to raise capital on international markets.S&P Global cut the country‚Äôs credit rating to ‚ÄúCC.‚Äù This is defined as ‚Äúdefault imminent with little prospect for recovery.‚ÄùThirty ‚Äúfallen angels‚Äù have already occurred because of the Ukraine‚ÄìRussia military conflict. This refers to a firm with a credit rating that has been cut from investment grade to speculative grade (junk).Many of these corporations have stopped trading in London or New York  or have witnessed their shares collapse to nearly zero.But S&P Global analysts say that there‚Äôs still plenty of uncertainty regarding how damaging Moscow‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine will be for the future of domestic companies.‚ÄúIn terms of creditworthiness  the Russian‚ÄìUkraine conflict has had the largest impact on banks  with 28% of total related rating actions ‚Äù the agency noted.‚ÄúIrrespective of the duration of military hostilities  sanctions and related political risks are likely to remain in place for some time. Potential effects could include dislocated commodities markets‚Äînotably for oil and gas‚Äîsupply chain disruptions  inflationary pressures  weaker growth  and capital market volatility.‚ÄùWill It Be 1998 All Over Again?Many U.S. financial institutions have some exposure to Russian corporate debt.Citigroup stated that its investment in Russian sovereign and corporate debt could result in losses totaling as much as $9.8 billion.‚ÄúWe have been managing that [exposure] very proactively to bring that number down ‚Äù Citi CFO Mark Mason told attendees at an investor event.PIMCO  a California-based asset manager  amassed about $1.5 billion of Russian debt. With this immense exposure  it could face tremendous losses in coming years.Flags are seen outside of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)  where markets were roiled after Russia attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24  2022. (Caitlin Ochs/Reuters)Goldman Sachs has approximately $650 million in exposure  a small percentage of its overall $2.8 trillion credit balance.Could it be 1998 all over again? This was the last time that Russia defaulted on its debt  causing Wall Street to suffer tremendous losses. However  despite market analysts‚Äô glowing forecasts for the country‚Äôs economy  banks have been more cautious about investing too much into the nation.Morgan Stanley stated that the Russian economy is in such a terrible state that it could default on its foreign debts soon.Earlier this month  Simon Waever  Morgan Stanley‚Äôs global head of emerging-market sovereign credit strategy  wrote in a note that the Eastern European economy is edging closer to default amid talks of additional Western sanctions and expectations of a deep recession.‚ÄúWe see a default as the most likely scenario ‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIn case of default  it is unlikely to be like a normal one  with Venezuela instead perhaps the most relevant comparison.‚ÄùJPMorgan analysts echoed these sentiments in a note  writing that ‚Äúsanctions have significantly increased the likelihood of a Russia government hard currency bond default.‚ÄùThus far  Russia has averted technical defaults by making coupon payments on dollar bonds that are set to mature in 2023 and 2043.,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,negative,0.01,0.14,0.85,True,English,"['First Russian Company', 'Foreign-Currency Debt', 'Severstal', 'Many U.S. financial institutions', 'chief emerging markets economist', 'total related rating actions', 'S&P Global analysts', 'Russian Mir payment systems', '$66 million Eurobond coupon payments', 'Ukraine‚ÄìRussia military conflict', 'U.S. Treasury', 'JPMorgan Chase analysts', 'related political risks', 'many bond payments', 'five-business-day grace period', 'loan participation notes', 'Thirty ‚Äúfallen angels', '$12.6 million coupon payment', 'Russian ruble coins', 'Russian ruble sign', 'The Russian Ministry', 'National Settlement Depository', 'international bond payment', 'Russian‚ÄìUkraine conflict', 'critical interest payment', 'state-owned Russian Railways', 'capital market volatility', 'corporate Eurobond payments', 'two international clearing', 'First Russian Company', 'domestic corporate Eurobonds', 'foreign unsecured debt', 'Russian corporate debt', 'international markets', 'global operations', 'Eurobond due', 'military hostilities', 'commodities markets', 'Russian investors', 'Russian firms', 'Russian securities', 'Russian corporates', 'international agents', 'settlement organizations', 'credit rating', 'interest payments', 'two people', 'two entities', 'foreign investors', 'foreign noteholders', 'domestic investors', 'corporate bondholders', 'Russian sovereign', 'Russian government', 'sovereign Eurobonds', 'Foreign-Currency Debt', 'external debt', 'Russian companies', 'Russian corporations', 'Kirill Kudryavtsev', 'Getty Images', 'mining company', 'industrial giant', 'ironclad permit', 'alternative options', 'complicated process', 'bank cards', 'European regulators', 'restrictive environment', 'European Union', 'top steelmaker', 'Polyus Gold', 'fertilizer producer', 'current marketplace', 'bigger risk', 'William Jackson', 'Capital Economics', 'rating agency', 'little prospect', 'investment grade', 'speculative grade', 'New York', 'largest impact', 'Potential effects', 'chain disruptions', 'inflationary pressures', 'weaker growth', 'domestic companies', 'domestic firm', 'Western sanctions', 'retaliatory sanctions', 'Other companies', 'junk territory', 'Severstal officials', 'banknotes', 'Moscow', 'Aug.', 'AFP', 'March', 'Citigroup', 'obligations', 'Bloomberg', 'discussions', 'claims', 'less', 'one-fifth', 'creditors', 'Kremlin', 'transit', 'photo', 'logos', 'Visa', 'Mastercard', 'delays', 'NSD', 'statement', 'Reuters', 'orders', 'clarifications', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'transactions', 'end', 'Finance', 'funds', 'challenges', 'NLMK', 'EuroChem', 'prelude', 'defaults', 'creditworthiness', 'plethora', 'country', 'invasion', 'CC', 'recovery', 'London', 'shares', 'plenty', 'uncertainty', 'future', 'terms', 'banks', 'duration', 'time', 'oil', 'gas', 'exposure']",2022-03-23,2022-03-24,m.theepochtimes.com

Severstal  Russia's top steelmaker NLMK  state-owned Russian Railways and fertiliser producer Eurochem are all struggling to get payments to Russian bondholders  the firms themselves and ITI Capital say.NLMK said on Tuesday it had paid a coupon on a 2024 bond but while foreigners had started to receive their money  Russian holders hadn't.""This is due to the fact that...

1329,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/sanctions-delay-payments-to-russian-corporate-eurobond-holders-944658,Steel giant Severstal scrambles to avoid first major default of Russia-Ukraine crisis,(Reuters) -   Russian holders of domestic corporate Eurobonds face delays in receiving payments settled through international agents  as transactions get snarled up by sanctions  Russia&#039;s National Settlement Depository (NSD)  companies and analysts said.,A source close to the steel firm said the money had been transferred last week but was yet to be processed and passed on by its paying agent Citibank.‚ÄúThis will technically be the first default since the crisis began to unfold ‚Äù Seaport Global credit analyst Himanshu Porwal said.‚ÄúBut people will know it is driven by the way the sanctions have been formulated  rather than the company‚Äôs fault ‚Äù adding Severstal might find a way to make the payment in the coming days  especially if Mordashov were to cut or relinquish his large stake in the firm  which itself is not sanctioned.With Wednesday‚Äôs deadline fast approaching Severstal said it had been in constant discussions about the issues  and that it was looking at an application for special ‚Äúlicences‚Äù that may be required to make the payment.The legal terms of the bonds state an ‚ÄúEvent of Default‚Äù can be formally declared five working days after the March 16 coupon due date.The latest Western sanctions and countersanctions by Moscow mean that transferring payments on Russian government and corporate bonds has become complex.Previously payments like Severstal‚Äôs would have been processed by international clearing houses such as Clearstream or Euroclear  which confirm asset ownership  and also funnel payments for domestic bondholders to Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository (NSD).However both Euroclear  owned by a group of global exchanges and banks  and Clearstream  part of Deutsche Boerse  have said they will stop settling trades in Russian securities as a result of the EU‚Äôs sanctions.Neither Clearstream  Euroclear nor Citigroup responded to requests for comment.DELAYS POSSIBLEA Severstal default would be the first by a major Russian company since Moscow was blanketed by sanctions for what it calls its ‚Äúspecial military operation‚Äù in Ukraine  but it may not be alone.Russian companies need to make $18.5 billion of international bond payments by year-end  ITI Capital analysts estimate  while Moscow needs to pay another $3.4 billion on its foreign currency sovereign bonds.Investors would have the right to take legal action to reclaim unpaid amounts  most likely in the United Kingdom or the United States ‚Äì under whose laws most international market bonds are issued.Payments due in coming days include from Gazprom  which made a payment without problems earlier this month  Russian Railways on March 25 and Polyus Gold on March 28  the same day as Russia‚Äôs next international sovereign bond payment falls due.It‚Äôs not just international bondholders who are affected. Severstal  Russia‚Äôs top steelmaker NLMK  state-owned Russian Railways and fertiliser producer Eurochem are all struggling to get payments to Russian bondholders  the firms themselves and ITI Capital say.NLMK said on Tuesday it had paid a coupon on a 2024 bond but while foreigners had started to receive their money  Russian holders hadn‚Äôt.‚ÄúThis is due to the fact that‚Ä¶ Euroclear and Clearstream are no longer settling transactions with Russia‚Äôs NSD ‚Äù NLMK said. ‚ÄúWe currently see no legal grounds prohibiting Euroclear and Clearstream to process payments to Russian residents.‚ÄùNSD confirmed it was receiving payments from Euroclear  but said it will not process these until Euroclear gets clarifications from European regulators.‚ÄúAfter curbs are lifted  payments will be processed‚Ä¶as usual ‚Äù it said.The daily Kommersant newspaper  citing a source at a large brokerage firm  said some Russian holders of Moscow‚Äôs sovereign bonds also hadn‚Äôt received payments.

The EEX operates the common auction platform for the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).ACX trades carbon credits in a similar way to a commodity market  with a conventional trade matching engine. However  the carbon credit certificates are tokenized on the public Polygon blockchain  making their ownership easier to trace and allowing for real-time settlement.The majority of the transactions on the ACX platform so far are for CORSIA tokens which support carbon offsets in the aviation sector. During the first half of 2021  the transaction volumes across all its markets represented 3 603 284 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent. The company says it has more than 130 corporate clients.‚ÄúI am confident that our 15 years of experience in operating spot and derivatives markets within the European Emissions Trading Scheme  coupled with ACX‚Äôs unique carbon solutions  will lead to a greater level of standardization required to successfully scale up Voluntary Carbon Markets ‚Äù said Tobias Paulun  Chief Strategy Officer of EEX.Numerous initiatives are targeting voluntary carbon markets  some of them using cryptocurrencies and others on private blockchains. Several major banks  including the National Bank of Australia  Natwest  BNP Paribas and Standard Chartered  are collaborating on Carbonplace. And in Singapore  where ACX first launched  Standard Chartered alongside DBS Bank  the Singapore Exchange (SGX) and Temasek are involved in the Climate Impact X (CIX).Update: the blockchain was changed from Binance Smart Chain to Polygon,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,True,English,"['Deutsche B√∂rse', 'blockchain-based AirCarbon Exchange', 'conventional trade matching engine', 'Deutsche B√∂rse group', 'European Emissions Trading Scheme', 'EU Emissions Trading System', 'blockchain-based Voluntary Carbon market', 'Deutsche Boerse subsidiary', 'Chief Strategy Officer', 'Several major banks', 'Climate Impact X', 'Binance Smart Chain', 'carbon credit certificates', 'carbon dioxide equivalent', 'unique carbon solutions', 'European Energy Exchange', 'common auction platform', 'Voluntary Carbon Markets', 'public Polygon blockchain', 'EU ETS', 'commodity market', 'carbon credits', 'carbon offsets', 'AirCarbon Exchange', 'derivatives markets', 'significant funding', 'same time', 'similar way', 'real-time settlement', 'CORSIA tokens', 'aviation sector', 'first half', 'transaction volumes', '3,603,284 metric tons', '130 corporate clients', 'operating spot', 'greater level', 'Tobias Paulun', 'Numerous initiatives', 'private blockchains', 'National Bank', 'BNP Paribas', 'Standard Chartered', 'DBS Bank', 'Singapore Exchange', 'ACX platform', 'The EEX', 'partnership', 'ownership', 'majority', 'transactions', 'company', '15 years', 'experience', 'standardization', 'cryptocurrencies', 'others', 'Australia', 'Natwest', 'Carbonplace', 'SGX', 'Temasek', 'CIX', 'Update']",2022-03-23,2022-03-24,ledgerinsights.com

This can then be passed on to the investor via additional returns or a reduction in the management fee.What is staking? How issuers boost returns in crypto ETPsIt is the fourth staked product launched by CoinShares after it unveiled the CoinShares Physical Staked Cardano ETP (CSDA) earlier this month and is the first launched in partnership with the FTX cryptocurrency exchange.This followed the CoinShares Physical Staked Tezos ETP (XTZS) and the CoinShares Physical Staked Polkadot ETP (CDOT) launched in January.Frank Spiteri  chief revenue officer at CoinShares  said: ‚ÄúThe feedback on our growing suite of innovative staked ETPs has been overwhelmingly positive  and collaborating with FTX to create the first Solana ETP with transparent staking rewards for investors allows us to double down on our commitment to providing investors with best-in-class regulated crypto products.‚ÄúSolana is one of the most requested exposures amongst our clients and SLNC is launching with ‚Ç¨1m SOL in assets under management  a level that meets institutions and corporates baseline for investment consideration.‚ÄùIt brings the total number of ETPs launched on the CoinShares platform to eight.SLNC is the second staked solana product to hit the market after 21Shares launched the Solana (SOL) ETP (ASOL) last June with a TER of 2.5%.Related articles,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,positive,0.72,0.25,0.03,True,English,"['ETP range', 'solana launch', 'CoinShares', 'The CoinShares FTX Physical Staked Solana ETP', 'CoinShares Physical Staked Cardano ETP', 'CoinShares Physical Staked Tezos ETP', 'CoinShares Physical Staked Polkadot ETP', 'class regulated crypto products', 'fourth staked product', 'innovative staked ETPs', 'first Solana ETP', 'chief revenue officer', 'FTX cryptocurrency exchange', 'total expanse ratio', 'solana exchange-traded product', 'transparent staking rewards', 'ETP range', 'SOL) ETP', 'solana product', 'CoinShares platform', 'crypto ETPs', 'solana launch', 'total number', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'additional yield', 'large pools', 'Frank Spiteri', 'growing suite', '‚Ç¨1m SOL', 'corporates baseline', 'investment consideration', 'Related articles', 'management fee', 'additional returns', 'market', 'investors', 'SLNC', 'potential', 'discretion', 'issuers', 'assets', 'reduction', 'CSDA', 'partnership', 'XTZS', 'CDOT', 'January', 'feedback', 'commitment', 'exposures', 'clients', 'level', 'institutions', '21Shares', 'ASOL']",2022-03-23,2022-03-24,etfstream.com

Canada is committed to establishing a broad  local battery ecosystem by leveraging  among other things  its leadership in the generation of electricity from renewable sources.‚ÄúOur joint venture with LG Energy Solution is yet another stepping stone to achieving our aggressive electrification roadmap in the region aimed at hitting 50% of battery electric vehicle sales in the US and Canada by the end of the decade ‚Äù said Carlos Tavares  Stellantis CEO. ‚ÄúWe are grateful to the Municipal  Provincial and Federal levels of government for their support and commitment to help position Canada as a North American leader in the production of electric vehicle batteries.‚ÄùStory continues‚ÄúThrough this joint venture  LG Energy Solution will be able to position itself as a critical player in building green energy value chains in the region ‚Äù said Youngsoo Kwon  CEO of LG Energy Solution. ‚ÄúCreating a joint venture battery manufacturing company in Canada  recognized as one of the leading nations in renewable energy resources  is key for LG Energy Solution as we aim to power more electric vehicles around the world.‚Äù‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement of a world leading facility to build electric vehicle batteries in Windsor is an investment in our workers  our communities and our future. Partnerships like these are critical to creating new jobs and putting Canada on the cutting edge of the clean economy. By working together  we are creating thousands of new jobs  making a difference in the lives of people now and making sure that future generations have a clean environment to live in.‚Äù ‚Äì The Rt Honourable Justin Trudeau  Prime Minister of Canada‚ÄúAttracting this multi billion-dollar investment will secure Ontario‚Äôs place as a North American hub for building the cars and batteries of the future. As we secure game-changing investments  we‚Äôre also connecting resources  industries and workers in northern Ontario with the manufacturing might of southern Ontario to build up home-grown supply chains. Every region of Ontario will benefit with thousands of jobs being created and a stronger economy that works for everyone.‚Äù ‚Äì Premier Doug Ford‚ÄúStellantis is Windsor‚Äôs largest employer and has a rich history in this community. Chrysler began operations in this community in 1925 and has employed generations of Windsor‚ÄìEssex workers at its facility. With this announcement  we are securing the future for thousands more local workers and securing Windsor‚Äôs strategic location as the home of Canada‚Äôs electric vehicle future. As the world pivots to EVs  Windsor will soon be home to the battery manufacturing facility that powers it all.‚Äù ‚Äì Mayor of Windsor  Drew DilkensAs part of the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  Stellantis announced plans to have global annual battery electric vehicle sales of five million vehicles by 2030  reaching 100% of passenger car BEV sales mix in Europe and 50% passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in North America. Stellantis also increased planned battery capacity by 140 GWh to approximately 400 GWh  to be supported by five battery manufacturing plants together with additional supply contracts.LG Energy Solution  with this latest announcement  has now solidly secured production capacity of over 200 GWh in North America annually  translating into production of 2.5 million high performance electric vehicles.

In fact  one in five (21%) have experienced a ransomware attack in the last year; with 43% of those experienc‚Ä¶,PARIS LA D√âFENSE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--New research from Thales has found that malware  ransomware and phishing continues to plague global organisations. In fact  one in five (21%) have experienced a ransomware attack in the last year; with 43% of those experiencing a significant impact on operations.First seen in the late 1980‚Äôs  with the PC Cyborg Virus  the frequency and impact of ransomware attacks has now accelerated due to the rise of cryptocurrency as the preferred ransomware payment method. In fact  the 2022 Thales Data Threat Report  conducted by 451 Research  part of S&P Global Market Intelligence  including more than 2 700 IT decision-makers worldwide  found a fifth (22%) of organisations have admitted that they have paid or would pay a ransom for their data. Despite this  41% of respondents said they had no plans to change security spending  even with greater ransomware impacts.Additionally  less than half of respondents (48%) have implemented a formal ransomware plan. Healthcare was the most prepared at 57% with a formal ransomware plan; energy the least at 44%. Despite both sectors experiencing significant breaches over the past twelve months.Data Visibility is a ChallengeAs more companies adopt multicloud strategies and hybrid work remains the norm  IT leaders continue to be challenged by the sprawl of data across their organizations and find it more difficult to locate all of their data. Just over half (56%) of IT leaders were very confident or had complete knowledge of where their data was being stored  down from 64% the previous year1  and only a quarter (25%) stated they were able to classify all their data.Threats & Compliance ChallengesThroughout 2021  security incidents remained high  with almost a third (29%) of businesses experiencing a breach in the past 12 months. Additionally  almost half (43%) of IT Leaders admitted to having failed a compliance audit.Globally  IT leaders ranked malware (56%)  ransomware (53%) and phishing (40%) as the leading source of security attacks. Managing these risks is an ongoing challenge  with almost half (45%) of IT leaders reporting an increase in the volume  severity and/or scope of cyberattacks in the past 12 months.The Cloud is Increasing Complexity & RiskCloud adoption is increasing with more than a third (34%) of respondents saying they used more than 50 Software as a Service (SaaS) apps and 16% used more than 100 apps. However  51% of IT leaders agreed that it is more complex to manage privacy and data protection regulations in a cloud environment than in on-premises networks within their organization  up from 46% last year.The 2022 Data Threat Report also revealed significant momentum amongst businesses to store data in the cloud  with 32% of respondents stating that around halfi of their workloads and data resides in external clouds  and a quarter (23%) reporting more than 60%. However  44% reported that they had experienced a breach or failed an audit in their cloud environments.Additionally  the use of encryption to protect sensitive data is low  with only half of respondents (50%) disclosing that more than 40% of their sensitive data has been encrypted  and a fifth (22%) stating more than 60%. Representing a significant ongoing risk for businesses.Remote Work WorriesAnother full year of remote working demonstrated that navigating security risks is proving a significant challenge for businesses. Worryingly  the majority of businesses (79%) are still concerned about the security risks and threats that posed by remote working. Only half of IT leaders (55%) reported to have implemented multi factor authentication (MFA)  a figure unchanged from the previous year2.Threats on the HorizonHowever  the report also showed that IT leaders have significant diversity of spending technology priorities ‚Äì suggesting they are serious about tackling complex threat environments. A quarter (26%) stated that broad cloud security toolsets are the greatest future spending priority. Additionally  a similar number of IT leaders (25%) stated they were prioritising key management  with Zero Trust3 an important strategy for 23%.IT leaders are also increasingly aware of the future challenges on the horizon. Looking ahead  when asked to identify security threats from quantum computing  52% said they were concerned with ‚Äòtomorrow‚Äôs decryption of today‚Äôs data‚Äô  a concern that will likely be intensified by the increasing complexity of cloud environments.Sebastien Cano  Senior Vice President for Cloud Protection and Licensing activities at Thales  comments: ‚ÄúAs the pandemic continues to affect both our business and personal lives  any expectation of a ‚Äòreturn‚Äô to pre-pandemic conditions have faded. Whilst teams around the world have continued to face challenges in securing their data  our findings indicate that urgent action is needed by businesses to develop more robust cybersecurity strategies. The attack surface  as well as the asset management challenges  are only set to increase in the coming year  and it is vital that businesses deploy a robust security strategy based on discovery  protection and control.‚ÄùThales and 451 Research will discuss the findings in more detail during a webinar on 31 March 2022.

The gross proceeds of the transaction amount to EUR 620 million. This completion is an important step towards the full closing of the sale of Aegon‚Äôs insurance  pension  and asset management businesses in Central and Eastern Europe to VIG for EUR 830 million  as announced in November 2020. The sales of Aegon‚Äôs businesses in Poland  Romania and Turkey are expected to be completed in the course of 2022  subject to required local regulatory approvals.‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announcement marks an important step in the transformation of Aegon as we narrow our strategic focus to select core and growth markets  and further strengthen our balance sheet‚Äù  said Lard Friese  CEO Aegon. ‚ÄúI would like to sincerely thank our employees in Hungary for their significant contribution to Aegon over the years.‚ÄùThe closing of the sale of the Hungarian businesses will result in a significant increase of Aegon‚Äôs Cash Capital at the Holding ‚Äì which amounted to EUR 1.3 billion at the end of 2021 ‚Äì and brings it above the stated operating range of EUR 0.5 billion to EUR 1.5 billion. This provides Aegon with the financial flexibility to announce today a reduction of its debt through a EUR 375 million tender offer  as well as the intention to return surplus cash capital to its shareholders via a EUR 300 million share buyback  barring unforeseen circumstances. These actions are in line with the ambitions stated at the Capital Markets Day in December 2020.‚ÄúI am very pleased that by further reducing our debt  we are able to deliver on our deleveraging goal well ahead of our 2023 target date‚Äù  Lard Friese added. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs announced share buyback also underscores our intention to return surplus cash capital to shareholders.‚ÄùDebt tender offer and share buybackThe debt repayment will be executed through a EUR 375 million tender offer for six subordinated bonds. Details of the debt tender offer will be disclosed via a separate press release today. After completion of the tender offer  Aegon will have reduced its gross financial leverage to the range of EUR 5.0 billion to EUR 5.5 billion  a target that was set to be accomplished by 2023.Story continuesAdditionally  Aegon intends to return EUR 300 million of surplus cash capital to shareholders via a share buyback in the course of 2022. The share buyback will be executed in three tranches of EUR 100 million each  with each tranche conditional on maintaining the capital positions of Aegon's main units in line with its stated ambitions  and the Cash Capital at the Holding being above the middle of the operating range.The EUR 300 million share buyback program will commence on April 1  2022 and is expected to be completed on or before December 15  2022. The first tranche of EUR 100 million is expected to be completed on or before June 30  2022. For each tranche Aegon will engage a third party to execute the buyback transactions on its behalf. The common shares will be repurchased at a maximum of the average of the daily volume-weighted average prices during the repurchase period  and will subsequently be proposed to be cancelled at Aegon‚Äôs 2023 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.Following the divestment of Aegon‚Äôs businesses in Hungary  Aegon‚Äôs IFRS equity will increase by approximately EUR 400 million in the first quarter of 2022  of which approximately EUR 375 million will be recognized as a book gain  based on the balance sheet position on December 31  2021. The combination of the completion of the sale of Aegon‚Äôs Hungarian businesses  the repayment of the debt and the share buyback will not have a material impact on the Group Solvency II ratio.About AegonAegon is an integrated  diversified  international financial services group.

The ‚ÄúUnione 0‚Äù real estate fund  managed by Prelios SGR...,MILAN ‚Äì Hines  the global real estate firm  and Accor  a world leader in the hospitality sector  announce plans for a hotel at MilanoSesto via an agreement with the ‚ÄúUnione 0‚Äù real estate fund.The ‚ÄúUnione 0‚Äù real estate fund  managed by Prelios SGR and ultimately invested in by Hines and Cale Street  has entered into a binding agreement with Accor for a hotel to be developed on the Unione 0 private lot at MilanoSesto  on a 25-year lease  via the hotel group's partner  Amapa. Hines is also a strategic advisor and development manager of the entire MilanoSesto 13-year project. Prelios  meanwhile  acts as manager of the ‚ÄúUnione 0‚Äù real estate fund and asset and project manager of the overall initiative.Currently  construction continues on the Unione 0 private lot section at MilanoSesto  which spans 250 000 square metres  bordering the former Falck area railway station. Excavation work for the hotel will start in August 2022 with construction set to begin on the buildings by the end of 2022. The buildings include the hotel (301 rooms)  office space covering c. 48 000 square metres  student accommodation catering for approximately 700 people  affordable housing units (285 apartments) and free-market residential units (480 apartments). The area will also feature an initial 13-hectare section of the 45-hectare park  designed by international architecture firm LAND.The hotel will have 301 rooms that will operate under two Accor Group brands: 204 rooms will be managed by Novotel and offer facilities like short-stay  rental accommodations  while a total of 97 serviced apartments will be managed by Adagio and used as medium-long stay accommodation. The hotel will span 19 floors covering approximately 16 000 square metres and will maintain the highest environmental  sustainability and energy efficiency standards  with the aim of achieving LEED Gold certification.The hotel  designed by international architecture and design firm Antonio Citterio Patricia Viel (ACPV)  will stand alongside the new Sesto San Giovanni station  designed by Renzo Piano Building Workshop together with Ottavio Di Blasi & Partners  located near the future City of Health and Research (Citt√† della Salute e della Ricerca - CdSR)  a public clinical research and training healthcare complex  entirely funded by the Italian state and the Lombardy Region. It will also become home to the National Cancer Institute and the ‚ÄúCarlo Besta‚Äù Neurological Institute  with both centres of excellence expected to receive approximately 4 000 visitors each day.The signing of this agreement is scheduled for early 2026 and is a testament to Hines‚Äô ability to partner with major companies for the projects it manages and develops. Such projects are characterised by a long-term approach and ESG vision with a focus on economic viability to ensure their success.‚ÄúWorking with an operator like Accor who is known for its great vision in the hospitality and accommodation sector is gratifying for us because we are fully confident that they can make the most of the opportunities that MilanoSesto will bring to the area.

Following our lowest ever Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate in 2021  we have continued to achieve new safety milestones  passing eight million hours without a Lost Time Injury in early March 2022.

In addition to setting a short-term carbon reduction target  the Board has also approved our ambition to be Net Zero by 2040.The positive momentum we saw in all our product markets in 2021 has continued into 2022. Global demand for ilmenite  our primary product  continues to exceed supply and our production volumes are being well received by the market.In light of this continuing market strength and our record performance  the Board is recommending a 2021 dividend of USc32.71 per share  up from USc10.00 per share in 2020.

Listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Euronext Dublin  Kenmare operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine in Mozambique. Moma‚Äôs production accounts for approximately 8% of global titanium feedstocks and the Group supplies to customers in more than 15 countries. Kenmare produces raw materials that are ultimately consumed in everyday ‚Äúquality-of life‚Äù items such as paints  plastics and ceramic tiles.All monetary amounts refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.Forward Looking StatementsThis announcement contains some forward-looking statements that represent Kenmare's expectations for its business  based on current expectations about future events  which by their nature involve risks and uncertainties. Kenmare believes that its expectations and assumptions with respect to these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However  because they involve risk and uncertainty  which are in some cases beyond Kenmare's control  actual results or performance may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information.CHAIRMAN‚ÄôS STATEMENTDear shareholders 2021 was the first full year of operations at the high grade Pilivili ore zone  in addition to our original Namalope area. Significant increases in production and shipments were achieved  while our product markets exhibited strong demand throughout the year. As a result  revenue increased by 87% to $455.9 million  and profit after tax by 669% to $128.5 million  vindicating our strategy of investing in additional production capacity in anticipation of a tight market.As we began 2021  while we had largely completed the last of our three growth projects  operational effectiveness continued to be impacted by COVID-19. Our vaccination  testing  and quarantine protocols mitigated the worst effects of the virus  however  and we also achieved a truly outstanding safety performance. Nevertheless  we remain vigilant as the pandemic continues to evolve. The health and safety of our colleagues and host communities remain our highest priorities.Shareholder returnsKenmare committed to increase shareholder returns after the completion of the major capital projects executed during 2018-2020. Accordingly  we have recommended a dividend payout of 25% of profit after tax for 2021  higher than the 20% minimum policy. Subject to shareholder approval  our 2021 full year dividend will be USc32.71  an increase of 227% compared to 2020.Despite robust operational and financial performance  our share price during 2021 did not fully reflect Kenmare‚Äôs intrinsic value  and the Board concluded that a share buy-back was therefore a prudent use of capital. A share buy-back was completed in December 2021  returning $81.6 million to eligible shareholders while reducing the number of shares in issue by 13.5%.I am pleased that Kenmare has been able to return almost $100 million in aggregate to shareholders during 2021  through dividends and the share buy-back  whilst also maintaining a robust balance sheet.At the 2022 Annual General Meeting (‚ÄúAGM‚Äù) Kenmare will ask shareholders to approve resolutions to implement an Odd-lot Offer at some point during the next 18 months. This will enable the Company to purchase  at a 5% premium  the shares held by eligible certificated shareholders who hold fewer than 200 shares in the Company. This will help small shareholders who would otherwise have difficulty selling their holdings due to disproportionate trading costs. Further details of the Odd-lot Offer scheme will be included in the Notice of AGM to be distributed to shareholders in due course.Outlook and strategyIn 2021 we benefitted from strong product markets for all our products and this positive momentum has continued into 2022. Our increased production has been well absorbed by our markets and demand for Kenmare ilmenite remains strong. However  the tragic conflict in Ukraine has created significant uncertainties in global trade routes and the wider economy. It is too soon to speculate on the overall effects on our business  but Ukraine is a significant supplier of titanium feedstocks  while lower global growth could reduce demand for our products.In 2025  Wet Concentrator Plant (‚ÄúWCP‚Äù) A will move to the Nataka ore zone. Field tests of mining methods and planning studies are making good progress and a Pre-Feasibility Study for the move is expected to be completed later in 2022. This will include details of the mining method  relocation  provision of water and power  an HMC pumping system  and plans for tailings disposal.Our overall strategy is to operate responsibly to deliver long-life low-cost production  allocating capital efficiently  including towards developing accretive growth opportunities. The Kenmare team is committed to achieving these strategic goals  while also becoming a first quartile producer on the industry revenue to cost curve. Achievement of these long-term strategic goals will support further increases in free cash flow and higher dividends  as well as improving resilience in case of potential cyclical commodity market downturns.SustainabilityKenmare has always placed sustainability at the heart of its business practices  working responsibly to achieve ambitious environment  social  and governance goals. In 2021  we published our inaugural Sustainability Report  which set out guiding principles  together with some examples of our approach to responsible environmental management  and constructive community and other stakeholder relations. We will publish our second Sustainability Report in the coming weeks  including commentary on our performance against public sustainability targets for the first time.The Board has ratified an inaugural Climate Policy and we will shortly publish our first Climate Strategy Report  aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‚ÄúTCFD‚Äù).During 2021 we launched a Portuguese version of our corporate website to ensure all information is easily accessible for Mozambicans. For the second consecutive year  we were pleased to be named as the most transparent extractive industry company in Mozambique by the Centre for Public Integrity‚Äôs Extractive Industry Transparency Index.Board developmentIn 2021  an external performance evaluation of the Board and all of its Committees was conducted by Board Excellence  in accordance with the provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. I am pleased to report that the evaluation concluded that Kenmare‚Äôs Board operates efficiently  ‚Äúwith a deep commitment to do the right thing and excel on behalf of shareholders  employees and stakeholders.‚Äù A summary of outcomes and actions from the evaluation will be published in our 2021 Annual Report.A number of important changes in the composition of the Board took place during the year  and further changes will occur in 2022 when I plan to retire  after nine years on Kenmare‚Äôs Board  almost eight of them as Chairman.Gabriel Smith  Tim Keating  and Peter Bacchus stepped down and I would like to thank them sincerely for their important contributions to Kenmare‚Äôs success in recent years. Graham Martin has assumed the role of Senior Independent Director following Peter‚Äôs departure.In March 2021  we were pleased to welcome Sameer Oundhakar to replace Tim as the representative Director of our largest shareholder  African Acquisition S.√†.r.l.  an investment vehicle owned by the Oman Investment Authority.In October 2021  we announced that Mette Dobel had agreed to join the Board as an independent Non-Executive Director effective 1 January 2022. Her significant leadership experience both as a senior executive and director of FLSmidth A/S  at the cutting edge of mining technology and automation  will be invaluable as we strive to achieve further operational efficiencies and build a positive social and environmental legacy.In December 2021  Andrew Webb joined the Board as an independent Non-Executive Director and Chair Designate. Andrew brings extensive natural resources and financial advisory experience  having previously served as a Managing Director at Rothschild & Co in the Global Advisory team  where he worked for 25 years. I have enjoyed working with him through the transition period and am confident that Andrew‚Äôs skills and enormous mining industry and finance experience position him well to play a key role in driving the future success of the business.I plan to step down following the 2022 AGM and Andrew will become Chairman. I look forward with confidence to Andrew and the rest of the Board taking Kenmare to even higher levels of achievement in future yearsAfter these changes  the composition of the Board will provide a strong and diverse mix of talents  skills and experience  well suited to the business and challenges ahead  while achieving our gender diversity target with female Directors representing one third of the Board.AcknowledgementsI would like to end my final statement as Chairman by thanking all of Kenmare‚Äôs key stakeholders for their support and commitment to the Company and the Board  not only during the unprecedented challenges we have all experienced during the past two years of COVID-19 disruption  but also throughout my nine-year tenure. I look back on the Company‚Äôs achievements with a sense of pride and I am pleased to be leaving Kenmare in the strongest position in its history.It has been a privilege to work with my fellow Board members  and particularly Michael Carvill who founded the company and has led it selflessly and courageously for more than 20 years. Kenmare has an outstanding management team and a remarkable workforce. I feel privileged to have worked with such a talented group and I will follow the Company‚Äôs continued progress with keen interest.With capacity to deliver 1.2 million tonnes per annum (‚ÄúMtpa‚Äù) of ilmenite on a sustainable basis  buoyant product markets  and a first class team  I am confident that Kenmare will continue to generate value for all stakeholders in 2022 and beyond.Steven McTiernanChairmanMANAGING DIRECTOR‚ÄôS STATEMENTKenmare delivered a record year for safety  production  and shipments in 2021. The Company demonstrated its resilience and agility  protecting our employees and host communities against a second year of heightened risk due to COVID-19. I would like to thank all our team for their hard work and dedication  particularly during H1 2021 when we faced huge challenges as a result of the virus.Our record operational performance in 2021 was supported by strong market conditions for all our products. We increased production of ilmenite  our main product  by almost 50% compared to 2020 and this was well received by the product market  with quarter-on-quarter price increases. This enabled us to generate EBITDA of $216.1 million  up 182% on 2020  and gave us the confidence to return almost $100 million to shareholders during the year  increasing our 2021 dividend payout to 25% of profit after tax  above the 20% minimum policy  and completing a share buy-back of 13.5% of our issued share capital.We are targeting production of 1.2 Mtpa of ilmenite  plus co-products  on a sustainable basis and reduced unit costs. We remain focused on delivering strong free cash flow and shareholder returns  while continuing to raise the standards to which we hold ourselves in terms of environment  social  and governance performance. We believe we are achieving our purpose of responsibly meeting global demand for quality-of-life minerals.SafetyIt is testimony to our strong safety culture that Kenmare reported its best ever safety performance in 2021. This achievement is particularly significant given the additional pressure put on our mining operations by COVID-19  which had the potential to increase safety risks.We delivered our lowest ever Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate of 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 31 December 2021  which also represented more than six million hours worked without a Lost Time Injury (‚ÄúLTI‚Äù) and an 88% reduction compared to 2020. Our Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (‚ÄúTRIFR‚Äù) relative to the 2020 International Council on Mining and Metals TRIFR was in the top quintile. On 6 January 2022 we achieved one year without a LTI and we are working hard to maintain this record performance. We also retained our five-star NOSA safety accreditation for the sixth consecutive year.SustainabilityOur commitment to working responsibly is enshrined in Kenmare‚Äôs purpose and we are particularly focused on protecting our employees and our host communities in Mozambique. In mid-2021 we began vaccinating our workforce against COVID-19 and by the end of the year  96% had been double vaccinated. We also donated 12 000 vaccines to local communities.Through the Kenmare Moma Development Association (‚ÄúKMAD‚Äù)  we completed the construction of a new health centre for the communities living near our Pilivili operations and constructed seven school blocks in the Namalope and Pilivili areas. By the end of the year  over 1 000 farmers were registered in our Conservation Agriculture programme to improve crop yields and 75 small businesses were benefitting from KMAD support.We recognise the role and responsibility all businesses must take in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and as such  in December 2021  the Board approved Kenmare‚Äôs Climate Policy. We will publish our first Climate Strategy Report in the coming weeks  which follows recommendations made by the TCFD. We have an ambition of becoming Net Zero (Scope 1 and 2) by 2040  with a short-term carbon emissions reduction target of 12% by 2024  contingent on receiving a reliable power supply from the Mozambican state power provider  Electricidade de Mo√ßambique.In early 2021 we approved the development of a RUPS. It is expected to deliver increased power stability for the Mineral Separation Plant  an important risk mitigation measure  and is anticipated to be the main contributor towards our reduced emissions through lower diesel consumption. At an estimated cost of $18 million  the RUPS is a Net Present Value positive project  using conservative assumptions  and commissioning commenced in Q1 2022.We also continued to invest in our people. The Moma workforce received 21 100 hours of training during the year as we believe that providing continuous development opportunities is key to attracting and retaining the best people and maintaining our strong safety culture. At the end of 2021  we had 1 551 employees at the Moma Mine and over 97% of them were Mozambican  with 70% from the local district or province. 12.5% of our Moma employees were women  compared with 10.6% in 2020  reflecting our successful initiatives to encourage women to join and remain in our workforce.Operational performance2021 was a record year for production and the first time we have produced more than one million tonnes of ilmenite. Total production of finished products was up 46% compared to 2020  driven by the higher ore grades mined in Pilivili by WCP B following its relocation in Q3 2020. We achieved Moma‚Äôs nameplate capacity of 1.2 Mtpa ilmenite production in Q3 2021  which set a new quarterly production record  and demonstrated our ability to produce at our targeted rate. We are now focused on achieving this run rate on a consistent basis. 2021 was also a record year for shipments  which were up 51% compared to 2020.We achieved this compelling performance despite the impact of COVID-19 on our operations  particularly in H1 2021. Ilmenite production was below the midpoint of guidance due to the challenges of operating with a reduced workforce  including senior management  and power supply disruptions in Q4. Operating costs per tonne were 3% above the top end of our guidance range due mainly to additional costs associated with repairs and maintenance  HMC haulage  and COVID-19 management. In 2022  we will look to progress towards becoming a first quartile producer on the industry revenue to cost curve.Product marketKenmare is the world‚Äôs largest supplier of ilmenite and the Moma Mine is one of the largest titanium minerals deposits globally. The titanium feedstocks we produce are principally used to make pigment  which is essential for imparting whiteness and opacity in the production of paints  paper  plastic  and a range of other items we use in our everyday lives.2021 was a strong year for all of Kenmare‚Äôs product markets  with increased volumes sold at a 21% higher average price than in 2020. Robust demand for titanium feedstocks  like ilmenite  was driven primarily by global pigment production reaching a record high and the titanium metal market improving. Following softer demand in 2020  the market for zircon  our main co-product  stabilised in Q1 2021 and then saw price increases throughout the remainder of 2021. The positive pricing momentum for all our products has continued into 2022  with global inventories remaining low.OutlookAlthough the pandemic continued to create huge challenges in 2021  I believe we have built a stronger business. The past two years have shown us what we are all capable of  particularly when we pull together and look out for each other. I would like to thank all our stakeholders  particularly those in Mozambique  for their invaluable support.I would also like to thank Steven McTiernan for his outstanding contribution to Kenmare. He led the Company as Chairman during a period of significant change  providing constructive challenge  wise counsel  and strong support. I look forward to working with Andrew Webb and ensuring we continue to deliver positive returns and create value for all our stakeholders.As we look to the months and years ahead  we know we have a lot of hard work ahead of us to live up to our strategy of operating responsibly  delivering long-life  low-cost production  and allocating capital efficiently  including developing accretive growth opportunities. However  we can be proud that our operations are safe and performing well  our balance sheet is strong  our product markets are tight  and our employees have proven they can succeed even in the most difficult conditions.Michael CarvillManaging DirectorUNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021Notes 2021$‚Äô000 2020$‚Äô000 Revenue 2 455 944 243 746 Cost of sales 4 (244 986) (179 103) Gross profit 210 958 64 643 Other operating costs 5 (57 977) (30 250) Operating profit 152 981 34 393 Finance income 6 265 642 Finance costs 7 (12 053) (11 301) Foreign exchange loss (3 897) (980) Profit before tax 137 296 22 754 Income tax expense 8 (8 770) (6 015) Profit for the financial year and total comprehensive income for the financial year 128 526 16 739 Attributable to equity holders 128 526 16 739 $ per share $ per share Profit per share: Basic 9 1.18 0.15 Profit per share: Diluted 9 1.16 0.15The accompanying notes form part of these financial statements.UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITIONAS AT 31 DECEMBER 2021Notes 2021$‚Äô000 2020$‚Äô000 Assets Non-current assets Property  plant and equipment 10 954 558 958 508 Right of use assets 11 2 136 3 220 Deferred tax asset -

Statement of accounting policiesKenmare Resources plc (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) is domiciled in the Republic of Ireland. The Company‚Äôs registered address is Styne House  Hatch Street Upper  Dublin 2. The Company has a premium listing on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin. These unaudited consolidated financial statements comprise the Company and its subsidiary undertakings (the ‚ÄúGroup‚Äù). The principal activity of the Group is the operation and further development of the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine in Mozambique.On 22 March 2022  the Directors approved the preliminary results for publication. While the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2021  from which the preliminary results have been extracted  are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union  these preliminary results do not contain sufficient information to comply with IFRS. The Directors expect to publish on 7 April 2022 the full financial statements that comply with IFRS as adopted by the European Union.The auditor  KPMG  has not yet issued their audit opinion on the financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021. The financial information included within this unaudited preliminary results statement for the year ended 31 December 2021 does not constitute the statutory financial statements of the Group within the meaning of section 293 of the Companies Act 2014. The Group financial information in this preliminary statement for the year ended 31 December 2021 is unaudited. A copy of the statutory financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021 will be annexed to the next annual return and filed with the Registrar of Companies.The Group financial information for the year ended 31 December 2020 included in this preliminary statement represents an abbreviated version of the Group‚Äôs financial statements for that year. The statutory financial statements for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020  upon which the auditor  KPMG  has issued an unqualified opinion  were annexed to the annual return of the Company and filed with the Registrar of Companies.None of the new and revised standards and interpretations which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021  have a material effect on the Group‚Äôs financial statements.Going concernThe Directors have evaluated the appropriateness of the going concern basis in preparing the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements (the ‚Äòperiod of assessment‚Äô). The evaluation is based on the Group‚Äôs cash flow forecast (‚Äúthe Group Forecast‚Äù).The Group Forecast has been prepared by management with best estimates of production  pricing and cost assumptions over the period of assessment. The Group recognises the principal risks which can impact on the outcome of the Group Forecast and have therefore applied sensitivity analysis to the assumptions to test the robustness of the cash flow forecast for changes in market prices  shipments  operating and capital cost assumptions.Changes in these assumptions affect the level of sales and profitability of the Group and the amount of capital required to deliver the projected production levels. Debt covenants are complied with and Group liquidity is maintained  although at lower levels  in each of these scenarios.Having assessed the principal risks facing the Group  together with the Group‚Äôs cash flow forecast  the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for the foreseeable future and can continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 20212.

An adjustment to the mine closure cost of $2.2 million (2020: $11.0 million) was made during the year as a result of an update in the discount rate as detailed in Note 16.At each reporting date  the Group assesses whether there is any indication that property  plant and equipment may be impaired. The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value  among other factors  when reviewing for indicators for impairment. As at 31 December 2021  the market capitalisation of the Group was below the book value of net assets which is considered an indicator of impairment of assets. The Group carried out an impairment review of property  plant and equipment as at 31 December 2021. As a result of the review and given the performance and outlook of the Group no impairment provision was recognised in the current financial year. No impairment was recognised in the prior financial year. Given the historic volatility in product pricing and sensitivities of the forecast to the discount rate and to a lesser extent operating costs  the impairment loss of $64.8 million which was recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in 2014 was not reversed.The cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing is the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine. The basis on which the Mine is assessed is its value-in-use. The cash flow forecast employed for the value-in-use computation is from a life of mine financial model. The recoverable amount obtained from the financial model represents the present value of the future discounted pre-tax  pre-finance cash flows discounted at 10.5% (2020: 10.0%).UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202110. Property  plant and equipment (continued)Key assumptions include the following:‚Ä¢ The discount rate is based on the Group‚Äôs weighted average cost of capital. This rate is a best estimate of the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Mine  taking into consideration country risk  currency risk and price risk. The factors making up the cost of equity  cost of debt and capital structure have changed from the prior year review (in particular the risk-free rate) resulting in a discount rate of 10.5% (2020: 10.0%). The Group‚Äôs estimation of the country risk premium included in the discount rate has remained unchanged from the prior year. The Group does not consider it appropriate to apply the full current country risk premium for Mozambique to the calculation of the Group‚Äôs weighted average cost of capital as it believes the specific circumstances which have resulted in the risk premium increase over the past number of years are not relevant to the specific circumstances of the Moma Mine. Hence  country risk premium applicable to the calculation of the cost of equity has been adjusted accordingly. Using a discount rate of 10.5%  the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying amount by $384.0 million (2020: $260.2 million). The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the recoverable amount. A 5.8% increase in the discount rate to 16.3% reduces the recoverable amount by $384 million. The increase in the recoverable amount from the prior year is a result of increased cash flows over the life of mine due to the factors detailed below partially offset by an increase in the discount rate from 10.0% to 10.5%.‚Ä¢ A mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi proved probable reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine life assumption of 40 years has not changed from the prior year review. Average annual production is approximately 1.2 million tonnes (2020: 1.2 million tonnes) of ilmenite and co-products zircon  rutile and concentrates over the life of the Mine and remains unchanged from the prior year review. This mine plan does not include investment in additional mining capacity. Certain minimum stocks of final and intermediate products are assumed to be maintained at period ends.‚Ä¢ Product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers  or where contracts are based on market prices or production is not currently contracted  prices are forecast by the Group taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise provided by TiPMC Solutions and management expectations including general inflation of 2% per annum. Forecast prices provided by TiPMC Solutions have been reviewed and found to be consistent with other external sources of information. Average forecast product sales prices have increased over the life of mine from the prior year end review as a result of revised forecast pricing. A 12% reduction in average sales prices over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $384.0 million.‚Ä¢ Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2022 taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and estimated forecast inflation for 2022. From 2023 onwards operating costs are escalated by 2% per annum. Average forecast operating costs have increased from the prior year end review as a result of increased production and inflation. A 14% increase in operating costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $384.0 million.‚Ä¢ Capital costs are based on a life of mine capital plan including inflation at 2% per annum from 2022. Average forecast capital costs have increased from the prior year end review based on updated sustaining and development capital plans required to maintain the existing plant over the life of mine. The forecast takes into account reasonable cost increases and therefore a sensitivity to this assumption which would give rise to a reduction in the recoverable amount has not been applied.11.

The finance documentation also contemplates a Mine Closure Guarantee Facility (provided by either the existing lenders or other finance providers) of up to $40 million  with the provider(s) of such a facility sharing in the common security package. The potential total aggregate principal amount of indebtedness secured under the finance documentation is therefore $190 million. The transaction costs for arrangement of the debt facilities amounted to $6.5 million.The Term Loan Facility has a final maturity date of 11 March 2025. Interest is at LIBOR plus 5.40% per annum. Repayment is in seven equal semi-annual instalments  beginning 11 March 2022.The Revolving Credit Facility has a final maturity date of 11 December 2022 extendable by up to 24 months at the lenders‚Äô discretion. Interest is at LIBOR plus 5.00% per annum.During the period the Group entered into a mine closure guarantee with Absa Bank Mo√ßambique SA for $11.4 million. This guarantee shares the security package with the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility on a pro rata and pari passu basis.The security package consists of (a) security over the Group‚Äôs bank accounts (subject to certain exceptions)  (b) pledges of the shares of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited and Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (the ‚ÄúProject Companies‚Äù)  (c) security over intercompany loans and (d) Mozambican law security interests over certain rights and agreements with Mozambican authorities  including over the Implementation Agreement  the Mineral Licensing Contract and the Mining Licence.The carrying amount of the secured bank accounts of the Group was $66.9 million as at 31 December 2021 (2020:$87.0 million). The shares of the Project Companies and intercompany loans are not included in the consolidated statement of financial position as they are eliminated on consolidation. They therefore do not have a carrying amount but  upon enforcement of the pledges on behalf of the lender group  the shares in the Project Companies would cease to be owned or controlled by the Group. The secured rights and agreements do not have a carrying amount. They are  however  necessary for the Project Companies to operate the Mine in Mozambique.The finance documents contain a number of representations  covenants and events of default on customary terms  the breach of which could lead to the secured parties under the finance documentation accelerating the outstanding loans and taking other enforcement steps  such as the enforcement of some or all of the security interests  which could lead  in extremis  with the Group losing its interest in the Mine. The most salient of the relevant terms that could lead to acceleration of the loans and/or enforcement of security are the financial covenants.At 31 December 2021 total debt of $148.1 million (2020: $145.8 million) was recognised by the Group  being the drawdown of $150.0 million before unamortised transaction costs of $3.8 million (2020: $5.4 million) plus interest amortised of $2.0 million (2020: $1.2 million).UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202115.

A corresponding amount equal to the provision is recognised as part of property  plant and equipment. The costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan  are subject to regular review and are estimated based on the net present value of estimated future cost. Mine closure costs are a normal consequence of mining  and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the life of the Mine. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost and $0.7 million (2020: $0.7 million) has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the financial year.The main assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated future costs include:‚Ä¢ a discount rate of 2.9% (2020: 2.0%);‚Ä¢ an inflation rate of 2% (2020: 2%);‚Ä¢ an estimated life of mine of 40 years (2020: 40 years). It is assumed that all licences and permits required to operate will be renewed or extended during the life of mine; and‚Ä¢ an estimated closure cost of $34.1 million (2020: $34.1 million) and an estimated post-closure monitoring provision of $3.9 million (2020: $3.9 million).The life of mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources as set out in the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resources table. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine closure provision has decreased by $1.0 million to reflect a change in the discount rate from 2.0% to 2.9%.The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the Mine closure provision. The discount rate increased to 2.9% (2020: 2.0%) as a result of movements in the US Treasury rates. Thirty-year US Treasury yields are the longest period for which yields are quoted. A forty-year rate to align with the estimated life of mine has been calculated by taking the average of the increase in yield from ten to twenty years and the increase in yield from twenty to thirty years and adding this average to the thirty-year treasury rate to arrive at an estimated extrapolated rate for forty years. This discount rate is deemed to provide the best estimate of the current market assessment of risk-free time value of the money. Risks specific to the liability are included in the cost estimate. A reasonable possible increase of 1% in the estimated discount rate results in the Mine closure provision decreasing to $24.0 million. A 1% decrease in the estimated discount rate results in the Mine closure provision increasing to $54.0 million.The Mine rehabilitation provision represents the Directors‚Äô best estimate of the Company‚Äôs liability for rehabilitating areas disturbed by mining activities. Rehabilitation costs are recognised based on the area disturbed and estimated cost of rehabilitation per hectare which is reviewed regularly against actual rehabilitation cost per hectare. Actual rehabilitation expenditure is incurred approximately twelve months after the area has been disturbed. During the financial year there was a release of $0.4 million (2020: $0.8 million) to reflect the actual mine rehabilitation costs incurred  and an addition to the provision of $0.4 million (2020: $1.4 million) for areas newly disturbed.Other provisions comprise an amount of $2.3 million (2020: $nil million) in relation to a potential indirect tax liability. As the matter is still outstanding it is possible that on conclusion the final outcome may differ from management‚Äôs estimate.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117.

The table does not include fair value information for other receivables  prepayments  trade payables and accruals as these are not measured at fair value as the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Trade receivables which are factored through the Absa Bank facility or letters of credit which are always confirmed and discounted through the Barclays Bank facility are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Trade receivables or letters or credit where it is not known at initial recognition if they will be factored are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Group derecognises the original receivable to which the arrangement applies when payment is received from the bank as the terms of the arrangement are non-recourse. The payment to the bank by the Group‚Äôs customers are considered non-cash transactions. Trade receivables not measured at fair value are receivables whose payment is received under the sale contract credit terms.The valuation technique used in measuring Level 2 fair values is discounted cash flows which considers the expected receipts or payments discounted using adjusted market discount rates or where these rates are not available estimated discount rates. The Group has exposure to credit risk  liquidity risk and market risk arising from financial instruments.Risk management frameworkThe Board is ultimately responsible for risk management within the Group. It has delegated responsibility for the monitoring of the effectiveness of the Group‚Äôs risk management and internal control systems to the Audit & Risk Committee. The Board and Audit & Risk Committee receive reports from executive management on the key risks to the business and the steps being taken to mitigate such risks. The Audit & Risk Committee is assisted in its role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures  the results of which are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee.Credit RiskCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet it contractual obligations  and arises principally from the Group‚Äôs trade receivables from customers. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.Trade receivablesThe Group‚Äôs exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual circumstances of each customer. The Group also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base  including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate. Before entering into sales contracts with new customers  the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer‚Äôs credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits attributed to customers are reviewed regularly during the year.The Group‚Äôs customers have been transacting with the Group for a significant number of years  and no customers‚Äô balances have been written off or are credit-impaired at the financial year end. In monitoring customer credit risk  customers are reviewed individually and the Group has not identified any factors which would merit reducing exposure to any particular customer. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade receivables.At 31 December 2021  $41.3 million (2020: $7.2 million) is due from the Group‚Äôs three largest customers.

For deposits in excess of $50 million the Group requires that the institution has an A- (S&P)/A3 (Moody‚Äôs) long-term rating. For deposits in excess of $15 million  the Group requires that the institution has a BB- (S&P)/Ba3 (Moody‚Äôs) long-term rating.At 31 December 2021 and 2020 cash was deposited with the following banks:2021 2020 Long-term credit rating Long-term credit rating $ million S&P Moody‚Äôs $ million S&P Moody‚Äôs Barclays Bank plc 60.8 A Positive A-1 Stable 60.0 A Negative A-1 Stable FirstRand Bank Limited 5.1 BBB - Stable Ba2 Negative 15.0 BBB- Stable Ba2 Negative Nedbank Limited - BB- Stable Ba2 Negative 10.0 BB- Stable Ba2 Negative HSBC Bank plc 0.8 A+ Stable A1 Stable 1.7 A+ Stable A1 Stable Absa Bank Limited 2.0 BBB- Stable Ba2 Negative - BBB- Stable Ba2 NegativeLiquidity riskLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled in cash payments. The Group‚Äôs objective when managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due.The Group monitors mine payment forecasts  both operating and capital  which assist it in monitoring cash flow requirements and optimising its cash return on investments. The Group aims to maintain the level of its cash and cash equivalents at an amount in excess of expected cash outflows on financial liabilities. The Group monitors the level of expected cash inflows on trade receivables together with expected cash outflows on trade and other payables.The Group has a trade finance facility with Absa Bank for three of the Group‚Äôs largest customers. In accordance with this facility the bank purchases 80% of the receivable without recourse and so the bank takes on the credit risk. The facility is $30 million with limits on the maximum amount that can be factored for each of the customers named in the facility. During the period no trade receivables were factored under this agreement. At the year end  trade receivables amounting to $14.5 million (2020: $8.9 million) may be factored under this facility and are therefore included in trade receivables as at 31 December 2021. The cost of this facility for the period  which amounted to $0.2 million (2020: $0.2 million)  is included in finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income and in net cash from operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117. Financial Instruments (continued)The Group has a trade facility with Barclays Bank for customers which it sells to under letter of credit terms. Under this facility  Barclays Bank confirms the letter of credit from the issuing bank and therefore takes the credit risk that the issuing bank will not pay. Barclays Bank can also discount these letters of credit thereby providing early payment of receivables to the Group. There is no limit under the Barclays Bank facility. During the period trade receivables of $224.4 million (2020: $88.3 million) were discounted under this facility. At the year-end there were $37.1 million (2020: $6.2 million) which may be discounted under this facility. The cost of this facility for the period  which amounted to $0.1 million (2020: $0.1 million)  is included in finance costs in the condensed statement of comprehensive income and in net cash from operating activities in the condensed statement of consolidated cash flows.The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group‚Äôs financial liabilities at 31 December 2021 based on the gross contractual undiscounted payments:Financial liabilities Total$‚Äô000 Less thanone year$‚Äô000 Between2 and 5 years$‚Äô000 More than5 years$‚Äô000 Bank loans 164 331 79 136 85 195 - Lease liabilities 2 684 1 207 1 317 160 Trade & other payables 32 768 32 768 - - 199 783 113 111 86 512 160The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group‚Äôs financial liabilities at 31 December 2020 based on the gross contractual undiscounted payments:Financial liabilities Total$‚Äô000 Less thanone year$‚Äô000 Between2 and 5 years$‚Äô000 More than5 years$‚Äô000 Bank loans 171 479 7 149 164 330 - Lease liabilities 4 044 1 359 2 251 434 Trade & other payables 50 122 50 122 ‚Äì ‚Äì 225 645 58 630 166 581 434As disclosed in Note 15 the Group has bank loans that contain loan covenants. A future breach of covenant may require the Group to repay the loan earlier than indicated in the above table. Under the loan agreement  the covenants are monitored on a regular basis by Group finance and regularly reported to management and the lenders to ensure compliance with the agreement.Risk ConcentrationConcentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities  or activities in the same geographical region  or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic  political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group‚Äôs performance to developments affecting a particular industry.The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables and contract assets as low  as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets. Details of concentration of revenue are included in Note 2.Market riskMarket risk is risk that changes in market prices for foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Group‚Äôs income statement. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures while optimising returns.Currency riskThe Group is exposed to transactional foreign currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales  purchases  receivables and borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of Group companies. The functional currencies of all Group are US Dollars. The presentational currency of the Group is US Dollars. Sales and bank loans are denominated in US Dollars which significantly reduces the exposure of the Group to foreign currency risk. Payables transactions are denominated in Mozambican Metical  South African Rand  Euro  Sterling  Australian Dollar and Renminbi.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117. Financial Instruments (continued)The Group‚Äôs risk management policy is to match the estimated foreign currency exposure in respect of forecast purchases over the following three to six months at any point in time to the extent that funds are available to do so.Exposure to currency riskThe Group‚Äôs exposure to currency risk as at 31 December 2021 is as follows.US Dollar$‚Äô000 Mozambican Metical$‚Äô000 South African Rand$‚Äô000 Euro$‚Äô000 Sterling$‚Äô000 Australian Dollar$‚Äô000 Renminbi$‚Äô000 Trade and other receivables 69 408 2 717 1 275 928 55 364 - Cash and cash equivalents 64 837 1 030 2 337 479 338 6 36 Bank loans (151 914) - - - - - - Leases (650) - - (1 528) - - - Trade & other payables (14 283) (14 082) (1 905) (2 395) (35) (68) - Net exposure (32 602) (10 335) 1 707 (2 516) 358 302 36The Group‚Äôs exposure to currency risk as at 31 December 2020 is as follows.US Dollar$‚Äô000 Mozambican Metical$‚Äô000 South African Rand$‚Äô000 Euro$‚Äô000 Sterling$‚Äô000 Australian Dollar$‚Äô000 Renminbi$‚Äô000 Trade and other receivables 28 059 ‚Äì 444 740 38 634 ‚Äì Cash and cash equivalents 81 969 130 4 406 441 256 21 21 Bank loans (151 217) ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì Leases (2 217) ‚Äì ‚Äì (1 815) ‚Äì ‚Äì ‚Äì Trade & other payables (31 185) (8 371) (8 186) (712) (62) (1 606) ‚Äì Net exposure (74 591) (8 241) (3 336) (1 346) 232 (951) 21Sensitivity analysisA reasonably possible strengthening or weakening of the Mozambique Metical  South African Rand  Euro  Sterling  Australian Dollar and Renminbi by 1% against US Dollar would have affected profit or loss by the amounts shown below.

Financial Instruments (continued)Interest rate riskThe loan facilities are arranged at variable rates and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Variable rates are based on six-month LIBOR. The borrowing rate at financial year end was 5.8% (2020: 5.8%). The interest rate profile of the Group‚Äôs loan balances at the financial year end was as follows:2021$‚Äô000 2020$‚Äô000 Variable rate debt 151 914 151 217Under the assumption that all other variables remain constant  a reasonable possible change of 1% in the six-month LIBOR rate results in a $1.5 million (2020: $1.5 million) change in finance costs for the financial year.The above sensitivity analyses are estimates of the impact of market risks assuming the specified change occurs. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global financial markets  which may cause fluctuations in interest rates to vary from the assumptions made above and therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events.Interest rate benchmark reformA fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally  including the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as ‚ÄúIBOR reform‚Äù). The group has exposure to IBORs on its financial instruments that will be reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives. The Group‚Äôs main IBOR exposure at the reporting date is US LIBOR  which is administered by ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA). The alternative reference rate for US LIBOR is the US Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).On 5 March 2021  IBA stated that it will cease the publication of (i) the overnight and 1  3  6 and 12 months USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on Friday  June 30  2023 and (ii) all other LIBOR settings  including the 1 week and 2 months USD LIBOR settings  immediately following the LIBOR publication on Friday  December 31  2021. IBA stated that it will not have access to input data necessary to calculate LIBOR settings on a representative basis after those dates. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a separate announcement confirming that IBA had notified the FCA of its intent to cease providing all LIBOR settings. The FCA confirmed that all 35 LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative as of the dates set out by IBA.The Group anticipates that IBOR reform will impact its operational and risk management processes. The main risk to which the Group is exposed as a result of IBOR reform is in the amendment to the Senior Facility Agreement with negotiation with the lender group to reflect the migration from USD LIBOR to SOFR  updating contractual terms and revising operational controls related to the migration. Financial risk is predominantly limited to interest rate risk.The Audit & Risk Committee monitors while the executive and senior management manages the migration to alternative rates. Such management includes evaluation of the extent to which contracts reference IBOR  whether such contracts will need to be amended as a result of IBOR reform and how to manage communication about IBOR reform to counterparties.The Group plans to amend contractual terms for purposes of migrating from USD LIBOR to SOFR prior to the discontinuance of the administration and publication of the relevant LIBOR rates by IBA.The carrying amount of financial liabilities with unreformed contracts at 31 December 2021 was $148.1 million (31 December 2020: $145.8 million).18. Contingent liabilitiesThe Group  like other businesses operating in Mozambique  is subject to tax audits by the Mozambican Tax Authorities. These audits may review a range of matters including corporate income tax  indirect taxes and transaction related issues  and can take a number of years to complete. The Mozambican Tax Authority conducted an audit of the tax obligations of the Branch in relation to the years 2015 to 2017. The Group is liaising with the Tax Authority to address matters raised during the audit. It is not possible to estimate with certainty the timing of any future resolution or possible outcomes.A provision of $2.3 million (2020: $nil) is included in the financial statements in relation to a potential indirect tax liability. As the matter is still outstanding it is possible that on conclusion the outcome may differ from management‚Äôs estimates. Other tax matters raised during the audit are likewise still outstanding. No provision has been made in these financial statements in relation to the other tax matters as the Group does not consider that there is any material future probable loss.GLOSSARY ‚Äì ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURESCertain financial measures set out in the 2021 Preliminary Results are not defined under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs)  but represent additional measures used by the Board to assess performance and for reporting both internally and to shareholders and other external users.

Our financial results were driven by record production volumes and higher average prices received for our products  with revenues up 87% and EBITDA up 182%. Following our lowest ever Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate in 2021  we have continued to achieve new safety milestones  passing eight million hours without a Lost Time Injury in early March 2022. Production in Q1 2022 has been impacted by poor weather conditions but we remain on track to achieve our 2022 guidance.We are pleased to be publishing our first Climate Strategy Report in the coming weeks  along with our second Sustainability Report. In addition to setting a short-term carbon reduction target  the Board has also approved our ambition to be Net Zero by 2040.The positive momentum we saw in all our product markets in 2021 has continued into 2022. Global demand for ilmenite  our primary product  continues to exceed supply and our production volumes are being well received by the market.In light of this continuing market strength and our record performance  the Board is recommending a 2021 dividend of USc32.71 per share  up from USc10.00 per share in 2020. This is in line with our 2021 dividend target payout of 25% of profit after tax and follows the $81.6 million share buy-back we completed in December as part of our strategy to deliver compelling shareholder returns.‚Äù2021 overviewFinancialRecommended 2021 dividend of $32.1 million or USc32.71 per share (2020: USc10.00)  up 227% on 2020  comprising an interim dividend of USc7.29 per share (paid in October 2021) and a final dividend of USc25.42 per share (expected to be paid in June 2022)87% increase in revenue to $455.9 million in 2021 (2020: $243.7 million)  driven by record shipments and a 21% increase in the average price received for Kenmare‚Äôs products20% increase in total cash operating costs to $189.7 million (2020: $158.0 million) as a result of a 46% increase in finished product production  plus increased costs relating to repairs and maintenance  Heavy Mineral Concentrate (‚ÄúHMC‚Äù) haulage from the Pilivili operations  and COVID-19 management18% decrease in cash operating costs per tonne to $154 per tonne (2020: $188 per tonne)  benefitting from increased product volumes. 26% decrease in net ilmenite unit costs to $93 per tonne (2020: $125 per tonne)  due to increased ilmenite production and higher co-product revenues182% increase in EBITDA to $216.1 million (2020: $76.7 million)  due to increased production  stronger product pricing and lower unit costs  representing a 51% EBITDA margin (2020: 33%)669% increase in profit after tax to $128.5 million (2020: $16.7 million) due to higher EBITDA  partially offset by increased depreciation chargesNet debt position of $82.8 million at year-end 2021  compared to $64.0 million at year-end 2020  following the completion of the $81.6 million share buy-backStory continuesOperationalRecord annual HMC production of 1 555 900 tonnes  representing a 30% increase compared to 2020 (1 201 100 tonnes)  benefitting from increased tonnes mined and higher ore grades48% increase in ilmenite production to 1 119 400 tonnes (2020: 756 000 tonnes) benefitting from increased HMC processed51% increase in shipments of finished products to 1 285 300 tonnes (2020: 853 100 tonnes)  reflecting increased production and benefitting from improved transshipment capacityCommissioning commenced of Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply (‚ÄúRUPS‚Äù)  which is expected to deliver benefits in terms of power stability  operating cost reductions  and lower carbon emissions through reduced usage of diesel generatorsKenmare is on track to achieve 2022 guidance  although production in Q1 2022 is expected to be below the anticipated annual run rate due to poor weather conditions during the quarterDividend timetableThe Company confirms the dates for the 2021 final dividend are as follows:Ex-dividend date 28 April 2022 Record date 29 April 2022 Currency election date 4 May 2022 at noon AGM date for shareholder approval 26 May 2022 Payment date 1 June 2022Irish Dividend Withholding Tax (25%) must be deducted from dividends paid by the Company  unless a shareholder is entitled to an exemption and has submitted a properly completed exemption form to the Company‚Äôs Registrar.Analyst and investor briefing and conference callKenmare will host a briefing and a conference call for analysts  institutional investors  and media today at 9:00am UK time.

Listed on the London Stock Exchange and the Euronext Dublin  Kenmare operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine in Mozambique. Moma‚Äôs production accounts for approximately 8% of global titanium feedstocks and the Group supplies to customers in more than 15 countries. Kenmare produces raw materials that are ultimately consumed in everyday ‚Äúquality-of life‚Äù items such as paints  plastics and ceramic tiles.All monetary amounts refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated.Forward Looking StatementsThis announcement contains some forward-looking statements that represent Kenmare's expectations for its business  based on current expectations about future events  which by their nature involve risks and uncertainties. Kenmare believes that its expectations and assumptions with respect to these forward-looking statements are reasonable. However  because they involve risk and uncertainty  which are in some cases beyond Kenmare's control  actual results or performance may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking information.CHAIRMAN‚ÄôS STATEMENTDear shareholders 2021 was the first full year of operations at the high grade Pilivili ore zone  in addition to our original Namalope area. Significant increases in production and shipments were achieved  while our product markets exhibited strong demand throughout the year. As a result  revenue increased by 87% to $455.9 million  and profit after tax by 669% to $128.5 million  vindicating our strategy of investing in additional production capacity in anticipation of a tight market.As we began 2021  while we had largely completed the last of our three growth projects  operational effectiveness continued to be impacted by COVID-19. Our vaccination  testing  and quarantine protocols mitigated the worst effects of the virus  however  and we also achieved a truly outstanding safety performance. Nevertheless  we remain vigilant as the pandemic continues to evolve. The health and safety of our colleagues and host communities remain our highest priorities.Shareholder returnsKenmare committed to increase shareholder returns after the completion of the major capital projects executed during 2018-2020. Accordingly  we have recommended a dividend payout of 25% of profit after tax for 2021  higher than the 20% minimum policy. Subject to shareholder approval  our 2021 full year dividend will be USc32.71  an increase of 227% compared to 2020.Despite robust operational and financial performance  our share price during 2021 did not fully reflect Kenmare‚Äôs intrinsic value  and the Board concluded that a share buy-back was therefore a prudent use of capital. A share buy-back was completed in December 2021  returning $81.6 million to eligible shareholders while reducing the number of shares in issue by 13.5%.I am pleased that Kenmare has been able to return almost $100 million in aggregate to shareholders during 2021  through dividends and the share buy-back  whilst also maintaining a robust balance sheet.At the 2022 Annual General Meeting (‚ÄúAGM‚Äù) Kenmare will ask shareholders to approve resolutions to implement an Odd-lot Offer at some point during the next 18 months. This will enable the Company to purchase  at a 5% premium  the shares held by eligible certificated shareholders who hold fewer than 200 shares in the Company. This will help small shareholders who would otherwise have difficulty selling their holdings due to disproportionate trading costs. Further details of the Odd-lot Offer scheme will be included in the Notice of AGM to be distributed to shareholders in due course.Outlook and strategyIn 2021 we benefitted from strong product markets for all our products and this positive momentum has continued into 2022. Our increased production has been well absorbed by our markets and demand for Kenmare ilmenite remains strong. However  the tragic conflict in Ukraine has created significant uncertainties in global trade routes and the wider economy. It is too soon to speculate on the overall effects on our business  but Ukraine is a significant supplier of titanium feedstocks  while lower global growth could reduce demand for our products.In 2025  Wet Concentrator Plant (‚ÄúWCP‚Äù) A will move to the Nataka ore zone. Field tests of mining methods and planning studies are making good progress and a Pre-Feasibility Study for the move is expected to be completed later in 2022. This will include details of the mining method  relocation  provision of water and power  an HMC pumping system  and plans for tailings disposal.Our overall strategy is to operate responsibly to deliver long-life low-cost production  allocating capital efficiently  including towards developing accretive growth opportunities. The Kenmare team is committed to achieving these strategic goals  while also becoming a first quartile producer on the industry revenue to cost curve. Achievement of these long-term strategic goals will support further increases in free cash flow and higher dividends  as well as improving resilience in case of potential cyclical commodity market downturns.SustainabilityKenmare has always placed sustainability at the heart of its business practices  working responsibly to achieve ambitious environment  social  and governance goals. In 2021  we published our inaugural Sustainability Report  which set out guiding principles  together with some examples of our approach to responsible environmental management  and constructive community and other stakeholder relations. We will publish our second Sustainability Report in the coming weeks  including commentary on our performance against public sustainability targets for the first time.The Board has ratified an inaugural Climate Policy and we will shortly publish our first Climate Strategy Report  aligned with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (‚ÄúTCFD‚Äù).During 2021 we launched a Portuguese version of our corporate website to ensure all information is easily accessible for Mozambicans. For the second consecutive year  we were pleased to be named as the most transparent extractive industry company in Mozambique by the Centre for Public Integrity‚Äôs Extractive Industry Transparency Index.Board developmentIn 2021  an external performance evaluation of the Board and all of its Committees was conducted by Board Excellence  in accordance with the provisions of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. I am pleased to report that the evaluation concluded that Kenmare‚Äôs Board operates efficiently  ‚Äúwith a deep commitment to do the right thing and excel on behalf of shareholders  employees and stakeholders.‚Äù A summary of outcomes and actions from the evaluation will be published in our 2021 Annual Report.A number of important changes in the composition of the Board took place during the year  and further changes will occur in 2022 when I plan to retire  after nine years on Kenmare‚Äôs Board  almost eight of them as Chairman.Gabriel Smith  Tim Keating  and Peter Bacchus stepped down and I would like to thank them sincerely for their important contributions to Kenmare‚Äôs success in recent years. Graham Martin has assumed the role of Senior Independent Director following Peter‚Äôs departure.In March 2021  we were pleased to welcome Sameer Oundhakar to replace Tim as the representative Director of our largest shareholder  African Acquisition S.√†.r.l.  an investment vehicle owned by the Oman Investment Authority.In October 2021  we announced that Mette Dobel had agreed to join the Board as an independent Non-Executive Director effective 1 January 2022. Her significant leadership experience both as a senior executive and director of FLSmidth A/S  at the cutting edge of mining technology and automation  will be invaluable as we strive to achieve further operational efficiencies and build a positive social and environmental legacy.In December 2021  Andrew Webb joined the Board as an independent Non-Executive Director and Chair Designate. Andrew brings extensive natural resources and financial advisory experience  having previously served as a Managing Director at Rothschild & Co in the Global Advisory team  where he worked for 25 years. I have enjoyed working with him through the transition period and am confident that Andrew‚Äôs skills and enormous mining industry and finance experience position him well to play a key role in driving the future success of the business.I plan to step down following the 2022 AGM and Andrew will become Chairman. I look forward with confidence to Andrew and the rest of the Board taking Kenmare to even higher levels of achievement in future yearsAfter these changes  the composition of the Board will provide a strong and diverse mix of talents  skills and experience  well suited to the business and challenges ahead  while achieving our gender diversity target with female Directors representing one third of the Board.AcknowledgementsI would like to end my final statement as Chairman by thanking all of Kenmare‚Äôs key stakeholders for their support and commitment to the Company and the Board  not only during the unprecedented challenges we have all experienced during the past two years of COVID-19 disruption  but also throughout my nine-year tenure. I look back on the Company‚Äôs achievements with a sense of pride and I am pleased to be leaving Kenmare in the strongest position in its history.It has been a privilege to work with my fellow Board members  and particularly Michael Carvill who founded the company and has led it selflessly and courageously for more than 20 years. Kenmare has an outstanding management team and a remarkable workforce. I feel privileged to have worked with such a talented group and I will follow the Company‚Äôs continued progress with keen interest.With capacity to deliver 1.2 million tonnes per annum (‚ÄúMtpa‚Äù) of ilmenite on a sustainable basis  buoyant product markets  and a first class team  I am confident that Kenmare will continue to generate value for all stakeholders in 2022 and beyond.Steven McTiernanChairmanMANAGING DIRECTOR‚ÄôS STATEMENTKenmare delivered a record year for safety  production  and shipments in 2021. The Company demonstrated its resilience and agility  protecting our employees and host communities against a second year of heightened risk due to COVID-19. I would like to thank all our team for their hard work and dedication  particularly during H1 2021 when we faced huge challenges as a result of the virus.Our record operational performance in 2021 was supported by strong market conditions for all our products. We increased production of ilmenite  our main product  by almost 50% compared to 2020 and this was well received by the product market  with quarter-on-quarter price increases. This enabled us to generate EBITDA of $216.1 million  up 182% on 2020  and gave us the confidence to return almost $100 million to shareholders during the year  increasing our 2021 dividend payout to 25% of profit after tax  above the 20% minimum policy  and completing a share buy-back of 13.5% of our issued share capital.We are targeting production of 1.2 Mtpa of ilmenite  plus co-products  on a sustainable basis and reduced unit costs. We remain focused on delivering strong free cash flow and shareholder returns  while continuing to raise the standards to which we hold ourselves in terms of environment  social  and governance performance. We believe we are achieving our purpose of responsibly meeting global demand for quality-of-life minerals.SafetyIt is testimony to our strong safety culture that Kenmare reported its best ever safety performance in 2021. This achievement is particularly significant given the additional pressure put on our mining operations by COVID-19  which had the potential to increase safety risks.We delivered our lowest ever Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate of 0.03 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 31 December 2021  which also represented more than six million hours worked without a Lost Time Injury (‚ÄúLTI‚Äù) and an 88% reduction compared to 2020. Our Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (‚ÄúTRIFR‚Äù) relative to the 2020 International Council on Mining and Metals TRIFR was in the top quintile. On 6 January 2022 we achieved one year without a LTI and we are working hard to maintain this record performance. We also retained our five-star NOSA safety accreditation for the sixth consecutive year.SustainabilityOur commitment to working responsibly is enshrined in Kenmare‚Äôs purpose and we are particularly focused on protecting our employees and our host communities in Mozambique. In mid-2021 we began vaccinating our workforce against COVID-19 and by the end of the year  96% had been double vaccinated. We also donated 12 000 vaccines to local communities.Through the Kenmare Moma Development Association (‚ÄúKMAD‚Äù)  we completed the construction of a new health centre for the communities living near our Pilivili operations and constructed seven school blocks in the Namalope and Pilivili areas. By the end of the year  over 1 000 farmers were registered in our Conservation Agriculture programme to improve crop yields and 75 small businesses were benefitting from KMAD support.We recognise the role and responsibility all businesses must take in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and as such  in December 2021  the Board approved Kenmare‚Äôs Climate Policy. We will publish our first Climate Strategy Report in the coming weeks  which follows recommendations made by the TCFD. We have an ambition of becoming Net Zero (Scope 1 and 2) by 2040  with a short-term carbon emissions reduction target of 12% by 2024  contingent on receiving a reliable power supply from the Mozambican state power provider  Electricidade de Mo√ßambique.In early 2021 we approved the development of a RUPS. It is expected to deliver increased power stability for the Mineral Separation Plant  an important risk mitigation measure  and is anticipated to be the main contributor towards our reduced emissions through lower diesel consumption. At an estimated cost of $18 million  the RUPS is a Net Present Value positive project  using conservative assumptions  and commissioning commenced in Q1 2022.We also continued to invest in our people. The Moma workforce received 21 100 hours of training during the year as we believe that providing continuous development opportunities is key to attracting and retaining the best people and maintaining our strong safety culture. At the end of 2021  we had 1 551 employees at the Moma Mine and over 97% of them were Mozambican  with 70% from the local district or province. 12.5% of our Moma employees were women  compared with 10.6% in 2020  reflecting our successful initiatives to encourage women to join and remain in our workforce.Operational performance2021 was a record year for production and the first time we have produced more than one million tonnes of ilmenite. Total production of finished products was up 46% compared to 2020  driven by the higher ore grades mined in Pilivili by WCP B following its relocation in Q3 2020. We achieved Moma‚Äôs nameplate capacity of 1.2 Mtpa ilmenite production in Q3 2021  which set a new quarterly production record  and demonstrated our ability to produce at our targeted rate. We are now focused on achieving this run rate on a consistent basis. 2021 was also a record year for shipments  which were up 51% compared to 2020.We achieved this compelling performance despite the impact of COVID-19 on our operations  particularly in H1 2021. Ilmenite production was below the midpoint of guidance due to the challenges of operating with a reduced workforce  including senior management  and power supply disruptions in Q4. Operating costs per tonne were 3% above the top end of our guidance range due mainly to additional costs associated with repairs and maintenance  HMC haulage  and COVID-19 management. In 2022  we will look to progress towards becoming a first quartile producer on the industry revenue to cost curve.Product marketKenmare is the world‚Äôs largest supplier of ilmenite and the Moma Mine is one of the largest titanium minerals deposits globally. The titanium feedstocks we produce are principally used to make pigment  which is essential for imparting whiteness and opacity in the production of paints  paper  plastic  and a range of other items we use in our everyday lives.2021 was a strong year for all of Kenmare‚Äôs product markets  with increased volumes sold at a 21% higher average price than in 2020. Robust demand for titanium feedstocks  like ilmenite  was driven primarily by global pigment production reaching a record high and the titanium metal market improving. Following softer demand in 2020  the market for zircon  our main co-product  stabilised in Q1 2021 and then saw price increases throughout the remainder of 2021. The positive pricing momentum for all our products has continued into 2022  with global inventories remaining low.OutlookAlthough the pandemic continued to create huge challenges in 2021  I believe we have built a stronger business. The past two years have shown us what we are all capable of  particularly when we pull together and look out for each other. I would like to thank all our stakeholders  particularly those in Mozambique  for their invaluable support.I would also like to thank Steven McTiernan for his outstanding contribution to Kenmare. He led the Company as Chairman during a period of significant change  providing constructive challenge  wise counsel  and strong support. I look forward to working with Andrew Webb and ensuring we continue to deliver positive returns and create value for all our stakeholders.As we look to the months and years ahead  we know we have a lot of hard work ahead of us to live up to our strategy of operating responsibly  delivering long-life  low-cost production  and allocating capital efficiently  including developing accretive growth opportunities. However  we can be proud that our operations are safe and performing well  our balance sheet is strong  our product markets are tight  and our employees have proven they can succeed even in the most difficult conditions.Michael CarvillManaging DirectorUNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOMEFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2021Notes 2021$‚Äô000 2020$‚Äô000 Revenue 2 455 944 243 746 Cost of sales 4 (244 986) (179 103) Gross profit 210 958 64 643 Other operating costs 5 (57 977) (30 250) Operating profit 152 981 34 393 Finance income 6 265 642 Finance costs 7 (12 053) (11 301) Foreign exchange loss (3 897) (980) Profit before tax 137 296 22 754 Income tax expense 8 (8 770) (6 015) Profit for the financial year and total comprehensive income for the financial year 128 526 16 739 Attributable to equity holders 128 526 16 739 $ per share $ per share Profit per share: Basic 9 1.18 0.15 Profit per share: Diluted 9 1.16 0.15The accompanying notes form part of these financial statements.UNAUDITED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITIONAS AT 31 DECEMBER 2021Notes 2021$‚Äô000 2020$‚Äô000 Assets Non-current assets Property  plant and equipment 10 954 558 958 508 Right of use assets 11 2 136 3 220 Deferred tax asset -

A copy of the statutory financial statements in respect of the year ended 31 December 2021 will be annexed to the next annual return and filed with the Registrar of Companies.The Group financial information for the year ended 31 December 2020 included in this preliminary statement represents an abbreviated version of the Group‚Äôs financial statements for that year. The statutory financial statements for the Group for the year ended 31 December 2020  upon which the auditor  KPMG  has issued an unqualified opinion  were annexed to the annual return of the Company and filed with the Registrar of Companies.None of the new and revised standards and interpretations which are effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2021  have a material effect on the Group‚Äôs financial statements.Going concernThe Directors have evaluated the appropriateness of the going concern basis in preparing the 2021 Consolidated Financial Statements for a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of these financial statements (the ‚Äòperiod of assessment‚Äô). The evaluation is based on the Group‚Äôs cash flow forecast (‚Äúthe Group Forecast‚Äù).The Group Forecast has been prepared by management with best estimates of production  pricing and cost assumptions over the period of assessment. The Group recognises the principal risks which can impact on the outcome of the Group Forecast and have therefore applied sensitivity analysis to the assumptions to test the robustness of the cash flow forecast for changes in market prices  shipments  operating and capital cost assumptions.Changes in these assumptions affect the level of sales and profitability of the Group and the amount of capital required to deliver the projected production levels. Debt covenants are complied with and Group liquidity is maintained  although at lower levels  in each of these scenarios.Having assessed the principal risks facing the Group  together with the Group‚Äôs cash flow forecast  the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources for the foreseeable future and can continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 20212.

An adjustment to the mine closure cost of $2.2 million (2020: $11.0 million) was made during the year as a result of an update in the discount rate as detailed in Note 16.At each reporting date  the Group assesses whether there is any indication that property  plant and equipment may be impaired. The Group considers the relationship between its market capitalisation and its book value  among other factors  when reviewing for indicators for impairment. As at 31 December 2021  the market capitalisation of the Group was below the book value of net assets which is considered an indicator of impairment of assets. The Group carried out an impairment review of property  plant and equipment as at 31 December 2021. As a result of the review and given the performance and outlook of the Group no impairment provision was recognised in the current financial year. No impairment was recognised in the prior financial year. Given the historic volatility in product pricing and sensitivities of the forecast to the discount rate and to a lesser extent operating costs  the impairment loss of $64.8 million which was recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in 2014 was not reversed.The cash-generating unit for the purpose of impairment testing is the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine. The basis on which the Mine is assessed is its value-in-use. The cash flow forecast employed for the value-in-use computation is from a life of mine financial model. The recoverable amount obtained from the financial model represents the present value of the future discounted pre-tax  pre-finance cash flows discounted at 10.5% (2020: 10.0%).UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202110. Property  plant and equipment (continued)Key assumptions include the following:‚Ä¢ The discount rate is based on the Group‚Äôs weighted average cost of capital. This rate is a best estimate of the current market assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the Mine  taking into consideration country risk  currency risk and price risk. The factors making up the cost of equity  cost of debt and capital structure have changed from the prior year review (in particular the risk-free rate) resulting in a discount rate of 10.5% (2020: 10.0%). The Group‚Äôs estimation of the country risk premium included in the discount rate has remained unchanged from the prior year. The Group does not consider it appropriate to apply the full current country risk premium for Mozambique to the calculation of the Group‚Äôs weighted average cost of capital as it believes the specific circumstances which have resulted in the risk premium increase over the past number of years are not relevant to the specific circumstances of the Moma Mine. Hence  country risk premium applicable to the calculation of the cost of equity has been adjusted accordingly. Using a discount rate of 10.5%  the recoverable amount is greater than the carrying amount by $384.0 million (2020: $260.2 million). The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the recoverable amount. A 5.8% increase in the discount rate to 16.3% reduces the recoverable amount by $384 million. The increase in the recoverable amount from the prior year is a result of increased cash flows over the life of mine due to the factors detailed below partially offset by an increase in the discount rate from 10.0% to 10.5%.‚Ä¢ A mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi proved probable reserves and resources. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine life assumption of 40 years has not changed from the prior year review. Average annual production is approximately 1.2 million tonnes (2020: 1.2 million tonnes) of ilmenite and co-products zircon  rutile and concentrates over the life of the Mine and remains unchanged from the prior year review. This mine plan does not include investment in additional mining capacity. Certain minimum stocks of final and intermediate products are assumed to be maintained at period ends.‚Ä¢ Product sales prices are based on contract prices as stipulated in marketing agreements with customers  or where contracts are based on market prices or production is not currently contracted  prices are forecast by the Group taking into account independent titanium mineral sands expertise provided by TiPMC Solutions and management expectations including general inflation of 2% per annum. Forecast prices provided by TiPMC Solutions have been reviewed and found to be consistent with other external sources of information. Average forecast product sales prices have increased over the life of mine from the prior year end review as a result of revised forecast pricing. A 12% reduction in average sales prices over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $384.0 million.‚Ä¢ Operating costs are based on approved budget costs for 2022 taking into account the current running costs of the Mine and estimated forecast inflation for 2022. From 2023 onwards operating costs are escalated by 2% per annum. Average forecast operating costs have increased from the prior year end review as a result of increased production and inflation. A 14% increase in operating costs over the life of mine reduces the recoverable amount by $384.0 million.‚Ä¢ Capital costs are based on a life of mine capital plan including inflation at 2% per annum from 2022. Average forecast capital costs have increased from the prior year end review based on updated sustaining and development capital plans required to maintain the existing plant over the life of mine. The forecast takes into account reasonable cost increases and therefore a sensitivity to this assumption which would give rise to a reduction in the recoverable amount has not been applied.11.

The finance documentation also contemplates a Mine Closure Guarantee Facility (provided by either the existing lenders or other finance providers) of up to $40 million  with the provider(s) of such a facility sharing in the common security package. The potential total aggregate principal amount of indebtedness secured under the finance documentation is therefore $190 million. The transaction costs for arrangement of the debt facilities amounted to $6.5 million.The Term Loan Facility has a final maturity date of 11 March 2025. Interest is at LIBOR plus 5.40% per annum. Repayment is in seven equal semi-annual instalments  beginning 11 March 2022.The Revolving Credit Facility has a final maturity date of 11 December 2022 extendable by up to 24 months at the lenders‚Äô discretion. Interest is at LIBOR plus 5.00% per annum.During the period the Group entered into a mine closure guarantee with Absa Bank Mo√ßambique SA for $11.4 million. This guarantee shares the security package with the Term Loan Facility and Revolving Credit Facility on a pro rata and pari passu basis.The security package consists of (a) security over the Group‚Äôs bank accounts (subject to certain exceptions)  (b) pledges of the shares of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited and Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (the ‚ÄúProject Companies‚Äù)  (c) security over intercompany loans and (d) Mozambican law security interests over certain rights and agreements with Mozambican authorities  including over the Implementation Agreement  the Mineral Licensing Contract and the Mining Licence.The carrying amount of the secured bank accounts of the Group was $66.9 million as at 31 December 2021 (2020:$87.0 million). The shares of the Project Companies and intercompany loans are not included in the consolidated statement of financial position as they are eliminated on consolidation. They therefore do not have a carrying amount but  upon enforcement of the pledges on behalf of the lender group  the shares in the Project Companies would cease to be owned or controlled by the Group. The secured rights and agreements do not have a carrying amount. They are  however  necessary for the Project Companies to operate the Mine in Mozambique.The finance documents contain a number of representations  covenants and events of default on customary terms  the breach of which could lead to the secured parties under the finance documentation accelerating the outstanding loans and taking other enforcement steps  such as the enforcement of some or all of the security interests  which could lead  in extremis  with the Group losing its interest in the Mine. The most salient of the relevant terms that could lead to acceleration of the loans and/or enforcement of security are the financial covenants.At 31 December 2021 total debt of $148.1 million (2020: $145.8 million) was recognised by the Group  being the drawdown of $150.0 million before unamortised transaction costs of $3.8 million (2020: $5.4 million) plus interest amortised of $2.0 million (2020: $1.2 million).UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202115.

A corresponding amount equal to the provision is recognised as part of property  plant and equipment. The costs are estimated on the basis of a formal closure plan  are subject to regular review and are estimated based on the net present value of estimated future cost. Mine closure costs are a normal consequence of mining  and the majority of close-down and restoration expenditure is incurred at the end of the life of the Mine. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost and $0.7 million (2020: $0.7 million) has been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the financial year.The main assumptions used in the calculation of the estimated future costs include:‚Ä¢ a discount rate of 2.9% (2020: 2.0%);‚Ä¢ an inflation rate of 2% (2020: 2%);‚Ä¢ an estimated life of mine of 40 years (2020: 40 years). It is assumed that all licences and permits required to operate will be renewed or extended during the life of mine; and‚Ä¢ an estimated closure cost of $34.1 million (2020: $34.1 million) and an estimated post-closure monitoring provision of $3.9 million (2020: $3.9 million).The life of mine plan is based on the Namalope  Nataka  Pilivili and Mualadi Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources as set out in the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resources table. Specific resource material is included only where there is a high degree of confidence in its economic extraction. The Mine closure provision has decreased by $1.0 million to reflect a change in the discount rate from 2.0% to 2.9%.The discount rate is a significant factor in determining the Mine closure provision. The discount rate increased to 2.9% (2020: 2.0%) as a result of movements in the US Treasury rates. Thirty-year US Treasury yields are the longest period for which yields are quoted. A forty-year rate to align with the estimated life of mine has been calculated by taking the average of the increase in yield from ten to twenty years and the increase in yield from twenty to thirty years and adding this average to the thirty-year treasury rate to arrive at an estimated extrapolated rate for forty years. This discount rate is deemed to provide the best estimate of the current market assessment of risk-free time value of the money. Risks specific to the liability are included in the cost estimate. A reasonable possible increase of 1% in the estimated discount rate results in the Mine closure provision decreasing to $24.0 million. A 1% decrease in the estimated discount rate results in the Mine closure provision increasing to $54.0 million.The Mine rehabilitation provision represents the Directors‚Äô best estimate of the Company‚Äôs liability for rehabilitating areas disturbed by mining activities. Rehabilitation costs are recognised based on the area disturbed and estimated cost of rehabilitation per hectare which is reviewed regularly against actual rehabilitation cost per hectare. Actual rehabilitation expenditure is incurred approximately twelve months after the area has been disturbed. During the financial year there was a release of $0.4 million (2020: $0.8 million) to reflect the actual mine rehabilitation costs incurred  and an addition to the provision of $0.4 million (2020: $1.4 million) for areas newly disturbed.Other provisions comprise an amount of $2.3 million (2020: $nil million) in relation to a potential indirect tax liability. As the matter is still outstanding it is possible that on conclusion the final outcome may differ from management‚Äôs estimate.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117.

The table does not include fair value information for other receivables  prepayments  trade payables and accruals as these are not measured at fair value as the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of their fair value. Trade receivables which are factored through the Absa Bank facility or letters of credit which are always confirmed and discounted through the Barclays Bank facility are initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Trade receivables or letters or credit where it is not known at initial recognition if they will be factored are classified as fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI). The Group derecognises the original receivable to which the arrangement applies when payment is received from the bank as the terms of the arrangement are non-recourse. The payment to the bank by the Group‚Äôs customers are considered non-cash transactions. Trade receivables not measured at fair value are receivables whose payment is received under the sale contract credit terms.The valuation technique used in measuring Level 2 fair values is discounted cash flows which considers the expected receipts or payments discounted using adjusted market discount rates or where these rates are not available estimated discount rates. The Group has exposure to credit risk  liquidity risk and market risk arising from financial instruments.Risk management frameworkThe Board is ultimately responsible for risk management within the Group. It has delegated responsibility for the monitoring of the effectiveness of the Group‚Äôs risk management and internal control systems to the Audit & Risk Committee. The Board and Audit & Risk Committee receive reports from executive management on the key risks to the business and the steps being taken to mitigate such risks. The Audit & Risk Committee is assisted in its role by Internal Audit. Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures  the results of which are reported to the Audit and Risk Committee.Credit RiskCredit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or a counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet it contractual obligations  and arises principally from the Group‚Äôs trade receivables from customers. The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure.Trade receivablesThe Group‚Äôs exposure to credit risk is influenced by the individual circumstances of each customer. The Group also considers the factors that may influence the credit risk of its customer base  including the default risk associated with the industry and country in which customers operate. Before entering into sales contracts with new customers  the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer‚Äôs credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Limits attributed to customers are reviewed regularly during the year.The Group‚Äôs customers have been transacting with the Group for a significant number of years  and no customers‚Äô balances have been written off or are credit-impaired at the financial year end. In monitoring customer credit risk  customers are reviewed individually and the Group has not identified any factors which would merit reducing exposure to any particular customer. The Group does not require collateral in respect of trade receivables.At 31 December 2021  $41.3 million (2020: $7.2 million) is due from the Group‚Äôs three largest customers. The exposure to credit risk for trade receivables by geographic region was as follows:UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117.

For deposits in excess of $50 million the Group requires that the institution has an A- (S&P)/A3 (Moody‚Äôs) long-term rating. For deposits in excess of $15 million  the Group requires that the institution has a BB- (S&P)/Ba3 (Moody‚Äôs) long-term rating.At 31 December 2021 and 2020 cash was deposited with the following banks:2021 2020 Long-term credit rating Long-term credit rating $ million S&P Moody‚Äôs $ million S&P Moody‚Äôs Barclays Bank plc 60.8 A Positive A-1 Stable 60.0 A Negative A-1 Stable FirstRand Bank Limited 5.1 BBB - Stable Ba2 Negative 15.0 BBB- Stable Ba2 Negative Nedbank Limited - BB- Stable Ba2 Negative 10.0 BB- Stable Ba2 Negative HSBC Bank plc 0.8 A+ Stable A1 Stable 1.7 A+ Stable A1 Stable Absa Bank Limited 2.0 BBB- Stable Ba2 Negative - BBB- Stable Ba2 NegativeLiquidity riskLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group will encounter difficulty in meeting the obligations associated with its financial liabilities that are settled in cash payments. The Group‚Äôs objective when managing liquidity is to ensure that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they are due.The Group monitors mine payment forecasts  both operating and capital  which assist it in monitoring cash flow requirements and optimising its cash return on investments. The Group aims to maintain the level of its cash and cash equivalents at an amount in excess of expected cash outflows on financial liabilities. The Group monitors the level of expected cash inflows on trade receivables together with expected cash outflows on trade and other payables.The Group has a trade finance facility with Absa Bank for three of the Group‚Äôs largest customers. In accordance with this facility the bank purchases 80% of the receivable without recourse and so the bank takes on the credit risk. The facility is $30 million with limits on the maximum amount that can be factored for each of the customers named in the facility. During the period no trade receivables were factored under this agreement. At the year end  trade receivables amounting to $14.5 million (2020: $8.9 million) may be factored under this facility and are therefore included in trade receivables as at 31 December 2021. The cost of this facility for the period  which amounted to $0.2 million (2020: $0.2 million)  is included in finance costs in the statement of comprehensive income and in net cash from operating activities in the statement of consolidated cash flows.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117. Financial Instruments (continued)The Group has a trade facility with Barclays Bank for customers which it sells to under letter of credit terms. Under this facility  Barclays Bank confirms the letter of credit from the issuing bank and therefore takes the credit risk that the issuing bank will not pay. Barclays Bank can also discount these letters of credit thereby providing early payment of receivables to the Group. There is no limit under the Barclays Bank facility. During the period trade receivables of $224.4 million (2020: $88.3 million) were discounted under this facility. At the year-end there were $37.1 million (2020: $6.2 million) which may be discounted under this facility. The cost of this facility for the period  which amounted to $0.1 million (2020: $0.1 million)  is included in finance costs in the condensed statement of comprehensive income and in net cash from operating activities in the condensed statement of consolidated cash flows.The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group‚Äôs financial liabilities at 31 December 2021 based on the gross contractual undiscounted payments:Financial liabilities Total$‚Äô000 Less thanone year$‚Äô000 Between2 and 5 years$‚Äô000 More than5 years$‚Äô000 Bank loans 164 331 79 136 85 195 - Lease liabilities 2 684 1 207 1 317 160 Trade & other payables 32 768 32 768 - - 199 783 113 111 86 512 160The table below summarises the maturity profile of the Group‚Äôs financial liabilities at 31 December 2020 based on the gross contractual undiscounted payments:Financial liabilities Total$‚Äô000 Less thanone year$‚Äô000 Between2 and 5 years$‚Äô000 More than5 years$‚Äô000 Bank loans 171 479 7 149 164 330 - Lease liabilities 4 044 1 359 2 251 434 Trade & other payables 50 122 50 122 ‚Äì ‚Äì 225 645 58 630 166 581 434As disclosed in Note 15 the Group has bank loans that contain loan covenants. A future breach of covenant may require the Group to repay the loan earlier than indicated in the above table. Under the loan agreement  the covenants are monitored on a regular basis by Group finance and regularly reported to management and the lenders to ensure compliance with the agreement.Risk ConcentrationConcentrations arise when a number of counterparties are engaged in similar business activities  or activities in the same geographical region  or have economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations to be similarly affected by changes in economic  political or other conditions. Concentrations indicate the relative sensitivity of the Group‚Äôs performance to developments affecting a particular industry.The Group evaluates the concentration of risk with respect to trade receivables and contract assets as low  as its customers are located in several jurisdictions and industries and operate in largely independent markets. Details of concentration of revenue are included in Note 2.Market riskMarket risk is risk that changes in market prices for foreign exchange rates and interest rates will affect the Group‚Äôs income statement. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures while optimising returns.Currency riskThe Group is exposed to transactional foreign currency risk to the extent that there is a mismatch between the currencies in which sales  purchases  receivables and borrowings are denominated and the respective functional currencies of Group companies. The functional currencies of all Group are US Dollars. The presentational currency of the Group is US Dollars. Sales and bank loans are denominated in US Dollars which significantly reduces the exposure of the Group to foreign currency risk. Payables transactions are denominated in Mozambican Metical  South African Rand  Euro  Sterling  Australian Dollar and Renminbi.UNAUDITED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTSFOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 202117.

Financial Instruments (continued)Interest rate riskThe loan facilities are arranged at variable rates and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. Variable rates are based on six-month LIBOR. The borrowing rate at financial year end was 5.8% (2020: 5.8%). The interest rate profile of the Group‚Äôs loan balances at the financial year end was as follows:2021$‚Äô000 2020$‚Äô000 Variable rate debt 151 914 151 217Under the assumption that all other variables remain constant  a reasonable possible change of 1% in the six-month LIBOR rate results in a $1.5 million (2020: $1.5 million) change in finance costs for the financial year.The above sensitivity analyses are estimates of the impact of market risks assuming the specified change occurs. Actual results in the future may differ materially from these results due to developments in the global financial markets  which may cause fluctuations in interest rates to vary from the assumptions made above and therefore should not be considered a projection of likely future events.Interest rate benchmark reformA fundamental reform of major interest rate benchmarks is being undertaken globally  including the replacement of some interbank offered rates (IBORs) with alternative nearly risk-free rates (referred to as ‚ÄúIBOR reform‚Äù). The group has exposure to IBORs on its financial instruments that will be reformed as part of these market-wide initiatives. The Group‚Äôs main IBOR exposure at the reporting date is US LIBOR  which is administered by ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA). The alternative reference rate for US LIBOR is the US Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR).On 5 March 2021  IBA stated that it will cease the publication of (i) the overnight and 1  3  6 and 12 months USD LIBOR settings immediately following the LIBOR publication on Friday  June 30  2023 and (ii) all other LIBOR settings  including the 1 week and 2 months USD LIBOR settings  immediately following the LIBOR publication on Friday  December 31  2021. IBA stated that it will not have access to input data necessary to calculate LIBOR settings on a representative basis after those dates. The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a separate announcement confirming that IBA had notified the FCA of its intent to cease providing all LIBOR settings. The FCA confirmed that all 35 LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative as of the dates set out by IBA.The Group anticipates that IBOR reform will impact its operational and risk management processes. The main risk to which the Group is exposed as a result of IBOR reform is in the amendment to the Senior Facility Agreement with negotiation with the lender group to reflect the migration from USD LIBOR to SOFR  updating contractual terms and revising operational controls related to the migration. Financial risk is predominantly limited to interest rate risk.The Audit & Risk Committee monitors while the executive and senior management manages the migration to alternative rates. Such management includes evaluation of the extent to which contracts reference IBOR  whether such contracts will need to be amended as a result of IBOR reform and how to manage communication about IBOR reform to counterparties.The Group plans to amend contractual terms for purposes of migrating from USD LIBOR to SOFR prior to the discontinuance of the administration and publication of the relevant LIBOR rates by IBA.The carrying amount of financial liabilities with unreformed contracts at 31 December 2021 was $148.1 million (31 December 2020: $145.8 million).18. Contingent liabilitiesThe Group  like other businesses operating in Mozambique  is subject to tax audits by the Mozambican Tax Authorities. These audits may review a range of matters including corporate income tax  indirect taxes and transaction related issues  and can take a number of years to complete. The Mozambican Tax Authority conducted an audit of the tax obligations of the Branch in relation to the years 2015 to 2017. The Group is liaising with the Tax Authority to address matters raised during the audit. It is not possible to estimate with certainty the timing of any future resolution or possible outcomes.A provision of $2.3 million (2020: $nil) is included in the financial statements in relation to a potential indirect tax liability. As the matter is still outstanding it is possible that on conclusion the outcome may differ from management‚Äôs estimates. Other tax matters raised during the audit are likewise still outstanding.

REUTERS/Maxim ZmeyevMarch 23 (Reuters) - Russian steel giant Severstal (CHMF.MM) was racing against the clock on Wednesday to avoid becoming the country's first major corporate default since the Ukraine crisis began  with international payment lines snarled by sanctions.Severstal  whose main shareholder Alexey Mordashov is one of a number of wealthy Russians now sanctioned by the European Union  has until the end of the day to get an already overdue $12.6 million loan 'coupon' payment to its creditors.A source close to the steel firm said the money had been transferred last week but was yet to be processed and passed on by its paying agent Citibank.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register""This will technically be the first default since the crisis began to unfold "" Seaport Global credit analyst Himanshu Porwal said.""But people will know it is driven by the way the sanctions have been formulated  rather than the company's fault "" adding Severstal might find a way to make the payment in the coming days  especially if Mordashov were to cut or relinquish his large stake in the firm  which itself is not sanctioned.With Wednesday's deadline fast approaching Severstal said it had been in constant discussions about the issues  and that it was looking at an application for special ""licences"" that may be required to make the payment. read moreThe legal terms of the bonds state an ""Event of Default"" can be formally declared five working days after the March 16 coupon due date.The latest Western sanctions and countersanctions by Moscow mean that transferring payments on Russian government and corporate bonds has become complex.Previously payments like Severstal's would have been processed by international clearing houses such as Clearstream or Euroclear  which confirm asset ownership  and also funnel payments for domestic bondholders to Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD).However both Euroclear  owned by a group of global exchanges and banks  and Clearstream  part of Deutsche Boerse  have said they will stop settling trades in Russian securities as a result of the EU's sanctions. read moreNeither Clearstream  Euroclear nor Citigroup responded to requests for comment.DELAYS POSSIBLEA Severstal default would be the first by a major Russian company since Moscow was blanketed by sanctions for what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine  but it may not be alone.Russian companies need to make $18.5 billion of international bond payments by year-end  ITI Capital analysts estimate  while Moscow needs to pay another $3.4 billion on its foreign currency sovereign bonds.Investors would have the right to take legal action to reclaim unpaid amounts  most likely in the United Kingdom or the United States - under whose laws most international market bonds are issued.Payments due in coming days include from Gazprom (GAZP.MM)  which made a payment without problems earlier this month  Russian Railways on March 25 and Polyus Gold (PLZL.MM) on March 28  the same day as Russia's next international sovereign bond payment falls due.It's not just international bondholders who are affected. Severstal (CHMF.MM)  Russia's top steelmaker NLMK (NLMK.MM)  state-owned Russian Railways and fertiliser producer Eurochem are all struggling to get payments to Russian bondholders  the firms themselves and ITI Capital say.NLMK said on Tuesday it had paid a coupon on a 2024 bond but while foreigners had started to receive their money  Russian holders hadn't.""This is due to the fact that... Euroclear and Clearstream are no longer settling transactions with Russia's NSD "" NLMK said. ""We currently see no legal grounds prohibiting Euroclear and Clearstream to process payments to Russian residents.""NSD confirmed it was receiving payments from Euroclear  but said it will not process these until Euroclear gets clarifications from European regulators.""After curbs are lifted  payments will be processed...as usual "" it said.The daily Kommersant newspaper  citing a source at a large brokerage firm  said some Russian holders of Moscow's sovereign bonds also hadn't received payments. A source at a European-based fund told Reuters it too had not received a sovereign bond payment due on Monday.The Russian finance ministry  Russian Railways and Eurochem did not reply to requests for comment.""Delays are possible for payments cleared via international depositories "" NSD added in a statement to Reuters.""This could be linked to 'manual' processing of the orders linked to Russian companies as well as with a need to get clarifications from European regulators"".Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterReporting by Reuters; Editing by Alexander Smith  Kirsten DonovanOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",negative,0.02,0.2,0.78,negative,0.02,0.2,0.79,True,English,"['Steel giant Severstal', 'first major default', 'Russia-Ukraine crisis', ""overdue $12.6 million loan 'coupon' payment"", 'The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles', 'next international sovereign bond payment', 'Seaport Global credit analyst', 'foreign currency sovereign bonds', 'most international market bonds', 'March 16 coupon due date', 'Moscow International Business Center', 'first major corporate default', 'international clearing houses', 'FREE unlimited access', 'National Settlement Depository', 'daily Kommersant newspaper', 'international payment lines', 'Russian finance ministry', 'Reuters.com Register', 'ITI Capital analysts', 'Russian steel giant', 'major Russian company', 'state-owned Russian Railways', 'large brokerage firm', 'international bond payments', 'latest Western sanctions', 'corporate bonds', 'first default', 'international bondholders', 'international depositories', 'global exchanges', 'steel firm', 'large stake', 'Russian government', 'Russian securities', 'Russian companies', 'Russian bondholders', 'Russian holders', 'Russian residents', 'general view', 'Maxim Zmeyev', 'main shareholder', 'wealthy Russians', 'European Union', 'paying agent', 'Himanshu Porwal', 'coming days', 'constant discussions', 'special ""licences', 'legal terms', 'asset ownership', 'domestic bondholders', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'legal action', 'unpaid amounts', 'United Kingdom', 'United States', 'Polyus Gold', 'top steelmaker', 'fertiliser producer', 'legal grounds', 'European regulators', 'European-based fund', ""manual' processing"", 'Alexander Smith', 'Kirsten Donovan', 'Alexey Mordashov', 'DELAYS POSSIBLE', 'same day', 'GAZP.MM', 'PLZL.MM', 'Severstal default', 'Ukraine crisis', '2024 bond', 'Moskva-City', 'CHMF', 'clock', 'Wednesday', 'country', 'number', 'end', 'creditors', 'source', 'money', 'Citibank', 'people', 'deadline', 'issues', 'application', 'Event', 'countersanctions', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'NSD', 'group', 'banks', 'part', 'trades', 'result', 'requests', 'comment', 'Investors', 'right', 'laws', 'Gazprom', 'problems', 'NLMK', 'Eurochem', 'firms', 'Tuesday', 'foreigners', 'fact', 'transactions', 'clarifications', 'curbs', 'Monday', 'statement', 'orders', 'need', 'Reporting', 'Editing', 'Standards']",2022-03-23,2022-03-24,reuters.com

The guidelines encompass remuneration to the Board of Directors  the CEO and the executive management  however  these guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the Annual General Meeting.The Board of Directors shall be entitled to temporarily depart from these guidelines  in whole or in part  if special reasons justify doing so in an individual case and such deviation is necessary in order to meet the company's long-term interests or to ensure the company's financial viability. If such a departure occurs  it must be reported in the remuneration report before the next Annual General Meeting. The guidelines pertain to the period starting from the 2022 Annual General Meeting. Any issue regarding departure from the guidelines shall be prepared by the remuneration committee and decided by the Board of Directors.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interest and sustainabilityMycronic is a global high-tech company that develops  manufactures and supplies market-leading production equipment with high requirements on precision and flexibility to the electronics industry. Mycronic has three priorities within the framework of the company's long-term strategy. These are: consolidating the company's strong position within the Pattern Generators division; increasing or retaining profitability in the High Flex  High Volume and Global Technologies divisions; and increasing the company's proximity to customers. The strategy also includes creating value through a focus on sustainability.The Board of Directors considers that it is critical for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  that the company is able to recruit and retain members of the executive management with the competence and capacity to achieve specified goals. To this end  the company must offer competitive remuneration to motivate the executive management.

Total remuneration consists of base salary and variable pay  pension and other benefits. Long-term variable pay is excluded in the calculation of the total remuneration and the relative proportion of the remuneration components.Fixed remunerationIn establishing the base salary for the CEO and members of the executive management  the scope and complexity of the position in question  as well as the individual's performance is taken into account. The executive managements' salaries are  like the other components of remuneration  subject to annual review by the Remuneration Committee  with the support of external salary statistics ensure that the salaries remain competitive. The base salary constitutes a maximum of 65 percent of total remuneration in the event of a maximum outcome of short-term variable pay.Short-term variable remunerationThe remuneration is paid in accordance with goals achieved. The criteria  such as order intake or EBIT  are established in order to contribute to the company's business strategy  long-term interests and thus to the company's long-term value creation. The fulfillment of the criteria is determined through the company's audited annual accounts. Short-term variable pay can amount to a maximum of 110 percent of base salary and 55 percent of total remuneration. Variable pay shall not be pensionable  unless otherwise provided by mandatory law or obligations in applicable collective bargaining agreements. The outcome is prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board of Directors in connection with the end of the qualification period and the remuneration is thereafter paid out. The company has no contractual right to recover the remuneration.Long-term variable remunerationMembers of the executive management can be offered incentive programs  which mainly should be share or share price-related. An incentive program is intended to improve the participants' commitment to the company's development and shall be introduced on market-based terms.Resolutions on share or share price-related incentive programs must be passed at an Annual General Meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines.Other long-term remunerationThere are already existing agreements on long-term variable pay linked to continued employment for certain members of the executive management.BenefitsPensionMembers of the executive management employed in Sweden after 2012 are covered by the contribution-defined plan under ITP1. Members of the executive management employed prior to 1 January 2022 have a supplementary contribution-defined pension plan in addition to the ITP plan. The retirement age for members of the executive management employed in Sweden is 65 years. For members of the executive management employed outside of Sweden  locally competitive pension plans and retirement ages are applied.Other benefitsOther benefits e.g. car benefits and health care plans are established based on them being competitive in the local market.Pension and other benefits constitute a maximum of 40 percent of total remuneration in the event of a maximum outcome of short-term variable pay.Special adjustmentsRegarding employment conditions that are governed by rules other than those applying in Sweden  appropriate adjustments may be made in order to comply with such mandatory rules or local practice  whereby the overall purpose of these guidelines shall be met.Notice of termination and severance payThe employment or contractual agreements of members of the executive management shall be valid until further notice or for a specified period of time.For the CEO  in the event of termination by the company  a twelve months notice period and twelve months severance pay apply.For members of the executive management employed in Sweden  the mutual notice period is a maximum of six months.

Information about the executive managements' total remuneration  components of their remuneration  as well as increases in remuneration and rates of increase over time have been obtained and have constituted a part of the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' decision basis in their evaluation of the fairness of the guidelines and the limitations arising from them.The resolution processThe Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines when there is a need for significant changes to the guidelines  however at least every four years. The Board of Directors' proposal is prepared by the Remuneration Committee. The Chairman of the Board of Directors may also be Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.

In such cases  remuneration shall be paid in accordance with the current guidelines or  if no guidelines exist  in accordance with the company's practice.External advisors are used in the preparation of these matters when deemed necessary.Review of the guidelinesThe guidelines for remuneration to members of the executive management were reviewed ahead of the 2022 Annual General Meeting  and did not result in any adjustments.Item 16: Proposal regarding composition of nomination committeeThe nomination committee proposes that a new nomination committee for the 2023 Annual General Meeting is appointed by the Chairman of the Board ‚Äì at the latest by the end of the third quarter of 2022 ‚Äì contacting the three largest or otherwise known shareholders per 31 August  2022.

Shares may be paid in kind  through set-off or with other conditions set forth in Chapter 13  Section 5  first paragraph item 6 in the Swedish Companies Act. The Board of Directors may otherwise set the terms of such share issuance. The authorization shall however not comprise a right for the Board to issue shares against cash payment and with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The issue price shall be determined on marketable grounds and the number of issued shares may not exceed ten percent of the total amount of outstanding shares in the company per the day of this notice.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and the right to decide on payment through set-off  in kind or other condition as set forth in the Swedish Companies Act is to enable the company to issue shares in order to acquire shares  business or product rights.Majority requirementsA valid resolution under item 17 above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.Item 18: The Board of Directors' proposal on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve for the company to acquire the company's own sharesThe Board of Directors shall be authorized  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to decide to acquire the company's own shares in accordance with the following.Acquisition may only be made by a maximum of so many shares that  at any given time  the company's own holdings do not exceed five percent of all shares in the company Acquisition of shares in the company may only be made on Nasdaq Stockholm (the ""Exchange"") Acquisition of shares on the Exchange may only take place at a price within the price range recorded on the Exchange at any given time The payment for the shares shall be paid in cash The authorization may be used on one or several occasions up until the end of the 2023 Annual General MeetingThe purpose of the above authorizations to acquire shares is to enable delivery of shares to participants in LTIP 2022 (the introduction of a new long term incentive program  LTIP 2022  is subject to a separate resolution in item 19 in the notice for the 2022 Annual General Meeting) and to be able to continuously adjust the company's capital structure to the company's capital requirements.Shares that have been acquired by the company and which have not been reserved in order to secure the company's delivery of shares under LTIP 2022 are intended to be canceled following a resolution thereof at the 2023 Annual General Meeting.Majority requirementsA valid resolution under item 18 above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.Item 19: The Board of Directors' proposal regarding Long Term Incentive Program 2022 (LTIP 2022)Mycronic's Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting passes a resolution on the implementation of a Long Term Incentive Program 2022 (LTIP 2022). This proposal is divided into four items:A. Terms of LTIP 2022B. Transfer of the company's own shares under LTIP 2022 and hedging activitiesC. Hedging of LTIP 2022 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyD. Other matters related to LTIP 2022A. Terms of LTIP 2022A.1 IntroductionThe Board wishes to establish a long-term incentive program for certain key employees in order to encourage personal long-term ownership of Mycronic shares as well as to increase and enhance its ability to recruit  retain and motivate employees. The Board therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance share program 2022 (""LTIP 2022""). The intention is also to use LTIP 2021 to unite the interest of the employees with the interests of shareholders.Participants may  after a qualifying period  receive allotments of Mycronic ordinary shares without consideration. The number of allotted shares will depend on the fulfilment of certain performance targets. The term of LTIP 2022 is more than three years.A.2 Basic features of LTIP 2022The LTIP 2022 will be directed towards certain key employees in the Mycronic Group. The participants are based in Sweden and other countries where the Mycronic Group is active. Each participant may be entitled  after a certain qualification period (defined below)  provided continued employment during the entire period (except from ""Good Leavers"")  and depending on the fulfilment of certain performance targets linked to Mycronic's Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")  to receive allotment of Mycronic shares (""Performance Shares""). The participant shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares. Performance Shares are Mycronic ordinary shares.A.3 Participation in LTIP 2022LTIP 2022 is directed towards a maximum of 70 employees  divided in three categories of participants:Category Maximum number of shares per personA) CEO (maximum 1 person) 8 900B) Management Group (maximum 10 persons) 3 400C) Other key employees (maximum 59 persons) 1 400Any resolution on participation or implementation of LTIP 2022 shall be conditional on that it  in the Board's judgement  can be offered with reasonable administrative costs and financial effects.A.4 Allotment of Performance SharesAllotment of Performance Shares within LTIP 2022 will be made during a limited period of time following the Annual General Meeting 2025. The period up to this date is referred to as the qualification period (vesting period). A condition for the participant to receive allotment of Performance Shares is that the participant remains an employee of the Mycronic Group during the full qualification period up until allotment. Allotment of Performance Shares also requires that the EPS performance targets are fulfilled. The Board shall establish a customary definition of Good Leavers and determine whether any allocation shall be made to participants who are considered Good Leavers.The performance target is Mycronic's EPS and the performance target shall be established by the Board. Partial fulfilment of the performance targets will result in partial allotment of Performance Shares. Performance under a certain level will result in no allotment. The EPS targets and the outcome will be communicated to the shareholders after the allotment of Performance Shares to participants.Prior to the allotment of Performance Shares  the Board shall assess whether the allotment is reasonable in relation to the company's financial results  position and performance  as well as other factors.If significant changes take place within the Mycronic Group  or on the market  which  by the assessment of the Board  would mean that the terms for allocation/transfer of shares according to LTIP 2022 is no longer reasonable  the Board shall have the right to implement an adjustment to LTIP 2022  including  among others  the right to reduce the number of Performance Shares allocated/transferred  or not to allocate/transfer Performance Shares at all.A.5 Implementation and administration etceteraThe Board  with the assistance of the remuneration committee  shall in accordance with the resolutions by the Annual General Meeting set forth herein be responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2022. The Board may also decide on the implementation of an alternative cash based incentive for participants in countries where the allotment of Performance Shares is not appropriate  as well as if otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTIP 2022.The intention is that the Board shall launch LTIP 2022 as soon as practically possible after the Annual General Meeting.In the event that the general meeting does not resolve in accordance with item B with the required majority  the Company shall hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party in accordance with what is stated in item C below.B. Transfer of the company's own shares under LTIP 2022 and hedging activities.B1. Number of sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that transfer of up to 125 500 Mycronic shares under LTIP 2022 may be made in accordance with the below. The number of shares is calculated on the basis of maximum participation and maximum fulfilment of performance requirements.B2. Other conditions for transfer of Mycronic sharesMycronic shares may be transferred to the participants in LTIP 2022.Share transfers to participants in LTIP 2022 shall be made without the participants paying consideration and shall be carried out at the time and subject to the other conditions under which participants in LTIP 2022 have the right to be allotted shares.The number of Mycronic shares that might be transferred under LTIP 2022 shall be subject to customary re-calculation principles and may  consequently  be subject to re-calculation due to a bonus issue  share split  dividends and/or other similar events. Resolutions resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting 2022 shall not be included in a re-calculation of the number of shares.B.3 Grounds for the Board's proposal and alternative hedging via an equity swap agreement with a third party etceteraSince the Board believes that the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer Mycronic shares under LTIP 2022 is obtained through transfer of own shares  the Board proposes that transfers are secured as described above in this item B. Should the necessary majority not be obtained for the proposal in item B  the Board will enter into a share swap agreement  in accordance with item C below.Share swap agreement will also be relevant should this be more appropriate  for example due to the fact that the acquisition of own shares cannot be made to the extent required to be able to transfer shares under LTIP 2022.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights to acquire the own shares is that the company shall be able to secure the delivery of shares under LTIP 2022.C. Hedge of LTIP 2022 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyIn the event that the necessary majority is not obtained for item B above  the company will hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer shares in the company under LTIP 2022. The relevant number of shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed under item B above. The cost of hedging by entering into an equity swap agreement  excluding any dividends and without regard to the development of Mycronic's share price  exceeds SEK 1 million during the term of the program.D. Other matters in relation to LTIP 2022D.1 Majority requirements etc.The resolution according to item A above shall require a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. A valid resolution under item B above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.D.2 Estimated costs  expenses and financial effects of LTIP 2022LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 ‚Äì Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the share awards should be expensed as personnel costs over the qualification period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security contributions will be recognized as an expense in the income statement through regular provisions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The amount of these regular provisions will be revalued in line with the trend in the value of the right to Performance Shares  and the contributions payable on the allotment of Performance Shares.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 178  and that the performance targets are achieved so that 50 percent of the maximum number of Performance Shares vest  including a share price increase of 50 percent during the qualification period and an annual employee turnover of 5 percent  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to SEK 14.1 million before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of SEK 4.7 million before tax.Assuming that the performance targets are achieved so that 100 percent of the maximum number of Performance Shares vest  and otherwise the same assumptions as above  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to SEK 28.2 million before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of SEK 9.4 million before tax.LTIP 2022 will comprise maximum 125 500 shares in total  which corresponds to 0.13 percent of the total outstanding shares and votes in the company on a fully diluted basis.The above calculations are based on a decision on hedging in accordance with item B.In the view of the Board  the positive effects expected to arise from LTIP 2022  outweigh the costs associated with LTIP 2022.D.3 The Board's explanatory statementAn individual long-term ownership commitment among the participants in LTIP 2022 is expected to stimulate greater interest and motivation in the company's business operations  results and strategy. Moreover  the Board wishes to increase the ability of Mycronic to retain important key employees. The Board believes that the implementation of LTIP 2022 will benefit Mycronic and its shareholders. LTIP 2022 will provide a competitive and motivation-improving incentive for executives and other key employees within the Group.LTIP 2022 has been designed to reward the participants for increased shareholder value by allotting shares  based on the fulfilment of conditions in respect of results and operations. By linking the employees' remuneration to the development of Mycronic's results and value  the long-term value growth of Mycronic is rewarded. Based on these circumstances  the Board considers that the implementation of LTIP 2022 will have a positive effect on the Mycronic Group's continued development  and will therefore be beneficial to the shareholders and Mycronic.D.4 Other share-related incentive programsThe company's share-related incentive programs are described on pages 49-51 in the company's annual report.D.5 Adjustment AuthorizationThe Board  or a person appointed by the Board  shall be authorized to make adjustments to the above resolutions that may be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB respectively.D.6 Preparation of the itemThe basis for LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the Board of the company. The work has been supported by external advisors and has been made in consultation with shareholders. The Board has thereafter decided to present this proposal for the general meeting. Except for the staff that have prepared the matter upon instruction from the Board  no employee that may be a participant of LTIP 2022 has participated in the preparations of the program's terms.The financial statements and the audit report regarding the financial year 2021  as well as the nomination committee's and the Board of Director's complete proposals including related documentation will be available at the company at Nytorpsv√§gen 9 in T√§by not later than by 14 April 2022  on the company website and will also be sent by post to shareholders requesting so and stating their postal address. The same applies to the Board of Directors report in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551) and the auditor's opinion in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 54 of the same law.The total number of shares and votes in the company amounts to 97 916 509. The company does not hold any of these shares. Shareholders are reminded of the right to  at the Annual General Meeting  ask questions to the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act  Chapter 7  Section 32.For information on how your personal data is processed  please see https://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfT√§by in March 2022Mycronic AB (publ)The Board of DirectorsN.B.

The resolutions under 15A - 15B below are conditional on each other and all decisions are therefore proposed to be adopted in one context.15A. Introduction of LTIP 2022The Board of Directors of the Company proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive programme (LTIP 2022) directed at senior executives and key individuals in the XVIVO group in accordance with the main terms and conditions set out below.Background and rationaleThe Company's Board is of the opinion that incentive programmes contribute to higher motivation and commitment among the employees and strengthen the bonds between the employees and the Company. Furthermore  the Board's assessment is that LTIP 2022 will contribute to the opportunities to retain knowledgeable and experienced employees and is expected to increase the employees' interest in the Company's operations and development of earnings. In view of these considerations  it is the Board's opinion that LTIP 2022 will benefit both the employees and the Company's shareholders through increased share value.LTIP 2022The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a directed new issue of not more than 130 000 warrants  hereinafter referred to as (""Warrants"")  and subsequent transfer of not more than 130 000 Warrants. The right to subscribe for Warrants shall only vest with senior executives and key individuals in the XVIVO group. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one share.Participants in LTIP 2022 shall no later than 6 May 2022 notify XVIVO of the number of Warrants that the participant wishes to subscribe. The Warrants will be acquired at market value assessed by the Company  which shall be determined by way of the Warrants being valued by an independent party in accordance with the Black & Scholes valuation model. At the valuation according to the Black & Scholes valuation model the following variables will be used; a subscription price of 150 percent of the XVIVO share's average volume-weighted closing price during twenty (20) subsequent banking days in relation to the date of the resolution by the annual general meeting and a term of three (3) years. Other variables such as volatility and risk-free interest rate in percent shall be reviewed and recommended by an experienced external financial advisor appointed by the Company. Provided that the subscription price will be SEK 250  the Warrant premium will amount to SEK 20.The Board of Directors of XVIVO shall  provided that the employment of participants has not been terminated  at the earliest after two years be able to resolve to subsidize 50 percent of the original Warrant premium  paid by the participant  by a one-time payment by the Company to the participant. Since the participant shall pay income tax on the payment  a one-time payment per participant will be possible which  after taxation  corresponds to half of the paid Warrant premium.In connection with the allotment of the Warrants  the Board shall have the right to make adjustments to comply with organisational changes and special rules or market conditions abroad and reserve the right to repurchase the Warrants if the participant in turn wishes to transfer the Warrants.Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new share in XVIVO during the period from 6 May 2025 to 31 May 2025. The subscription price for shares subscribed for on the basis of the Warrants shall correspond to 150 percent of the XVIVO share's average volume-weighted closing price during twenty (20) subsequent banking days in relation to the date of the resolution by the annual general meeting. The subscription price shall be paid in cash or by set-off.The exercise price  as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10  whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded downwards. The exercise price and the number of shares that each Warrant entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue etc. in accordance with market practice.The Company shall have the right  but no obligation  to acquire at market value such number of Warrants that enables the participant to exercise the remaining Warrants to subscribe for shares  whereby the subscription proceeds are paid by way of set-off against the claim on sold Warrants. The Company shall also have the right  but no obligation  to acquire some or all Warrants at market value instead of subscription of shares in order to avoid dilution.Holders of Warrants whose employment is terminated or who wish to sell their Warrants shall offer the Company to acquire the Warrants at a price corresponding to the lowest of the premium paid for the Warrants at the time of acquisition and the market value.Allocation of WarrantsThe LTIP 2022 shall comprise of not more than approximately 12 senior executives and key individuals within the XVIVO group. The maximum number of Warrants per participant in the LTIP 2022 follows from the table below.Category Maximum number of Warrants per person Maximum number of Warrants per category CEO - category 1 20 000 20 000 Remaining senior executives and key individuals - category 2 10 000 110 000In the event of changes in positions and employments remaining Warrants in a category can be used in an alternative category.Costs for the incentive programmeThe Warrants which initially are transferred to participants in Sweden are made at a price corresponding to the Warrants' market value at the time of the transfer  which entails that no social security contributions will be incurred for the XVIVO group. Under the assumption that the LTIP 2022 is fully subscribed  the Company's subsidized one-time payments to the employees will amount to SEK 2 600 000 after two years and entail social security contributions of approximately SEK 1 300 000.The Warrants which are transferred to participants in other countries may incur social security contributions and expenses in accordance with the accounting principles set out in IFRS2.Costs for financial and legal advice in connection with the LTIP 2022 will amount to approximately SEK 250 000.As the Company's costs for LTIP 2022 will be relatively limited  the Board of Directors have resolved to propose to the annual general meeting to resolve to not cover these.DilutionBased on the outstanding number of shares in the Company  LTIP 2022 will upon exercise of all 130 000 Warrants increase the share capital by a maximum of SEK 3 323 and  at the time of the notice  entail a maximum dilution corresponding to approximately 0.4 percent of the total number of outstanding capital and number of votes in the Company. If all the outstanding incentive programmes in the Company are included in the calculation  at the time of the notice  the maximum dilution will amount to approximately 2.0 percent of the total number of outstanding capital and number of votes in the Company.Preparation of the proposalLTIP 2022 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with the remuneration committee and external advisers.The Board of Directors  or a special committee set up by the Board  shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of LTIP 2022  in accordance with the presented terms and guidelines including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in‚Äëbetween bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or similar measures. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet specific foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also be entitled to make other adjustments if significant changes occur in the XVIVO group or in its environment that would result in that the adopted terms for the LTIP 2022 no longer fulfils their objectives.15B. Directed issue of warrants  Series 2022/2025  to participantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 130 000 Warrants entitling to subscription for new shares  as a result of which the Company's share capital may increase by a maximum of SEK 3 323.The right to subscribe for the Warrants shall only vest with senior executives and key individuals within the XVIVO group with the right and obligation to manage the Warrants as described above. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one share. The Warrants will be acquired at market value assessed by the Company  which shall be determined by way of the Warrants being valued by an independent party in accordance with the Black & Scholes valuation model.Special authorisationsThe Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting instruct the Board of Directors to implement the decisions above and to ensure that the Board of Directors transfers the Warrants in accordance with what is stated above.The Board further proposes that the annual general meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Item 16 - Resolution to authorise the board of directors to resolve on new share issuesThe Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  to resolve on new share issues.The authorisation may be utilised for new issues of shares  which may be made with provisions regarding contribution in cash  in kind or through set-off corresponding to not more than 10 per cent of the registered share capital in the Company at the time of the issue resolution. The subscription price shall be determined on market terms and conditions. However  in order to enable delivery of shares in connection with a cash issue as described above  this may  if the Board of Directors deems it appropriate  be made at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares  whereby the issue is directed to an issuing agent that acts as a settlement bank for investors.Deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be possible in connection with future investments in the form of acquisitions of operations  companies  shares in companies or otherwise for the Company's future expansion. If the Board resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the rationale shall be that the Board shall be able to issue shares in the Company to be used as a means of in-kind payment or the right to offset debt or to in a flexible and cost-efficient manner raise capital to use as means of payment or to continuously adjust the Company's capital structure.The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to make any adjustments or amendments of the above resolution which may be required in connection with the registration of such resolution and to take any other measure deemed necessary for the execution of the resolution.Item 17 - Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of the Company's own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to acquire the Company's own shares. Shares may be acquired to the extent that the Company's holding of its own shares  on any occasion  does not exceed ten (10) per cent of the Company's total outstanding shares. Acquisitions of shares shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price interval registered at any given time  by which is meant the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed authorisation is to give the Board the opportunity to adapt the Company's capital structure to its capital needs and thereby  among other things  be able to use the repurchased shares as a means of payment for the acquisition of assets or rights.The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to make any adjustments or amendments of the above resolution which may be required in connection with the registration of such resolution and to take any other measure deemed necessary for the execution of the resolution.MISCELLANEOUSSpecial majority requirementThe Board of Directors' proposal for resolutions in accordance with 15A - 15B above constitute a package  as the various proposals are dependent on and strongly linked to each other. Therefore  it is proposed that the annual general meeting make a single resolution in connection with the abovementioned proposals  in compliance with the majority requirement specified in Chapter 16  Section 8 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that the resolution shall be supported by shareholders representing at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.For valid resolutions in accordance with item 16 and 17 above  it is required that the proposals be supported by at least two thirds (2/3) of the shares represented and votes cast at the general meeting.Number of shares and votesThe number of shares and votes in XVIVO amounts to 29 498 666 per the day for the issuance of this notice.

The guidelines encompass remuneration to the Board of Directors  the CEO and the executive management  however  these guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the Annual General Meeting.The Board of Directors shall be entitled to temporarily depart from these guidelines  in whole or in part  if special reasons justify doing so in an individual case and such deviation is necessary in order to meet the company's long-term interests or to ensure the company's financial viability. If such a departure occurs  it must be reported in the remuneration report before the next Annual General Meeting. The guidelines pertain to the period starting from the 2022 Annual General Meeting. Any issue regarding departure from the guidelines shall be prepared by the remuneration committee and decided by the Board of Directors.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interest and sustainabilityMycronic is a global high-tech company that develops  manufactures and supplies market-leading production equipment with high requirements on precision and flexibility to the electronics industry. Mycronic has three priorities within the framework of the company's long-term strategy. These are: consolidating the company's strong position within the Pattern Generators division; increasing or retaining profitability in the High Flex  High Volume and Global Technologies divisions; and increasing the company's proximity to customers. The strategy also includes creating value through a focus on sustainability.The Board of Directors considers that it is critical for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  that the company is able to recruit and retain members of the executive management with the competence and capacity to achieve specified goals. To this end  the company must offer competitive remuneration to motivate the executive management. Short-term variable pay covered by these guidelines shall be based on criteria that aim at promoting the company's business strategy and long-term interests  and where the fulfillment of the criteria is determined by the method set out below.Forms of remuneration  etc.The remuneration and other terms of employment for members of the executive management shall be based on market terms. Total remuneration consists of base salary and variable pay  pension and other benefits. Long-term variable pay is excluded in the calculation of the total remuneration and the relative proportion of the remuneration components.Fixed remunerationIn establishing the base salary for the CEO and members of the executive management  the scope and complexity of the position in question  as well as the individual's performance is taken into account. The executive managements' salaries are  like the other components of remuneration  subject to annual review by the Remuneration Committee  with the support of external salary statistics ensure that the salaries remain competitive. The base salary constitutes a maximum of 65 percent of total remuneration in the event of a maximum outcome of short-term variable pay.Short-term variable remunerationThe remuneration is paid in accordance with goals achieved. The criteria  such as order intake or EBIT  are established in order to contribute to the company's business strategy  long-term interests and thus to the company's long-term value creation. The fulfillment of the criteria is determined through the company's audited annual accounts. Short-term variable pay can amount to a maximum of 110 percent of base salary and 55 percent of total remuneration. Variable pay shall not be pensionable  unless otherwise provided by mandatory law or obligations in applicable collective bargaining agreements. The outcome is prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board of Directors in connection with the end of the qualification period and the remuneration is thereafter paid out. The company has no contractual right to recover the remuneration.Long-term variable remunerationMembers of the executive management can be offered incentive programs  which mainly should be share or share price-related. An incentive program is intended to improve the participants' commitment to the company's development and shall be introduced on market-based terms.Resolutions on share or share price-related incentive programs must be passed at an Annual General Meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines.Other long-term remunerationThere are already existing agreements on long-term variable pay linked to continued employment for certain members of the executive management.BenefitsPensionMembers of the executive management employed in Sweden after 2012 are covered by the contribution-defined plan under ITP1. Members of the executive management employed prior to 1 January 2022 have a supplementary contribution-defined pension plan in addition to the ITP plan. The retirement age for members of the executive management employed in Sweden is 65 years. For members of the executive management employed outside of Sweden  locally competitive pension plans and retirement ages are applied.Other benefitsOther benefits e.g. car benefits and health care plans are established based on them being competitive in the local market.Pension and other benefits constitute a maximum of 40 percent of total remuneration in the event of a maximum outcome of short-term variable pay.Special adjustmentsRegarding employment conditions that are governed by rules other than those applying in Sweden  appropriate adjustments may be made in order to comply with such mandatory rules or local practice  whereby the overall purpose of these guidelines shall be met.Notice of termination and severance payThe employment or contractual agreements of members of the executive management shall be valid until further notice or for a specified period of time.For the CEO  in the event of termination by the company  a twelve months notice period and twelve months severance pay apply.For members of the executive management employed in Sweden  the mutual notice period is a maximum of six months. Upon termination by the company  six months' severance pay also applies. During notice period  the current employment contract runs with associated benefits. In cases where severance pay would be paid  no other benefits will be paid after the expiry of the notice period. For other members of the executive management who are locally employed outside of Sweden  employment or contractual agreements shall comply with mandatory rules applicable in the relevant jurisdiction or local practice  entailing that e.g. other term of the employment (or term of contract as the case may be)  other notice periods and other agreements on severance pay may be applicable in the individual case.Salary and terms of employmentIn preparing the Board of Directors' proposal for guidelines on remuneration to members of the executive management  the salaries and terms of employment for the company's other employees have been taken into account. Information about the executive managements' total remuneration  components of their remuneration  as well as increases in remuneration and rates of increase over time have been obtained and have constituted a part of the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' decision basis in their evaluation of the fairness of the guidelines and the limitations arising from them.The resolution processThe Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines when there is a need for significant changes to the guidelines  however at least every four years. The Board of Directors' proposal is prepared by the Remuneration Committee. The Chairman of the Board of Directors may also be Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. In order to manage conflicts of interest  other members of the Remuneration Committee who are elected by the Annual General Meeting must be independent in relation to the company and members of the executive management.The Remuneration Committee shall  inter alia  monitor and evaluate the application of the guidelines for remuneration to members of the executive management resolved by the Annual General Meeting. When the Remuneration Committee has prepared the proposal  it is submitted to the Board of Directors for decision. The CEO or other members of members of the executive management shall not be present while the Board of Directors addresses issues related to remuneration and passes resolutions about them  insofar as they are affected by the issues.If the Annual General Meeting resolves not to adopt guidelines when there is a proposal for such  the Board of Directors shall submit a new proposal no later than at the next Annual General Meeting. In such cases  remuneration shall be paid in accordance with the current guidelines or  if no guidelines exist  in accordance with the company's practice.External advisors are used in the preparation of these matters when deemed necessary.Review of the guidelinesThe guidelines for remuneration to members of the executive management were reviewed ahead of the 2022 Annual General Meeting  and did not result in any adjustments.Item 16: Proposal regarding composition of nomination committeeThe nomination committee proposes that a new nomination committee for the 2023 Annual General Meeting is appointed by the Chairman of the Board ‚Äì at the latest by the end of the third quarter of 2022 ‚Äì contacting the three largest or otherwise known shareholders per 31 August  2022. The term of office shall run until a new nomination committee commences its service.The composition of the nomination committee shall be published no later than six months before the company's Annual General Meeting.The responsibility of the nomination committee regarding the 2023 Annual General Meeting includes proposing (i) chairman of the meeting  (ii) the number of Board members  (iii) election of members of the Board and Chairman of the Board and remuneration to Board members and the Chairman of the Board and remuneration to members of Board committees  (iv) election of auditor and remuneration to auditor and (v) the process for appointment of a new nomination committee.The nomination committee proposes that the Annual General Meeting decides that the instruction to the nomination committee shall be the same as last year.Item 17: The Board of Directors' proposal on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve to issue new sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors up until the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to issue new shares  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. Shares may be paid in kind  through set-off or with other conditions set forth in Chapter 13  Section 5  first paragraph item 6 in the Swedish Companies Act. The Board of Directors may otherwise set the terms of such share issuance. The authorization shall however not comprise a right for the Board to issue shares against cash payment and with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The issue price shall be determined on marketable grounds and the number of issued shares may not exceed ten percent of the total amount of outstanding shares in the company per the day of this notice.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and the right to decide on payment through set-off  in kind or other condition as set forth in the Swedish Companies Act is to enable the company to issue shares in order to acquire shares  business or product rights.Majority requirementsA valid resolution under item 17 above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.Item 18: The Board of Directors' proposal on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve for the company to acquire the company's own sharesThe Board of Directors shall be authorized  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to decide to acquire the company's own shares in accordance with the following.Acquisition may only be made by a maximum of so many shares that  at any given time  the company's own holdings do not exceed five percent of all shares in the company Acquisition of shares in the company may only be made on Nasdaq Stockholm (the ""Exchange"") Acquisition of shares on the Exchange may only take place at a price within the price range recorded on the Exchange at any given time The payment for the shares shall be paid in cash The authorization may be used on one or several occasions up until the end of the 2023 Annual General MeetingThe purpose of the above authorizations to acquire shares is to enable delivery of shares to participants in LTIP 2022 (the introduction of a new long term incentive program  LTIP 2022  is subject to a separate resolution in item 19 in the notice for the 2022 Annual General Meeting) and to be able to continuously adjust the company's capital structure to the company's capital requirements.Shares that have been acquired by the company and which have not been reserved in order to secure the company's delivery of shares under LTIP 2022 are intended to be canceled following a resolution thereof at the 2023 Annual General Meeting.Majority requirementsA valid resolution under item 18 above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.Item 19: The Board of Directors' proposal regarding Long Term Incentive Program 2022 (LTIP 2022)Mycronic's Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting passes a resolution on the implementation of a Long Term Incentive Program 2022 (LTIP 2022). This proposal is divided into four items:A. Terms of LTIP 2022B. Transfer of the company's own shares under LTIP 2022 and hedging activitiesC. Hedging of LTIP 2022 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyD. Other matters related to LTIP 2022A. Terms of LTIP 2022A.1 IntroductionThe Board wishes to establish a long-term incentive program for certain key employees in order to encourage personal long-term ownership of Mycronic shares as well as to increase and enhance its ability to recruit  retain and motivate employees. The Board therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance share program 2022 (""LTIP 2022""). The intention is also to use LTIP 2021 to unite the interest of the employees with the interests of shareholders.Participants may  after a qualifying period  receive allotments of Mycronic ordinary shares without consideration. The number of allotted shares will depend on the fulfilment of certain performance targets. The term of LTIP 2022 is more than three years.A.2 Basic features of LTIP 2022The LTIP 2022 will be directed towards certain key employees in the Mycronic Group. The participants are based in Sweden and other countries where the Mycronic Group is active. Each participant may be entitled  after a certain qualification period (defined below)  provided continued employment during the entire period (except from ""Good Leavers"")  and depending on the fulfilment of certain performance targets linked to Mycronic's Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")  to receive allotment of Mycronic shares (""Performance Shares""). The participant shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares. Performance Shares are Mycronic ordinary shares.A.3 Participation in LTIP 2022LTIP 2022 is directed towards a maximum of 70 employees  divided in three categories of participants:Category Maximum number of shares per personA) CEO (maximum 1 person) 8 900B) Management Group (maximum 10 persons) 3 400C) Other key employees (maximum 59 persons) 1 400Any resolution on participation or implementation of LTIP 2022 shall be conditional on that it  in the Board's judgement  can be offered with reasonable administrative costs and financial effects.A.4 Allotment of Performance SharesAllotment of Performance Shares within LTIP 2022 will be made during a limited period of time following the Annual General Meeting 2025. The period up to this date is referred to as the qualification period (vesting period). A condition for the participant to receive allotment of Performance Shares is that the participant remains an employee of the Mycronic Group during the full qualification period up until allotment. Allotment of Performance Shares also requires that the EPS performance targets are fulfilled. The Board shall establish a customary definition of Good Leavers and determine whether any allocation shall be made to participants who are considered Good Leavers.The performance target is Mycronic's EPS and the performance target shall be established by the Board. Partial fulfilment of the performance targets will result in partial allotment of Performance Shares. Performance under a certain level will result in no allotment. The EPS targets and the outcome will be communicated to the shareholders after the allotment of Performance Shares to participants.Prior to the allotment of Performance Shares  the Board shall assess whether the allotment is reasonable in relation to the company's financial results  position and performance  as well as other factors.If significant changes take place within the Mycronic Group  or on the market  which  by the assessment of the Board  would mean that the terms for allocation/transfer of shares according to LTIP 2022 is no longer reasonable  the Board shall have the right to implement an adjustment to LTIP 2022  including  among others  the right to reduce the number of Performance Shares allocated/transferred  or not to allocate/transfer Performance Shares at all.A.5 Implementation and administration etceteraThe Board  with the assistance of the remuneration committee  shall in accordance with the resolutions by the Annual General Meeting set forth herein be responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2022. The Board may also decide on the implementation of an alternative cash based incentive for participants in countries where the allotment of Performance Shares is not appropriate  as well as if otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTIP 2022.The intention is that the Board shall launch LTIP 2022 as soon as practically possible after the Annual General Meeting.In the event that the general meeting does not resolve in accordance with item B with the required majority  the Company shall hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party in accordance with what is stated in item C below.B. Transfer of the company's own shares under LTIP 2022 and hedging activities.B1. Number of sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that transfer of up to 125 500 Mycronic shares under LTIP 2022 may be made in accordance with the below. The number of shares is calculated on the basis of maximum participation and maximum fulfilment of performance requirements.B2. Other conditions for transfer of Mycronic sharesMycronic shares may be transferred to the participants in LTIP 2022.Share transfers to participants in LTIP 2022 shall be made without the participants paying consideration and shall be carried out at the time and subject to the other conditions under which participants in LTIP 2022 have the right to be allotted shares.The number of Mycronic shares that might be transferred under LTIP 2022 shall be subject to customary re-calculation principles and may  consequently  be subject to re-calculation due to a bonus issue  share split  dividends and/or other similar events. Resolutions resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting 2022 shall not be included in a re-calculation of the number of shares.B.3 Grounds for the Board's proposal and alternative hedging via an equity swap agreement with a third party etceteraSince the Board believes that the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer Mycronic shares under LTIP 2022 is obtained through transfer of own shares  the Board proposes that transfers are secured as described above in this item B. Should the necessary majority not be obtained for the proposal in item B  the Board will enter into a share swap agreement  in accordance with item C below.Share swap agreement will also be relevant should this be more appropriate  for example due to the fact that the acquisition of own shares cannot be made to the extent required to be able to transfer shares under LTIP 2022.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights to acquire the own shares is that the company shall be able to secure the delivery of shares under LTIP 2022.C. Hedge of LTIP 2022 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyIn the event that the necessary majority is not obtained for item B above  the company will hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer shares in the company under LTIP 2022. The relevant number of shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed under item B above. The cost of hedging by entering into an equity swap agreement  excluding any dividends and without regard to the development of Mycronic's share price  exceeds SEK 1 million during the term of the program.D. Other matters in relation to LTIP 2022D.1 Majority requirements etc.The resolution according to item A above shall require a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. A valid resolution under item B above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.D.2 Estimated costs  expenses and financial effects of LTIP 2022LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 ‚Äì Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the share awards should be expensed as personnel costs over the qualification period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security contributions will be recognized as an expense in the income statement through regular provisions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The amount of these regular provisions will be revalued in line with the trend in the value of the right to Performance Shares  and the contributions payable on the allotment of Performance Shares.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 178  and that the performance targets are achieved so that 50 percent of the maximum number of Performance Shares vest  including a share price increase of 50 percent during the qualification period and an annual employee turnover of 5 percent  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to SEK 14.1 million before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of SEK 4.7 million before tax.Assuming that the performance targets are achieved so that 100 percent of the maximum number of Performance Shares vest  and otherwise the same assumptions as above  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to SEK 28.2 million before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of SEK 9.4 million before tax.LTIP 2022 will comprise maximum 125 500 shares in total  which corresponds to 0.13 percent of the total outstanding shares and votes in the company on a fully diluted basis.The above calculations are based on a decision on hedging in accordance with item B.In the view of the Board  the positive effects expected to arise from LTIP 2022  outweigh the costs associated with LTIP 2022.D.3 The Board's explanatory statementAn individual long-term ownership commitment among the participants in LTIP 2022 is expected to stimulate greater interest and motivation in the company's business operations  results and strategy. Moreover  the Board wishes to increase the ability of Mycronic to retain important key employees. The Board believes that the implementation of LTIP 2022 will benefit Mycronic and its shareholders. LTIP 2022 will provide a competitive and motivation-improving incentive for executives and other key employees within the Group.LTIP 2022 has been designed to reward the participants for increased shareholder value by allotting shares  based on the fulfilment of conditions in respect of results and operations. By linking the employees' remuneration to the development of Mycronic's results and value  the long-term value growth of Mycronic is rewarded. Based on these circumstances  the Board considers that the implementation of LTIP 2022 will have a positive effect on the Mycronic Group's continued development  and will therefore be beneficial to the shareholders and Mycronic.D.4 Other share-related incentive programsThe company's share-related incentive programs are described on pages 49-51 in the company's annual report.D.5 Adjustment AuthorizationThe Board  or a person appointed by the Board  shall be authorized to make adjustments to the above resolutions that may be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB respectively.D.6 Preparation of the itemThe basis for LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the Board of the company. The work has been supported by external advisors and has been made in consultation with shareholders. The Board has thereafter decided to present this proposal for the general meeting. Except for the staff that have prepared the matter upon instruction from the Board  no employee that may be a participant of LTIP 2022 has participated in the preparations of the program's terms.The financial statements and the audit report regarding the financial year 2021  as well as the nomination committee's and the Board of Director's complete proposals including related documentation will be available at the company at Nytorpsv√§gen 9 in T√§by not later than by 14 April 2022  on the company website and will also be sent by post to shareholders requesting so and stating their postal address. The same applies to the Board of Directors report in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551) and the auditor's opinion in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 54 of the same law.The total number of shares and votes in the company amounts to 97 916 509. The company does not hold any of these shares. Shareholders are reminded of the right to  at the Annual General Meeting  ask questions to the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act  Chapter 7  Section 32.For information on how your personal data is processed  please see https://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfT√§by in March 2022Mycronic AB (publ)The Board of DirectorsN.B.

The remaining amount of the profit is proposed to be carried forward in a new account.Presentation of the remuneration report for approval (item 16)The board proposes that the Annual General Meeting approves the board's report regarding remuneration pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act.Resolution regarding adoption of a stock option program  issuance of warrants and transfer of warrants (item 17)The board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a long-term  share based  incentive program in accordance with items A.-C. (the ""Stock Option Program 2022/2025"")  which materially has the same structure as the stock option programs adopted by the Annual General Meeting in 2019 (""Stock Option Program 2019/2022"") and the Annual General Meeting 2020 (""Stock Option Program 2020/2023"").The objective of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is to link a portion of the employees' remuneration to INVISIO's long-term performance and value creation for the shareholders. Thereby the long-term interests of the employees aligns with the interests of the shareholders. In addition  the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 will be an important tool for INVISIO to recruit  retain and motivate the company's employees and the board considers the program beneficial for both INVISIO and its shareholders in the coming years. Board members elected by the general meeting are not allowed to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.A. ADOPTION OF THE PROGRAM1. The Stock Option Program 2022/2025 in briefAll INVISIO group employees shall be entitled to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.Based on performance  position and the employee's importance to the INVISIO group  the employees will be granted stock options which entitle the participants to acquire shares in INVISIO during 2025  subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 (the ""Stock Options""). If the participant (i) throughout the entire vesting period of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  which runs from the allotment of the Stock Option up to and including 8 May 2025 (the ""Vesting Period"")  with certain exceptions  is employed by the INVISIO group and (ii) to the extent the performance based criteria for the Stock Options has been reached during 6 May 2022 ‚Äì 8 May 2025 (the ""Measurement Period"")  the participants will be entitled to acquire shares in INVISIO during May ‚Äì June 2025.To ensure INVISIO's undertaking to deliver shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  the board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 700 000 warrants (each warrant entitles to subscription for one (1) share in INVISIO) to a wholly-owned Danish subsidiary  INVISIO A/S (the ""Subsidiary""). To such extent the performance criteria of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is reached  the warrants shall be exercised to deliver shares in INVISIO to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.2. CostsPursuant to IFRS 2  the Stock Options are to be recorded as a personnel expense during the Vesting Period and should be reported directly against equity. Based on the assumption of a share price of SEK 160 at the time of allotment and calculated by using the Black & Scholes and Monte Carlo methods  the estimated total reported cost for the Stock Options is approx. SEK 13.8 million for the period 2022/2025.In the event of a positive price trend  social security costs will arise due to the Stock Options. These costs shall be written off during the tenor of the Stock Options based on the value changes of the Stock Options.Based on the assumption that all 700 000 Stock Options will be exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO on 15 May 2025  and the INVISIO share price increases with 30 per cent and outperforms the SIXPRX Index (see definition below in item 5.5) by 20 percentage points during the Vesting Period  the social security costs are estimated to be approx. SEK 3.0 million. The costs are continuously reviewed during the Vesting Period.3. Dilution and effects on important key ratiosUp to 700 000 Stock Options may be issued to the participants in the program. The maximum number of shares in INVISIO which may be subscribed for in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is 700 000  corresponding to an increase of the share capital of a maximum of SEK 700 000. Based on the current number of outstanding shares  the maximum dilution resulting from the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 will be approx. 1.5 per cent of outstanding shares and votes  provided that all Stock Options are exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO. The total dilution resulting from all Stock Options being exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO in Stock Option Program 2019/2022  Stock Option Program 2020/2023 and Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is approximately 4.1 per cent based on the number of outstanding shares and votes as of today.The costs and dilution are expected to have only a marginal effect on the key ratios of INVISIO.4. Other share related incentive programsThere are two ongoing share related incentive programs in INVISIO  the Stock Option Program 2019/2022  adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2019  and the Stock Option Program 2020/2023  adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020.5.

Persons who  at the time of allotment  have resigned from their employment  or who have been dismissed from their employment by INVISIO  will not be granted Stock Options. Future employees  who have not yet commenced their employment at the time of allotment  may  conditioned upon that the employment commences on 1 December 2022 at the latest  be offered to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 if the board considers it compatible with the objective of the program.The participants may be granted the maximum number of Stock Options as stated below.Category 1 ‚Äì CEO may be granted a maximum of 24 000 Stock Options.Category 2 ‚Äì a maximum of six senior executives  may be granted a maximum of 12 000 Stock Options per person.Category 3 ‚Äì other employees  approx. 183 persons  may be granted a maximum of 6 000 Stock Options per person.Allotment of Stock Options shall be based on inter alia the participant's performance  position and importance for INVISIO.No employee is guaranteed to be granted Stock Options.5.3 Stock Option price and purchase priceThe granted Stock Options are received free of charge.After the Stock Options have been granted and vested  and to the extent the performance criteria for the Stock Options have been reached  each Stock Option entitles to the acquisition of one (1) share in INVISIO at a price corresponding to the average share price of INVISIO's share during the period 1 April 2022 ‚Äì 30 April 2022 (the ""Purchase Price""). The average share price shall be calculated as the average for each trading day calculated average volume-weighted price paid for the INVISIO share on Nasdaq Stockholm  round off to the nearest full ten √∂re whereby five √∂re shall be round off upwards.5.4 Vesting conditionsIf  for whatever reason  a participant's employment with the INVISIO group would come to an end before the end of the Vesting Period  the Stock Options will lapse and cannot be exercised.

(SIXPRX displays the average development (including dividends) on Nasdaq Stockholm adjusted for stock fund placement limitations.)In order for all (100 per cent) of the Stock Options to entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO it is required that the share price development for INVISIO surpasses SIXPRX with 20 percentage points. If the share price development surpasses SIXPRX with 10 percentage points  half (50 per cent) of the participant's Stock Options will entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO. If the share price development for the INVISIO share surpasses SIXPRX with more than 10 but with less than 20 percentage points  the Stock Options will entitle to acquisition of shares in INVISIO on a linear basis between 50 to 100 per cent. If the share price development in INVISIO does not surpasses SIXPRX with 10 percentage points  all (100 per cent) of the Stock Options will lapse.5.6 ExerciseThe exercise of Stock Options to acquire new shares in INVISIO may  to the extent the performance criteria for the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is reached and the participant has fulfilled the vesting conditions  occur during the period 15 May ‚Äì 30 June 2025 (the ""Exercise Period"").The Exercise Period may be postponed if the board deems it suitable.The Stock Options will automatically lapse and may no longer be exercised at the end of the Exercise Period.5.7 Transfer and pledgingStock Options are non-transferrable and may not be pledged.5.8 RecalculationAs far as the warrants  which have been issued to secure delivery of shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  are subject to recalculation according to the terms and conditions for warrants  the Stock Options shall be recalculated accordingly.Recalculation shall take place in the event of e.g. bonus issues  rights issues  reverse share splits and share splits in accordance with the terms and conditions for warrants 2022/2025  which are available on INVISIO's website.5.9 Change of controlIn the event of a change of control in INVISIO  which inter alia includes that someone  directly or indirectly  owns or controls 50 per cent or more of the votes in INVISIO as well as in certain other events  participants have a right to exercise granted Stock Options in advance  i.e. even during the Vesting Period.5.10 Preparation and administrationThe Stock Options shall be subject to the provisions of separate agreements with each participant.The board shall be responsible for preparing the agreements with the participants and the administration of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  with its primary terms and conditions being in accordance with the resolution by the Annual General Meeting. In connection therewith  the board may make adjustments in order to fulfil specific rules or market conditions. Further  the board may make other adjustments  including to resolve to reduce the number of Stock Options which may be exercised to acquire new shares (wholly or partially) for all employees or certain categories of employees which are encompassed by the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  if significant changes occur in the INVISIO group or on the market that the board considers entailing that the conditions for acquisition of new shares in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 no longer fulfils the objective of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.B. ISSUANCE OF WARRANTSIn order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  the board of INVISIO proposes that INVISIO  deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues a maximum of 700 000 warrants  Series 2022/2025  entitling to subscription of new shares in INVISIO as follows.1. The warrants shall be issued free of charge.

With deviation of the shareholders' preferential rights  Invisio A/S shall be entitled to subscribe for the warrants.3. The warrants shall be subscribed for by 10 May 2022 at the latest. The term of subscription may be extended by the board.4. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of shares from the day the warrants are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 31 December 2025.5.

If such a departure occurs  it must be reported in the remuneration report before the next Annual General Meeting. The guidelines pertain to the period starting from the 2022 Annual General Meeting. Any issue regarding departure from the guidelines shall be prepared by the remuneration committee and decided by the Board of Directors.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interest and sustainabilityMycronic is a global high-tech company that develops  manufactures and supplies market-leading production equipment with high requirements on precision and flexibility to the electronics industry. Mycronic has three priorities within the framework of the company's long-term strategy. These are: consolidating the company's strong position within the Pattern Generators division; increasing or retaining profitability in the High Flex  High Volume and Global Technologies divisions; and increasing the company's proximity to customers. The strategy also includes creating value through a focus on sustainability.The Board of Directors considers that it is critical for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  that the company is able to recruit and retain members of the executive management with the competence and capacity to achieve specified goals. To this end  the company must offer competitive remuneration to motivate the executive management. Short-term variable pay covered by these guidelines shall be based on criteria that aim at promoting the company's business strategy and long-term interests  and where the fulfillment of the criteria is determined by the method set out below.Forms of remuneration  etc.The remuneration and other terms of employment for members of the executive management shall be based on market terms. Total remuneration consists of base salary and variable pay  pension and other benefits. Long-term variable pay is excluded in the calculation of the total remuneration and the relative proportion of the remuneration components.Fixed remunerationIn establishing the base salary for the CEO and members of the executive management  the scope and complexity of the position in question  as well as the individual's performance is taken into account. The executive managements' salaries are  like the other components of remuneration  subject to annual review by the Remuneration Committee  with the support of external salary statistics ensure that the salaries remain competitive. The base salary constitutes a maximum of 65 percent of total remuneration in the event of a maximum outcome of short-term variable pay.Short-term variable remunerationThe remuneration is paid in accordance with goals achieved. The criteria  such as order intake or EBIT  are established in order to contribute to the company's business strategy  long-term interests and thus to the company's long-term value creation. The fulfillment of the criteria is determined through the company's audited annual accounts. Short-term variable pay can amount to a maximum of 110 percent of base salary and 55 percent of total remuneration. Variable pay shall not be pensionable  unless otherwise provided by mandatory law or obligations in applicable collective bargaining agreements. The outcome is prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board of Directors in connection with the end of the qualification period and the remuneration is thereafter paid out. The company has no contractual right to recover the remuneration.Long-term variable remunerationMembers of the executive management can be offered incentive programs  which mainly should be share or share price-related. An incentive program is intended to improve the participants' commitment to the company's development and shall be introduced on market-based terms.Resolutions on share or share price-related incentive programs must be passed at an Annual General Meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines.Other long-term remunerationThere are already existing agreements on long-term variable pay linked to continued employment for certain members of the executive management.BenefitsPensionMembers of the executive management employed in Sweden after 2012 are covered by the contribution-defined plan under ITP1. Members of the executive management employed prior to 1 January 2022 have a supplementary contribution-defined pension plan in addition to the ITP plan. The retirement age for members of the executive management employed in Sweden is 65 years. For members of the executive management employed outside of Sweden  locally competitive pension plans and retirement ages are applied.Other benefitsOther benefits e.g. car benefits and health care plans are established based on them being competitive in the local market.Pension and other benefits constitute a maximum of 40 percent of total remuneration in the event of a maximum outcome of short-term variable pay.Special adjustmentsRegarding employment conditions that are governed by rules other than those applying in Sweden  appropriate adjustments may be made in order to comply with such mandatory rules or local practice  whereby the overall purpose of these guidelines shall be met.Notice of termination and severance payThe employment or contractual agreements of members of the executive management shall be valid until further notice or for a specified period of time.For the CEO  in the event of termination by the company  a twelve months notice period and twelve months severance pay apply.For members of the executive management employed in Sweden  the mutual notice period is a maximum of six months. Upon termination by the company  six months' severance pay also applies. During notice period  the current employment contract runs with associated benefits. In cases where severance pay would be paid  no other benefits will be paid after the expiry of the notice period. For other members of the executive management who are locally employed outside of Sweden  employment or contractual agreements shall comply with mandatory rules applicable in the relevant jurisdiction or local practice  entailing that e.g. other term of the employment (or term of contract as the case may be)  other notice periods and other agreements on severance pay may be applicable in the individual case.Salary and terms of employmentIn preparing the Board of Directors' proposal for guidelines on remuneration to members of the executive management  the salaries and terms of employment for the company's other employees have been taken into account. Information about the executive managements' total remuneration  components of their remuneration  as well as increases in remuneration and rates of increase over time have been obtained and have constituted a part of the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' decision basis in their evaluation of the fairness of the guidelines and the limitations arising from them.The resolution processThe Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines when there is a need for significant changes to the guidelines  however at least every four years. The Board of Directors' proposal is prepared by the Remuneration Committee. The Chairman of the Board of Directors may also be Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. In order to manage conflicts of interest  other members of the Remuneration Committee who are elected by the Annual General Meeting must be independent in relation to the company and members of the executive management.The Remuneration Committee shall  inter alia  monitor and evaluate the application of the guidelines for remuneration to members of the executive management resolved by the Annual General Meeting. When the Remuneration Committee has prepared the proposal  it is submitted to the Board of Directors for decision. The CEO or other members of members of the executive management shall not be present while the Board of Directors addresses issues related to remuneration and passes resolutions about them  insofar as they are affected by the issues.If the Annual General Meeting resolves not to adopt guidelines when there is a proposal for such  the Board of Directors shall submit a new proposal no later than at the next Annual General Meeting. In such cases  remuneration shall be paid in accordance with the current guidelines or  if no guidelines exist  in accordance with the company's practice.External advisors are used in the preparation of these matters when deemed necessary.Review of the guidelinesThe guidelines for remuneration to members of the executive management were reviewed ahead of the 2022 Annual General Meeting  and did not result in any adjustments.Item 16: Proposal regarding composition of nomination committeeThe nomination committee proposes that a new nomination committee for the 2023 Annual General Meeting is appointed by the Chairman of the Board ‚Äì at the latest by the end of the third quarter of 2022 ‚Äì contacting the three largest or otherwise known shareholders per 31 August  2022. The term of office shall run until a new nomination committee commences its service.The composition of the nomination committee shall be published no later than six months before the company's Annual General Meeting.The responsibility of the nomination committee regarding the 2023 Annual General Meeting includes proposing (i) chairman of the meeting  (ii) the number of Board members  (iii) election of members of the Board and Chairman of the Board and remuneration to Board members and the Chairman of the Board and remuneration to members of Board committees  (iv) election of auditor and remuneration to auditor and (v) the process for appointment of a new nomination committee.The nomination committee proposes that the Annual General Meeting decides that the instruction to the nomination committee shall be the same as last year.Item 17: The Board of Directors' proposal on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve to issue new sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors up until the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to issue new shares  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. Shares may be paid in kind  through set-off or with other conditions set forth in Chapter 13  Section 5  first paragraph item 6 in the Swedish Companies Act. The Board of Directors may otherwise set the terms of such share issuance. The authorization shall however not comprise a right for the Board to issue shares against cash payment and with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The issue price shall be determined on marketable grounds and the number of issued shares may not exceed ten percent of the total amount of outstanding shares in the company per the day of this notice.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and the right to decide on payment through set-off  in kind or other condition as set forth in the Swedish Companies Act is to enable the company to issue shares in order to acquire shares  business or product rights.Majority requirementsA valid resolution under item 17 above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.Item 18: The Board of Directors' proposal on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve for the company to acquire the company's own sharesThe Board of Directors shall be authorized  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to decide to acquire the company's own shares in accordance with the following.Acquisition may only be made by a maximum of so many shares that  at any given time  the company's own holdings do not exceed five percent of all shares in the company Acquisition of shares in the company may only be made on Nasdaq Stockholm (the ""Exchange"") Acquisition of shares on the Exchange may only take place at a price within the price range recorded on the Exchange at any given time The payment for the shares shall be paid in cash The authorization may be used on one or several occasions up until the end of the 2023 Annual General MeetingThe purpose of the above authorizations to acquire shares is to enable delivery of shares to participants in LTIP 2022 (the introduction of a new long term incentive program  LTIP 2022  is subject to a separate resolution in item 19 in the notice for the 2022 Annual General Meeting) and to be able to continuously adjust the company's capital structure to the company's capital requirements.Shares that have been acquired by the company and which have not been reserved in order to secure the company's delivery of shares under LTIP 2022 are intended to be canceled following a resolution thereof at the 2023 Annual General Meeting.Majority requirementsA valid resolution under item 18 above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.Item 19: The Board of Directors' proposal regarding Long Term Incentive Program 2022 (LTIP 2022)Mycronic's Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting passes a resolution on the implementation of a Long Term Incentive Program 2022 (LTIP 2022). This proposal is divided into four items:A. Terms of LTIP 2022B. Transfer of the company's own shares under LTIP 2022 and hedging activitiesC. Hedging of LTIP 2022 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyD. Other matters related to LTIP 2022A. Terms of LTIP 2022A.1 IntroductionThe Board wishes to establish a long-term incentive program for certain key employees in order to encourage personal long-term ownership of Mycronic shares as well as to increase and enhance its ability to recruit  retain and motivate employees. The Board therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance share program 2022 (""LTIP 2022""). The intention is also to use LTIP 2021 to unite the interest of the employees with the interests of shareholders.Participants may  after a qualifying period  receive allotments of Mycronic ordinary shares without consideration. The number of allotted shares will depend on the fulfilment of certain performance targets. The term of LTIP 2022 is more than three years.A.2 Basic features of LTIP 2022The LTIP 2022 will be directed towards certain key employees in the Mycronic Group. The participants are based in Sweden and other countries where the Mycronic Group is active. Each participant may be entitled  after a certain qualification period (defined below)  provided continued employment during the entire period (except from ""Good Leavers"")  and depending on the fulfilment of certain performance targets linked to Mycronic's Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")  to receive allotment of Mycronic shares (""Performance Shares""). The participant shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares. Performance Shares are Mycronic ordinary shares.A.3 Participation in LTIP 2022LTIP 2022 is directed towards a maximum of 70 employees  divided in three categories of participants:Category Maximum number of shares per personA) CEO (maximum 1 person) 8 900B) Management Group (maximum 10 persons) 3 400C) Other key employees (maximum 59 persons) 1 400Any resolution on participation or implementation of LTIP 2022 shall be conditional on that it  in the Board's judgement  can be offered with reasonable administrative costs and financial effects.A.4 Allotment of Performance SharesAllotment of Performance Shares within LTIP 2022 will be made during a limited period of time following the Annual General Meeting 2025. The period up to this date is referred to as the qualification period (vesting period). A condition for the participant to receive allotment of Performance Shares is that the participant remains an employee of the Mycronic Group during the full qualification period up until allotment. Allotment of Performance Shares also requires that the EPS performance targets are fulfilled. The Board shall establish a customary definition of Good Leavers and determine whether any allocation shall be made to participants who are considered Good Leavers.The performance target is Mycronic's EPS and the performance target shall be established by the Board. Partial fulfilment of the performance targets will result in partial allotment of Performance Shares. Performance under a certain level will result in no allotment. The EPS targets and the outcome will be communicated to the shareholders after the allotment of Performance Shares to participants.Prior to the allotment of Performance Shares  the Board shall assess whether the allotment is reasonable in relation to the company's financial results  position and performance  as well as other factors.If significant changes take place within the Mycronic Group  or on the market  which  by the assessment of the Board  would mean that the terms for allocation/transfer of shares according to LTIP 2022 is no longer reasonable  the Board shall have the right to implement an adjustment to LTIP 2022  including  among others  the right to reduce the number of Performance Shares allocated/transferred  or not to allocate/transfer Performance Shares at all.A.5 Implementation and administration etceteraThe Board  with the assistance of the remuneration committee  shall in accordance with the resolutions by the Annual General Meeting set forth herein be responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2022. The Board may also decide on the implementation of an alternative cash based incentive for participants in countries where the allotment of Performance Shares is not appropriate  as well as if otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTIP 2022.The intention is that the Board shall launch LTIP 2022 as soon as practically possible after the Annual General Meeting.In the event that the general meeting does not resolve in accordance with item B with the required majority  the Company shall hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party in accordance with what is stated in item C below.B. Transfer of the company's own shares under LTIP 2022 and hedging activities.B1. Number of sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that transfer of up to 125 500 Mycronic shares under LTIP 2022 may be made in accordance with the below. The number of shares is calculated on the basis of maximum participation and maximum fulfilment of performance requirements.B2. Other conditions for transfer of Mycronic sharesMycronic shares may be transferred to the participants in LTIP 2022.Share transfers to participants in LTIP 2022 shall be made without the participants paying consideration and shall be carried out at the time and subject to the other conditions under which participants in LTIP 2022 have the right to be allotted shares.The number of Mycronic shares that might be transferred under LTIP 2022 shall be subject to customary re-calculation principles and may  consequently  be subject to re-calculation due to a bonus issue  share split  dividends and/or other similar events. Resolutions resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting 2022 shall not be included in a re-calculation of the number of shares.B.3 Grounds for the Board's proposal and alternative hedging via an equity swap agreement with a third party etceteraSince the Board believes that the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer Mycronic shares under LTIP 2022 is obtained through transfer of own shares  the Board proposes that transfers are secured as described above in this item B. Should the necessary majority not be obtained for the proposal in item B  the Board will enter into a share swap agreement  in accordance with item C below.Share swap agreement will also be relevant should this be more appropriate  for example due to the fact that the acquisition of own shares cannot be made to the extent required to be able to transfer shares under LTIP 2022.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights to acquire the own shares is that the company shall be able to secure the delivery of shares under LTIP 2022.C. Hedge of LTIP 2022 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyIn the event that the necessary majority is not obtained for item B above  the company will hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer shares in the company under LTIP 2022. The relevant number of shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed under item B above. The cost of hedging by entering into an equity swap agreement  excluding any dividends and without regard to the development of Mycronic's share price  exceeds SEK 1 million during the term of the program.D. Other matters in relation to LTIP 2022D.1 Majority requirements etc.The resolution according to item A above shall require a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. A valid resolution under item B above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.D.2 Estimated costs  expenses and financial effects of LTIP 2022LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 ‚Äì Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the share awards should be expensed as personnel costs over the qualification period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security contributions will be recognized as an expense in the income statement through regular provisions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The amount of these regular provisions will be revalued in line with the trend in the value of the right to Performance Shares  and the contributions payable on the allotment of Performance Shares.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 178  and that the performance targets are achieved so that 50 percent of the maximum number of Performance Shares vest  including a share price increase of 50 percent during the qualification period and an annual employee turnover of 5 percent  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to SEK 14.1 million before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of SEK 4.7 million before tax.Assuming that the performance targets are achieved so that 100 percent of the maximum number of Performance Shares vest  and otherwise the same assumptions as above  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to SEK 28.2 million before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of SEK 9.4 million before tax.LTIP 2022 will comprise maximum 125 500 shares in total  which corresponds to 0.13 percent of the total outstanding shares and votes in the company on a fully diluted basis.The above calculations are based on a decision on hedging in accordance with item B.In the view of the Board  the positive effects expected to arise from LTIP 2022  outweigh the costs associated with LTIP 2022.D.3 The Board's explanatory statementAn individual long-term ownership commitment among the participants in LTIP 2022 is expected to stimulate greater interest and motivation in the company's business operations  results and strategy. Moreover  the Board wishes to increase the ability of Mycronic to retain important key employees. The Board believes that the implementation of LTIP 2022 will benefit Mycronic and its shareholders. LTIP 2022 will provide a competitive and motivation-improving incentive for executives and other key employees within the Group.LTIP 2022 has been designed to reward the participants for increased shareholder value by allotting shares  based on the fulfilment of conditions in respect of results and operations. By linking the employees' remuneration to the development of Mycronic's results and value  the long-term value growth of Mycronic is rewarded. Based on these circumstances  the Board considers that the implementation of LTIP 2022 will have a positive effect on the Mycronic Group's continued development  and will therefore be beneficial to the shareholders and Mycronic.D.4 Other share-related incentive programsThe company's share-related incentive programs are described on pages 49-51 in the company's annual report.D.5 Adjustment AuthorizationThe Board  or a person appointed by the Board  shall be authorized to make adjustments to the above resolutions that may be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB respectively.D.6 Preparation of the itemThe basis for LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the Board of the company. The work has been supported by external advisors and has been made in consultation with shareholders. The Board has thereafter decided to present this proposal for the general meeting. Except for the staff that have prepared the matter upon instruction from the Board  no employee that may be a participant of LTIP 2022 has participated in the preparations of the program's terms.The financial statements and the audit report regarding the financial year 2021  as well as the nomination committee's and the Board of Director's complete proposals including related documentation will be available at the company at Nytorpsv√§gen 9 in T√§by not later than by 14 April 2022  on the company website and will also be sent by post to shareholders requesting so and stating their postal address. The same applies to the Board of Directors report in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551) and the auditor's opinion in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 54 of the same law.The total number of shares and votes in the company amounts to 97 916 509. The company does not hold any of these shares. Shareholders are reminded of the right to  at the Annual General Meeting  ask questions to the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act  Chapter 7  Section 32.For information on how your personal data is processed  please see https://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfT√§by in March 2022Mycronic AB (publ)The Board of DirectorsN.B.

These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration resolved or approved by the General Meeting. The guidelines' promotion of the Company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability Eastnine's vision is to create and provide the best meeting places where ideas can flow  people can meet and successful business operations develop. The Company's business concept is to be the leading  long-term supplier of modern and sustainable office and logistics space in prime locations in the Baltics. At any time  current versions of vision and business concept as well as further information regarding the Company's business strategy  is available at www.eastnine.com. The Company shall have the remuneration levels and terms of employment required to recruit and retain expertise and necessary capacity. Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the Company's business strategy and long-term interests  including sustainability. The long-term incentive programs that exist in the Company  as well as the long-term incentive program that the Board of Directors has proposed that the Annual General Meeting 2022 shall adopt  are excluded from these guidelines.Types of remuneration  etc. The remuneration for executives can consist of fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension and insurance benefits  and other customary benefits. Additionally  the General Meeting may irrespective of these guidelines resolve on  among other things  long-term share-based or share-related incentive programs/remuneration. The Board of Directors decide at its discretion  according to established internal performance-based goals  whether a variable cash remuneration should be paid to the executives. The variable cash remuneration shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria which can be financial or non-financial. Variable cash remuneration may amount to not more than 50 per cent of the fixed salary. Additionally  the executives are entitled to an individual premium-based pension plan according to which the Company pays premiums corresponding to a maximum of 4.5 per cent of the fixed salary up to 7.5 income base amounts  and premiums corresponding to a maximum of 30 per cent on salary components exceeding 7.5 income base amounts. Other benefits may include  for example  health insurance  health care and car benefits. Such benefits may amount to not more than 10 per cent of the fixed salary. Termination of employment The notice period may not exceed twelve months if notice of termination of employment is made by the Company. Fixed cash salary during the period of notice and severance pay may together not exceed an amount equivalent to the CEO's fixed cash salary for two years  and twelve months for other executives. The period of notice may not exceed six months without any right to severance pay when termination is made by the executive. In addition  remuneration may be paid for non-compete undertakings. Such remuneration shall compensate for loss of income and shall only be paid in so far as the previously employed executive is not entitled to severance pay. The remuneration shall be the difference between the fixed monthly salary and the lower income the employee receives and be paid during the time the non-compete undertaking applies  which shall not be for more than 6 months following the termination of employment Salary and employment conditions for employees In the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of the Company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable. The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelines During 2021  the Board of Directors has not appointed a formal Remuneration Committee. However  a smaller group consisting of Peter Elam H√•kansson  Ylva Sarby Westman and Liselotte Hjorth  has set aside extra time in order to prepare remuneration matters within the Company to the Board of Directors. The formal tasks that would have been carried out by a Remuneration Committee have been carried out by the Board of Directors. In March 2022  the Board of Directors has decided to establish a Remuneration Committee after the Annual General Meeting 2022 with its main tasks in accordance with the Swedish Corporate Governance Code. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the General Meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the General Meeting. The Board of Directors shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the executive management  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the Company. The CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters. Deviation from the guidelines The Board of Directors may resolve to deviate from the guidelines resolved by the Annual General Meeting  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the Company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the Company's financial viability. As set out above  the Board of Directors' tasks include preparing the resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to deviate from the guidelines. 15. Authorization to transfer own shares The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to transfer own shares  under the following conditions: The share may be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm or otherwise. Transfer may take place with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. Transfer on Nasdaq Stockholm may take place at a price per share within the registered share price interval from time to time  which means the spread between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price prevailing from time to time on the exchange. The authorization covers all shares held by the Company from time to time. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash  contributions in-kind or set-off. The authorization may be utilized on one or more occasions  however not longer than until the next AGM. The purpose of the authorization to transfer own shares and the reasons for any deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable the Board of Directors an opportunity to adjust the Company's capital structure and to use repurchased owned shares as payment for or financing of acquisitions or investments in order to create increased value for the shareholders. A resolution in accordance with item 15 above requires that shareholders representing no less than two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the AGM approve the resolution. 16. Resolution regarding (a) the establishment of LTIP 2022  and (b) transfers of own shares to the participants in LTIP 2022 The Board of Directors' proposal regarding (a) the establishment of LTIP 2022  and (b) transfers of own shares to the participants in LTIP 2022. The Board of Directors of Eastnine AB (publ) proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to establish a long-term incentive program (""LTIP 2022"") directed to employees of the group. The proposal is based on LTIP 2021  approved by the Annual General Meeting last year  and reads as follows: LTIP 2022 in brief The Board of Directors' proposals involves the establishment of LTIP 2022 under which the employees in total may be granted a maximum of 58 000 shares in the Company subject to the satisfaction of certain vesting requirements (see the proposal under item (a) below) and  for the purpose of ensuring delivery of shares  transfers of 58 000 own shares (see the proposal under item (b) below). The rationale for LTIP 2022 is to promote shareholder value and the Company's long-term value creation capability by creating conditions for retaining and recruiting competent personnel  increasing the motivation amongst the participants  promoting a personal shareholding as well as aligning the participants' interest with the interest of the Company's shareholders. The Company has two outstanding long-term incentive programs resolved upon on the Annual General Meeting 2020 and 2021 respectively. For a description  see note 5 in the Company's annual report 2021 which is held available at the Company's website www.eastnine.com. (a) Establishment of LTIP 2022 The Board of Directors proposes that LTIP 2022 be established in accordance with the following principal terms and conditions. LTIP 2022 is directed to employees of the group who have been employed since 1 May 2022  divided into the following three categories: Category A (CEO and CFO)  Category B (country managers and other positions deemed business critical) and Category C (other employees)  collectively referred to as the ""Participants"". Participation in LTIP 2022 requires that the Participant  as of 30 June 2022  has a personal shareholding in the Company (""Participation Shares"") with a value corresponding to one month of the Participants annual gross fixed salary as of 1 May 2022 (""Fixed Salary""). If applicable insider rules and regulations prohibit a Participant from purchasing Participation Shares in the Company prior to applying to participate in LTIP 2022 and during the period up until 30 June 2022  the Board of Directors has the right to postpone the last day of investment for such Participant. Each Participant shall receive performance shares rights free of charge (""Share Rights"") and each Share Right entitles the Participant to receive up to one share in the Company (""Performance Shares"")  subject to the satisfaction of the performance requirements. Performance Shares are expected to be allotted to the Participants within 45 days from the publication of the Company's interim report for January-June 2025  however  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to adjust such date. The period from 30 June 2022 up until the date of the publication of the Company's interim report immediately following the third anniversary of the implementation of LTIP 2022 is below referred to as the ""Vesting Period"". The allotment of Performance Shares is conditional upon that the Participant has not resigned or has not terminated its employment and the Participation Shares being retained by the Participant during the entire Vesting Period. The Board of Directors has the discretion to waive this condition for good leavers (for example  where employment is terminated as a result of the Participant's long-term illness  disability or death) or if the employer has given notice of termination of the Participant's employment due to redundancy (Sw. arbetsbrist). In such case  the Board of Directors shall determine the number of Performance Shares to be allotted adjusted for the number of days in the Vesting Period which the Participant was employed and the allotment shall be determined based on the satisfaction of the performance requirements. The number of Share Rights allotted to a Participant shall be calculated by dividing a certain percentage as determined by the Board of Directors of 50 (category A)  30-40 (category B) and 10-20 per cent (category c) of the Participant's Fixed Salary for category A  B and C  respectively  with the share price corresponding to the volume weighted average price of the Company's shares on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days immediately prior to the allotment of the Share Rights (""Initial Share Price""). The total number of allotted Share Rights shall not exceed 58 000. If the Initial Share Price would result in a higher total number of Share Rights  the number of Share Rights allotted to the Participants shall be adjusted downwards on a pro rata basis. Should the Share Price at Allotment of the Performance Shares (as defined below) exceed 300 per cent of the Initial Share Price (the ""Share Price Cap"")  the number of Performance Shares to be allotted shall be reduced by way of multiplying the number of Share Rights that entitle to allotment by a factor equal to the Share Price Cap divided by the Share Price at Allotment. The value of the Company's shares in connection with allotment (the ""Share Price at Allotment"") shall be calculated based on the volume weighted average price of the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days immediately following the publication of the Company's interim report for the period January-June 2025. If the Participant is absent due to sick leave or other long-term absence (not including parental leave  vacation or similar) for more than four weeks in total during a fiscal year or is part-time employed during the Vesting Period  the Participant's Share Rights will be reduced on a pro rata basis. However  if the Participant has a disability  consideration will be given to making an adjustment to any allotment due depending on the circumstances of the individual case. In order to further increase alignment between the long-term interests of the Participants and the Company's shareholders  a requirement for participation in the Company's long-term incentive programs going forward shall be that Participants in Categories A and B retain at least 50 per cent of all allotted Performance Shares (net of tax for such allotment) until the Participant's shareholding in the Company is equal in value to the Participant's Fixed Salary. The Allotment of Performance Shares is conditional upon the degree of satisfaction of the performance requirements set out below compared to below established minimum and maximum target levels during the relevant measurement period. Fractions of the allotted Performance Shares shall be rounded-off to the immediate lower whole number. Requirement 1 The development of the Company's return on equity  excluding the effect from Eastnine's holding in Melon Fashion Group (MFG)  i.e. average profits/losses  excluding the profits/losses from MFG  related to the average shareholder's equity  excluding shareholder's equity relating to MFG  during the period 1 July 2022-30 June 2025. Max level: 12 per cent per year.Min level: 10 per cent per year. Requirement 2 The percentile ranking of the Company's total shareholder return  i.e. share price development including dividends  during the period 1 July 2022-30 June 2025 compared to a peer group (the ""Peer Group"") consisting of 22 European real estate companies[1]. Maximum level: Total shareholder return corresponding to top quartile of the peer group.Minimum level: Total shareholder return corresponding to median of the peer group. If the minimum level of a performance requirement is not reached  no Performance Shares under that performance requirement will be allotted. If the maximum level is reached  for requirement 1  80 per cent of the maximum number of Performance Shares and  for Requirement 2  20 per cent of the maximum number of Performance Shares under LTIP 2022 will be allotted. If the outcome falls between the minimum level and the maximum level  a linear pro rata allotment of Performance Shares for the relevant performance requirement shall apply. The Board of Directors will determine the level of satisfaction of each of the performance requirements and intends to present the satisfaction level after the end of the Vesting Period. Performance Shares are expected to be allotted to the Participants within 45 days from the end of the Vesting Period. In order to maintain representative and relevant performance requirements during the Vesting Period  the Board of Directors may adjust the Peer Group and the definition of return on equity. The number of Share Rights and the Share Price Cap may be recalculated by the Board of Directors in the event of share issues  share splits  reversed share splits  merger  reduction of share capital or any similar event that may affect the capital structure of the Company. When determining the final vesting level for the allotment of Performance Shares  the Board of Directors shall examine whether the vesting level as well as the performance requirements are reasonable considering the Company's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the Board of Directors  change the vesting level as deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors. The Company will not compensate the Participants for any dividends during the Vesting Period. The Share Rights must not be assigned  pledged or disposed of in any way (except in the event of the Participant's death  to his or her beneficiaries) and will lapse immediately on any attempt to do so or if the Participant is declared bankrupt. Participants are not entitled to perform any shareholder's rights regarding the Share Rights during the Vesting Period. If a Participant is subject to a disciplinary process or there is a dispute pending or threatened  the Board of Directors may delay allotment of Performance Shares until the conclusion of such a process. If significant changes occur in the Company or on the market  or in the event the costs for LTIP 2022 significantly exceed the estimated costs  and this  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  results in a situation where the conditions for allotment of Performance Shares become unreasonable or no longer appropriate  the Board of Directors is entitled to adopt different conditions or make adjustments to LTIP 2022  including  among other things  to resolve on a reduced allotment of Performance Shares  or to not allot any Performance Shares at all. In case a public offer for all shares in the Company is completed resulting in the offeror owning more than 90 per cent of the shares in the Company  LTIP 2022 shall be closed down by the earlier execution of any outstanding Share Rights and amending the vesting and performance requirements in proportion to the time elapsed since the implementation of LTIP 2022 and the last measurable point of performance prior to the completion of the public offer. Participation in LTIP 2022 requires that it is permitted and appropriate with regard to applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdiction in which the relevant Participant is resident and that the Board of Directors deems it feasible at reasonable administrative and financial costs. In the event delivery of Performance Shares to a Participant cannot take place under applicable law or at reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative effort  the Board of Directors may pay a part of or the entire allotment to such Participant in cash instead of shares. The Board of Directors may retain allotted Performance Shares and settle a part of the allotment in cash in order to facilitate the payment of the Participants' tax liabilities. The Board of Directors is responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2022. Accordingly  the Board of Directors is to prepare and execute any necessary full-text documentation to the Participants and otherwise manage and administer LTIP 2022. (b) Transfer of own shares The Board of Directors proposes  for the purpose of securing delivery of shares under LTIP 2022  that a maximum of 58 000 own shares be transferred to the Participants on the following terms and conditions. The right to receive shares shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be granted to the Participants  with right for each of the Participants to receive no more than the maximum number of shares allowed under the terms and conditions of LTIP 2022. Furthermore  subsidiaries within the group shall have the right to receive shares  free of consideration  and such subsidiaries shall be obligated to immediately transfer  free of consideration  such shares to the Participants in accordance with the terms and conditions of LTIP 2022. The Participants' right to receive shares are conditional upon the fulfilment of the terms and conditions of LTIP 2022. The shares shall be transferred within the time period set out in the terms and conditions of LTIP 2022. The shares shall be transferred free of charge. The number of shares that may be transferred to the Participants may be recalculated in the event of share issues  share splits  reversed share splits or similar events or otherwise in accordance with the terms and conditions of LTIP 2022. Hedging arrangements The Company intends to use up to 67 094 previously repurchased own shares (corresponding to approx. 0.30 per cent the total number of shares in Eastnine) in order to ensure the delivery of shares to the Participants and to secure and cover the costs that arise as a result of LTIP 2022 (for example social security charges and tax). The Board thus do not propose any further actions to hedge the Company's obligations under LTIP 2022. In the event that the required majority for approval to transfer shares to the Participants is not reached under item (b) above  the Board of Directors intends to hedge the financial exposure of the LTIP 2022 by the Company entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party  under which the third party shall  in its own name  acquire and transfer shares in the Company to Participants covered by the LTIP 2022. Estimated costs and dilution for LTIP 2022 The costs for LTIP 2022 will be calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 and distributed over the Vesting Period. Assuming that one third (1/3) of the maximum number of Performance Shares are allotted  resulting in the allotment of 19 333 Performance Shares  an Initial Share Price of SEK 105  and an annual share price increase of 5 per cent during the Vesting Period  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to approximately EUR 0.2 million. Assuming that the maximum number of Performance Shares are allotted  resulting in the allotment of approx. 58 000 Performance Shares  an Initial Share Price of SEK 105  and an annual share price increase of 5 per cent during the Vesting Period  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to approximately EUR 0.6 million. The costs should be viewed in relation to the Company's total costs for salaries and other remuneration to employees  which for 2021 amounted to EUR 3.6 million  including social security costs. Effect on key ratios The Company will not issue any new shares due to LTIP 2022 but intends to use up to 67 094 shares held in treasury for delivery to the Participants and for hedging of costs for LTIP 2022. The costs for LTIP 2022 are expected to have a marginal effect on the group's key ratios. Preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal The proposal has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with external advisors. Majority vote requirements The Board of Directors' proposals under item (a) is valid only if supported by shareholders holding not less than half of the votes cast represented at the Meeting and (b) is valid only if supported by shareholders holding not less than nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the AGM. 17. Authorization to acquire own shares The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to acquire the Company's own shares  under the following conditions: The share purchases may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price per share within the registered share price interval from time to time  which means the spread between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price prevailing from time to time on the exchange. Purchases may also be made in accordance with an offer directed to all shareholders with a cash consideration not below the market price at the time of the offer and with a maximum upward deviation of 20 percent. The Company may only purchase so many shares that the Company's holding of its own shares does not at any time exceed 10 percent of all the shares in the Company. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash. The authorization may be utilized on one or more occasions  however not longer than until the next AGM. The purpose of this authorization to acquire own shares in the Company is to enable the Board of Directors to adjust the capital structure and thereby generate a higher value for the shareholders. A resolution in accordance with item 17 above requires that shareholders representing no less than two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the AGM approve the resolution. 18. Authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issue The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to  at one or several occasions until the next Annual General Meeting  decide upon an issue of shares in the Company corresponding to not more than 10 per cent of the Company's share capital  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential right. Furthermore  the proposal means that an issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind. Shares shall  in case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential right to subscription  be issued on market terms. The purpose of the above authorisation is to enable the Company to  completely or partially  finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses by issuing new shares as payment in connection with agreements on acquisition of real property  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions. A resolution in accordance with item 18 above requires that shareholders representing no less than two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the AGM approve the resolution.

It is proposed that Thomas Rex is re-elected chairman of the board. Information regarding the proposed members of the board of directors is available on the Company's website  investor.acconeer.com. Furthermore  it has been proposed that the registered auditing company KPMG AB is elected for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting. KPMG AB has announced that  should the annual general meeting approve the proposal  the authorised public accountant Jonas Nihlberg will be the auditor-in-charge. Item 12 - Proposal for a decision on the directed issue of warrants and approval of the subsidiary's transfer pursuant to Chapter 16 section 4 second paragraph of the Companies Act Background and motiveThe board of directors has proposed that the annual general meeting resolves on a warrant-based incentive program for the individuals who are or will be employed by the Company (individuals employed for a fixed time period are excluded) including the CEO of the Company (""Employees"") in accordance with the conditions set out below (""Warrant Program 2022/2026""). The purpose of the proposed program and the reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights are that the board of directors believes that a warrant program that allows the Employees to gain access to the Company's value development promotes participation and accountability and brings increased motivation to promote favourable economic development in the Company. An incentive program is also expected to contribute to the recruitment and retention of competent  motivated and committed employees. In light of the above  the board of directors propose that the annual general meeting resolve to (A) issue warrants of series 2022/2026 to the Subsidiary (as defined below) and (B) approve the transfer of warrants series 2022/2026 from the Subsidiary to the Employees in accordance with item 12.B below. Items (A) and (B) constitute an overall proposal and shall be resolved upon as one resolution by the annual general meeting. Item 12.A - Directed issue of warrantsFor the implementation of Warrant Program 2022/2026  the board of directors propose that the annual general meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 300 000 warrants of series 2022/2026  implying an increase in the share capital upon full exercise with a maximum of SEK 15 000. For the decision  the following conditions shall apply: No more than 300 000 warrants shall be issued. With the exception of shareholders' preferential rights  the subscriber shall be the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Acconeer Incentive AB  reg. no. 559156-2474 (the ""Subsidiary"") with the right and obligation for the Subsidiary to transfer the warrants to the Employees in accordance with item B below. The warrants shall be issued free of charge to the Subsidiary. Subscription of warrants shall be made on a special subscription list within two weeks from the date of the issue resolution. The board of directors is entitled to extend the subscription period. Over-subscription cannot occur. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. Subscription of shares under the warrants may take place during the period from 3 December 2025 up to and including 16 January 2026. The premium per share shall be transferred to the free share premium reserve (Sw. fria √∂verkursfonden). The subscription price per share shall correspond to 150 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period of ten (10) trading days ending on 11 November 2022  however  the subscription price per share shall never be less than the quota value of the share. The subscription price shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.01  whereupon SEK 0.005 shall be rounded upwards. The shares subscribed for on the basis of the warrants shall entitle the holder to a distribution of profits for the first time on the first record date of dividends that occur after the subscription of shares has been exercised through the exercise of the warrants. Applicable re-calculation terms and other terms and conditions for the warrants can be found in ""Terms and conditions for warrants series 2022/2026 for new subscription of shares in Acconeer AB (publ)"". The board of directors  or the one the board of directors appoints  is authorised to make minor adjustments to the annual general meeting's decisions and attachments that may prove necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Officeor  where applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB. Item 12.B - Approval of transfer of warrants to EmployeesWarrant Program 2022/2026 shall be carried out mainly as described below. The warrants shall  for payment  be transferred by the Subsidiary on 18 November 2022  or on the later date decided by the board of directors  to the Employees in accordance with the guidelines set out below. Transfer according to item 12.B.1 shall be made at market value at the respective transfer dates  which shall be determined by Optionspartner AB or another independent valuation institute  using the Black & Scholes valuation model. Warrants shall be allotted in accordance with the following guidelines:* On each respective transfer date  every Employee shall be given the opportunity to acquire warrants to an amount equivalent to no more than one fifth (1/5) of the Employee's annual income prior to income tax.* No more than 300 000 warrants in total may be allotted on each occasion. There will be no guaranteed allotment and over-subscription cannot occur. In case the subscription of warrants exceeds the highest amount of warrants which may be allotted  allotment of warrants will be made proportionally in accordance with each Employee's annual income prior to income tax or  to the extent that allotment cannot be made this way  by the drawing of lots. Transfer of warrants may not take place after the annual general meeting 2023  after which non-transferred warrants shall be cancelled. Such cancellation of warrants shall be reported to the Swedish Companies Registration Office for duly registration. The right to transfer warrants in Warrant Program 2022/2026 assumes that (i) the Employee holds his/her position or has signed an agreement thereon by the time of the allotment and not announced or been informed at that time that the employment is intended to be terminated  (ii)that acquisition of warrants can take place in accordance with applicable laws and  according to the board of directors' assessment  can be executed with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts  and (iii) that the Employee and/or  in applicable cases  the participant'scompany has entered into an agreement with the Company  according to which the Company  or the one the Company assigns  under certain circumstances has the right to repurchase the warrants from the participant/company if the participant's employment/consultancy assignmentceases or if the participant/company wishes to transfer the warrants before they can be exercised for subscription of shares. The board of directors has the right to make the reasonable changes and adjustments to the terms and conditions of the agreement that are deemed suitable or appropriate as a result of local employment law or tax law or administrative conditions. For participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden  it is implied that transfer of warrants is legally possible and that transfer  in the board of directors' opinion  can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial efforts at their established fair market value. The board of directors shall be authorised to adjust the terms and conditions of the Warrants Program 2022/2026 to the extent required in order for allotment of warrants to participants in other jurisdictions  to the extent practically possible  to be carried out under the same conditions imposed by the Warrants Program 2022/2026. Award criteriaNo award criteria  beyond what is stated in item 12.B.6 above  have been resolved upon to receive allocation in the incentive program. The board of directors believes that a broad program that includes all Employees provides the best conditions to achieve the board of directors' goals of implementing the program: committed  motivated and competent co-workers. ValuationSubscription of the warrants shall be made at a price equal to the warrant's fair market value the day of subscription. The warrants' fair market value  according to a preliminary valuation based on assumptions of the market value of the underlying share of SEK 48.23 at subscription and an exercise price of SEK 72.34 per share  SEK 6.93 per warrant. The Black & Scholes valuation model has been used for the valuation  assuming a risk-free interest rate of 0.549 per cent and a volatility assumption of 41.7 per cent  taking into account the expected dividends and other value transfers to the shareholders. With respect to restrictions on disposal of  and the illiquidity in the warrants  a so-called illiquidity discount of 15.2 per cent has been applied to the warrants' value. The final price for the warrants will be established in connection with each subscription occasion to the Employees and will be based on market conditions prevailing at that time. CostsSince the warrants are subscribed for at market value  the Company is of the opinion that there will be no social costs for the Company as a result of the issue. However  some costs may arise if the subscription price exceeds the initially estimated market value. The costs will therefore mainly consist of limited costs for the implementation and administration of the warrants. Warrant Program 2022/2026 is not expected to entail any costs of significance to the Company. For this reason  no measures for hedging the program have been taken. Dilution  previous incentive programs and effects on key ratiosAs per the day of this proposal  there are 25 720 750 shares in the Company. Assuming that all warrants that can be issued under Warrant Program 2022/2026 are exercised for subscription of new shares  the number of shares and votes in the Company will increase by 300 000  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.15 per cent of the number of shares and votes in Company. The dilution is expected to have a marginal impact on the Company's key ratios. The Company currently has four ongoing share-based incentive programs: Warrant Program 2019/2022  Warrant Program 2020/2023  Warrant Program 2021/2024:1 and Warrant Program 2021/2024:2. The annual general meeting resolved on 9 April 2019 to issue a maximum of 600 000 warrants to the Subsidiary through Warrant Program 2019/2022. The incentive program includes the persons who are or will be employed by the Company (but not fixed-term employees) including the CEO of the Company. The warrant holders have the right to  during the period from and including 1 May 2022 to and including 30 June 2022  call for subscription of a new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to 140 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period from 26 March 2019 until 8 April 2019. The annual general meeting resolved on 14 April 2020 to issue a maximum of 300 000 warrants to the Subsidiary through Warrants Program 2020/2023. The incentive program includes the persons who are or will be employed by the Company (but not fixed-term employees) including the CEO of the Company. The warrant holders have the right to  during the period from and including 1 May 2023 to and including 30 June 2023  call for subscription of a new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to 120 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period from 31 March 2020 until 13 April 2020. The annual general meeting resolved on 27 April 2021 to issue a maximum of 300 000 warrants to the Subsidiary  which as of today holds 82 497 of these  through Warrant Program 2021/2024:1. The incentive program includes the persons who are or will be employed by the Company (but not fixed-term employees) including the CEO of the Company. The warrant holders have the right to  during the period from and including 15 May 2024 to and including 30 September 2024  call for subscription of a new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period of ten (10) trading days ending on 23 April 2021. The annual general meeting resolved on 27 April 2021 to issue a maximum of 300 000 warrants to the Subsidiary  which as of today holds 192 862 of these  through Warrant Program 2021/2024:2. The incentive program includes the persons who are or will be employed by the Company (but not fixed-term employees) including the CEO of the Company. The warrant holders have the right to  during the period from and including 15 November 2024 to and including 31 Mars 2025  call for subscription of a new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period of ten (10) trading days beginning on 28 October 2021. Besides Warrant Program 2022/2026  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting of 26 April 2022 resolves to implement Warrant Program 2023/2026 (see item 13). If (i) all outstanding warrants issued in connection with the ongoing incentive programs  excluding the warrants held by the Subsidiary  are exercised in full for subscription of shares  (ii) the general meeting resolves on the implementation of Warrant Program 2022/2026 and Warrant Program 2023/2026 in accordance with the proposals  and (iii) all warrants that can be issued in or in connection with Warrant Program 2022/2026 and Warrant Program 2023/2026 are exercised for subscription of shares  the number of shares and votes in the Company will increase by 1 824 641  which corresponds to a total dilution of approximately 6.62 per cent of the number of shares and votes in the Company. The above estimates are subject to revaluations of the warrants under the usual translation terms contained in the full terms. All dilution effects have been calculated as the number of additional shares in relation to the number of existing plus additional shares. Preparation of the proposalThe proposal for resolution on the implementation of Warrant Program 2022/2026 and the proposals of resolutions according to item 12.A and 12.B above  have been prepared by the board of directors together with external advisors. Board members will not be allotted. The CEO  who may be granted warrants in Warrant Program 2022/2026  has not participated in the preparation of the proposal. Majority requirementsThe resolution of the annual general meeting in accordance with the board of directors' proposals under items 12.A-B above is proposed to be adopted as a joint decision. A valid resolution requires that the resolution is supported by shareholders with at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the annual general meeting. Item 13 - Proposal for a decision on the directed issue of warrants and approval of the subsidiary's transfer pursuant to Chapter 16 section 4 second paragraph of the Companies Act Background and motiveThe board of directors has proposed that the annual general meeting resolves on a warrant-based incentive program for individuals who are or will be Employees (including the CEO) in the Company in accordance with the conditions set out below (""Warrant Program 2023/2026""). The purpose of the proposed program and the reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights are that the board of directors believes that a warrant program that allows the Employees to gain access to the Company's value development promotes participation and accountability and brings increased motivation to promote favourable economic development in the Company. An incentive program is also expected to contribute to the recruitment and retention of competent  motivated and committed employees. In light of the above  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolve to (A) issue warrants series 2023/2026 to the Subsidiary and (B) approve transfer of warrants series 2023/2026 from the Subsidiary to the Employees in accordance with item 13.B below. Items (A) and (B) constitute an overall proposal and shall be resolved upon as one resolution by the annual general meeting. Item 13.A - Directed issue of warrants For the implementation of Warrant Program 2023/2026  the board of directors propose that the annual general meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 300 000 warrants of series 2023/2026  implying an increase in the share capital upon full exercise with a maximum of SEK 15 000. For the decision  the following conditions shall apply: No more than 300 000 warrants shall be issued. With the exception of shareholders' preferential rights  the subscriber shall be the Subsidiary  with the right and obligation for the Subsidiary to transfer the warrants to the Employees in accordance with item B below. The warrants shall be issued free of charge to the Subsidiary. Subscription of warrants shall be made on a special subscription list within two weeks from the date of the issue resolution. The board of directors is entitled to extend the subscription period. Over-subscription cannot occur. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. Subscription of shares under the warrants may take place during the period from 25 March 2026 up to and including 8 May 2026. The premium per share shall be transferred to the free share premium reserve (Sw. fria √∂verkursfonden). The subscription price per share shall correspond to 150 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period of ten (10) trading days ending on 3 March 2023  however the subscription price per share shall never be less than the quota value of the share. The subscription price shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.01  whereupon SEK 0.005 shall be rounded upwards. The shares subscribed for on the basis of the warrants shall entitle the holder to a distribution of profits for the first time on the first record date of dividends that occur after the subscription of shares has been exercised through the exercise of the warrants. Applicable re-calculation terms and other terms and conditions for the warrants can be found in ""Terms and conditions for warrants series 2023/2026 for new subscription of shares in Acconeer AB (publ)"". The board of directors  or the one the board of directors appoints  is authorised to make minor adjustments to the annual general meeting's decisions and attachments that may prove necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or  where applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB. Item 13.B - Approval of transfer of warrants to EmployeesWarrant Program 2023/2026 shall be carried out mainly as described below. The warrants shall  for payment  be transferred by the Subsidiary on 10 March 2023  or on the later date decided by the board of directors  to the Employees in accordance with the guidelines set out below. Transfer according to item 13.B.1 shall be made at market value at the respective transfer dates  which shall be determined by Optionspartner AB or another independent valuation institute  using the Black & Scholes valuation model. Warrants shall be allotted in accordance with the following guidelines:* On each respective transfer date  every Employee shall be given the opportunity to acquire warrants to an amount equivalent to no more than one fifth (1/5) of the Employee's annual income prior to income tax.* No more than 300 000 warrants in total may be allotted on each occasion. There will be no guaranteed allotment and over-subscription cannot occur. In case the subscription of warrants exceeds the highest amount of warrants which may be allotted  allotment of warrants will be made proportionally in accordance with each Employee's annual income prior to income tax or  to the extent that allotment cannot be made this way  by the drawing of lots. Transfer of warrants may not take place after the annual general meeting 2023  after which non-transferred warrants shall be cancelled. Such cancellation of warrants shall be reported to the Swedish Companies Registration Office for duly registration. The right to transfer warrants in Warrant Program 2023/2026 assumes that (i) the Employee holds his/her position or has signed an agreement thereon by the time of the allotment and not announced or been informed at that time that the employment is intended to be terminated  (ii) that acquisition of warrants can take place in accordance with applicable laws and  according to the board of directors' assessment  can be executed with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts  and (iii) that the Employee and/or  in applicable cases  the participant's company has entered into an agreement with the Company  according to which the Company  or the one the Company assigns  under certain circumstances has the right to repurchase the warrants from the participant/company if the participant's employment/consultancy assignment ceases or if the participant/company wishes to transfer the warrants before they can be exercised for subscription of shares. The board of directors has the right to make the reasonable changes and adjustments to the terms and conditions of the agreement that are deemed suitable or appropriate as a result of local employment law or tax law or administrative conditions. For participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden  it is implied that transfer of warrants is legally possible and that transfer  in the board of directors' opinion  can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial efforts at their established fair market value. The board of directors shall be authorised to adjust the terms and conditions of the Warrants Program 2023/2026 to the extent required in order for allotment of warrants to participants in other jurisdictions  to the extent practically possible  to be carried out under the same conditions imposed by the Warrants Program 2023/2026. Award criteriaNo award criteria  beyond what is stated in item 13.B.6 above  have been resolved upon to receive allocation in the incentive program. The board of directors believes that a broad program that includes all Employees provides the best conditions to achieve the board of directors' goals of implementing the program: committed  motivated and competent co-workers. ValuationSubscription of the warrants shall be made at a price equal to the warrant's fair market value the day of subscription. The warrants' fair market value  according to a preliminary valuation based on assumptions of the market value of the underlying share of SEK 48.23 at subscription and an exercise price of SEK 72.34 per share  SEK 6.93 per warrant. The Black & Scholes valuation model has been used for the valuation  assuming a risk-free interest rate of 0.549 per cent and a volatility assumption of 41.7 per cent  taking into account the expected dividends and other value transfers to the shareholders. With respect to restrictions on disposal of  and the illiquidity in the warrants  a so-called illiquidity discount of 15.2 per cent has been applied to the warrants' value. The final price for the warrants will be established in connection with each subscription occasion to the Employees and will be based on market conditions prevailing at that time. CostsSince the warrants are subscribed for at market value  the Company is of the opinion that there will be no social costs for the Company as a result of the issue. However  some costs may arise if the subscription price exceeds the initially estimated market value. The costs will therefore mainly consist of limited costs for the implementation and administration of the warrants. Warrant Program 2023/2026 is not expected to entail any costs of significance to the Company. For this reason  no measures for hedging the program have been taken. Dilution  previous incentive programs and effects on key ratiosAs per the day of this proposal  there are 25 720 750 shares in the Company. Assuming that all warrants that can be issued under Warrant Program 2023/2026 are exercised for subscription of new shares  the number of shares and votes in the Company will increase by 300 000  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.15 per cent of the number of shares and votes in Company. The dilution is expected to have a marginal impact on the Company's key ratios. The Company currently has four ongoing share-based incentive programs: Warrant Program 2019/2022  Warrant Program 2020/2023  Warrant Program 2021/2024:1 and Warrant Program 2021/2024:2. The annual general meeting resolved on 9 April 2019 to issue a maximum of 600 000 warrants to the Subsidiary through Warrant Program 2019/2022. The incentive program includes the persons who are or will be employed by the Company (but not fixed-term employees) including the CEO of the Company. The warrant holders have the right to  during the period from and including 1 May 2022 to and including 30 June 2022  call for subscription of a new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to 140 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period from 26 March 2019 until 8 April 2019. The annual general meeting resolved on 14 April 2020 to issue a maximum of 300 000 warrants to the Subsidiary through Warrants Program 2020/2023. The incentive program includes the persons who are or will be employed by the Company (but not fixed-term employees) including the CEO of the Company. The warrant holders have the right to  during the period from and including 1 May 2023 to and including 30 June 2023  call for subscription of a new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to 120 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period from 31 March 2020 until 13 April 2020. The annual general meeting resolved on 27 April 2021 to issue a maximum of 300 000 warrants to the Subsidiary  which as of today holds 82 497 of these  through Warrant Program 2021/2024:1. The incentive program includes the persons who are or will be employed by the Company (but not fixed-term employees) including the CEO of the Company. The warrant holders have the right to  during the period from and including 15 May 2024 to and including 30 September 2024  call for subscription of a new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period of ten (10) trading days ending on 23 April 2021. The annual general meeting resolved on 27 April 2021 to issue a maximum of 300 000 warrants to the Subsidiary  which as of today holds 192 862 of these  through Warrant Program 2021/2024:2. The incentive program includes the persons who are or will be employed by the Company (but not fixed-term employees) including the CEO of the Company. The warrant holders have the right to  during the period from and including 15 November 2024 to and including 31 Mars 2025  call for subscription of a new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period of ten (10) trading days beginning on 28 October 2021. Besides Warrant Program 2023/2026  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting of 26 April 2022 resolves to implement Warrant Program 2022/2026 (see item 12). If (i) all outstanding warrants issued in connection with the ongoing incentive programs  excluding the warrants held by the Subsidiary  are exercised in full for subscription of shares  (ii) the general meeting resolves on the implementation of Warrant Program 2022/2026 and Warrant Program 2023/2026 in accordance with the proposals  and (iii) all warrants that can be issued in or in connection with Warrant Program 2022/2026 and Warrant Program 2023/2026 are exercised for subscription of shares  the number of shares and votes in the Company will increase by 1 824 641  which corresponds to a total dilution of approximately 6.62 per cent of the number of shares and votes in the Company. The above estimates are subject to revaluations of the warrants under the usual translation terms contained in the full terms. All dilution effects have been calculated as the number of additional shares in relation to the number of existing plus additional shares. Preparation of the proposalThe proposal for resolution on the implementation of Warrant Program 2023/2026 and the proposals of resolutions according to item 13.A and 13.B above  have been prepared by the board of directors together with external advisors. Board members will not be allotted. The CEO  who may be granted warrants in Warrant Program 2023/2026  has not participated in the preparation of the proposal. Majority requirementsThe resolution of the annual general meeting in accordance with the board of directors' proposals under items 13.A-B above is proposed to be adopted as a joint decision. A valid resolution requires that the resolution is supported by shareholders with at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the annual general meeting. Item 14 - Proposal for a decision regarding authorisation of the board of directors to issue new sharesThe board of directors proposes that the meeting authorises the board of directors until the next annual general meeting to  on one or more occasions  resolve to increase the Company's share capital by issue of no more than shares corresponding to twenty-five (25) per cent of the total number of shares in the Company at the time of the meeting's decision of authorisation. However  such issues may not cause the share capital in the Company to exceed the Company's highest allowed share capital according to the articles of association. The board of directors may deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights. The reason for the board of directors' authorisation to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable the Company to raise new capital and to take advantage of future opportunities to attract new long-term owners  and to finance the Company's growth strategy. The authorisation also includes the right to decide on payment for the issued shares by set-off  in kind or with other conditions as referred in Chapter 13  section 5  item 6 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)). At a deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the issue rate shall be determined in accordance with market conditions  taking into account any discount on market terms. For a valid resolution on the proposal in this item 14  the proposal has to be supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as shares represented at the meeting. Available documentsThe complete proposals and other documents that shall be made available prior to the annual general meeting pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act will be made available at the Company and at the Company's website  www.acconeer.com  at least three weeks prior to the annual general meeting. The documents will also be sent free of charge to shareholders who so request and provide their address to the Company. In other respects  the board of directors' complete proposals for resolutions are stated in the notice. Information at the annual general meetingThe board of directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believes that it can be done without material harm to the Company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda and circumstances that can affect the assessment of the Company's or its subsidiaries' financial situation and the Company's relation to other companies within the group.

(Kirill Kudryavtsev /AFP via Getty Images)Severstal Could Become First Russian Company to Default on Foreign-Currency DebtSeverstal  a steel and mining company  could become the first Russian company to fail to make a critical interest payment on foreign-currency debt.The domestic firm had a $12.6 million coupon payment due on March 16  but was granted a five-business-day grace period. The industrial giant possesses $800 million in loan participation notes that mature in 2024. The company has urged bondholders to contact Citigroup  the financial institution that blocked the payment and requested an ironclad permit from the U.S. Treasury to cover the obligations  Bloomberg reported  citing two people familiar with the discussions.Should it default on its debt  Severstal‚Äôs global operations and claims would cover less than one-fifth of its foreign unsecured debt  JPMorgan Chase analysts estimated earlier this month.If interest payments aren‚Äôt processed  Severstal officials announced that the company would search for alternative options to pay its creditors.Making payments for bonds issued by Russian companies has turned into a complicated process. Because of Western sanctions and the Kremlin‚Äôs retaliatory sanctions  many bond payments could be delayed or become frozen in transit.A photo taken on March 14  2022  shows the logos of Visa  Mastercard  and Russian Mir payment systems on bank cards in Moscow. (AFP via Getty Images)Russian investors holding domestic corporate Eurobonds could experience delays in receiving payments completed through international agents amid Western sanctions  Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository (NSD) said in a statement to Reuters.Russian firms would need to manually process orders and receive clarifications from European regulators in this restrictive environment.Clearstream and Euroclear  two international clearing and settlement organizations  had previously processed Russian sovereign and corporate Eurobond payments. However  the two entities confirmed that they would stop settling transactions in Russian securities because of sanctions from the European Union.It‚Äôs estimated that Russian corporations are scheduled to pay approximately $18.5 billion in external debt  including interest payments  by the end of 2022. The Russian Ministry of Finance is also poised to pay about $3.4 billion in sovereign Eurobonds after recently executing $117 million and $66 million Eurobond coupon payments  with foreign investors receiving their funds.Other companies are bracing for challenges to execute coupon payments on foreign-currency debt.NLMK  Russia‚Äôs top steelmaker  confirmed that it had paid a coupon on its Eurobond due in 2024. The business stated that foreign noteholders started receiving interest payments  while domestic investors didn‚Äôt.It‚Äôs widely anticipated that state-owned Russian Railways  Polyus Gold  and fertilizer producer EuroChem will struggle to send payments to corporate bondholders in this current marketplace.Russian Railways and Polyus Gold are scheduled to make coupon payments on March 25 and March 28  respectively. The Russian government is also expected to make an international bond payment on March 28.‚ÄúPerhaps the bigger risk is that it may be a prelude to defaults by Russian corporates  whose external debts are more than four times larger than those of the sovereign ‚Äù William Jackson  chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics  wrote in a note last week.Last week  rating agency S&P Global downgraded the creditworthiness of the Russian government and a plethora of companies into junk territory because of the country‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. This makes it harder for the government and companies to raise capital on international markets.S&P Global cut the country‚Äôs credit rating to ‚ÄúCC.‚Äù This is defined as ‚Äúdefault imminent with little prospect for recovery.‚ÄùThirty ‚Äúfallen angels‚Äù have already occurred because of the Ukraine‚ÄìRussia military conflict. This refers to a firm with a credit rating that has been cut from investment grade to speculative grade (junk).Many of these corporations have stopped trading in London or New York  or have witnessed their shares collapse to nearly zero.But S&P Global analysts say that there‚Äôs still plenty of uncertainty regarding how damaging Moscow‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine will be for the future of domestic companies.‚ÄúIn terms of creditworthiness  the Russian‚ÄìUkraine conflict has had the largest impact on banks  with 28% of total related rating actions ‚Äù the agency noted.‚ÄúIrrespective of the duration of military hostilities  sanctions and related political risks are likely to remain in place for some time. Potential effects could include dislocated commodities markets‚Äînotably for oil and gas‚Äîsupply chain disruptions  inflationary pressures  weaker growth  and capital market volatility.‚ÄùWill It Be 1998 All Over Again?Many U.S. financial institutions have some exposure to Russian corporate debt.Citigroup stated that its investment in Russian sovereign and corporate debt could result in losses totaling as much as $9.8 billion.‚ÄúWe have been managing that [exposure] very proactively to bring that number down ‚Äù Citi CFO Mark Mason told attendees at an investor event.PIMCO  a California-based asset manager  amassed about $1.5 billion of Russian debt. With this immense exposure  it could face tremendous losses in coming years.Flags are seen outside of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)  where markets were roiled after Russia attacked Ukraine on Feb. 24  2022. (Caitlin Ochs/Reuters)Goldman Sachs has approximately $650 million in exposure  a small percentage of its overall $2.8 trillion credit balance.Could it be 1998 all over again? This was the last time that Russia defaulted on its debt  causing Wall Street to suffer tremendous losses. However  despite market analysts‚Äô glowing forecasts for the country‚Äôs economy  banks have been more cautious about investing too much into the nation.Morgan Stanley stated that the Russian economy is in such a terrible state that it could default on its foreign debts soon.Earlier this month  Simon Waever  Morgan Stanley‚Äôs global head of emerging-market sovereign credit strategy  wrote in a note that the Eastern European economy is edging closer to default amid talks of additional Western sanctions and expectations of a deep recession.‚ÄúWe see a default as the most likely scenario ‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúIn case of default  it is unlikely to be like a normal one  with Venezuela instead perhaps the most relevant comparison.‚ÄùJPMorgan analysts echoed these sentiments in a note  writing that ‚Äúsanctions have significantly increased the likelihood of a Russia government hard currency bond default.‚ÄùThus far  Russia has averted technical defaults by making coupon payments on dollar bonds that are set to mature in 2023 and 2043.,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,negative,0.01,0.14,0.85,True,English,"['First Russian Company', 'Foreign-Currency Debt', 'Severstal', 'Many U.S. financial institutions', 'chief emerging markets economist', 'total related rating actions', 'S&P Global analysts', 'Russian Mir payment systems', '$66 million Eurobond coupon payments', 'Ukraine‚ÄìRussia military conflict', 'U.S. Treasury', 'JPMorgan Chase analysts', 'related political risks', 'many bond payments', 'five-business-day grace period', 'loan participation notes', 'Thirty ‚Äúfallen angels', '$12.6 million coupon payment', 'Russian ruble coins', 'Russian ruble sign', 'The Russian Ministry', 'National Settlement Depository', 'international bond payment', 'Russian‚ÄìUkraine conflict', 'critical interest payment', 'state-owned Russian Railways', 'capital market volatility', 'corporate Eurobond payments', 'two international clearing', 'First Russian Company', 'domestic corporate Eurobonds', 'foreign unsecured debt', 'Russian corporate debt', 'international markets', 'global operations', 'Eurobond due', 'military hostilities', 'commodities markets', 'Russian investors', 'Russian firms', 'Russian securities', 'Russian corporates', 'international agents', 'settlement organizations', 'credit rating', 'interest payments', 'two people', 'two entities', 'foreign investors', 'foreign noteholders', 'domestic investors', 'corporate bondholders', 'Russian sovereign', 'Russian government', 'sovereign Eurobonds', 'Foreign-Currency Debt', 'external debt', 'Russian companies', 'Russian corporations', 'Kirill Kudryavtsev', 'Getty Images', 'mining company', 'industrial giant', 'ironclad permit', 'alternative options', 'complicated process', 'bank cards', 'European regulators', 'restrictive environment', 'European Union', 'top steelmaker', 'Polyus Gold', 'fertilizer producer', 'current marketplace', 'bigger risk', 'William Jackson', 'Capital Economics', 'rating agency', 'little prospect', 'investment grade', 'speculative grade', 'New York', 'largest impact', 'Potential effects', 'chain disruptions', 'inflationary pressures', 'weaker growth', 'domestic companies', 'domestic firm', 'Western sanctions', 'retaliatory sanctions', 'Other companies', 'junk territory', 'Severstal officials', 'banknotes', 'Moscow', 'Aug.', 'AFP', 'March', 'Citigroup', 'obligations', 'Bloomberg', 'discussions', 'claims', 'less', 'one-fifth', 'creditors', 'Kremlin', 'transit', 'photo', 'logos', 'Visa', 'Mastercard', 'delays', 'NSD', 'statement', 'Reuters', 'orders', 'clarifications', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'transactions', 'end', 'Finance', 'funds', 'challenges', 'NLMK', 'EuroChem', 'prelude', 'defaults', 'creditworthiness', 'plethora', 'country', 'invasion', 'CC', 'recovery', 'London', 'shares', 'plenty', 'uncertainty', 'future', 'terms', 'banks', 'duration', 'time', 'oil', 'gas', 'exposure']",2022-03-23,2022-03-24,m.theepochtimes.com

(the ""Stock Option Program 2022/2025"")  which materially has the same structure as the stock option programs adopted by the Annual General Meeting in 2019 (""Stock Option Program 2019/2022"") and the Annual General Meeting 2020 (""Stock Option Program 2020/2023""). The objective of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is to link a portion of the employees' remuneration to INVISIO's long-term performance and value creation for the shareholders. Thereby the long-term interests of the employees aligns with the interests of the shareholders. In addition  the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 will be an important tool for INVISIO to recruit  retain and motivate the company's employees and the board considers the program beneficial for both INVISIO and its shareholders in the coming years. Board members elected by the general meeting are not allowed to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025. A. ADOPTION OF THE PROGRAM 1. The Stock Option Program 2022/2025 in brief All INVISIO group employees shall be entitled to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025. Based on performance  position and the employee's importance to the INVISIO group  the employees will be granted stock options which entitle the participants to acquire shares in INVISIO during 2025  subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 (the ""Stock Options""). If the participant (i) throughout the entire vesting period of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  which runs from the allotment of the Stock Option up to and including 8 May 2025 (the ""Vesting Period"")  with certain exceptions  is employed by the INVISIO group and (ii) to the extent the performance based criteria for the Stock Options has been reached during 6 May 2022 ‚Äì 8 May 2025 (the ""Measurement Period"")  the participants will be entitled to acquire shares in INVISIO during May ‚Äì June 2025. To ensure INVISIO's undertaking to deliver shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  the board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 700 000 warrants (each warrant entitles to subscription for one (1) share in INVISIO) to a wholly-owned Danish subsidiary  INVISIO A/S (the ""Subsidiary""). To such extent the performance criteria of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is reached  the warrants shall be exercised to deliver shares in INVISIO to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025. 2. Costs Pursuant to IFRS 2  the Stock Options are to be recorded as a personnel expense during the Vesting Period and should be reported directly against equity. Based on the assumption of a share price of SEK 160 at the time of allotment and calculated by using the Black & Scholes and Monte Carlo methods  the estimated total reported cost for the Stock Options is approx. SEK 13.8 million for the period 2022/2025. In the event of a positive price trend  social security costs will arise due to the Stock Options. These costs shall be written off during the tenor of the Stock Options based on the value changes of the Stock Options. Based on the assumption that all 700 000 Stock Options will be exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO on 15 May 2025  and the INVISIO share price increases with 30 per cent and outperforms the SIXPRX Index (see definition below in item 5.5) by 20 percentage points during the Vesting Period  the social security costs are estimated to be approx. SEK 3.0 million. The costs are continuously reviewed during the Vesting Period. 3. Dilution and effects on important key ratios Up to 700 000 Stock Options may be issued to the participants in the program. The maximum number of shares in INVISIO which may be subscribed for in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is 700 000  corresponding to an increase of the share capital of a maximum of SEK 700 000. Based on the current number of outstanding shares  the maximum dilution resulting from the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 will be approx. 1.5 per cent of outstanding shares and votes  provided that all Stock Options are exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO. The total dilution resulting from all Stock Options being exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO in Stock Option Program 2019/2022  Stock Option Program 2020/2023 and Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is approximately 4.1 per cent based on the number of outstanding shares and votes as of today. The costs and dilution are expected to have only a marginal effect on the key ratios of INVISIO. 4. Other share related incentive programs There are two ongoing share related incentive programs in INVISIO  the Stock Option Program 2019/2022  adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2019  and the Stock Option Program 2020/2023  adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020. 5. Main terms and conditions for the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 5.1 Issuance and allotment of Stock Options A maximum of 700 000 Stock Options may be allotted to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025. Allotment will occur on 6 May 2022. 5.2 Participants in the program and allocation The Stock Options may be allocated to all employees who  at the time of allotment  are permanently employed by the INVISIO group  approx. 190 persons. Persons who  at the time of allotment  have resigned from their employment  or who have been dismissed from their employment by INVISIO  will not be granted Stock Options. Future employees  who have not yet commenced their employment at the time of allotment  may  conditioned upon that the employment commences on 1 December 2022 at the latest  be offered to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 if the board considers it compatible with the objective of the program. The participants may be granted the maximum number of Stock Options as stated below. Category 1 ‚Äì CEO may be granted a maximum of 24 000 Stock Options. Category 2 ‚Äì a maximum of six senior executives  may be granted a maximum of 12 000 Stock Options per person. Category 3 ‚Äì other employees  approx. 183 persons  may be granted a maximum of 6 000 Stock Options per person. Allotment of Stock Options shall be based on inter alia the participant's performance  position and importance for INVISIO. No employee is guaranteed to be granted Stock Options. 5.3 Stock Option price and purchase price The granted Stock Options are received free of charge. After the Stock Options have been granted and vested  and to the extent the performance criteria for the Stock Options have been reached  each Stock Option entitles to the acquisition of one (1) share in INVISIO at a price corresponding to the average share price of INVISIO's share during the period 1 April 2022 ‚Äì 30 April 2022 (the ""Purchase Price""). The average share price shall be calculated as the average for each trading day calculated average volume-weighted price paid for the INVISIO share on Nasdaq Stockholm  round off to the nearest full ten √∂re whereby five √∂re shall be round off upwards. 5.4 Vesting conditions If  for whatever reason  a participant's employment with the INVISIO group would come to an end before the end of the Vesting Period  the Stock Options will lapse and cannot be exercised. Only if the participant has been employed by the INVISIO group for at least 36 months at the end of the notice period  and: (a) the employment is terminated by INVISIO or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than due to the participant's breach of the employment agreement  or (b) the employment is terminated in INVISIO or any of its subsidiaries by the participant due to a significant breach of the employment agreement by INVISIO or any of its subsidiaries  the participant shall be entitled to exercise the Stock Options during the Exercise Period. A participant encompassed by items (a)-(b) above shall  with regard to the Stock Options  be treated as if he/she was still employed by the INVISIO group during the entire Vesting Period. 5.5 Performance criteria The number of granted Stock Options  which each participant will be entitled to exercise to acquire shares in INVISIO  is dependent on the extent to which the following performance criteria for the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 has been reached: The share price development for the INVISIO share (including paid dividends from INVISIO to its shareholders for the period 1 April 2022 ‚Äì 30 April 2025) during the Measurement Period compared to the SIX Portfolio Return Index (""SIXPRX"") reference index. (SIXPRX displays the average development (including dividends) on Nasdaq Stockholm adjusted for stock fund placement limitations.) In order for all (100 per cent) of the Stock Options to entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO it is required that the share price development for INVISIO surpasses SIXPRX with 20 percentage points. If the share price development surpasses SIXPRX with 10 percentage points  half (50 per cent) of the participant's Stock Options will entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO. If the share price development for the INVISIO share surpasses SIXPRX with more than 10 but with less than 20 percentage points  the Stock Options will entitle to acquisition of shares in INVISIO on a linear basis between 50 to 100 per cent. If the share price development in INVISIO does not surpasses SIXPRX with 10 percentage points  all (100 per cent) of the Stock Options will lapse. 5.6 Exercise The exercise of Stock Options to acquire new shares in INVISIO may  to the extent the performance criteria for the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is reached and the participant has fulfilled the vesting conditions  occur during the period 15 May ‚Äì 30 June 2025 (the ""Exercise Period""). The Exercise Period may be postponed if the board deems it suitable. The Stock Options will automatically lapse and may no longer be exercised at the end of the Exercise Period. 5.7 Transfer and pledging Stock Options are non-transferrable and may not be pledged. 5.8 Recalculation As far as the warrants  which have been issued to secure delivery of shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  are subject to recalculation according to the terms and conditions for warrants  the Stock Options shall be recalculated accordingly. Recalculation shall take place in the event of e.g. bonus issues  rights issues  reverse share splits and share splits in accordance with the terms and conditions for warrants 2022/2025  which are available on INVISIO's website. 5.9 Change of control In the event of a change of control in INVISIO  which inter alia includes that someone  directly or indirectly  owns or controls 50 per cent or more of the votes in INVISIO as well as in certain other events  participants have a right to exercise granted Stock Options in advance  i.e. even during the Vesting Period. 5.10 Preparation and administration The Stock Options shall be subject to the provisions of separate agreements with each participant. The board shall be responsible for preparing the agreements with the participants and the administration of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  with its primary terms and conditions being in accordance with the resolution by the Annual General Meeting. In connection therewith  the board may make adjustments in order to fulfil specific rules or market conditions. Further  the board may make other adjustments  including to resolve to reduce the number of Stock Options which may be exercised to acquire new shares (wholly or partially) for all employees or certain categories of employees which are encompassed by the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  if significant changes occur in the INVISIO group or on the market that the board considers entailing that the conditions for acquisition of new shares in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 no longer fulfils the objective of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025. B. ISSUANCE OF WARRANTS In order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  the board of INVISIO proposes that INVISIO  deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues a maximum of 700 000 warrants  Series 2022/2025  entitling to subscription of new shares in INVISIO as follows. 1. The warrants shall be issued free of charge. Each warrant shall entitle to subscription of one share in INVISIO  thus  the share capital will increase with maximum SEK 700 000 after full exercise of the warrants. 2. With deviation of the shareholders' preferential rights  Invisio A/S shall be entitled to subscribe for the warrants. 3. The warrants shall be subscribed for by 10 May 2022 at the latest. The term of subscription may be extended by the board. 4. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of shares from the day the warrants are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 31 December 2025. 5. The warrants shall have a subscription price at subscription of new share corresponding to the average share price of the INVISIO share during the period 1 April 2022 ‚Äì 30 April 2022 (i.e. the same price as the Purchase Price  defined in item A). The average share price shall be calculated as the average for each trading day calculated average volume-weighted price paid for the INVISIO share on Nasdaq Stockholm  round off to the nearest full ten √∂re whereby five √∂re shall be round off upwards  during a specified period. In the event that a price paid is not available  the bid price listed as the closing price shall be included in the calculation. A day without a listing of a price paid or bid price shall not be included in the calculation. 6. The newly issued shares shall entitle to dividend from the first record date for dividend that occurs after the shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. 7. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are available on INVISIO's website and will be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the issuance (and the transfer) ensures delivery of shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025. For an account of the reasons for adopting the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  please see item A. C. APPROVAL OF TRANSFER OF WARRANTS The board proposes that the Subsidiary may transfer/dispose of the warrants to the participants or otherwise to third parties for the purpose of delivering shares in INVISIO to the participants in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025. The Subsidiary may only transfer/dispose of the warrants for this purpose. D. MISCELLANEOUS 1.

Thereby the long-term interests of the employees aligns with the interests of the shareholders. In addition  the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 will be an important tool for INVISIO to recruit  retain and motivate the company's employees and the board considers the program beneficial for both INVISIO and its shareholders in the coming years. Board members elected by the general meeting are not allowed to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.A. ADOPTION OF THE PROGRAM1. The Stock Option Program 2022/2025 in briefAll INVISIO group employees shall be entitled to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.Based on performance  position and the employee's importance to the INVISIO group  the employees will be granted stock options which entitle the participants to acquire shares in INVISIO during 2025  subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 (the ""Stock Options""). If the participant (i) throughout the entire vesting period of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  which runs from the allotment of the Stock Option up to and including 8 May 2025 (the ""Vesting Period"")  with certain exceptions  is employed by the INVISIO group and (ii) to the extent the performance based criteria for the Stock Options has been reached during 6 May 2022 - 8 May 2025 (the ""Measurement Period"")  the participants will be entitled to acquire shares in INVISIO during May - June 2025.To ensure INVISIO's undertaking to deliver shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  the board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 700 000 warrants (each warrant entitles to subscription for one (1) share in INVISIO) to a wholly-owned Danish subsidiary  INVISIO A/S (the ""Subsidiary""). To such extent the performance criteria of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is reached  the warrants shall be exercised to deliver shares in INVISIO to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.2. CostsPursuant to IFRS 2  the Stock Options are to be recorded as a personnel expense during the Vesting Period and should be reported directly against equity. Based on the assumption of a share price of SEK 160 at the time of allotment and calculated by using the Black & Scholes and Monte Carlo methods  the estimated total reported cost for the Stock Options is approx. SEK 13.8 million for the period 2022/2025.In the event of a positive price trend  social security costs will arise due to the Stock Options. These costs shall be written off during the tenor of the Stock Options based on the value changes of the Stock Options.Based on the assumption that all 700 000 Stock Options will be exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO on 15 May 2025  and the INVISIO share price increases with 30 per cent and outperforms the SIXPRX Index (see definition below in item 5.5) by 20 percentage points during the Vesting Period  the social security costs are estimated to be approx. SEK 3.0 million. The costs are continuously reviewed during the Vesting Period.3. Dilution and effects on important key ratiosUp to 700 000 Stock Options may be issued to the participants in the program. The maximum number of shares in INVISIO which may be subscribed for in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is 700 000  corresponding to an increase of the share capital of a maximum of SEK 700 000. Based on the current number of outstanding shares  the maximum dilution resulting from the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 will be approx. 1.5 per cent of outstanding shares and votes  provided that all Stock Options are exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO. The total dilution resulting from all Stock Options being exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO in Stock Option Program 2019/2022  Stock Option Program 2020/2023 and Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is approximately 4.1 per cent based on the number of outstanding shares and votes as of today.The costs and dilution are expected to have only a marginal effect on the key ratios of INVISIO.4. Other share related incentive programsThere are two ongoing share related incentive programs in INVISIO  the Stock Option Program 2019/2022  adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2019  and the Stock Option Program 2020/2023  adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020.5. Main terms and conditions for the Stock Option Program 2022/20255.1Issuance and allotment of Stock OptionsA maximum of 700 000 Stock Options may be allotted to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025. Allotment will occur on 6 May 2022.5.2Participants in the program and allocationThe Stock Options may be allocated to all employees who  at the time of allotment  are permanently employed by the INVISIO group  approx. 190 persons. Persons who  at the time of allotment  have resigned from their employment  or who have been dismissed from their employment by INVISIO  will not be granted Stock Options. Future employees  who have not yet commenced their employment at the time of allotment  may  conditioned upon that the employment commences on 1 December 2022 at the latest  be offered to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 if the board considers it compatible with the objective of the program.The participants may be granted the maximum number of Stock Options as stated below.Category 1 - CEO may be granted a maximum of 24 000 Stock Options.Category 2 - a maximum of six senior executives  may be granted a maximum of 12 000 Stock Options per person.Category 3 - other employees  approx. 183 persons  may be granted a maximum of 6 000 Stock Options per person.Allotment of Stock Options shall be based on inter alia the participant's performance  position and importance for INVISIO.No employee is guaranteed to be granted Stock Options.5.3Stock Option price and purchase priceThe granted Stock Options are received free of charge.After the Stock Options have been granted and vested  and to the extent the performance criteria for the Stock Options have been reached  each Stock Option entitles to the acquisition of one (1) share in INVISIO at a price corresponding to the average share price of INVISIO's share during the period 1 April 2022 - 30 April 2022 (the ""Purchase Price""). The average share price shall be calculated as the average for each trading day calculated average volume-weighted price paid for the INVISIO share on Nasdaq Stockholm  round off to the nearest full ten √∂re whereby five √∂re shall be round off upwards.5.4Vesting conditionsIf  for whatever reason  a participant's employment with the INVISIO group would come to an end before the end of the Vesting Period  the Stock Options will lapse and cannot be exercised. Only if the participant has been employed by the INVISIO group for at least 36 months at the end of the notice period  and:(a) the employment is terminated by INVISIO or any of its subsidiaries for any reason other than due to the participant's breach of the employment agreement  or(b) the employment is terminated in INVISIO or any of its subsidiaries by the participant due to a significant breach of the employment agreement by INVISIO or any of its subsidiaries the participant shall be entitled to exercise the Stock Options during the Exercise Period.A participant encompassed by items (a)-(b) above shall  with regard to the Stock Options  be treated as if he/she was still employed by the INVISIO group during the entire Vesting Period.5.5Performance criteriaThe number of granted Stock Options  which each participant will be entitled to exercise to acquire shares in INVISIO  is dependent on the extent to which the following performance criteria for the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 has been reached:The share price development for the INVISIO share (including paid dividends from INVISIO to its shareholders for the period 1 April 2022 - 30 April 2025) during the Measurement Period compared to the SIX Portfolio Return Index (""SIXPRX"") reference index. (SIXPRX displays the average development (including dividends) on Nasdaq Stockholm adjusted for stock fund placement limitations.)In order for all (100 per cent) of the Stock Options to entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO it is required that the share price development for INVISIO surpasses SIXPRX with 20 percentage points. If the share price development surpasses SIXPRX with 10 percentage points  half (50 per cent) of the participant's Stock Options will entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO. If the share price development for the INVISIO share surpasses SIXPRX with more than 10 but with less than 20 percentage points  the Stock Options will entitle to acquisition of shares in INVISIO on a linear basis between 50 to 100 per cent. If the share price development in INVISIO does not surpasses SIXPRX with 10 percentage points  all (100 per cent) of the Stock Options will lapse.5.6ExerciseThe exercise of Stock Options to acquire new shares in INVISIO may  to the extent the performance criteria for the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is reached and the participant has fulfilled the vesting conditions  occur during the period 15 May - 30 June 2025 (the ""Exercise Period"").The Exercise Period may be postponed if the board deems it suitable.The Stock Options will automatically lapse and may no longer be exercised at the end of the Exercise Period.5.7Transfer and pledgingStock Options are non-transferrable and may not be pledged.5.8RecalculationAs far as the warrants  which have been issued to secure delivery of shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  are subject to recalculation according to the terms and conditions for warrants  the Stock Options shall be recalculated accordingly.Recalculation shall take place in the event of e.g. bonus issues  rights issues  reverse share splits and share splits in accordance with the terms and conditions for warrants 2022/2025  which are available on INVISIO's website.5.9Change of controlIn the event of a change of control in INVISIO  which inter alia includes that someone  directly or indirectly  owns or controls 50 per cent or more of the votes in INVISIO as well as in certain other events  participants have a right to exercise granted Stock Options in advance  i.e. even during the Vesting Period.5.10Preparation and administrationThe Stock Options shall be subject to the provisions of separate agreements with each participant.The board shall be responsible for preparing the agreements with the participants and the administration of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  with its primary terms and conditions being in accordance with the resolution by the Annual General Meeting. In connection therewith  the board may make adjustments in order to fulfil specific rules or market conditions. Further  the board may make other adjustments  including to resolve to reduce the number of Stock Options which may be exercised to acquire new shares (wholly or partially) for all employees or certain categories of employees which are encompassed by the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  if significant changes occur in the INVISIO group or on the market that the board considers entailing that the conditions for acquisition of new shares in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 no longer fulfils the objective of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.B. ISSUANCE OF WARRANTSIn order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  the board of INVISIO proposes that INVISIO  deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues a maximum of 700 000 warrants  Series 2022/2025  entitling to subscription of new shares in INVISIO as follows.1. The warrants shall be issued free of charge. Each warrant shall entitle to subscription of one share in INVISIO  thus  the share capital will increase with maximum SEK 700 000 after full exercise of the warrants.2. With deviation of the shareholders' preferential rights  Invisio A/S shall be entitled to subscribe for the warrants.3. The warrants shall be subscribed for by 10 May 2022 at the latest. The term of subscription may be extended by the board.4. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of shares from the day the warrants are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 31 December 2025.5. The warrants shall have a subscription price at subscription of new share corresponding to the average share price of the INVISIO share during the period 1 April 2022 - 30 April 2022 (i.e. the same price as the Purchase Price  defined in item A). The average share price shall be calculated as the average for each trading day calculated average volume-weighted price paid for the INVISIO share on Nasdaq Stockholm  round off to the nearest full ten √∂re whereby five √∂re shall be round off upwards  during a specified period. In the event that a price paid is not available  the bid price listed as the closing price shall be included in the calculation.

This year  Active Equity ETFs received $13.11 billion of net inflows  a meager amount compared to Passive Equity ETFs  which netted $160 billion over the same period. America-domiciled Active Equity ETFs scooped in 99% of the net inflows. Meanwhile  Europe witnessed minor outflows of $55 million (net) and APAC ¬ñ net inflows of $155 million.Recently  S&P DJI released their semi-annual SPIVA research which measures actively managed funds performance against their relevant index benchmarks worldwide. The research covers funds in Australia  Canada  Europe  India  Japan  Latin America  the Middle East  South Africa  and the United States. Read Active ETFs: Not a magic bullet.The full-year 2021 results show that in 16 of the 18 categories tracking U.S. equities-focused funds  more than half the funds underperformed their benchmark. On the other hand  half of the European equities-focused funds in 3 out of 8 categories were able to beat their benchmarks.3 most popular Active Equity ETFs in AmericaAmong the most popular active ETFs (in terms of net inflows) in America  this year are JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPI  $1.68 billion)  ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK  $1.07 billion)  and Avantis U.S. Small Cap Value ETF (AVUV  $510 million).JEPI seeks to deliver a significant portion of the return associated with the S&P 500 Index with less volatility  in addition to generating a monthly income stream from associated option premiums and stock dividends.In terms of sector exposure (as of March 23rd  2022)  healthcare has the highest weighting (12.5%)  followed by industrials (12.5%)  information technology (11.2%)  and consumer staples (11.1%). The fund is well-diversified with 113 holdings  with each holding accounting for <2% of the total portfolio (as of March 22nd  2022)JEPI has a total expense ratio of 0.35% and trades primarily on the NYSE Arca. A $10 000 investment in JEPI on April 4th  2020  would be worth $13 697 by February 28th  2022 (+37%).3 most popular Active Equity ETFs in EuropeIn Europe  Fidelity Sustainable Research Enhanced US Equity UCITS ETF (FUSS  $410 million) JPMorgan ETFs (Ireland) ICAV - Global Research Enhanced Index Equity (ESG) UCITS ETF - Acc ¬ñ USD (JREG  $144 million)  JPMorgan ETFs (Ireland) ICAV - Global Research Enhanced Index Equity (ESG) UCITS ETF (Acc) - GBP Hedged (JGEP  $129 million)  and JPMorgan ETFs (Ireland) ICAV - Global Emerging Markets Research Enhanced Index Equity (ESG) UCITS ETF - Acc - USD (JREM  $127 million) were among the most targeted active equity ETFs.FUSS invests in U.S. equities across different sectors  including information technology (28%)  healthcare (14%)  consumer discretionary (12%)  financials (11.8%)  and telecommunication services (9%) ¬ñ among others.

1417,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2022/mar/24/deutsche-borse-photography-prize-review-striking-imagery-of-global-belonging,Deutsche B√∂rse photography prize review ‚Äì striking imagery of global belonging,From haunting images of a decaying Miami to the tumult of 70s Belfast  this show pits traditional and contemporary strategies against each other,This year‚Äôs Deutsche B√∂rse photography prize shortlist show is  as ever  a study in dramatically contrasting approaches to the medium. On one floor of The Photographers‚Äô Gallery  Deana Lawson‚Äôs elaborately constructed tableaux of Black experience  which draw on  and deftly subvert  studio portraiture  documentary and vernacular traditions  give way to Gilles Peress‚Äôs visceral reportage from the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The two seem worlds apart.Likewise  on a separate floor  there‚Äôs a jolting shift from the vivid colours and disorienting compositions of Anastasia Samoylova‚Äôs Miami to Jo Ractliffe‚Äôs stark South African landscapes. While traditional and contemporary strategies rub uneasily up against each other throughout  there is a kind of unity in the themes of community and belonging  struggle and self-definition.If each room is a small  self-contained exhibition designed to illuminate a much bigger body of work  it is Samoylova and Ractliffe that come off best here. The former‚Äôs work-in-progress  FloodZone  transports you to a Ballardian future world that is already unfolding in real time. Her large-scale  almost dreamlike constructions depict the hyperreal iconography of Miami‚Äôs tourism and real estate industries as it exists alongside the ominous harbingers of impending eco-disaster: flooded basements  uprooted palm trees leaning precariously against art deco facades  cracked and crumbling concrete pavements beneath vast advertisements for high-end beachfront properties.In a room painted aquamarine  the baby-doll pinkness of Miami‚Äôs walls and pavements takes on an even more sickly aspect ‚Äì damp-stained  mould-covered  and in retreat from a force more inexorably powerful than capital and commerce.Gator (2017) from the series FloodZone by Anastasia Samoylova. Photograph: Anastasia SamoylovaIn contrast  Ractliffe‚Äôs space is airy and light  her monochrome photographs exuding a quietude that is immediately palpable. For me  this is the most realised exhibition here  thoughtfully conceived and deftly curated to allow these stark  haunted landscapes to speak for themselves. Ractliffe‚Äôs subject is post-apartheid  rural South Africa  which she has photographed over 40 years. Her most obvious precursor is the late David Goldblatt  but Ractliffe‚Äôs landscapes are more elusive: vast  arid flatlands pockmarked by traces of the colonial past: the scattered ruins of concrete pipelines  industrial buildings and former shantytowns. Culled from her recent monograph  Photographs 1980s ‚Äì Now  it is the work that most repays close attention  her quiet observational approach characterised by subtle visual rhythms and echoes that speak of a deep and patient engagement with the land  its people and its ghosts.On the floor below  Deana Lawson‚Äôs Centropy is as ambitiously conceptual as its title suggests  her large-scale constructed portraits with mirrored frames existing somewhere between portraiture and myth  their symbolism often located within the domestic traditions of Black experience. In one striking tableau  Monetta Passing  an elderly man sits next to a dead woman who has been laid out in her finery on a semi-raised  silk-draped couch beneath gold curtains. His gaze is direct  stern and stoical. Beside him  an ornate display of flowers stand above a piece of exercise equipment ‚Äì a glimpse of the functional amid the elaborate. The scale and rich colour tones combine with incidental details ‚Äì her laced-gloved hands  his tattooed head ‚Äì to create a scene both dramatically enhanced and  for all its artifice  authentic.A family snapshot has been enlarged  and perhaps treated  to foreground its signs of wear and tearElsewhere  a family snapshot of a mother and daughter  posing casually and beaming at the camera  has been enlarged  and perhaps treated  to foreground its signs of wear and tear: surface dirt  erosion  scratches. The scale lends an ordinary  unaffected portrait an even deeper charm  but the degraded state of the print makes one‚Äôs thoughts turn inevitably to the time between then and now  and all that may have happened in between.Lawson‚Äôs ambitious images  which include holograms  always allow a lot of space for the viewer to enter in and form their own interpretations  while simultaneously holding something back. That something ‚Äì embedded  complex  and elusive ‚Äì is crucial in terms of the resonance these photographs possess. In his catalogue essay  pointedly titled Against Simplicity  writer and photographer Stanley Wolukau-Wanambwa writes that ‚ÄúLawson‚Äôs portaits demonstrate how it is that Blackness ‚Ä¶ cannot be both accurately and simply described‚Äù. Nor interpreted.Of late  Peress has worked hard on reimagining ‚Äì or repositioning ‚Äì his vast archive of images from the Troubles in Northern Ireland. The work on display here  arranged floor to ceiling in unframed monochrome grids  is a mere fraction of the vast flow of images that make up his epic 2021 book Whatever You Say  Say Nothing. His aim was to create a work of ‚Äúdocumentary fiction‚Äù that evokes the ‚Äúhelicoidal‚Äù nature of time in a conflict zone ‚Äì days that spiral and repeat around rituals of protest  resistance  marching  violence and mourning.Pictures taken from Whatever You Say  Say Nothing by Gilles Peress. Photograph: Gilles PeressThe most obvious way to do this in a gallery would be through multiscreen projections rather than prints ‚Äì and collages ‚Äì on the wall  which  in this relatively small apace  fail to evoke the ambition of the project. The images themselves  though  are visceral and often uncannily evocative of the time  the juxtaposition of the ordinary ‚Äì youngsters playing  teens snogging ‚Äì with the arresting ‚Äì a girl sweeping broken glass from her front yard while a soldier stands a few feet away  baton in hand  behind a riot shield.Peress captures the tumult of the Troubles like few others: the walls a mad dance of imagery: sectarian graffiti  masked young people  Republican and Loyalist paraphernalia  bonfires  rioters and the deserted nocturnal streets of Belfast in a time of constant paranoia. In this context  though  the power of a single image  mounted and framed on a wall  has been lost amid the overload.As ever  it‚Äôs hard to know what criteria one would use to select a winner from such disparate artists  but  given the times we live in  and the prize‚Äôs past penchant for photography that ‚Äúinterrogates the medium ‚Äù the smart money‚Äôs on Lawson or Samoylova.

The 2022 Axway API Adoption Survey  a commissioned ‚Ä¶,"PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Axway (Euronext: AXW.PA)  an API Management leader  finds in a new study that APIs offer a valuable return on investment ‚Äì but only if organizations drive consumption of their APIs.The 2022 Axway API Adoption Survey  a commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting in December 2021 on behalf of Axway  analysts surveyed more than 300 IT and business decision-makers tasked with driving digital business at global organizations.72% of respondents say they expect an estimated 26.4% digital business growth on average if they could increase API adoption.However  there‚Äôs still a significant gap between API development and API consumption: 71% of those surveyed said they didn't achieve the business results planned from their APIs ‚Äì often due to a lack of API adoption  UX issues  as well as lack of API performance metrics and related insights.‚ÄúMany enterprises are enthusiastic about APIs  but it‚Äôs essential to focus on creating the right APIs  ones that will deliver business value. What people often lack is a holistic view of their APIs to make data-driven decisions ‚Äù says Axway Chief Catalyst Brian Pagano.86% of API decision-makers agree the value of their APIs is not in their existence alone  but in their consumption. 59% have seen or expect to see increased revenue from API traffic if they had an API management product that closes the gap between development and consumption.Yet companies often face cultural challenges as well as technological obstacles  both internally (legacy systems  IT complexity  inflexible processes  slow API adoption) and externally (complicated partner onboarding).‚ÄúBy improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our API development and management process  we‚Äôre cutting the time it takes from ideation to service deployment ‚Äî helping us to bring value-added services to our customers faster than ever ‚Äù said Jim Cornelius  Vice President  Solution Architect at Robert W. Baird & Co.‚ÄúIf there are any challenges with API consumption or authentication  the Amplify API Management Platform allows us to troubleshoot them and get to the root cause rapidly "" adds Cornelius.‚ÄúThe right API management platform helps close the gap between development and usage through centralized  automated governance  leading to increased revenue and more valuable APIs ‚Äì not to mention a decrease in API complexity ‚Äù said Pagano.Outcomes may be helped by experts who specialize in digital transformation and API technology. Axway Catalysts  for example  advise organizations looking to align their API strategy with larger  transformative business goals. As the study highlights  this kind of vendor expertise and support can help make the cultural shift required to truly leverage the power and promise of APIs.Join us for a webinar discussing the findings and what this means for companies looking to drive business with APIs.

Pomacle is at the heart of a new and fully French renewable isododecane production chain. Its commercial launch will take place under the ‚ÄúIsonaturane¬Æ 12‚Äù brand at In-Cosmetics in Paris in early April. The Company is accelerating its scale-up trajectory and reaffirming its ambitions in aviation biofuels.Start of commercial production in PomacleThe Company‚Äôs first commercial unit  located on the ARD site in Pomacle-Bazancourt  near Reims  has begun production on schedule. The first batches of biosourced isobutene have been manufactured at this unit in March 2022.This new and fully French production chain  using raw materials sourced locally  was established thanks to developments in the manufacturing process  which now relies on subcontractors both upstream (industrial fermentation) and downstream (green chemistry).Participation in the In-Cosmetics trade showTo promote this emerging sector  Global Bioenergies is to exhibit its flagship ingredient at In-Cosmetics from 5 to 7 April. In-Cosmetics is the world‚Äôs leading trade show for cosmetic ingredients. Isonaturane¬Æ 12 will be marketed to the big names in cosmetics and major manufacturers in the field.Daphne Galvez  Global Bioenergies Head of Sales  said: ‚ÄúIn-Cosmetics is a great place to showcase innovations and the ideal venue to launch a new ingredient on the market. It will represent a new milestone for Global Bioenergies: Isonaturane¬Æ 12 has cleared all the regulatory hurdles. It has been validated at market scale with our LAST¬Æ make-up brand  the first in the world to combine longwear  waterproof and no transfer properties with natural origin. Our aim is now to distribute this innovative ingredient to players in the field  in order to help them convert their make-up ranges to naturalness without any compromise on performance. The start-up of the new unit will enable us to respond to sampling requests from numerous prospects  and complete referencing procedures prior to the commercial delivery of material in the second half of 2022.‚ÄùStory continuesAccelerated scale-up prospectsThe success of the unit‚Äôs start-up without any major difficulties means that the scale-up schedule can be accelerated: the Company now expects to reach full capacity by the end of 2022  rather than over 18 months as initially projected. That will take the unit‚Äôs isobutene annual production capacity to 100 tonnes. The isobutene will then be converted into isododecane for the make-up ingredients market.The scale-up to 1 000 tonnes  planned for late 2024 or early 2025  is starting to look like a realistic prospect. The aim will be to target the broader dermo-cosmetics and hair care markets. That will put Global Bioenergies in a strong position to target the much larger aviation biofuels market by 2026 or 2027. Using the ingredient in this sector will bring a significant environmental impact (CO 2 reductions)  while at the same time helping reduce Europe‚Äôs energy dependency.Marc Delcourt  Chief Executive Officer of Global Bioenergies  said: ‚ÄúThe fight against global warming and the quest to achieve Europe‚Äôs strategic challenges have become central concerns across the board  and remind us of the relevance of the Company‚Äôs strategy and investments since its creation in 2008. Our target markets  cosmetic ingredients in the short term and aviation biofuels in the medium term  are booming: the number of potential customers is increasing rapidly  as are the potential competitors for our Company. We can now state that our process  patiently developed over more than 10 years  is unique and offers specific and decisive advantages that will enable us to compete in the cosmetic ingredients market. In the aviation biofuels market  it will be necessary to improve performance further  but we believe that to be achievable within 12 to 24 months. We will then boast the best fermentation process in the world to decarbonise air transport.‚ÄùAbout GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies has developed a process to convert plant-derived resources into a family of compounds used in the cosmetics industry as well as the energy and materials sectors. In 2021  the Group entered the market with the launch of LAST¬Æ  its own make-up brand with formulas based on a key ingredient produced via its technology. The Company is constantly seeking to enhance the performance of its process while gradually ramping up production capacities in order to supply ingredients to major cosmetics manufacturers  thereby promoting naturalness in the industry whilst improving its carbon footprint. Some of these compounds can also be used to produce renewable plastics  rubbers and paints. Lastly  Global Bioenergies is also aiming to reduce CO 2 emissions in the aviation sector and thereby curb global warming.

I am proud of the team maintaining their focus on execution while operating in a challenging market environment. We reached numerous milestones in 2021 and feel we are well positioned to further build on this momentum in 2022 ‚Äù commented Olivier Taelman  Nyxoah‚Äôs Chief Executive Officer. ‚ÄúThrough the BETTER SLEEP study results  we are now able to offer an effective solution for CCC patients with an expanded CE mark indication in Europe  and we are working hard to initiate a CCC-focused IDE trial in the US. Particularly encouraging are the strong responder rates in all patient cohorts  further increasing our confidence in positive outcomes from the ongoing DREAM study.‚ÄùStory continues‚ÄúWe have also been happy with our commercial progress in Europe  focusing on Germany  where we obtained a dedicated DRG code.‚Äù continued Mr. Taelman. ‚ÄúWe already had 12 active implant sites in December 2021 and continue to expand rapidly. In addition  we have secured a DRG code in Switzerland and hospital reimbursement in Spain while we await final reimbursement decisions in the Netherlands and Belgium. Our commercial strategy is based on a deep understanding of the patient journey  building strong relationships with implanting surgeons and further strengthening their relationships with referring sleep physicians  in combination with digital marketing programs.‚ÄùMr. Taelman continued  ‚ÄúWe secured CE mark MR conditional labeling for Genio¬Æ  enabling all implanted patients to safely undergo 1.5T and 3T MRI diagnostics scans. Genio¬Æ is now the only HGNS device with an MRI compatibility label for full-body and 3T. This illustrates our patient-centric strategy  and you can soon expect to hear more on the progress made by our R&D team.

The increase in revenue was attributable to the Company‚Äôs commercialization of the Genio¬Æ system  primarily in Germany. Revenue for the second half of 2021 was ‚Ç¨497 000  a 40.0% increase versus the first half of the year despite COVID-related headwinds during the fourth quarter.Cost of Goods SoldCost of goods sold was ‚Ç¨303 000 for the twelve months ending December 31  2021  representing a gross profit of ‚Ç¨549 000  or gross margin of 64.4%. This compares to total costs of goods sold of ‚Ç¨30 000 in the 2020  for a gross profit of ‚Ç¨39 000  or gross margin of 56.5%.General and Administrative ExpensesGeneral and administrative expenses rose to ‚Ç¨11.1 million for the full year ending December 31  2021  from ‚Ç¨7.5 million in the prior year. This was due primarily to increased commercial efforts in Germany and other European markets  as well as investments in Nyxoah‚Äôs corporate infrastructure. The Company expects to continue adding headcount across the organization ahead of U.S. commercial launch.Research and Development ExpensesResearch and Development expenses were ‚Ç¨2.4 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2021  a substantial increase over the ‚Ç¨0.5 million for the prior year  reflecting the ongoing research and development activities  most notably the development of next generation versions of the Genio¬Æ system. As of January 2021  the Company started to amortize its intangible assets  which explains the significant increase in depreciation expenses for the twelve months ending December 31  2021  compared to the twelve months ending December 31  2020.Clinical ExpensesClinical expenses increased to ‚Ç¨2.7 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2021  from ‚Ç¨1.1 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2020. Total clinical expenses were ‚Ç¨9.5 million  of which ‚Ç¨6.8 million was capitalized  reflecting an increase in staff and consulting to support the completion of the BETTER SLEEP trial implantations  continuous recruitment for the EliSA trial  and the ongoing DREAM IDE trial in the United States.Manufacturing ExpensesManufacturing expenses increased to ‚Ç¨4.8 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2021  from ‚Ç¨0.5 million for the twelve months ending December 30  2020  due mainly to increased demand for our Genio¬Æ system for both commercial and non-commercial purposes.Quality Assurance and Regulatory ExpensesQuality assurance and regulatory expenses of ‚Ç¨1.5 million for the year ending December 31  2021  were up significantly from ‚Ç¨0.2 million for the year ending December 31  2020  to support the scale-up of operations.Patent Fees & Related ExpensesPatents fees and related expenses increased from ‚Ç¨0.1 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2020  to ‚Ç¨1.1 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2021  due to expenses related to the exclusive licensing agreement with Vanderbilt University.Therapy Development ExpensesTherapy development expenses were ‚Ç¨3.6 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2021  versus ‚Ç¨1.9 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2020. The increase in expenses was mainly driven by the scale-up of commercial operations in Europe.Operating LossThe Company realized a net loss of ‚Ç¨27.6 million for the full year ending December 31  2021  compared to a net loss of ‚Ç¨12.2 million for the full year ending December 31  2020  due to increases of activities in all departments.Cash PositionCash and cash equivalents totaled ‚Ç¨135.5 million on December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨92.3 million on December 31  2020. The increase was due primarily to total gross proceeds of $97.8 million generated from the July 2021 IPO.Net cash used in operations was ‚Ç¨25.3 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2021  compared to ‚Ç¨6.9 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2020. The increase was primarily due to an increase in net loss for the period that was mainly attributable to increased general and administrative expenses  research and development expenses  manufacturing expenses and therapy development expenses  which were offset by a positive variation in the working capital of ‚Ç¨1.1 million.Net cash used in investing activities was ‚Ç¨11.8 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2021  compared ‚Ç¨10.7 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2020.Net cash generated in financing activities for the twelve months ending December 31  2021  was ‚Ç¨76.5 compared to ‚Ç¨104.0 million of net cash provided by financing activities during the twelve months ending December 31  2020.Outlook for 2022The Company‚Äôs business  operational  and clinical outlook for 2022 include the following expected milestones and goals:Completing DREAM trial implants in the second quarter of 2022Continuing commercial execution in GermanyCommencing a U.S. IDE study for CCC patients in the fourth quarter of 2022Full-year report 2021Nyxoah‚Äôs financial report for the full year 2021  including details of the audited consolidated results  are available on the investor page of Nyxoah‚Äôs website ( https://investors.nyxoah.com/financials ).Conference call and webcast presentationNyxoah will conduct a conference call to open to the public tomorrow  March 25  2022  at 1:00 p.m. CET / 8:00 a.m. ET  which will also be webcasted.

Following EU approval for the additive's use in February 2022  the parties have decided to launch this pilot immediately. The Dutch feed supplier Agrifirm will supply the feed additive to the participating farmers. Through innovations like this  Dutch dairy farmers can build on sustainability improvements over recent years and contribute to a sustainable food production system.DSM Logo.The Bovaer¬Æ pilot collaboration between the Dutch companies FrieslandCampina  DSM  and Agrifirm marks an important step forward in increasing the sustainability of the dairy sector. Some 200 FrieslandCampina dairy farms in the Netherlands will take part in the pilot in the second half of 2022. Providing the results are positive  the use of Bovaer¬Æ will be further upscaled from 2023.Hein Schumacher  CEO of Royal FrieslandCampina: ""Our ultimate goal is for all of our dairy products to be climate neutral. Though we can't achieve this overnight  we're working toward it. In addition to solutions like switching to green energy ‚Äì preferably generated by our members ‚Äì reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of our cows is one of the routes towards reaching our climate goal. This requires innovation ‚Äì and now Bovaer  a truly innovative feed additive from DSM that significantly reduces cows' methane emissions  is part of the solution. We know that our members are always open to innovation and improvements in our sustainability performance  and with this pilot we will be the first dairy company in Europe to gain valuable practical experience with Bovaer.""Dimitri de Vreeze  Co-CEO of Royal DSM: ""There's no time to lose when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cutting methane emissions is the fastest way to combat global warming  as was underlined during the most recent UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. I'm proud that we  FrieslandCampina and DSM  can offer dairy farmers a solution that will help to make a major contribution toward tackling one of the greatest challenges of our time. Collaboration  new ways of thinking and pioneering innovations are crucial to making dairy farming more sustainable. It's important that dairy farmers are rewarded for their sustainability performance.""Story continuesInnovationBovaer¬Æ is a feed additive for cows and other ruminants. DSM has researched and developed this additive over ten years. Just a quarter of a teaspoon of Bovaer¬Æ added daily to each cow's feed will enable a consistent reduction in methane emissions of 30 percent  on average. This feed additive therefore contributes to a significant and immediate reduction in the environmental footprint of meat and dairy products. With its Food System Commitments  DSM addresses several of the most urgent societal and environmental challenges facing the world's food consumption and production up to 2030. One of its commitments is to enable a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in dairy production. Since the end of last year  Bovaer¬Æ has been approved for use in Brazil and Chile  and  at the start of 2022  it also received EU approval.30 percent fewer methane emissionsTogether with its member dairy farmers  FrieslandCampina  aims to achieve a 33 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on its farms by 2030. To this end  the dairy cooperative is working on various solutions  such as generating sustainable energy on farms  using guaranteed deforestation-free soy in cattle feed  and thanks to this project reducing cow methane emission using Bovaer¬Æ. Previous tests with Bovaer¬Æ at the Dairy Campus in Leeuwarden showed an average reduction in methane in enteric emissions* per kilogram of milk of 30 percent. This leads to a reduction of approximately 10 percent in CO 2 footprint.During the pilot  the participating dairy farms will feed Bovaer¬Æ to their cattle for a period of six months. It will be added to the feed by the feed supplier  Agrifirm  an agricultural cooperative. In addition  there will be talks with other feed suppliers in the follow-up phase.Dick Hordijk  CEO of Royal Agrifirm Group: ""As an agricultural cooperative  we are constantly working on feed solutions that help to improve food production and hence enable us to continue to feed future generations in a responsible manner. This additive is one of the solutions that will help to reduce emissions  so we're very enthusiastic about it.""During the pilot  the results and experiences of farmers will be gathered through workshops and surveys. The economic aspects  together with the costs and benefits  will naturally be considered as well. FrieslandCampina will ensure that every dairy farmer receives fair payment for the supplied milk and reward for the sustainability efforts they make on their farm.* Enteric emissions are the methane emissions that primarily arise during fermentation in the first stomach of ruminants such as cattle.For more information DSM Media Relations Andre van der Elsen tel. +31 (0) 45 5782421 email media.contacts@dsm.com FrieslandCampina Jan-Willem ter Avest M +31 (0)683639940press@frieslandcampina.comForward-looking statementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements with respect to DSM's future (financial) performance and position.

The all-comers cohort will recruit both KIR3DL2 expressors and non-expressors to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment outcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay as a companion diagnostic. The KIR3DL2 non-expressing Cohort 3 has been closed to recruitment. As per the Simon 2-stage design  the number of responses to move to stage 2 was not reached  as such  recruitment into this cohort is stopped. Cohort 3 included KIR3DL2 non-expressing patients assigned via a KIR3DL2 immunohistochemistry assay for use on frozen biopsy samples and as a tool for stratification.In June 2021  the Company announced preliminary data from its Phase 2 TELLOMAK trial  in which lacutamab demonstrated a 35% overall global response rate in patients with MF that express KIR3DL2 (Cohort 2). This first trial data set also established safety and demonstrated skin improvement. Lacutamab reached the pre-determined threshold to advance to stage 2 (six confirmed responses). These results were presented in an oral presentation at the 16th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma (16-ICML).Two parallel clinical trials to study lacutamab in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing  relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) are ongoing: Phase 1b trial: a Company-sponsored Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate lacutamab as a monotherapy in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed PTCL. Phase 2 KILT (anti-KIR in T Cell Lymphoma) trial: The Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) initiated an investigator-sponsored  randomized trial to evaluate lacutamab in combination with chemotherapy GEMOX (gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin) versus GEMOX alone in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed/refractory PTCL.ANKET‚Ñ¢ (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):In December 2021  the Company announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi  evaluating IPH6101/SAR443579  the first NKp46/CD16‚Äëbased NK cell engager  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high risk-myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). The purpose of the dose escalation and dose expansion study  which is sponsored by Sanofi  is to evaluate the safety  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics and initial clinical activity of IPH6101/SAR443579  Innate‚Äôs lead ANKET TM asset  in various CD123-expressing hematological malignancies. The start of the trial has triggered a milestone payment from Sanofi to Innate.asset  in various CD123-expressing hematological malignancies. The start of the trial has triggered a milestone payment from Sanofi to Innate. In November 2021  Innate Pharma in collaboration with Sanofi  presented preclinical data from Innate‚Äôs proprietary  multi-specific NK cell engager platform  ANKET TM   at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC). Data on IPH6101/SAR443579  using Innate‚Äôs proprietary multi-specific antibody format (Gauthier et al. Cell 2019) that targets CD123 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and co-engages NKp46 and CD16a on NK cells was presented. In preclinical studies  IPH6101/SAR443579 demonstrated potent antitumor activity against AML cell lines  including those resistant to ADCC by a comparator anti-CD123 antibody. IPH6101/SAR443579 also promoted strong and specific NK-cell activation and induced cytokine secretion only in the presence of AML target cells. In addition  IPH6101/SAR443579 had sustained pharmacodynamic effects in non-human primates  combining efficient depletion of CD123-expressing cells with minor systemic cytokine release in comparison to T-cell engagers. As expected  it also had a favorable safety profile.  at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC).

Specifically  Innate shared data from its tetra-specific ANKET TM molecule  which is the first NK cell engager technology to engage two NK cell activating receptors (NKp46 and CD16)  a cytokine receptor (IL-2Rb) and a tumor antigen via a single molecule. In preclinical studies  the tetra-specific ANKET TM demonstrated in vitro the ability to induce human NK cell proliferation  cytokine production and cytolytic activity against cancer cells expressing the targeted antigen. The tetra-specific ANKET TM also demonstrated in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in several tumor models  allowing regression of established tumors as well as control of metastasis  associated with increased NK cell infiltration  cytokine and chemokine production at the tumor site. ANKET TM also showed a pharmacodynamic effect  low systemic cytokine release and a manageable safety profile in non-human primates.platform  at the Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies meeting.

In January 2021  it was announced that Sanofi will transition IPH6101/SAR443579 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. The decision triggered a ‚Ç¨7 million milestone payment from Sanofi to Innate. In addition  in January 2021  a GLP-tox study was initiated for the IPH6101/SAR443579 program.IPH64  the other drug candidate of the research collaboration with Sanofi is progressing and the Company look forward to updates on this asset.The Company‚Äôs proprietary tetra-specific ANKETTM IPH65 is progressing to IND enabling studies.Monalizumab (anti-NKG2A antibody)  partnered with AstraZeneca:In March 2022  the Phase 2 NeoCOAST study assessing the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy and oleclumab or monalizumab and adjuvant treatment in participants with resectable  early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been accepted for an oral presentation on 11 April 2022 at the Annual Meeting 2022 of the American Association for Cancer Research.In February 2022  AstraZeneca initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial  PACIFIC-9  evaluating durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab (anti-NKG2A) or AstraZeneca‚Äôs oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT).In December 2021  the Company presented data from the Phase 2 expansion cohort (‚Äòcohort 3‚Äô)  exploring the triplet combination of monalizumab  cetuximab and durvalumab in the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer (R/M HNSCC) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Immuno-Oncology Congress 2021. After a median follow-up of 16.3 months  preliminary data suggest anti-tumor activity in the triplet of monalizumab  cetuximab and durvalumab in first-line treatment of R/M HNSCC. As of August 1  2021  40 patients were enrolled. Thirteen patients had a confirmed response with a 32.5% overall response rate (95% confidence interval (CI): 20-48)  including three complete responses. Seven out of 13 responders were still on treatment. Median duration of response was not yet reached (95% CI: 7.1-not available). The survival rate at 12 months was 58.6% (95% CI: 45-77) and the median overall survival was 15 months (95% CI: 11.4 - not available).In September 2021  AstraZeneca commenced a Phase 2 clinical study  NeoCOAST-2  that includes a treatment arm with durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy and monalizumab in resectable  early-stage NSCLC.In September 2021  AstraZeneca presented a late-breaker abstract on the randomized COAST Phase 2 trial in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC at the ESMO Congress. The presentation highlighted progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) results for durvalumab in combination with monalizumab  Innate‚Äôs lead partnered asset  and oleclumab  AstraZeneca‚Äôs anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody. After a median follow-up of 11.5 months  the results of an interim analysis showed a 10-month PFS rate of 72.7% for durvalumab plus monalizumab  versus 39.2% with durvalumab alone in unresectable  Stage III NSCLC patients following chemoradiation therapy. The results also showed an increase in the primary endpoint of confirmed ORR for durvalumab plus monalizumab over durvalumab alone (36% vs. 18%).IPH5201 (anti-CD39)  partnered with AstraZeneca:AstraZeneca is conducting a Phase 1 trial in solid tumors with IPH5201 alone or in combination with durvalumab (anti-PD-L1). The data is expected to be presented in 2023. Innate is in discussions with AstraZeneca on potential next steps for this program.IPH5301 (anti-CD73):In March 2022  The Institut Paoli-Calmettes announced that the first patient had been dosed in the investigator-sponsored Phase 1 trial of IPH5301 (CHANCES). The trial will be conducted in two parts  Part 1  the dose escalation  followed by a Part 2 safety expansion study cohort. Part 2 will evaluate IPH5301 in combination with chemotherapy and trastuzumab in HER2+ cancer patients.Avdoralimab (IPH5401  anti-C5aR antibody):In July 2021  the Company announced that FORCE ( FOR C OVID-19 E limination)  the investigator-sponsored  Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of avdoralimab  in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia  did not meet its primary endpoints in all three cohorts of the trial.

She left the Company on January 2022.Financial highlights for 2021:The key elements of Innate‚Äôs financial position and financial results as of and for the year ended December 31  2021 are as follows:Cash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets amounting to ‚Ç¨159.7 million 2 (‚Ç¨m) as of December 31  2021 (‚Ç¨190.6m as of December 31  2020)  including non-current financial instruments amounting to ‚Ç¨39.9m (‚Ç¨38.9m as of December 31  2020).(‚Ç¨m) as of December 31  2021 (‚Ç¨190.6m as of December 31  2020)  including non-current financial instruments amounting to ‚Ç¨39.9m (‚Ç¨38.9m as of December 31  2020). As of December 31  2021  financial liabilities amount to ‚Ç¨44.3m (‚Ç¨19.1m as of December 31  2020). This change is mainly linked to proceeds relating to State-Guaranteed Loans (Pr√™ts Garantis par l‚ÄôEtat ‚ÄúPGE‚Äù) of ‚Ç¨28.7m from Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale (‚Ç¨20.0m) and BNP Paribas (‚Ç¨8.7m) collected by the Company on December 2021.Revenue and other income from continuing operations 3 amounted to ‚Ç¨24.7m in 2021 (2020: ‚Ç¨69.8m  -64.6%). It mainly comprises revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements (‚Ç¨12.1m in 2021 vs ‚Ç¨56.2m in 2020  -78.4%)  and research tax credit (‚Ç¨10.3m in 2021 vs ‚Ç¨13.1m in 2020  -21.2%): Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreement with AstraZeneca amounted to ‚Ç¨9.1m in 2021 (‚Ç¨49.0m in 2020  -81.4%) and mainly resulted from (i) the spreading of the upfront and opt-in payments received from AstraZeneca and (ii) the invoicing to AstraZeneca of certain fees for the work performed by Innate for the partnered programs. The variation between the two periods is notably explained by the (i) decrease in direct monalizumab research and development costs over the period  in connection with the Phase 1 & 2 trials maturity  and (ii) the absence of revenue relating to IPH5201 in 2021  the Company having fulfilled all of its commitments on preclinical work related to the start of Phase 1 as of December 31 2020. Revenue of ‚Ç¨3.0m from Sanofi following the initiation of a GLP-tox Study and the launching of the first Phase 1 clinical trial in humans in relapsed of refractory AML with IPH6101/SAR443579  respectively in January and December 2021. The variation in the research tax credit mainly results from a decrease in the amortization for the intangible assets related to acquired licenses (monalizumab and IPH5201).amounted to ‚Ç¨24.7m in 2021 (2020: ‚Ç¨69.8m  -64.6%). It mainly comprises revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements (‚Ç¨12.1m in 2021 vs ‚Ç¨56.2m in 2020  -78.4%)  and research tax credit (‚Ç¨10.3m in 2021 vs ‚Ç¨13.1m in 2020  -21.2%): Operating expenses from continuing operations amounted to ‚Ç¨72.5m in 2021 (2020: ‚Ç¨68.7m  +5.6%): General and administrative (G&A) expenses from continuing activities amounted to ‚Ç¨25.5m in 2021 (2020: ‚Ç¨19.0m  +34.4% 4 ). This increase results cumulatively from (i) an increase in wages mainly resulting from restructuring costs and higher annual bonuses level in 2021  (ii) an increase in non-scientific advisory fees and (iii) an increase in other general and administrative expenses. Research and development (R&D) expenses from continuing activities amounted to ‚Ç¨47.0m in 2021 (2020: ‚Ç¨49.7m  -5.4%). This variation mainly results from a (i) decrease in depreciation and amortization of intangible assets acquired by the Company (IPH5201  fully amortized since December 2020  and monalizumab) partly offset by (ii) an increase in direct research and development expenses (clinical and non-clinical).A net financial income of ‚Ç¨2.3m in 2021 (2020: ‚Ç¨1.9m loss).A net loss from Lumoxiti discontinued operations of ‚Ç¨7.3m in 2021 (2020 : net loss of ‚Ç¨63.2m  -88.4%) mainly resulting from the Settlement Amount of $6.2m 5 (‚Ç¨5.5m as of December 31  2021) to be paid to AstraZeneca on April 30  2022  as part of the Termination and Transition agreement effective as of June 30  2021. The net loss in 2020 mainly resulted from the full impairment of Lumoxiti rights following the Company decision to return the marketing rights of Lumoxiti in the United States and in Europe to AstraZeneca.(‚Ç¨5.5m as of December 31  2021) to be paid to AstraZeneca on April 30  2022  as part of the Termination and Transition agreement effective as of June 30  2021. The net loss in 2020 mainly resulted from the full impairment of Lumoxiti rights following the Company decision to return the marketing rights of Lumoxiti in the United States and in Europe to AstraZeneca.

Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements mainly results from the spreading of the initial payments and the exercise of options related to the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015 and October 2018  on the basis of the completion of work that the Company is committed to carry out. The evolution in 2021 is mainly due to:A ‚Ç¨26.1 million decrease in revenue related to monalizumab to ‚Ç¨7.5 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨33.6 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This decrease is mainly explained by the decrease in direct monalizumab research and development costs over the period  in connection with the Phase 1 & 2 trials maturity. As of December 31  2021  the deferred revenue related to monalizumab amounts to ‚Ç¨20.2 million (‚Ç¨12.1 million as ‚ÄúDeferred revenue‚ÄîCurrent portion‚Äù and ‚Ç¨8.0 million as ‚ÄúDeferred revenue‚ÄîNon-current portion‚Äù).A ‚Ç¨13.4 million decrease in revenue related to IPH5201. Nil for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨13.4 million for the year ended December 31  2020. As a reminder  as of December 31  2020  the Company having fulfilled all of its commitments on preclinical work related to the start of Phase 1 of the IPH5201 program  the initial payment of $50.0 million and the milestone payment of $5.0 million were fully recognized in revenue.A ‚Ç¨0.9 million decrease in revenue from invoicing of research and development costs to ‚Ç¨1.6 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨2.5 million for the year ended December 31  2020. Pursuant to our agreements with AstraZeneca  research and development costs related to avdoralimab in oncology are equally shared between us and AstraZeneca and research and development costs related to IPH5201 are fully borne by AstraZeneca. The decrease between the two periods is mainly explained by the decrease in research and development costs relating to IPH5201 re-invoiced to AstraZeneca following the transition of the program in Phase 1 clinical trial  supported AstraZeneca.A ‚Ç¨4.0 million decrease in revenue from collaboration and research license agreement with Sanofi  to ‚Ç¨3.0 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨7.0 million for the year ended December 31  2020. In January 2021  a GLP-tox study was initiated for the IPH6101/SAR443579 program. Additionally  in December  2021  the Company announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial launched by Sanofi in humans with IPH6101/SAR443579 in relapsed or refractory AML. These trials triggered two milestone payments from Sanofi to Innate  planned in the research collaboration between the two companies  fully recognized in revenue as of December 31  2021. As a reminder  in December 2020  Sanofi informed the Company of its intention to advance IPH6101/SAR443579 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. This decision triggered a milestone payment of ‚Ç¨7.0 million from Sanofi to the Company  fully recognized in revenue as of December 31  2020.Government funding for research expendituresGovernment funding for research expenditures decreased by ‚Ç¨1.0 million  or 7.5%  to ‚Ç¨12.6 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨13.6 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This change is primarily a result of a decrease in the research tax credit of ‚Ç¨2.8 million  which is mainly due to a decrease in the amortization expense relating to the intangible assets related to the acquired licenses (see R&D expenses).The research tax credit is calculated as 30% of the amount of research and development expenses  net of grants received  eligible for the research tax credit for the fiscal year. The Company is again eligible to the SME status under European Union criteria as of December 31  2021. Consecutively  the Company is eligible for the early repayment by the French treasury of the 2021 research tax credit during the fiscal year 2022.Operating expensesThe table below presents our operating expenses from continuing operations for the years ended December 31  2021 and 2020:In thousands of euros December 31  2021 December 31  2020(1) Research and development expenses (47 004) (49 708) Selling  general and administrative expenses (25 524) (18 986) Operating expenses (72 528) (68 694)(1) The 2020 comparatives have been restated to consider the impact of classifying the Lumoxiti business as discontinued operations in 2021.Research and development expensesResearch and development (‚ÄúR&D‚Äù) expenses from continuing operations decreased by ‚Ç¨2.7 million  or 5.4%  to ‚Ç¨47.0 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨49.7 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This decrease mainly results from a decrease of ‚Ç¨5.1 million in research and development depreciation and amortization of intangible assets acquired by the Company  partly offset by an increase of ‚Ç¨3.3 million in direct research and development expenses (clinical and non-clinical). R&D expenses represented a total of 64.8% and 72.4% of the total operating expenses from continued operations for the years ended December 31  2021 and 2020  respectively.They include direct R&D expenses (subcontracting costs and consumables)  depreciation and amortization  and personnel expenses. Direct R&D expenses increased by ‚Ç¨3.3 million  or 14.0%  to ‚Ç¨26.7 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨23.4 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase is mainly due to: (i) a ‚Ç¨5.0 million increase in expenses relating to the lacutamab program and (ii) a ‚Ç¨1.5 million increase in expenses related to non-clinical development program relating notably to IPH65. These increases are partly offset by a ‚Ç¨1.9 million and ‚Ç¨1.3 million decreases in expenses relating to the monalizumab and avdoralimab programs  respectively.Also  as of December 31  2021  the collaboration liabilities relating to monalizumab and the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015  October 2018 and September 2020 amounted to ‚Ç¨40.4m  as compared to collaborations liabilities of ‚Ç¨46.7m as of December 31  2020. This decrease of ‚Ç¨6.3m mainly results from the payments made in 2021 to AstraZeneca relating to the co-funding of the monalizumab program  including the INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 trial.Personnel and other expenses allocated to R&D decreased by ‚Ç¨6.0 million  or 22.8%  to ‚Ç¨20.3 million for the year ended December 2021  as compared to an amount of ‚Ç¨26.3 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This decrease is mainly due to the decrease by ‚Ç¨5.2 million in amortization relating to monalizumab rights (extension of the depreciation horizon due to the extension of the duration of certain clinical trials) and IPH5201 rights (full amortization at December 31  2020).General and administrative expensesGeneral and administrative (‚ÄúG&A‚Äù) expenses from continuing operations increased by ‚Ç¨6.5 million  or 34.4%6 to ‚Ç¨25.5 million for the year ended December 31  2021 as compared to ‚Ç¨19.0 million for the year ended December 31  2020. G&A expenses represented a total of 35.2% and 27.6% of the total operating expenses for the years ended December 31  2021 and 2020  respectively.Personnel expenses (including share-based compensation) include the compensation paid to our employees and consultants  and increased by ‚Ç¨2.6 million  or 31.9%  to ‚Ç¨10.9 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨8.3 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase mainly results from an increase in wages of ‚Ç¨2.0 million  mainly resulting from restructuring costs and higher annual bonuses level in 2021. This increase is completed by the increase in share-based payments of ‚Ç¨0.6 million.G&A expenses also include non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses which mostly consist of auditing  accounting  legal and hiring fees. These expenses increased by ‚Ç¨0.7 million  or 15.0%  to ‚Ç¨5.1 million for the year ended December 31  2021  compared to an amount of ‚Ç¨4.4 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase results mainly from (i) an increase of auditing and accounting fees  recruitment fees and investor relation consultancy fees partly offset by (ii) a decrease of costs related to the launch of the Company's new ERP in 2020 and the support by external service providers in the context of compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley law following the listing of the Company in the United States in October 2019.Other G&A expenses relate to intellectual property  the costs of maintaining laboratory equipment and our premises  depreciation and amortization and other general  administrative expenses. These expenses increased by ‚Ç¨3.2 million or 51.5% to ‚Ç¨9.5 million for the year ended December 31 2021  as compared to an amount of ‚Ç¨6.3 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase related notably to insurance costs  which increased in fiscal year 2021  following the listing of the Company in the United States in October 2019. It also includes increases related to staff training (catch-up observed in 2021 following the impact of COVID-19 in 2020) and local taxes.Financial income (loss)  netWe recognized a net financial gain of ‚Ç¨2.3 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨1.9 million net financial loss for the year ended December 31  2020. This change results mainly from the change in the fair value of certain financial instruments (loss of ‚Ç¨0.6 million in 2020 as compared to a ‚Ç¨1.1 million gain in 2021) and a net foreign exchange gain of ‚Ç¨1.2 million in 2021 as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of ‚Ç¨1.6 million in 2020.Net loss from discontinued operationsFurther to the Company decision to terminate the Lumoxiti Agreement in December 2020  a Termination and Transition Agreement was negotiated and executed  effective as of June 30  2021 terminating the Lumoxiti Agreement as well as Lumoxiti related agreements (including the supply agreement  the quality agreement and other related agreements) and transferring the U.S. marketing authorization and distribution rights of Lumoxiti back to AstraZeneca. The marketing authorization has been transferred back to AstraZeneca which has reimbursed Innate for all Lumoxiti related costs  expenses and benefited net sales.Subsequently  operations related to Lumoxiti are presented as discontinued operations from October 1  2021.As a consequence  net result from discontinued operations relating to Lumoxiti decreased by ‚Ç¨55.8m  or -88.4%  to a ‚Ç¨7.3 million net loss for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to a ‚Ç¨63.2 million net loss for the year ended December 31  2020. Net loss for the year ended December 31  2021 mainly resulting from the Settlement Amount of $6.2m (‚Ç¨5.5m as of December 31  2021) to be paid to AstraZeneca on April 30  2022  as part of the Termination and Transition agreement. Net loss for the year ended December 31  2020 mainly resulted from the full impairment of Lumoxiti rights following the Company‚Äôs decision to return the marketing rights of Lumoxiti in the United States and in Europe to AstraZeneca and the costs incurred for the marketing of Lumoxiti and for our U.S subsidiary  including the related personnel costs.Balance sheet itemsCash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets (current and non-current) amounted to ‚Ç¨159.7 million as of December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨190.6 million as of December 31  2020. Net cash as of December 31  2021 (cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets less current financial liabilities) amounted to ‚Ç¨89.1 million (‚Ç¨149.5 million as of December 31  2020).The other key balance sheet items as of December 31  2021 are:Deferred revenue of ‚Ç¨37.9 million (including ‚Ç¨25.4 million booked as ‚ÄòDeferred revenue ‚Äì non-current portion‚Äô) and collaboration liabilities of ‚Ç¨40.4 million (including ‚Ç¨33.0 million booked as ‚ÄòCollaboration liability ‚Äì non-current portion‚Äô) relating to the remainder of the initial payment received from AstraZeneca with respect to monalizumab  not yet recognized as revenue or used to co-fund the research and the development work performed by AstraZeneca including co-funding of the monalizumab program with AstraZeneca  notably the INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 trial;Deferred revenue of ‚Ç¨17.4 million relating to the initial payment for preclinical molecules  entirely classified as ‚ÄòDeferred revenue ‚Äì non-current portion‚Äô;Intangible assets for a net book value of ‚Ç¨44.2 million  mainly corresponding to the rights and licenses relating to the acquisitions of monalizumab and avdoralimab (‚Ç¨46.3 million as of December 30  2020); variation between the two periods is mainly explained by the amortization of monalizumab rights;Current receivables of ‚Ç¨18.4 million  mainly resulting from the French government in relation to the research tax credit for 2021 (‚Ç¨10.3 million).Non-current receivables from the French government in relation to the research tax credit for 2019 and 2020 of ‚Ç¨29.8 million;Shareholders‚Äô equity of ‚Ç¨107.4 million  including the net loss of the period of ‚Ç¨52.8 million;Financial liabilities amounting to ‚Ç¨44.3 million (‚Ç¨19.1 million as of December 31  2020).Cash-flow itemsThe net cash flow used over the year ended December 31  2021 amounted to ‚Ç¨33.0 million  compared to a net cash flow used of ‚Ç¨66.1 million for the year ended December 31  2020.The net cash flow used during the period under review mainly results from the following:Net cash used from operating activities of ‚Ç¨58.5 million  mainly explained by the net cash consumption of operating activities less the receipts for a total amount of ‚Ç¨10.0 million from Sanofi (in January  February and December 2021) in connection with the IPH6101/SAR443579 agreement signed in 2016  following Sanofi's decision at the end of 2020 to advance IPH6101/SAR443579 towards regulatory preclinical studies for a new investigational drug  and the launch of the first related Phase 1 trial in December 2021. Restated for these receipts  net cash flows used by operating activities for the year ended December  2021 are down by ‚Ç¨24.6 million. This decrease is mainly due to the discontinuation of Lumoxiti-related activities in connection with the Company's decision at the end of 2020 to return the commercial rights in the United States and Europe to AstraZeneca  under the termination and transition agreement signed in 2021. As a result  net cash flow consumed by operating activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation amounted to ‚Ç¨3.6 million for the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to ‚Ç¨22.4 million for the year 2020.Net cash used in investing activities for an amount of ‚Ç¨0.9 million. As a reminder  net cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31  2020 amounted ‚Ç¨13.4 million which mainly resulted from (i) a ‚Ç¨13.4 million ($15.0 million) additional consideration paid  in January 2020  to AstraZeneca regarding Lumoxiti following the submission of the Biologics License Application to the European Medicine Agency (EMA) in November 2019 (ii) a ‚Ç¨2.7 million additional consideration paid to Orega Biotech in April 2020 regarding IPH5201 following the dosing of a first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial  in March 2020 and (iii) the acquisition of financial assets for a net amount of ‚Ç¨3.0 million. Such items were partially offset by the reimbursement by AstraZeneca in relation to the 2019 cost sharing mechanism for the commercialization of Lumoxiti (‚Ç¨7.0 million). As a result  net cash flows consumed by investing activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation were nil for year ended December 31  2021 as compared to ‚Ç¨6.6 million for year ended December 31 2020.Net cash flows from financing activities for an amount of ‚Ç¨26.8 million. On January 5  2022  the Company announced that it had obtained a non-dilutive financing of ‚Ç¨28.7 million in the form of two State-Guaranteed Loans (Pr√™ts Garantis ‚ÄúPGE‚Äù) from Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale (‚Ç¨20.0 million) and BNP Paribas (‚Ç¨8.7 million). The funds related to these two PGEs were collected by the Company on December 27 and 30  2021 respectively. Loan repayments amounted to ‚Ç¨2.1 million for the year ended December 31  2021 compared to ‚Ç¨2.2 million for the year ended December 31  2020. In addition  net cash flow from financing activities related to Lumoxiti discontinued operation are nil for year ended December 31  2021 and 2020  respectively.Post period eventBetween December 31  2021  closing date of the financial year  and March 23  2022  closing date of the consolidated financial statements by the Executive Board  the military operations in Ukraine took place  which began on February 24  2022 and the sanctions taken against the Russia by many States having an impact on the activity of many international groups and which will have an impact on the world economy.

But gross lending was also ¬£1.3bn lower year on year as the bank targeted more profitable customer segments..Meanwhile  Bank of Ireland‚Äôs venture capital arm has invested ‚Ç¨1.8m in Dublin City University‚Äôs Pilot Photonics spin-out.Kernel Capital confirmed its investment on Thursday in the tech start-up  which has patented a technique that can create multiple lasers from one device.Photonics is the science of light and is used in manufacturing  medical devices  telecoms  security and also to scan groceries in supermarkets.The technology was developed over more than a decade of research and development (R&D) at DCU  Trinity College Dublin and the Tyndall National Institute in Cork.Pilot Photonics is led by chief executive William Oppermann  who founded data storage start-up and fellow Kernel Capital investee company MPSTOR.

1444,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/03/24/backed-by-spacs-ipos-hit-new-heights-in-2021/,Backed by SPACs  IPOs Hit New Heights in 2021,The global IPO market made up for lost time in 2021. After a slow 2019 and a pandemic-battered 2020  new issues came roaring back last year‚Äî3 021 listings (inc. SPACs) raised US$601.2 billion  valuing the newly floated companies at US$2.7 trillion. Overall  t‚Ä¶,The global IPO market made up for lost time in 2021. After a slow 2019 and a pandemic-battered 2020  new issues came roaring back last year‚Äî3 021 listings (inc. SPACs) raised US$601.2 billion  valuing the newly floated companies at US$2.7 trillion. Overall  this was a year-on-year increase of 88 percent in volume and 87 percent by value.A proportion of last year‚Äôs activity reflected pent-up demand  with new issues that might have taken place in the previous year deferred until 2021. But even without that effect  last year was remarkable  with IPO activity hitting new heights.One significant driver was the continuing boom in the market for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs)‚Äîparticularly evident in the first half of 2021 and the expansion to European markets. Last year‚Äôs global IPO figures included the launch of no fewer than 681 SPACs  which collectively raised US$172.3 billion. That was a major increase from 2020  itself a record year for blank check companies.Nevertheless  excluding SPACs  the IPO market still enjoyed a record year  with 2 340 new issues raising US$428.9 billion. By volume  IPO activity rose 73 percent compared to 2020; by value  2021 was 81 percent ahead.A boom across regionsUnlike in some previous years  the IPO surge was global  rather than restricted to the largest markets. That said  the biggest listing in 2021  the flotation of Rivian Automotive  came in the US. The California-based company designs  develops and manufactures electric vehicles and accessories for the consumer and commercial markets  and raised US$13.7 billion when it listed on Nasdaq.The Asia-Pacific region had a bumper year  with six of the top-ten deals taking place in the region. The largest of these saw Hong Kong‚Äìbased Kuaishou  which derives its income from live streaming and online marketing  list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange raising US$6.2 billion‚Äîthe world‚Äôs second-biggest new issue.South Korea‚Äôs Coupang took the third spot in last year‚Äôs IPO rankings  raising US$4.6 billion. Coupang‚Äôs IPO in New York reflected investors‚Äô appetite for a business that is often compared to Amazon and owns more than 100 fulfillment and logistics centers.And listings were not limited to the major capital markets. For example  Indonesian e-commerce company Bukalapak listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange  raising US$1.5 billion. The company listed at a market cap of US$6 billion  making it the country‚Äôs first listed tech unicorn.In Europe  meanwhile  the biggest listing was for Poland‚Äôs InPost  a parcels and collections business that raised US$3.9 billion on Euronext Amsterdam.In Latin America  the top deals were all in Brazil. Many of these deals were related to technology‚Äîand in particular  fintech. The highest-profile of these was the IPO of digital banking group Nu Holdings‚ÄîSouth America‚Äôs largest new issue of the year. Nu raised US$2.7 billion in the IPO.These deals highlight that technology was a major driver of the IPO surge  encouraged by the societal changes that the pandemic accelerated.Meanwhile  private equity (PE) was not shy about going public  adding to the 2021 IPO frenzy. The listing of UK PE firm Bridgepoint  which raised US$1.2 billion  and French PE firm Antin Infrastructure  which raised US$742 million  caught the attention of European peers. The spectacular stock market performance of Sweden‚Äôs EQT AB since its 2019 listing‚Äîat its highest in November 2021  up 542 percent‚Äîalso focused minds.

The 2021 audited consolidated financial statements are available on the Company‚Äôs website (Financial Reports ‚Äì Valneva).Valneva will provide a live webcast of its full-year 2021 results conference call beginning at 3 p.m. CET today. This webcast will also be available on the Company‚Äôs website. Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/qieuu6atPeter B√ºhler  Valneva‚Äôs Chief Financial Officer  commented  ‚Äú2021 was an exceptional year for Valneva  marked by unprecedented R&D progress and our successful Nasdaq listing. We reported positive Phase 3 results for two vaccine candidates (COVID-19 and chikungunya) and we expect both vaccines  if approved  to make a positive change to people‚Äôs lives. With close to ‚Ç¨350 million in cash  we entered 2022 in a strong position and will continue to focus on gaining regulatory approvals and preparing market entry for our key late-stage programs.‚ÄùClinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesLYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE ‚Äì VLA15Further positive Phase 2 results reportedValneva and Pfizer2 are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. The vaccine candidate covers the six OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe.In February 2022  Valneva and Pfizer reported further positive Phase 2 data for VLA153 confirming the robust immunogenicity profile observed for adults (18-65 years) in previous Phase 2 studies. The companies are also evaluating VLA15 in pediatric participants aged 5 to 17 years  with first data expected in the second quarter of 2022. Based on the latest Phase 2 results  Valneva and Pfizer plan to proceed with a three-dose primary series vaccination schedule for adults (18-65 years) in a planned Phase 3 clinical trial  which they expect to initiate in the third quarter of 2022  subject to regulatory approval.SARS-CoV-2 VACCINE CANDIDATE ‚Äì VLA2001First Emergency Use Authorization grantedVLA2001 is currently the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted vaccine candidate in clinical trials against COVID-19 in Europe. It is produced using Valneva‚Äôs established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for the Company‚Äôs commercial Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO¬Æ.Valneva remains focused on achieving regulatory approvals of VLA2001. In March 2022  VLA2001 was granted emergency use authorization from the Kingdom of Bahrain4. Valneva now expects to deliver the first VLA2001 shipments to Bahrain at the end of March 2022 as per the purchase agreement signed in December 20215.VLA2001 is in advanced review processes with the EMA and UK MHRA  as recently communicated6. Subject to acceptance of Valneva‚Äôs responses by the EMA‚Äôs Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)  Valneva anticipates receiving a positive CHMP recommendation for conditional approval of VLA2001 for primary immunization in adults 18 to 55 years of age in April 2022. Following such conditional approval  the Company would expect to start delivering planned doses of VLA2001 to European countries in the second quarter of 2022. Valneva signed an agreement with the European Commission (EC) in November 2021 to supply up to 60 million doses of VLA2001 over two years  including 24.3 million doses in 20227 and the remainder via options in 2023.In order to gradually expand the label and indications of VLA2001 to further age groups  Valneva is currently conducting additional clinical studies  including for potential use as a homologous and heterologous booster vaccine in the course of 2022.CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE ‚Äì VLA1553Final Positive Phase 3 Results reportedValneva is developing a single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to over 120 countries.In March 2022  Valneva announced successful completion of the Phase 3 pivotal trial of VLA15538. The final six-month analysis confirmed the very high level of seroprotection reported in August 2021. Six months after receiving a single vaccination  96.3% of participants showed protective CHIKV neutralizing antibody titers. VLA1553‚Äôs good safety and tolerability profile was also consistent with topline Phase 3 data. Valneva now expects to commence the pre-submission process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second quarter of 2022.The Company also previously reported positive topline lot-to-lot manufacturing consistency results for VLA15539. This is one of the standard requirements for vaccine licensure  and final lot-to-lot results are expected in the second quarter of 2022.Valneva also initiated a Phase 3 trial in adolescents in January 2022. The trial  conducted in Brazil by Instituto Butantan  is designed to support label extension to this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults in the U.S10. Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  the trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic region.Commercial VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO¬Æ/JESPECT¬Æ)IXIARO¬Æ is the only Japanese encephalitis vaccine licensed and available in the U.S.  Canada and Europe.Sales of IXIARO¬Æ were ‚Ç¨45.1 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨48.5 million in 2020. While the COVID-19 pandemic continued to adversely impact the travel industry and vaccine sales to the private market  the impact on IXIARO¬Æ sales was mitigated by the Company‚Äôs contract with the U.S. Government‚Äôs Department of Defense (DoD).CHOLERA / ETEC11-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL¬Æ)DUKORAL¬Æ is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC  the leading cause of travelers‚Äô diarrhea. DUKORAL¬Æ is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.DUKORAL¬Æ recorded sales of ‚Ç¨2.4 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨13.3 million in 2020. 2021 sales continued to be significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic‚Äôs impact on the travel industry.Full Year 2021 Financial Review(Audited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva‚Äôs total revenues were ‚Ç¨348.1 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨110.3 million in 2020  an increase of 216%.Product sales decreased by 4.5% to ‚Ç¨63.0 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨65.9 million in 2020 as the travel industry continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. On a constant exchange rate (CER) basis  product sales also decreased by 4.5% in 2021 as compared to 2020.IXIARO¬Æ/JESPECT¬Æ product sales decreased by 6.9% (5.7% at CER) to ‚Ç¨45.1 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨48.5 million in 2020. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was mitigated by sales to the U.S. Government‚Äôs Department of Defense (DoD) during the period. DUKORAL¬Æ product sales declined by 81.7% (82.4% at CER) to ‚Ç¨2.4 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨13.3 million in 2020. Third Party product sales grew by 271.0% to ‚Ç¨15.4 million in 2021 from ‚Ç¨4.2 million in 2020. The increase in Third Party product sales was driven by incremental sales related to Valneva‚Äôs distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic for the sales of Rabipur¬Æ/RabAvert¬Æ and Encepur¬Æ  which commenced in certain territories in 2021.Other Revenues amounted to ‚Ç¨285.1 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨44.4 million in 2020. This increase was attributable to revenues recognized in relation to the terminated UK COVID-19 vaccine supply agreement for non-refundable payments received up to December 31st  2021.Operating Result and EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were ‚Ç¨187.9 million in 2021. Gross margin on product sales was 36.5% compared to 36.6% in 2020. COGS of ‚Ç¨22.6 million were related to IXIARO¬Æ/JESPECT¬Æ product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 50.0%. COGS of ‚Ç¨7.6 million were related to DUKORAL¬Æ product sales  causing a negative product gross margin. Of the remaining 2021 COGS  ‚Ç¨9.9 million were related to the Third-Party product distribution business  ‚Ç¨122.8 million to the COVID-19 business and ‚Ç¨25.1 million to cost of services. COGS for the COVID-19 business in 2021 included write-offs of materials and onerous purchase agreements resulting from the termination of the UK VLA2001 supply agreement. In 2020  overall COGS were ‚Ç¨54.3 million  of which ‚Ç¨41.8 million related to cost of goods and ‚Ç¨12.5 million related to cost of services.Research and development investments continued to increase in 2021  growing to ‚Ç¨173.3 million compared to ‚Ç¨84.5 million in 2020. This was mainly driven by investments in Valneva‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine candidate  VLA2001  as well as Phase 3 clinical study costs for Valneva‚Äôs chikungunya vaccine program  VLA1553. Excluding COVID-19  research and development investments amounted to ‚Ç¨59.4 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨65.5 million in 2020. Marketing and distribution expenses in 2021 amounted to ‚Ç¨23.6 million compared to ‚Ç¨18.3 million in 2020. Marketing and distribution expenses in 2021 notably included ‚Ç¨3.8 million of expenses (compared to ‚Ç¨0.6 million in 2020) related to the launch preparation costs of the chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  and also included higher expenses related to the Company‚Äôs employee share-based compensation programs  which offset cost containment measures taken as a result of the pandemic‚Äôs impact on the travel vaccine business. General and administrative expenses increased to ‚Ç¨47.6 million in 2021 from ‚Ç¨27.5 million in 2020  mainly driven by increased costs to support corporate transactions such as the Company‚Äôs initial public offering on Nasdaq  increased resources in support of incremental COVID-19 activities  and higher costs related to the Company‚Äôs employee share-based compensation programs.Other income  net of other expenses  increased to ‚Ç¨23.0 million in 2021 from ‚Ç¨19.1 million in 2020. This increase was mainly driven by increased R&D tax credits directly resulting from increased R&D spending.Valneva recorded an operating loss of ‚Ç¨61.4 million in 2021 compared to an operating loss of ‚Ç¨55.1 million in 2020. EBITDA loss in 2021 was ‚Ç¨47.1 million compared to an EBITDA loss of ‚Ç¨45.2 million in 2020.Net ResultIn 2021  Valneva generated a net loss of ‚Ç¨73.4 million compared to a net loss of ‚Ç¨64.4 million in 2020.Finance expense and currency effects in 2021 resulted in a net finance expense of ‚Ç¨8.6 million  compared to a net finance expense of ‚Ç¨10.0 million in 2020. This was mainly a result of foreign exchange gains amounting to ‚Ç¨8.1 million in 2021  primarily driven by revaluation gains of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange gain (including gains on derivative financial instruments) of ‚Ç¨0.6 million in 2020. Interest charges increased to ‚Ç¨17.0 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨10.7 million in 2020. This growth was mainly driven by increased interest charges related to refund liabilities.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash generated by operating activities amounted to ‚Ç¨76.9 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨137.7 million in 2020  mainly driven by pre-payments related to the vaccine supply agreement signed with the EC. Net cash generated by operating activities in 2020 was mainly derived from the $130 million upfront payment received from Pfizer related to the Lyme R&D collaboration agreement  as well as payments received from the UK government in relation to the UK VLA2001 supply agreement.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to ‚Ç¨93.1 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨19.3 million in 2020  mainly as a result of COVID manufacturing related construction activities across production sites in Scotland and Sweden  as well as equipment purchases.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to ‚Ç¨154.5 million in 2021  which was mainly a result of proceeds from the issuance of new shares in the U.S. initial public offering and European private placement (Global Offering). Cash inflows in 2020 amounted to ‚Ç¨21.7 million and mainly consisted of net proceeds from the financing arrangement with U.S. healthcare funds Deerfield and OrbiMed  offset by ‚Ç¨20.0 million of repayments of borrowings to the European Investment Bank.Liquid funds increased to ‚Ç¨346.7 million as of December 31  2021  compared to ‚Ç¨204.4 million as of December 31  2020. The cash increase resulted from significant cash in-flows most notably COVID related payments received from UK government and EC member states as well as net proceeds from the Global Offering in May and October 2021.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results as well as the non-IFRS measure of EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva‚Äôs current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provides additional analytical tools. EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization.A reconciliation of EBITDA to operating loss  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:‚Ç¨ in million 12 months ending December 31  2021 2020 Operating Loss (61.4) (55.1) Add: Amortization 6.6 6.0 Depreciation 7.7 3.8 Impairment of Tangible Assets - 0.1 EBITDA (47.1) (45.2)About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  production and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

The all-comers cohort will recruit both KIR3DL2 expressors and non-expressors to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment outcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay as a companion diagnostic. The KIR3DL2 non-expressing Cohort 3 has been closed to recruitment. As per the Simon 2-stage design  the number of responses to move to stage 2 was not reached  as such  recruitment into this cohort is stopped. Cohort 3 included KIR3DL2 non-expressing patients assigned via a KIR3DL2 immunohistochemistry assay for use on frozen biopsy samples and as a tool for stratification.In June 2021  the Company announced preliminary data from its Phase 2 TELLOMAK trial  in which lacutamab demonstrated a 35% overall global response rate in patients with MF that express KIR3DL2 (Cohort 2). This first trial data set also established safety and demonstrated skin improvement. Lacutamab reached the pre-determined threshold to advance to stage 2 (six confirmed responses). These results were presented in an oral presentation at the 16th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma (16-ICML).Two parallel clinical trials to study lacutamab in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing  relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) are ongoing:Phase 1b trial: a Company-sponsored Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate lacutamab as a monotherapy in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed PTCL. Phase 2 KILT (anti-KIR in T Cell Lymphoma) trial: The Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) initiated an investigator-sponsored  randomized trial to evaluate lacutamab in combination with chemotherapy GEMOX (gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin) versus GEMOX alone in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed/refractory PTCL.ANKET‚Ñ¢ (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):In December 2021  the Company announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi  evaluating IPH6101/SAR443579  the first NKp46/CD16‚Äëbased NK cell engager  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high risk-myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). The purpose of the dose escalation and dose expansion study  which is sponsored by Sanofi  is to evaluate the safety  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics and initial clinical activity of IPH6101/SAR443579  Innate‚Äôs lead ANKET TM asset  in various CD123-expressing hematological malignancies. The start of the trial has triggered a milestone payment from Sanofi to Innate.asset  in various CD123-expressing hematological malignancies. The start of the trial has triggered a milestone payment from Sanofi to Innate. In November 2021  Innate Pharma in collaboration with Sanofi  presented preclinical data from Innate‚Äôs proprietary  multi-specific NK cell engager platform  ANKET TM   at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC). Data on IPH6101/SAR443579  using Innate‚Äôs proprietary multi-specific antibody format (Gauthier et al. Cell 2019) that targets CD123 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and co-engages NKp46 and CD16a on NK cells was presented. In preclinical studies  IPH6101/SAR443579 demonstrated potent antitumor activity against AML cell lines  including those resistant to ADCC by a comparator anti-CD123 antibody. IPH6101/SAR443579 also promoted strong and specific NK-cell activation and induced cytokine secretion only in the presence of AML target cells. In addition  IPH6101/SAR443579 had sustained pharmacodynamic effects in non-human primates  combining efficient depletion of CD123-expressing cells with minor systemic cytokine release in comparison to T-cell engagers. As expected  it also had a favorable safety profile.  at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC).

As expected  it also had a favorable safety profile. In June 2021  the Company presented new data on its ANKET TM platform  at the Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies meeting. Specifically  Innate shared data from its tetra-specific ANKET TM molecule  which is the first NK cell engager technology to engage two NK cell activating receptors (NKp46 and CD16)  a cytokine receptor (IL-2Rb) and a tumor antigen via a single molecule. In preclinical studies  the tetra-specific ANKET TM demonstrated in vitro the ability to induce human NK cell proliferation  cytokine production and cytolytic activity against cancer cells expressing the targeted antigen. The tetra-specific ANKET TM also demonstrated in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in several tumor models  allowing regression of established tumors as well as control of metastasis  associated with increased NK cell infiltration  cytokine and chemokine production at the tumor site. ANKET TM also showed a pharmacodynamic effect  low systemic cytokine release and a manageable safety profile in non-human primates.platform  at the Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies meeting.

In January 2021  it was announced that Sanofi will transition IPH6101/SAR443579 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. The decision triggered a ‚Ç¨7 million milestone payment from Sanofi to Innate. In addition  in January 2021  a GLP-tox study was initiated for the IPH6101/SAR443579 program.IPH64  the other drug candidate of the research collaboration with Sanofi is progressing and the Company look forward to updates on this asset.The Company‚Äôs proprietary tetra-specific ANKETTM IPH65 is progressing to IND enabling studies.Monalizumab (anti-NKG2A antibody)  partnered with AstraZeneca:In March 2022  the Phase 2 NeoCOAST study assessing the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy and oleclumab or monalizumab and adjuvant treatment in participants with resectable  early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been accepted for an oral presentation on 11 April 2022 at the Annual Meeting 2022 of the American Association for Cancer Research.In February 2022  AstraZeneca initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial  PACIFIC-9  evaluating durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab (anti-NKG2A) or AstraZeneca‚Äôs oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT).In December 2021  the Company presented data from the Phase 2 expansion cohort (‚Äòcohort 3‚Äô)  exploring the triplet combination of monalizumab  cetuximab and durvalumab in the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer (R/M HNSCC) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Immuno-Oncology Congress 2021. After a median follow-up of 16.3 months  preliminary data suggest anti-tumor activity in the triplet of monalizumab  cetuximab and durvalumab in first-line treatment of R/M HNSCC. As of August 1  2021  40 patients were enrolled. Thirteen patients had a confirmed response with a 32.5% overall response rate (95% confidence interval (CI): 20-48)  including three complete responses. Seven out of 13 responders were still on treatment. Median duration of response was not yet reached (95% CI: 7.1-not available). The survival rate at 12 months was 58.6% (95% CI: 45-77) and the median overall survival was 15 months (95% CI: 11.4 - not available).In September 2021  AstraZeneca commenced a Phase 2 clinical study  NeoCOAST-2  that includes a treatment arm with durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy and monalizumab in resectable  early-stage NSCLC.In September 2021  AstraZeneca presented a late-breaker abstract on the randomized COAST Phase 2 trial in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC at the ESMO Congress. The presentation highlighted progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) results for durvalumab in combination with monalizumab  Innate‚Äôs lead partnered asset  and oleclumab  AstraZeneca‚Äôs anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody. After a median follow-up of 11.5 months  the results of an interim analysis showed a 10-month PFS rate of 72.7% for durvalumab plus monalizumab  versus 39.2% with durvalumab alone in unresectable  Stage III NSCLC patients following chemoradiation therapy. The results also showed an increase in the primary endpoint of confirmed ORR for durvalumab plus monalizumab over durvalumab alone (36% vs. 18%).IPH5201 (anti-CD39)  partnered with AstraZeneca:AstraZeneca is conducting a Phase 1 trial in solid tumors with IPH5201 alone or in combination with durvalumab (anti-PD-L1). The data is expected to be presented in 2023. Innate is in discussions with AstraZeneca on potential next steps for this program.IPH5301 (anti-CD73):In March 2022  The Institut Paoli-Calmettes announced that the first patient had been dosed in the investigator-sponsored Phase 1 trial of IPH5301 (CHANCES). The trial will be conducted in two parts  Part 1  the dose escalation  followed by a Part 2 safety expansion study cohort. Part 2 will evaluate IPH5301 in combination with chemotherapy and trastuzumab in HER2+ cancer patients.Avdoralimab (IPH5401  anti-C5aR antibody):In July 2021  the Company announced that FORCE ( FOR C OVID-19 E limination)  the investigator-sponsored  Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of avdoralimab  in COVID-19 patients with severe pneumonia  did not meet its primary endpoints in all three cohorts of the trial.

Results from this trial  including translational data  are planned to be submitted for publication. The Company‚Äôs COVID-19 activities were covered by public funding from the French government. Following a strategic review  the Company will now solely pursue avdoralimab in bullous pemphigoid  an inflammatory disease  through an investigator-sponsored study and stop further development in all other indications. Data in bullous pemphigoid is now expected in 2024.Corporate Update:In February 2022  Mrs Tracy Rossin  VP  Global Head of Communications  decided to pursue another opportunity outside the Company. Mr Henry Wheeler  Vice President of Investor Relations  who joined Innate in June 2021 is now responsible for Investor Relations and Communications.In January 2022  Mr Nicola Beltraminelli PhD was appointed as Vice President  Chief Development Officer of Innate responsible for non-clinical development. Mrs Frederique Brune  Vice President Development CMC and Supply Chain decided to pursue another opportunity outside the company. Mr Beltraminelli brings more than 20 years of biotech experience to the role  and specifically in the development of biologic products from early discovery to GMP manufacture. Most recently  Mr Beltraminelli served as Chief Technical Officer at Lysogene  where he led the CMC activities for two late-stage assets.In January 2022  Innate Pharma announced that it had obtained ‚Ç¨28.7M in non-dilutive financing in the form of State Guaranteed Loans from Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale and BNP Paribas. The two agreements were signed and funds received in December 2021.In November 2021  Jen Butler  Head of Global Commercial and US General Manager left her position at the Company.In June 2021  Bpifrance informed Innate that its permanent representative at Innate‚Äôs Supervisory Board  Mrs Ma√Ølys Ferrere will be replaced by Mr Olivier Martinez  Senior Investment Director in the Life Sciences Investments Department of the Direction of Innovation of Bpifrance  who has been Observer of Innate‚Äôs Supervisory Board since 2010.Announced on May 28  2021  Novo Nordisk A/S  represented by Marcus Schindler  M.D.  decided not to seek re-election to the Supervisory Board due to Dr. Schindler‚Äôs new role as Executive Vice President Research & Early Development and Chief Scientific Officer of Novo Nordisk A/S. Novo Nordisk A/S remains a shareholder in the Company but no longer has a seat on its Supervisory Board.Frederic Lombard was appointed as Chief Financial Officer on April 1  2021. Mr Lombard has more than 20 years of financial experience in the pharmaceutical industry  holding senior finance roles at Ipsen  AstraZeneca and Novartis. Laure-H√©l√®ne Mercier  Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and member of the Executive Board  decided to step down from her position  after leading the Company through more than 14 years of growth  including an initial public offering in the US. She left the Company on January 2022.Financial highlights for 2021:The key elements of Innate‚Äôs financial position and financial results as of and for the year ended December 31  2021 are as follows:Cash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets amounting to ‚Ç¨159.7 million 2 (‚Ç¨m) as of December 31  2021 (‚Ç¨190.6m as of December 31  2020)  including non-current financial instruments amounting to ‚Ç¨39.9m (‚Ç¨38.9m as of December 31  2020).(‚Ç¨m) as of December 31  2021 (‚Ç¨190.6m as of December 31  2020)  including non-current financial instruments amounting to ‚Ç¨39.9m (‚Ç¨38.9m as of December 31  2020). As of December 31  2021  financial liabilities amount to ‚Ç¨44.3m (‚Ç¨19.1m as of December 31  2020). This change is mainly linked to proceeds relating to State-Guaranteed Loans (Pr√™ts Garantis par l‚ÄôEtat ‚ÄúPGE‚Äù) of ‚Ç¨28.7m from Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale (‚Ç¨20.0m) and BNP Paribas (‚Ç¨8.7m) collected by the Company on December 2021.Revenue and other income from continuing operations 3 amounted to ‚Ç¨24.7m in 2021 (2020: ‚Ç¨69.8m  -64.6%). It mainly comprises revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements (‚Ç¨12.1m in 2021 vs ‚Ç¨56.2m in 2020  -78.4%)  and research tax credit (‚Ç¨10.3m in 2021 vs ‚Ç¨13.1m in 2020  -21.2%): Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreement with AstraZeneca amounted to ‚Ç¨9.1m in 2021 (‚Ç¨49.0m in 2020  -81.4%) and mainly resulted from (i) the spreading of the upfront and opt-in payments received from AstraZeneca and (ii) the invoicing to AstraZeneca of certain fees for the work performed by Innate for the partnered programs. The variation between the two periods is notably explained by the (i) decrease in direct monalizumab research and development costs over the period  in connection with the Phase 1 & 2 trials maturity  and (ii) the absence of revenue relating to IPH5201 in 2021  the Company having fulfilled all of its commitments on preclinical work related to the start of Phase 1 as of December 31 2020. Revenue of ‚Ç¨3.0m from Sanofi following the initiation of a GLP-tox Study and the launching of the first Phase 1 clinical trial in humans in relapsed of refractory AML with IPH6101/SAR443579  respectively in January and December 2021. The variation in the research tax credit mainly results from a decrease in the amortization for the intangible assets related to acquired licenses (monalizumab and IPH5201).amounted to ‚Ç¨24.7m in 2021 (2020: ‚Ç¨69.8m  -64.6%). It mainly comprises revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements (‚Ç¨12.1m in 2021 vs ‚Ç¨56.2m in 2020  -78.4%)  and research tax credit (‚Ç¨10.3m in 2021 vs ‚Ç¨13.1m in 2020  -21.2%): Operating expenses from continuing operations amounted to ‚Ç¨72.5m in 2021 (2020: ‚Ç¨68.7m  +5.6%): General and administrative (G&A) expenses from continuing activities amounted to ‚Ç¨25.5m in 2021 (2020: ‚Ç¨19.0m  +34.4% 4 ). This increase results cumulatively from (i) an increase in wages mainly resulting from restructuring costs and higher annual bonuses level in 2021  (ii) an increase in non-scientific advisory fees and (iii) an increase in other general and administrative expenses. Research and development (R&D) expenses from continuing activities amounted to ‚Ç¨47.0m in 2021 (2020: ‚Ç¨49.7m  -5.4%). This variation mainly results from a (i) decrease in depreciation and amortization of intangible assets acquired by the Company (IPH5201  fully amortized since December 2020  and monalizumab) partly offset by (ii) an increase in direct research and development expenses (clinical and non-clinical).A net financial income of ‚Ç¨2.3m in 2021 (2020: ‚Ç¨1.9m loss).A net loss from Lumoxiti discontinued operations of ‚Ç¨7.3m in 2021 (2020 : net loss of ‚Ç¨63.2m  -88.4%) mainly resulting from the Settlement Amount of $6.2m 5 (‚Ç¨5.5m as of December 31  2021) to be paid to AstraZeneca on April 30  2022  as part of the Termination and Transition agreement effective as of June 30  2021. The net loss in 2020 mainly resulted from the full impairment of Lumoxiti rights following the Company decision to return the marketing rights of Lumoxiti in the United States and in Europe to AstraZeneca.(‚Ç¨5.5m as of December 31  2021) to be paid to AstraZeneca on April 30  2022  as part of the Termination and Transition agreement effective as of June 30  2021. The net loss in 2020 mainly resulted from the full impairment of Lumoxiti rights following the Company decision to return the marketing rights of Lumoxiti in the United States and in Europe to AstraZeneca. A net loss of ‚Ç¨52.8m in 2021 (2020: net loss of ‚Ç¨64.0m).The table below summarizes the IFRS consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31  2021  including 2020 comparative information.In thousands of euros  except for data per share December 31  2021 December 31  2020(1) Revenue and other income 24 703 69 773 Research and development (47 004) (49 708) Selling  general and administrative (25 524) (18 986) Total operating expenses (72 528) (68 694) Operating income (loss) (47 825) 1 079 Net financial income (loss) 2 347 (1 908) Income tax expense ‚Äî ‚Äî Net income (loss) from continuing operations (45 478) (829) Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (7 331) (63 155) Net income (loss) (52 809) (63 984) Weighted average number of shares outstanding (in thousands) 79 543 78 935 Basic income (loss) per share (0.66) (0.81) Diluted income (loss) per share (0.66) (0.81) Basic income (loss) per share from continuing operations (0.57) (0.01) Diluted income (loss) per share from continuing operations (0.57) (0.01) Basic income (loss) per share from discontinued operations (0.09) (0.80) Diluted income (loss) per share from discontinued operations (0.09) (0.80) December 31  2021 December 31  2020 Cash  cash equivalents and financial asset 159 714 190 571 Total assets 267 496 307 423 Shareholders‚Äô equity 107 440 155 976 Total financial debt 44 251 19 087(1) The 2020 comparatives have been restated to consider the impact of classifying the Lumoxiti business as discontinued operations in 2021.About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma‚Äôs broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of natural killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens  as well as antibody engineering.

Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements mainly results from the spreading of the initial payments and the exercise of options related to the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015 and October 2018  on the basis of the completion of work that the Company is committed to carry out. The evolution in 2021 is mainly due to:A ‚Ç¨26.1 million decrease in revenue related to monalizumab to ‚Ç¨7.5 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨33.6 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This decrease is mainly explained by the decrease in direct monalizumab research and development costs over the period  in connection with the Phase 1 & 2 trials maturity. As of December 31  2021  the deferred revenue related to monalizumab amounts to ‚Ç¨20.2 million (‚Ç¨12.1 million as ‚ÄúDeferred revenue‚ÄîCurrent portion‚Äù and ‚Ç¨8.0 million as ‚ÄúDeferred revenue‚ÄîNon-current portion‚Äù).A ‚Ç¨13.4 million decrease in revenue related to IPH5201. Nil for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨13.4 million for the year ended December 31  2020. As a reminder  as of December 31  2020  the Company having fulfilled all of its commitments on preclinical work related to the start of Phase 1 of the IPH5201 program  the initial payment of $50.0 million and the milestone payment of $5.0 million were fully recognized in revenue.A ‚Ç¨0.9 million decrease in revenue from invoicing of research and development costs to ‚Ç¨1.6 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨2.5 million for the year ended December 31  2020. Pursuant to our agreements with AstraZeneca  research and development costs related to avdoralimab in oncology are equally shared between us and AstraZeneca and research and development costs related to IPH5201 are fully borne by AstraZeneca. The decrease between the two periods is mainly explained by the decrease in research and development costs relating to IPH5201 re-invoiced to AstraZeneca following the transition of the program in Phase 1 clinical trial  supported AstraZeneca.A ‚Ç¨4.0 million decrease in revenue from collaboration and research license agreement with Sanofi  to ‚Ç¨3.0 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨7.0 million for the year ended December 31  2020. In January 2021  a GLP-tox study was initiated for the IPH6101/SAR443579 program. Additionally  in December  2021  the Company announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial launched by Sanofi in humans with IPH6101/SAR443579 in relapsed or refractory AML. These trials triggered two milestone payments from Sanofi to Innate  planned in the research collaboration between the two companies  fully recognized in revenue as of December 31  2021. As a reminder  in December 2020  Sanofi informed the Company of its intention to advance IPH6101/SAR443579 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. This decision triggered a milestone payment of ‚Ç¨7.0 million from Sanofi to the Company  fully recognized in revenue as of December 31  2020.Government funding for research expendituresGovernment funding for research expenditures decreased by ‚Ç¨1.0 million  or 7.5%  to ‚Ç¨12.6 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨13.6 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This change is primarily a result of a decrease in the research tax credit of ‚Ç¨2.8 million  which is mainly due to a decrease in the amortization expense relating to the intangible assets related to the acquired licenses (see R&D expenses).The research tax credit is calculated as 30% of the amount of research and development expenses  net of grants received  eligible for the research tax credit for the fiscal year. The Company is again eligible to the SME status under European Union criteria as of December 31  2021. Consecutively  the Company is eligible for the early repayment by the French treasury of the 2021 research tax credit during the fiscal year 2022.Operating expensesThe table below presents our operating expenses from continuing operations for the years ended December 31  2021 and 2020:In thousands of euros December 31  2021 December 31  2020(1) Research and development expenses (47 004) (49 708) Selling  general and administrative expenses (25 524) (18 986) Operating expenses (72 528) (68 694)(1) The 2020 comparatives have been restated to consider the impact of classifying the Lumoxiti business as discontinued operations in 2021.Research and development expensesResearch and development (‚ÄúR&D‚Äù) expenses from continuing operations decreased by ‚Ç¨2.7 million  or 5.4%  to ‚Ç¨47.0 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨49.7 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This decrease mainly results from a decrease of ‚Ç¨5.1 million in research and development depreciation and amortization of intangible assets acquired by the Company  partly offset by an increase of ‚Ç¨3.3 million in direct research and development expenses (clinical and non-clinical). R&D expenses represented a total of 64.8% and 72.4% of the total operating expenses from continued operations for the years ended December 31  2021 and 2020  respectively.They include direct R&D expenses (subcontracting costs and consumables)  depreciation and amortization  and personnel expenses. Direct R&D expenses increased by ‚Ç¨3.3 million  or 14.0%  to ‚Ç¨26.7 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨23.4 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase is mainly due to: (i) a ‚Ç¨5.0 million increase in expenses relating to the lacutamab program and (ii) a ‚Ç¨1.5 million increase in expenses related to non-clinical development program relating notably to IPH65. These increases are partly offset by a ‚Ç¨1.9 million and ‚Ç¨1.3 million decreases in expenses relating to the monalizumab and avdoralimab programs  respectively.Also  as of December 31  2021  the collaboration liabilities relating to monalizumab and the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015  October 2018 and September 2020 amounted to ‚Ç¨40.4m  as compared to collaborations liabilities of ‚Ç¨46.7m as of December 31  2020. This decrease of ‚Ç¨6.3m mainly results from the payments made in 2021 to AstraZeneca relating to the co-funding of the monalizumab program  including the INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 trial.Personnel and other expenses allocated to R&D decreased by ‚Ç¨6.0 million  or 22.8%  to ‚Ç¨20.3 million for the year ended December 2021  as compared to an amount of ‚Ç¨26.3 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This decrease is mainly due to the decrease by ‚Ç¨5.2 million in amortization relating to monalizumab rights (extension of the depreciation horizon due to the extension of the duration of certain clinical trials) and IPH5201 rights (full amortization at December 31  2020).General and administrative expensesGeneral and administrative (‚ÄúG&A‚Äù) expenses from continuing operations increased by ‚Ç¨6.5 million  or 34.4%6 to ‚Ç¨25.5 million for the year ended December 31  2021 as compared to ‚Ç¨19.0 million for the year ended December 31  2020. G&A expenses represented a total of 35.2% and 27.6% of the total operating expenses for the years ended December 31  2021 and 2020  respectively.Personnel expenses (including share-based compensation) include the compensation paid to our employees and consultants  and increased by ‚Ç¨2.6 million  or 31.9%  to ‚Ç¨10.9 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨8.3 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase mainly results from an increase in wages of ‚Ç¨2.0 million  mainly resulting from restructuring costs and higher annual bonuses level in 2021. This increase is completed by the increase in share-based payments of ‚Ç¨0.6 million.G&A expenses also include non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses which mostly consist of auditing  accounting  legal and hiring fees. These expenses increased by ‚Ç¨0.7 million  or 15.0%  to ‚Ç¨5.1 million for the year ended December 31  2021  compared to an amount of ‚Ç¨4.4 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase results mainly from (i) an increase of auditing and accounting fees  recruitment fees and investor relation consultancy fees partly offset by (ii) a decrease of costs related to the launch of the Company's new ERP in 2020 and the support by external service providers in the context of compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley law following the listing of the Company in the United States in October 2019.Other G&A expenses relate to intellectual property  the costs of maintaining laboratory equipment and our premises  depreciation and amortization and other general  administrative expenses. These expenses increased by ‚Ç¨3.2 million or 51.5% to ‚Ç¨9.5 million for the year ended December 31 2021  as compared to an amount of ‚Ç¨6.3 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase related notably to insurance costs  which increased in fiscal year 2021  following the listing of the Company in the United States in October 2019. It also includes increases related to staff training (catch-up observed in 2021 following the impact of COVID-19 in 2020) and local taxes.Financial income (loss)  netWe recognized a net financial gain of ‚Ç¨2.3 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨1.9 million net financial loss for the year ended December 31  2020. This change results mainly from the change in the fair value of certain financial instruments (loss of ‚Ç¨0.6 million in 2020 as compared to a ‚Ç¨1.1 million gain in 2021) and a net foreign exchange gain of ‚Ç¨1.2 million in 2021 as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of ‚Ç¨1.6 million in 2020.Net loss from discontinued operationsFurther to the Company decision to terminate the Lumoxiti Agreement in December 2020  a Termination and Transition Agreement was negotiated and executed  effective as of June 30  2021 terminating the Lumoxiti Agreement as well as Lumoxiti related agreements (including the supply agreement  the quality agreement and other related agreements) and transferring the U.S. marketing authorization and distribution rights of Lumoxiti back to AstraZeneca. The marketing authorization has been transferred back to AstraZeneca which has reimbursed Innate for all Lumoxiti related costs  expenses and benefited net sales.Subsequently  operations related to Lumoxiti are presented as discontinued operations from October 1  2021.As a consequence  net result from discontinued operations relating to Lumoxiti decreased by ‚Ç¨55.8m  or -88.4%  to a ‚Ç¨7.3 million net loss for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to a ‚Ç¨63.2 million net loss for the year ended December 31  2020. Net loss for the year ended December 31  2021 mainly resulting from the Settlement Amount of $6.2m (‚Ç¨5.5m as of December 31  2021) to be paid to AstraZeneca on April 30  2022  as part of the Termination and Transition agreement. Net loss for the year ended December 31  2020 mainly resulted from the full impairment of Lumoxiti rights following the Company‚Äôs decision to return the marketing rights of Lumoxiti in the United States and in Europe to AstraZeneca and the costs incurred for the marketing of Lumoxiti and for our U.S subsidiary  including the related personnel costs.Balance sheet itemsCash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets (current and non-current) amounted to ‚Ç¨159.7 million as of December 31  2021  as compared to ‚Ç¨190.6 million as of December 31  2020. Net cash as of December 31  2021 (cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets less current financial liabilities) amounted to ‚Ç¨89.1 million (‚Ç¨149.5 million as of December 31  2020).The other key balance sheet items as of December 31  2021 are:Deferred revenue of ‚Ç¨37.9 million (including ‚Ç¨25.4 million booked as ‚ÄòDeferred revenue ‚Äì non-current portion‚Äô) and collaboration liabilities of ‚Ç¨40.4 million (including ‚Ç¨33.0 million booked as ‚ÄòCollaboration liability ‚Äì non-current portion‚Äô) relating to the remainder of the initial payment received from AstraZeneca with respect to monalizumab  not yet recognized as revenue or used to co-fund the research and the development work performed by AstraZeneca including co-funding of the monalizumab program with AstraZeneca  notably the INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 trial;Deferred revenue of ‚Ç¨17.4 million relating to the initial payment for preclinical molecules  entirely classified as ‚ÄòDeferred revenue ‚Äì non-current portion‚Äô;Intangible assets for a net book value of ‚Ç¨44.2 million  mainly corresponding to the rights and licenses relating to the acquisitions of monalizumab and avdoralimab (‚Ç¨46.3 million as of December 30  2020); variation between the two periods is mainly explained by the amortization of monalizumab rights;Current receivables of ‚Ç¨18.4 million  mainly resulting from the French government in relation to the research tax credit for 2021 (‚Ç¨10.3 million).Non-current receivables from the French government in relation to the research tax credit for 2019 and 2020 of ‚Ç¨29.8 million;Shareholders‚Äô equity of ‚Ç¨107.4 million  including the net loss of the period of ‚Ç¨52.8 million;Financial liabilities amounting to ‚Ç¨44.3 million (‚Ç¨19.1 million as of December 31  2020).Cash-flow itemsThe net cash flow used over the year ended December 31  2021 amounted to ‚Ç¨33.0 million  compared to a net cash flow used of ‚Ç¨66.1 million for the year ended December 31  2020.The net cash flow used during the period under review mainly results from the following:Net cash used from operating activities of ‚Ç¨58.5 million  mainly explained by the net cash consumption of operating activities less the receipts for a total amount of ‚Ç¨10.0 million from Sanofi (in January  February and December 2021) in connection with the IPH6101/SAR443579 agreement signed in 2016  following Sanofi's decision at the end of 2020 to advance IPH6101/SAR443579 towards regulatory preclinical studies for a new investigational drug  and the launch of the first related Phase 1 trial in December 2021. Restated for these receipts  net cash flows used by operating activities for the year ended December  2021 are down by ‚Ç¨24.6 million. This decrease is mainly due to the discontinuation of Lumoxiti-related activities in connection with the Company's decision at the end of 2020 to return the commercial rights in the United States and Europe to AstraZeneca  under the termination and transition agreement signed in 2021. As a result  net cash flow consumed by operating activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation amounted to ‚Ç¨3.6 million for the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to ‚Ç¨22.4 million for the year 2020.Net cash used in investing activities for an amount of ‚Ç¨0.9 million. As a reminder  net cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31  2020 amounted ‚Ç¨13.4 million which mainly resulted from (i) a ‚Ç¨13.4 million ($15.0 million) additional consideration paid  in January 2020  to AstraZeneca regarding Lumoxiti following the submission of the Biologics License Application to the European Medicine Agency (EMA) in November 2019 (ii) a ‚Ç¨2.7 million additional consideration paid to Orega Biotech in April 2020 regarding IPH5201 following the dosing of a first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial  in March 2020 and (iii) the acquisition of financial assets for a net amount of ‚Ç¨3.0 million. Such items were partially offset by the reimbursement by AstraZeneca in relation to the 2019 cost sharing mechanism for the commercialization of Lumoxiti (‚Ç¨7.0 million). As a result  net cash flows consumed by investing activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation were nil for year ended December 31  2021 as compared to ‚Ç¨6.6 million for year ended December 31 2020.Net cash flows from financing activities for an amount of ‚Ç¨26.8 million. On January 5  2022  the Company announced that it had obtained a non-dilutive financing of ‚Ç¨28.7 million in the form of two State-Guaranteed Loans (Pr√™ts Garantis ‚ÄúPGE‚Äù) from Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale (‚Ç¨20.0 million) and BNP Paribas (‚Ç¨8.7 million). The funds related to these two PGEs were collected by the Company on December 27 and 30  2021 respectively. Loan repayments amounted to ‚Ç¨2.1 million for the year ended December 31  2021 compared to ‚Ç¨2.2 million for the year ended December 31  2020. In addition  net cash flow from financing activities related to Lumoxiti discontinued operation are nil for year ended December 31  2021 and 2020  respectively.Post period eventBetween December 31  2021  closing date of the financial year  and March 23  2022  closing date of the consolidated financial statements by the Executive Board  the military operations in Ukraine took place  which began on February 24  2022 and the sanctions taken against the Russia by many States having an impact on the activity of many international groups and which will have an impact on the world economy.

We are giving Cegedim Sant√© the capital it needs to grow: exclusive talks with social protection groups Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP will result in a ‚Ç¨65 million reserved capital increase.

See pages 137-139 of the 2020 Universal Registration Document.(2) At constant scope and exchange rates.Consolidated revenues increased by ‚Ç¨27.8 million  or 5.6%  to ‚Ç¨524.7 million in 2021 compared with ‚Ç¨496.9 million in 2020. The positive scope effect of ‚Ç¨1.3 million  or 0.3pp  was attributable to Cegedim‚Äôs first-time consolidation of new acquisitions M√©dimust and Kobus Tech. The positive currency impact of ‚Ç¨1.6 million  or 0.3pp  was mainly due to the euro‚Äôs appreciation against the pound sterling.Like-for-like(2) revenues climbed 5.0% over the period.Recurring operating income(1) decreased by ‚Ç¨1.8 million  or 4.4%  to ‚Ç¨39.9 million in 2021 compared with ‚Ç¨41.7 million in 2020. It represented 7.6% of consolidated revenue in 2021  compared with 8.4% in 2020. The decline is chiefly attributable to a ‚Ç¨4.5 million negative impact from lower R&D capitalization and an increase in R&D amortization. In addition  other net non-recurring operating expenses(1) fell by ‚Ç¨23.7 million compared with 2020.Other non-recurring operating income and expenses(1) amounted to income of ‚Ç¨3.8 million in 2021 compared with a charge of ‚Ç¨19.9 million in 2020. The 2021 performance is partly the result of a ‚Ç¨4.7 million payment made by a client as part of the early termination of a services contract that was originally supposed to run through 2027. This payment was partly offset by other expenses  notably fees related to disputes or the winding up of non-recurring operations. In 2020 the amount was mainly attributable to ‚Ç¨15.0 million of impairments of certain intangible assets related to software businesses  notably on products for doctors in the UK and Belgium.Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by ‚Ç¨2.3 million  or 3.8%  to ‚Ç¨64.8 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨62.5 million in 2020. Amortization related to lease contracts (IFRS 16) was virtually stable  at ‚Ç¨16.5 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨15.9 million in 2020. The amortization of capitalized R&D expenses over the period increased by ‚Ç¨2.7 million  or 9.0%  to ‚Ç¨33.3 million in 2021 compared to ‚Ç¨30.6 million in 2020. The increase was due to higher R&D capitalization in previous years. Other depreciation & amortization declined by ‚Ç¨0.9 million to ‚Ç¨15.0 million in 2021 from ‚Ç¨15.9 million in 2020.EBITDA (1) increased by ‚Ç¨0.5 million  or 0.5%  to ‚Ç¨104.7 million in 2021  compared with ‚Ç¨104.2 million in 2020. It represented 20.0% of consolidated revenue in 2021  compared with 21.0% in 2020.Financial result increased by ‚Ç¨1.7 million  or 20.0%  to ‚Ç¨10.4 million in 2021 compared with ‚Ç¨8.6 million in 2020. The main reason for the increase was exchange rate impacts related to the pound sterling. We note that the cost of gross financial debt is stable relative to December 31  2020  because the vast majority of debt is at fixed interest rates.Total tax came to ‚Ç¨5.8 million in 2021 compared with ‚Ç¨2.0 million in 2020  an increase of ‚Ç¨3.9 million or 196.8%. This change was principally the result of a combination of increased income taxes  especially for French companies  and a decrease in deferred tax assets.Net profit attributable to the owners of the parent came to ‚Ç¨26.2 million in 2021 compared with ‚Ç¨10.8 million in 2020. Recurring earnings per share came to ‚Ç¨1.8 in 2021 compared with a profit of ‚Ç¨1.2 a year earlier. Earnings per share came to ‚Ç¨1.9 in 2021 compared with ‚Ç¨0.8 a year earlier.Analysis of business trends by divisionSoftware & ServicesIn millions of euros 2021 2020 Change Revenue 292.0 277.2 +5.4% | Like for like (2): +4.4% Recurring operating income(1) 12.8 23.8 (46.1)% Margin 4.4% 8.6% (420) bp Operating income 12.3 6.9 +78.9% Margin 4.2% 2.5% +174 bpRevenues got a boost from stronger growth in computerization activities for health insurers  bolstered by the resumption of project-based business  which positively affected recurring operating income(1).

Its solution has more than 4 000 users. It is perfectly compatible with Cegedim Sant√©‚Äôs solutions  and their combined offering in France is one of the market‚Äôs most comprehensive.Kobus was initially consolidated on June 30  2021.Acquisition of M√©dimust in FranceOn May 4  2021  Cegedim acquired M√©dimust  a software publisher serving healthcare professions for 25 years that currently supplies 2 000 independent physicians. The acquisition cements Cegedim Sant√©‚Äôs place as France‚Äôs number 1 medical software company(3). Pooling the companies‚Äô know-how and expertise is strengthening Cegedim Sant√©‚Äôs range of solutions and improving its ability to adapt to market developments and healthcare professionals‚Äô changing needs.M√©dimust generated revenues of ‚Ç¨1.3 million in 2020 and earned a profit. It began contributing to the Group‚Äôs consolidation scope in May 2021.Euris litigationCegedim  jointly with IQVIA (formerly IMS Health)  is being sued by Euris for unfair competition. Cegedim has asked the court to dismiss the case against the Group. On December 17  2018  the Paris Commercial Court granted Cegedim‚Äôs request  which IQVIA then appealed.

After consultation with its lawyers and based on ample precedent. the Group believes that the adjustment is unwarranted and continues to explore its options to appeal the decision. The maximum tax liability Cegedim faces as a result of the current audit is ‚Ç¨20.3 million at December 31  2021. Cegedim still believes that there is not enough risk with respect to this amount or to tax loss carryforwards recorded on its consolidated balance sheet (corresponding to ‚Ç¨20 million) to jeopardize their valuation.On October 21  2021  Cegedim SA received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2019  to December 31  2020.

Recurring operating income(1) should remain stable owing to the significant investments planned  especially for Cegedim Sant√©.These targets may need to be revised if there is a sharp resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic and/or a significant worsening of geopolitical risks.The Group does not expect to make any significant acquisitions in 2022.---------------The Audit Committee met on March 23  2022.

Over the past year  our team executed in evaluating our dynamic shRNA proprietary technology platform and introduced our armored CAR T franchise while delivering important updates across our CAR T pipeline. In addition  we expect our recently announced private placement with Fortress Investment Group to act as a catalyst for our corporate initiatives to advance our intellectual property and allogeneic CAR T product candidates ‚Äù commented Filippo Petti  Chief Executive Officer of the Company. ‚ÄúAlthough we are facing a current challenge with the CYAD-101 Phase 1b trial  the safety of our patients is our first priority  and we are focusing our efforts on the current investigation. The situation does not take away from the important work our team is doing and we believe we can look forward to announcing exciting upcoming milestones in 2022.‚ÄùUpdate on Clinical and Preclinical ProgramsCYAD-211 ‚Äì Allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T candidate for r/r MMStory continuesThe dose-escalation  Phase 1 IMMUNICY-1 trial is evaluating the tolerability and clinical activity of a single infusion of CYAD-211 following preconditioning with CyFlu (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) in patients with r/r MM. At the 63rd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2021  the Company presented the latest clinical data from the trial that showed a good tolerability profile and evidence of clinical activity. Data showed no dose-limiting toxicities  GvHD or CAR T-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES). There was one Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) event and three patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related blood disorders. Three out of 12 total patients with r/r MM evaluated for activity achieved partial response  one in each dose-level  while eight patients had stable disease. All patients had detectable CYAD-211 cells in the peripheral blood  although engraftment was short lasting. The next segment of the IMMUNICY-1 study will evaluate CYAD-211 following enhanced lymphodepleting (eLD) regimens with the aim to improve cell expansion and persistence and potentially maximize the clinical activity of CYAD-211. In addition  the IMMUNICY-1 protocol allows for redosing of CYAD-211 in certain patients. Enrollment in the eLD cohorts of the IMMUNICY-1 trial is ongoing with additional data expected in the second half of 2022.CYAD-101 ‚Äì Allogeneic TIM-based  NKG2D CAR T Candidate for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC).In December 2021  the Company announced the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1b CYAD-101-002 (KEYNOTE-B79) Phase 1b trial. The CYAD-101-002 trial is part of a collaboration with MSD  a tradename of Merck & Co.  Inc.  Kenilworth  NJ  USA  through a subsidiary. The trial is evaluating the Company‚Äôs TCR Inhibitory Molecule (TIM)-based allogeneic NKG2D CAR T cell investigational therapy  CYAD-101  administered concurrently with FOLFOX chemotherapy  followed by MSD‚Äôs anti-PD-1 therapy  KEYTRUDA¬Æ (pembrolizumab)  in patients with refractory mCRC with microsatellite stable/mismatch-repair proficient disease.In February 2022  the Company voluntarily placed the Phase 1b trial on clinical hold after two fatalities occurred that presented with similar pulmonary findings. Subsequently  in March 2022  the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) put the Company on a clinical hold. The Company is currently investigating these findings and evaluating any similar events in additional patients treated on study. The Company expects to provide additional updates on the trial in the future.CYAD-101 is the only investigational candidate from the Company using the TIM technology.CYAD-203 ‚Äì Preclinical allogeneic shRNA-based  IL-18-armored NKG2D CAR T for Solid TumorsPreclinical data presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 36th Annual Meeting demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor activity of NKG2D CAR T cells when armored with the cytokine Interleukin-18 (IL-18)  supporting the continued development of CYAD-203 as well as future allogeneic IL-18-armored CAR T candidates.IND-enabling studies are currently in progress alongside production of the clinical grade vector. Submission of the IND application to the FDA for CYAD-203 is anticipated by year-end 2022.CYAD-02 ‚Äì Autologous NKG2D receptor CAR T Candidate for relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (r/r AML / MDS)At the ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2021  the Company presented the latest clinical data from the Phase 1 CYCLE-1 dose-escalation trial of CYAD-02 for the treatment of r/r AML / MDS. Data from the trial showed that a single shRNA can target two independent genes (MICA/MICB) to enhance the phenotype of the CAR T cells. In addition  the dual knockdown of these genes showed a positive contribution to the initial clinical activity of CYAD-02 as well as a trend towards increased engraftment and persistence compared to our first-generation  autologous NKG2D receptor CAR T candidate  CYAD-01. A comparison of cellular kinetics for CYAD-02 and CYAD-01 trend towards increased engraftment and persistence of CYAD-02  potentially associated with the knockdown of MICA/MICB and reduced fratricide in vivo.Upcoming Anticipated MilestonesEnrollment in the cohorts evaluating enhanced lymphodepletion is ongoing in the CYAD-211 IMMUNICY-1 trial and additional data from the trial are expected in the second half of 2022.IND-enabling studies continue for CYAD-203  with submission of an IND application to the FDA for CYAD-203 anticipated by year-end 2022.Full Year 2021 Financial ReviewAs of December 31  2021  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of ‚Ç¨30.0 million ($34.0 million).Based on the Company‚Äôs current scope of activities  the Company estimates that its cash and cash equivalents as of December 31  2021  combined with the remaining access to the equity purchase agreement established with Lincoln Park Capital Fund  LLC  should be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements until mid-2023.Key financial figures for full-year 2021  compared with full-year 2020  are summarized below:Selected key financial figures (‚Ç¨ millions) Full year 2021 Full year 2020 Revenue - - Research and development expenses (20.8 ) (21.5 ) General and administrative expenses (9.9 ) (9.3 ) Change in fair value of contingent consideration 0.8 9.2 Other income/(expenses) 3.4 4.6 Operating loss (26.4 ) (17.0 ) Loss for the period/year (26.5 ) (17.2 ) Net cash used in operations (26.6 ) (27.7 ) Treasury position(1) 30.0 17.2(1) ‚ÄúTreasury position‚Äù is an alternative performance measure determined by adding Short-term investments and Cash and cash equivalents from the statement of financial position prepared in accordance with IFRS. The purpose of this measure by Management is to identify the level of cash available internally (excluding external sources of financing) within 12 months.The Company‚Äôs license and collaboration agreements generated no revenue in 2021 and in 2020.Research and Development (R&D) expenses were ‚Ç¨20.8 million in 2021 as compared to ‚Ç¨21.5 million in 2020  a year-over-year decrease of ‚Ç¨0.7 million. The decrease in the Company‚Äôs R&D expenses is primarily driven by the Company‚Äôs decision to discontinue the development of CYAD-01 in the fourth quarter of 2020  as well as a decrease of the expenses associated with share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrant plan offered to our employees and directors.General and Administrative (G&A) expenses were ‚Ç¨9.9 million in 2021 as compared to ‚Ç¨9.3 million in 2020  an increase of ‚Ç¨0.6 million. This increase is primarily related to higher insurances costs and consulting fees partially compensated by the decrease of the expenses associated with the share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrants plan offered to our employees and directors.The fair value adjustment (‚Ç¨0.8 million) relating to the contingent consideration and other financial liabilities as of December 31  2021 was mainly driven by updated assumptions associated with the timing of the potential commercialization of the Company‚Äôs allogenic CYAD-101 CAR T program for mCRC and autologous CYAD-02 CAR T program for r/r AML/MDS as well as to reflect the future development of the program through potential partnership. The decrease of the liability is also driven by an update to the fair value measurement based on factors such as the weighted average cost of capital  the revaluation of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and updated assumptions on probability of success associated with the Company‚Äôs CAR T programs as of December 31  2021.The Company‚Äôs other income is associated with grants received from the Walloon Region mainly in the form of recoverable cash advances (RCAs) and R&D tax credit income:Grant income (RCAs): additional grant income has been recognized in 2021 on grants in the form of RCAs. According to IFRS standards  the Company has recognized grant income for the period amounting to ‚Ç¨2.7 million and a liability component of ‚Ç¨1.6 million is accounted for as a financial liability.Grant income (Others): additional grant income has been recognized in 2021 on grants received from the Federal Belgian Institute for Health Insurance Inami (‚Ç¨0.3 million) and from the regional government (for ‚Ç¨1.1 million)  not referring to RCAs and not subject to reimbursement.With respect to R&D tax credit  the current year income is predicated on a R&D tax credit recorded as (‚Ç¨0.7 million)  which has been updated to take into account all information available as of this date and is in line with previous year.In 2021  other income was partially compensated by other expenses including the remeasurement income on the RCAs of ‚Ç¨0.3 million for the year 2021 and amendment fees associated with the Dartmouth license agreement signed in December 2021 for ‚Ç¨1.1 million.Net loss for the year ended December 31  2021 was ‚Ç¨26.5 million  or ‚Ç¨1.70 per share  compared to a net loss of ‚Ç¨17.2 million  or ‚Ç¨1.23 per share  for the same period in 2020. As noted above  the increase in net loss between periods was primarily due to the decrease change in fair value of contingent consideration combined with the decrease on other income/expenses.Net cash used in operations for the year ended December 31  2021  which excludes non-cash effects  amounted to ‚Ç¨26.6 million  which is in line with net cash used in operations of ‚Ç¨27.7 million for the year ended December 31  2020.Annual Report 2021The Annual Report for the year ended December 31  2021 will be published on March 24  2022  and will be available on the Company‚Äôs website  www.celyad.com.

European Union countries debated a possible ban on Russian oil that has deeply divided the bloc which relies heavily on Moscow for energy supplies.Wheat prices have been extremely volatile during the conflict  as the market heavily relies on supplies from Russia and Ukraine through the Black Sea.Importers have turned to other sources  including the EU.In Germany  export demand is seen staying strong while the conflict lasts  although securing supplies was becoming increasingly difficult  traders said.‚ÄúWith Euronext rising so strongly  farmers are very hesitant about selling today because they may make a lot more money tomorrow. Before accepting a sale for export in German ports  traders are now first collecting the sales offers from farmers ‚Äù one trader said.‚ÄúIn the past  you would accept a deal to sell to exporters and then seek the wheat from farmers and regional traders. This is not practical any more.‚ÄùSellers of standard 12% protein wheat for April onwards delivery in Hamburg were offering around 34 euros a tonne over the Euronext May contract.In rapeseed  May futures on Euronext added as much as 3% to 999.50 euros a tonne  a new record for the market as it neared the 1 000 euro threshold for the first time.A block on sunflower oil and meal shipments from Ukraine due to the war has added to demand for rapeseed  which had already been in tight supply in Europe this season  traders said.The May contract settled up 2.5% at 994.50 euros.,neutral,0.03,0.5,0.47,negative,0.01,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['Paris wheat', 'new', 'Ukraine', 'war', 'Front-month May milling wheat', 'European Union countries', 'The May contract', 'standard 12% protein wheat', 'new record peak', 'Euronext May contract', 'Paris-based Euronext exchange', 'May futures', 'Euronext wheat', 'Wheat prices', 'negative territory', 'steep rise', 'four-week-old invasion', 'decisive advance', 'possible ban', 'Russian oil', 'Black Sea', 'other sources', 'German ports', 'sales offers', 'one trader', 'April onwards', '1,000 euro threshold', 'first time', 'sunflower oil', 'meal shipments', 'tight supply', 'oilseed supplies', 'energy supplies', 'regional traders', 'export demand', 'Tuesday', 'market', 'developments', 'Ukraine', '1,000 euros', 'conflict', 'positive', 'session', 'Monday', 'cities', 'bloc', 'Moscow', 'Importers', 'Germany', 'farmers', 'money', 'past', 'deal', 'exporters', 'Sellers', 'delivery', 'Hamburg', '34 euros', '999.50 euros', '994.50 euros', '2.25', '379.00']",2022-03-24,2022-03-24,brecorder.com

""Through the BETTER SLEEP study results  we are now able to offer an effective solution for CCC patients with an expanded CE mark indication in Europe  and we are working hard to initiate a CCC-focused IDE trial in the US. Particularly encouraging are the strong responder rates in all patient cohorts  further increasing our confidence in positive outcomes from the ongoing DREAM study.""""We have also been happy with our commercial progress in Europe  focusing on Germany  where we obtained a dedicated DRG code."" continued Mr. Taelman. ""We already had 12 active implant sites in December 2021 and continue to expand rapidly. In addition  we have secured a DRG code in Switzerland and hospital reimbursement in Spain while we await final reimbursement decisions in the Netherlands and Belgium. Our commercial strategy is based on a deep understanding of the patient journey  building strong relationships with implanting surgeons and further strengthening their relationships with referring sleep physicians  in combination with digital marketing programs.""Mr. Taelman continued  ""We secured CE mark MR conditional labeling for Genio  enabling all implanted patients to safely undergo 1.5T and 3T MRI diagnostics scans. Genio is now the only HGNS device with an MRI compatibility label for full-body and 3T. This illustrates our patient-centric strategy  and you can soon expect to hear more on the progress made by our R&D team. Short term  we expect to launch the next generation Genio 2.1  which includes a patient-centric smartphone app and will incorporate a position sensor to adjust stimulation levels based on sleeping position. Looking further into the future  we are proud of our collaboration with Vanderbilt University and Dr. Kent that should result in novel treatment options for OSA patients  starting with Ansa Cervicalis stimulation.""""With our second successful IPO in the span of 10 months last July  we have a strong balance sheet that provides ample liquidity to complete the DREAM study  conduct our U.S. CCC IDE study  invest in pre-commercial activities in the U.S.  and remain committed to our important R&D priorities.

The increase in revenue was attributable to the Company's commercialization of the Genio system  primarily in Germany.

The Company expects to continue adding headcount across the organization ahead of U.S. commercial launch.Research and Development ExpensesResearch and Development expenses were ‚Ç¨2.4 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2021  a substantial increase over the ‚Ç¨0.5 million for the prior year  reflecting the ongoing research and development activities  most notably the development of next generation versions of the Genio system. As of January 2021  the Company started to amortize its intangible assets  which explains the significant increase in depreciation expenses for the twelve months ending December 31  2021  compared to the twelve months ending December 31  2020.Clinical ExpensesClinical expenses increased to ‚Ç¨2.7 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2021  from ‚Ç¨1.1 million for the twelve months ending December 31  2020.
