The guidelines encompass remuneration to the Board of Directors  the CEO and the executive management  however  these guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the Annual General Meeting.The Board of Directors shall be entitled to temporarily depart from these guidelines  in whole or in part  if special reasons justify doing so in an individual case and such deviation is necessary in order to meet the company's long-term interests or to ensure the company's financial viability. If such a departure occurs  it must be reported in the remuneration report before the next Annual General Meeting. The guidelines pertain to the period starting from the 2022 Annual General Meeting. Any issue regarding departure from the guidelines shall be prepared by the remuneration committee and decided by the Board of Directors.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interest and sustainabilityMycronic is a global high-tech company that develops  manufactures and supplies market-leading production equipment with high requirements on precision and flexibility to the electronics industry.

Total remuneration consists of base salary and variable pay  pension and other benefits. Long-term variable pay is excluded in the calculation of the total remuneration and the relative proportion of the remuneration components.Fixed remunerationIn establishing the base salary for the CEO and members of the executive management  the scope and complexity of the position in question  as well as the individual's performance is taken into account. The executive managements' salaries are  like the other components of remuneration  subject to annual review by the Remuneration Committee  with the support of external salary statistics ensure that the salaries remain competitive. The base salary constitutes a maximum of 65 percent of total remuneration in the event of a maximum outcome of short-term variable pay.Short-term variable remunerationThe remuneration is paid in accordance with goals achieved. The criteria  such as order intake or EBIT  are established in order to contribute to the company's business strategy  long-term interests and thus to the company's long-term value creation.

Variable pay shall not be pensionable  unless otherwise provided by mandatory law or obligations in applicable collective bargaining agreements.

Information about the executive managements' total remuneration  components of their remuneration  as well as increases in remuneration and rates of increase over time have been obtained and have constituted a part of the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' decision basis in their evaluation of the fairness of the guidelines and the limitations arising from them.The resolution processThe Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines when there is a need for significant changes to the guidelines  however at least every four years. The Board of Directors' proposal is prepared by the Remuneration Committee. The Chairman of the Board of Directors may also be Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.

In such cases  remuneration shall be paid in accordance with the current guidelines or  if no guidelines exist  in accordance with the company's practice.External advisors are used in the preparation of these matters when deemed necessary.Review of the guidelinesThe guidelines for remuneration to members of the executive management were reviewed ahead of the 2022 Annual General Meeting  and did not result in any adjustments.Item 16: Proposal regarding composition of nomination committeeThe nomination committee proposes that a new nomination committee for the 2023 Annual General Meeting is appointed by the Chairman of the Board – at the latest by the end of the third quarter of 2022 – contacting the three largest or otherwise known shareholders per 31 August  2022.

The issue price shall be determined on marketable grounds and the number of issued shares may not exceed ten percent of the total amount of outstanding shares in the company per the day of this notice.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and the right to decide on payment through set-off  in kind or other condition as set forth in the Swedish Companies Act is to enable the company to issue shares in order to acquire shares  business or product rights.Majority requirementsA valid resolution under item 17 above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.Item 18: The Board of Directors' proposal on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve for the company to acquire the company's own sharesThe Board of Directors shall be authorized  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to decide to acquire the company's own shares in accordance with the following.Acquisition may only be made by a maximum of so many shares that  at any given time  the company's own holdings do not exceed five percent of all shares in the company Acquisition of shares in the company may only be made on Nasdaq Stockholm (the ""Exchange"") Acquisition of shares on the Exchange may only take place at a price within the price range recorded on the Exchange at any given time The payment for the shares shall be paid in cash The authorization may be used on one or several occasions up until the end of the 2023 Annual General MeetingThe purpose of the above authorizations to acquire shares is to enable delivery of shares to participants in LTIP 2022 (the introduction of a new long term incentive program  LTIP 2022  is subject to a separate resolution in item 19 in the notice for the 2022 Annual General Meeting) and to be able to continuously adjust the company's capital structure to the company's capital requirements.Shares that have been acquired by the company and which have not been reserved in order to secure the company's delivery of shares under LTIP 2022 are intended to be canceled following a resolution thereof at the 2023 Annual General Meeting.Majority requirementsA valid resolution under item 18 above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.Item 19: The Board of Directors' proposal regarding Long Term Incentive Program 2022 (LTIP 2022)Mycronic's Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting passes a resolution on the implementation of a Long Term Incentive Program 2022 (LTIP 2022). This proposal is divided into four items:A. Terms of LTIP 2022B. Transfer of the company's own shares under LTIP 2022 and hedging activitiesC. Hedging of LTIP 2022 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyD. Other matters related to LTIP 2022A. Terms of LTIP 2022A.1 IntroductionThe Board wishes to establish a long-term incentive program for certain key employees in order to encourage personal long-term ownership of Mycronic shares as well as to increase and enhance its ability to recruit  retain and motivate employees. The Board therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance share program 2022 (""LTIP 2022""). The intention is also to use LTIP 2021 to unite the interest of the employees with the interests of shareholders.Participants may  after a qualifying period  receive allotments of Mycronic ordinary shares without consideration. The number of allotted shares will depend on the fulfilment of certain performance targets. The term of LTIP 2022 is more than three years.A.2 Basic features of LTIP 2022The LTIP 2022 will be directed towards certain key employees in the Mycronic Group. The participants are based in Sweden and other countries where the Mycronic Group is active. Each participant may be entitled  after a certain qualification period (defined below)  provided continued employment during the entire period (except from ""Good Leavers"")  and depending on the fulfilment of certain performance targets linked to Mycronic's Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")  to receive allotment of Mycronic shares (""Performance Shares""). The participant shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares. Performance Shares are Mycronic ordinary shares.A.3 Participation in LTIP 2022LTIP 2022 is directed towards a maximum of 70 employees  divided in three categories of participants:Category Maximum number of shares per personA) CEO (maximum 1 person) 8 900B) Management Group (maximum 10 persons) 3 400C) Other key employees (maximum 59 persons) 1 400Any resolution on participation or implementation of LTIP 2022 shall be conditional on that it  in the Board's judgement  can be offered with reasonable administrative costs and financial effects.A.4 Allotment of Performance SharesAllotment of Performance Shares within LTIP 2022 will be made during a limited period of time following the Annual General Meeting 2025. The period up to this date is referred to as the qualification period (vesting period). A condition for the participant to receive allotment of Performance Shares is that the participant remains an employee of the Mycronic Group during the full qualification period up until allotment. Allotment of Performance Shares also requires that the EPS performance targets are fulfilled. The Board shall establish a customary definition of Good Leavers and determine whether any allocation shall be made to participants who are considered Good Leavers.The performance target is Mycronic's EPS and the performance target shall be established by the Board. Partial fulfilment of the performance targets will result in partial allotment of Performance Shares. Performance under a certain level will result in no allotment. The EPS targets and the outcome will be communicated to the shareholders after the allotment of Performance Shares to participants.Prior to the allotment of Performance Shares  the Board shall assess whether the allotment is reasonable in relation to the company's financial results  position and performance  as well as other factors.If significant changes take place within the Mycronic Group  or on the market  which  by the assessment of the Board  would mean that the terms for allocation/transfer of shares according to LTIP 2022 is no longer reasonable  the Board shall have the right to implement an adjustment to LTIP 2022  including  among others  the right to reduce the number of Performance Shares allocated/transferred  or not to allocate/transfer Performance Shares at all.A.5 Implementation and administration etceteraThe Board  with the assistance of the remuneration committee  shall in accordance with the resolutions by the Annual General Meeting set forth herein be responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2022. The Board may also decide on the implementation of an alternative cash based incentive for participants in countries where the allotment of Performance Shares is not appropriate  as well as if otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTIP 2022.The intention is that the Board shall launch LTIP 2022 as soon as practically possible after the Annual General Meeting.In the event that the general meeting does not resolve in accordance with item B with the required majority  the Company shall hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party in accordance with what is stated in item C below.B. Transfer of the company's own shares under LTIP 2022 and hedging activities.B1. Number of sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that transfer of up to 125 500 Mycronic shares under LTIP 2022 may be made in accordance with the below. The number of shares is calculated on the basis of maximum participation and maximum fulfilment of performance requirements.B2. Other conditions for transfer of Mycronic sharesMycronic shares may be transferred to the participants in LTIP 2022.Share transfers to participants in LTIP 2022 shall be made without the participants paying consideration and shall be carried out at the time and subject to the other conditions under which participants in LTIP 2022 have the right to be allotted shares.The number of Mycronic shares that might be transferred under LTIP 2022 shall be subject to customary re-calculation principles and may  consequently  be subject to re-calculation due to a bonus issue  share split  dividends and/or other similar events. Resolutions resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting 2022 shall not be included in a re-calculation of the number of shares.B.3 Grounds for the Board's proposal and alternative hedging via an equity swap agreement with a third party etceteraSince the Board believes that the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer Mycronic shares under LTIP 2022 is obtained through transfer of own shares  the Board proposes that transfers are secured as described above in this item B. Should the necessary majority not be obtained for the proposal in item B  the Board will enter into a share swap agreement  in accordance with item C below.Share swap agreement will also be relevant should this be more appropriate  for example due to the fact that the acquisition of own shares cannot be made to the extent required to be able to transfer shares under LTIP 2022.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights to acquire the own shares is that the company shall be able to secure the delivery of shares under LTIP 2022.C. Hedge of LTIP 2022 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyIn the event that the necessary majority is not obtained for item B above  the company will hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer shares in the company under LTIP 2022. The relevant number of shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed under item B above. The cost of hedging by entering into an equity swap agreement  excluding any dividends and without regard to the development of Mycronic's share price  exceeds SEK 1 million during the term of the program.D. Other matters in relation to LTIP 2022D.1 Majority requirements etc.The resolution according to item A above shall require a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. A valid resolution under item B above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.D.2 Estimated costs  expenses and financial effects of LTIP 2022LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the share awards should be expensed as personnel costs over the qualification period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security contributions will be recognized as an expense in the income statement through regular provisions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The amount of these regular provisions will be revalued in line with the trend in the value of the right to Performance Shares  and the contributions payable on the allotment of Performance Shares.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 178  and that the performance targets are achieved so that 50 percent of the maximum number of Performance Shares vest  including a share price increase of 50 percent during the qualification period and an annual employee turnover of 5 percent  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to SEK 14.1 million before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of SEK 4.7 million before tax.Assuming that the performance targets are achieved so that 100 percent of the maximum number of Performance Shares vest  and otherwise the same assumptions as above  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to SEK 28.2 million before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of SEK 9.4 million before tax.LTIP 2022 will comprise maximum 125 500 shares in total  which corresponds to 0.13 percent of the total outstanding shares and votes in the company on a fully diluted basis.The above calculations are based on a decision on hedging in accordance with item B.In the view of the Board  the positive effects expected to arise from LTIP 2022  outweigh the costs associated with LTIP 2022.D.3 The Board's explanatory statementAn individual long-term ownership commitment among the participants in LTIP 2022 is expected to stimulate greater interest and motivation in the company's business operations  results and strategy. Moreover  the Board wishes to increase the ability of Mycronic to retain important key employees. The Board believes that the implementation of LTIP 2022 will benefit Mycronic and its shareholders. LTIP 2022 will provide a competitive and motivation-improving incentive for executives and other key employees within the Group.LTIP 2022 has been designed to reward the participants for increased shareholder value by allotting shares  based on the fulfilment of conditions in respect of results and operations. By linking the employees' remuneration to the development of Mycronic's results and value  the long-term value growth of Mycronic is rewarded. Based on these circumstances  the Board considers that the implementation of LTIP 2022 will have a positive effect on the Mycronic Group's continued development  and will therefore be beneficial to the shareholders and Mycronic.D.4 Other share-related incentive programsThe company's share-related incentive programs are described on pages 49-51 in the company's annual report.D.5 Adjustment AuthorizationThe Board  or a person appointed by the Board  shall be authorized to make adjustments to the above resolutions that may be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB respectively.D.6 Preparation of the itemThe basis for LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the Board of the company. The work has been supported by external advisors and has been made in consultation with shareholders. The Board has thereafter decided to present this proposal for the general meeting. Except for the staff that have prepared the matter upon instruction from the Board  no employee that may be a participant of LTIP 2022 has participated in the preparations of the program's terms.The financial statements and the audit report regarding the financial year 2021  as well as the nomination committee's and the Board of Director's complete proposals including related documentation will be available at the company at Nytorpsvägen 9 in Täby not later than by 14 April 2022  on the company website and will also be sent by post to shareholders requesting so and stating their postal address. The same applies to the Board of Directors report in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551) and the auditor's opinion in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 54 of the same law.The total number of shares and votes in the company amounts to 97 916 509. The company does not hold any of these shares. Shareholders are reminded of the right to  at the Annual General Meeting  ask questions to the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act  Chapter 7  Section 32.For information on how your personal data is processed  please see https://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfTäby in March 2022Mycronic AB (publ)The Board of DirectorsN.B.

The resolutions under 15A - 15B below are conditional on each other and all decisions are therefore proposed to be adopted in one context.15A. Introduction of LTIP 2022The Board of Directors of the Company proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive programme (LTIP 2022) directed at senior executives and key individuals in the XVIVO group in accordance with the main terms and conditions set out below.Background and rationaleThe Company's Board is of the opinion that incentive programmes contribute to higher motivation and commitment among the employees and strengthen the bonds between the employees and the Company. Furthermore  the Board's assessment is that LTIP 2022 will contribute to the opportunities to retain knowledgeable and experienced employees and is expected to increase the employees' interest in the Company's operations and development of earnings. In view of these considerations  it is the Board's opinion that LTIP 2022 will benefit both the employees and the Company's shareholders through increased share value.LTIP 2022The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a directed new issue of not more than 130 000 warrants  hereinafter referred to as (""Warrants"")  and subsequent transfer of not more than 130 000 Warrants. The right to subscribe for Warrants shall only vest with senior executives and key individuals in the XVIVO group. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one share.Participants in LTIP 2022 shall no later than 6 May 2022 notify XVIVO of the number of Warrants that the participant wishes to subscribe. The Warrants will be acquired at market value assessed by the Company  which shall be determined by way of the Warrants being valued by an independent party in accordance with the Black & Scholes valuation model. At the valuation according to the Black & Scholes valuation model the following variables will be used; a subscription price of 150 percent of the XVIVO share's average volume-weighted closing price during twenty (20) subsequent banking days in relation to the date of the resolution by the annual general meeting and a term of three (3) years. Other variables such as volatility and risk-free interest rate in percent shall be reviewed and recommended by an experienced external financial advisor appointed by the Company. Provided that the subscription price will be SEK 250  the Warrant premium will amount to SEK 20.The Board of Directors of XVIVO shall  provided that the employment of participants has not been terminated  at the earliest after two years be able to resolve to subsidize 50 percent of the original Warrant premium  paid by the participant  by a one-time payment by the Company to the participant. Since the participant shall pay income tax on the payment  a one-time payment per participant will be possible which  after taxation  corresponds to half of the paid Warrant premium.In connection with the allotment of the Warrants  the Board shall have the right to make adjustments to comply with organisational changes and special rules or market conditions abroad and reserve the right to repurchase the Warrants if the participant in turn wishes to transfer the Warrants.Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new share in XVIVO during the period from 6 May 2025 to 31 May 2025. The subscription price for shares subscribed for on the basis of the Warrants shall correspond to 150 percent of the XVIVO share's average volume-weighted closing price during twenty (20) subsequent banking days in relation to the date of the resolution by the annual general meeting. The subscription price shall be paid in cash or by set-off.The exercise price  as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10  whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded downwards. The exercise price and the number of shares that each Warrant entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue etc. in accordance with market practice.The Company shall have the right  but no obligation  to acquire at market value such number of Warrants that enables the participant to exercise the remaining Warrants to subscribe for shares  whereby the subscription proceeds are paid by way of set-off against the claim on sold Warrants. The Company shall also have the right  but no obligation  to acquire some or all Warrants at market value instead of subscription of shares in order to avoid dilution.Holders of Warrants whose employment is terminated or who wish to sell their Warrants shall offer the Company to acquire the Warrants at a price corresponding to the lowest of the premium paid for the Warrants at the time of acquisition and the market value.Allocation of WarrantsThe LTIP 2022 shall comprise of not more than approximately 12 senior executives and key individuals within the XVIVO group. The maximum number of Warrants per participant in the LTIP 2022 follows from the table below.Category Maximum number of Warrants per person Maximum number of Warrants per category CEO - category 1 20 000 20 000 Remaining senior executives and key individuals - category 2 10 000 110 000In the event of changes in positions and employments remaining Warrants in a category can be used in an alternative category.Costs for the incentive programmeThe Warrants which initially are transferred to participants in Sweden are made at a price corresponding to the Warrants' market value at the time of the transfer  which entails that no social security contributions will be incurred for the XVIVO group. Under the assumption that the LTIP 2022 is fully subscribed  the Company's subsidized one-time payments to the employees will amount to SEK 2 600 000 after two years and entail social security contributions of approximately SEK 1 300 000.The Warrants which are transferred to participants in other countries may incur social security contributions and expenses in accordance with the accounting principles set out in IFRS2.Costs for financial and legal advice in connection with the LTIP 2022 will amount to approximately SEK 250 000.As the Company's costs for LTIP 2022 will be relatively limited  the Board of Directors have resolved to propose to the annual general meeting to resolve to not cover these.DilutionBased on the outstanding number of shares in the Company  LTIP 2022 will upon exercise of all 130 000 Warrants increase the share capital by a maximum of SEK 3 323 and  at the time of the notice  entail a maximum dilution corresponding to approximately 0.4 percent of the total number of outstanding capital and number of votes in the Company. If all the outstanding incentive programmes in the Company are included in the calculation  at the time of the notice  the maximum dilution will amount to approximately 2.0 percent of the total number of outstanding capital and number of votes in the Company.Preparation of the proposalLTIP 2022 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with the remuneration committee and external advisers.The Board of Directors  or a special committee set up by the Board  shall be responsible for preparing the detailed design and administration of the terms and conditions of LTIP 2022  in accordance with the presented terms and guidelines including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in‑between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or similar measures. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet specific foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also be entitled to make other adjustments if significant changes occur in the XVIVO group or in its environment that would result in that the adopted terms for the LTIP 2022 no longer fulfils their objectives.15B. Directed issue of warrants  Series 2022/2025  to participantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 130 000 Warrants entitling to subscription for new shares  as a result of which the Company's share capital may increase by a maximum of SEK 3 323.The right to subscribe for the Warrants shall only vest with senior executives and key individuals within the XVIVO group with the right and obligation to manage the Warrants as described above. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one share. The Warrants will be acquired at market value assessed by the Company  which shall be determined by way of the Warrants being valued by an independent party in accordance with the Black & Scholes valuation model.Special authorisationsThe Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting instruct the Board of Directors to implement the decisions above and to ensure that the Board of Directors transfers the Warrants in accordance with what is stated above.The Board further proposes that the annual general meeting instruct the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Item 16 - Resolution to authorise the board of directors to resolve on new share issuesThe Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  to resolve on new share issues.The authorisation may be utilised for new issues of shares  which may be made with provisions regarding contribution in cash  in kind or through set-off corresponding to not more than 10 per cent of the registered share capital in the Company at the time of the issue resolution. The subscription price shall be determined on market terms and conditions. However  in order to enable delivery of shares in connection with a cash issue as described above  this may  if the Board of Directors deems it appropriate  be made at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares  whereby the issue is directed to an issuing agent that acts as a settlement bank for investors.Deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be possible in connection with future investments in the form of acquisitions of operations  companies  shares in companies or otherwise for the Company's future expansion. If the Board resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the rationale shall be that the Board shall be able to issue shares in the Company to be used as a means of in-kind payment or the right to offset debt or to in a flexible and cost-efficient manner raise capital to use as means of payment or to continuously adjust the Company's capital structure.The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to make any adjustments or amendments of the above resolution which may be required in connection with the registration of such resolution and to take any other measure deemed necessary for the execution of the resolution.Item 17 - Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of the Company's own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to acquire the Company's own shares. Shares may be acquired to the extent that the Company's holding of its own shares  on any occasion  does not exceed ten (10) per cent of the Company's total outstanding shares. Acquisitions of shares shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price interval registered at any given time  by which is meant the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash.

The guidelines encompass remuneration to the Board of Directors  the CEO and the executive management  however  these guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the Annual General Meeting.The Board of Directors shall be entitled to temporarily depart from these guidelines  in whole or in part  if special reasons justify doing so in an individual case and such deviation is necessary in order to meet the company's long-term interests or to ensure the company's financial viability. If such a departure occurs  it must be reported in the remuneration report before the next Annual General Meeting. The guidelines pertain to the period starting from the 2022 Annual General Meeting. Any issue regarding departure from the guidelines shall be prepared by the remuneration committee and decided by the Board of Directors.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interest and sustainabilityMycronic is a global high-tech company that develops  manufactures and supplies market-leading production equipment with high requirements on precision and flexibility to the electronics industry. Mycronic has three priorities within the framework of the company's long-term strategy. These are: consolidating the company's strong position within the Pattern Generators division; increasing or retaining profitability in the High Flex  High Volume and Global Technologies divisions; and increasing the company's proximity to customers. The strategy also includes creating value through a focus on sustainability.The Board of Directors considers that it is critical for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  that the company is able to recruit and retain members of the executive management with the competence and capacity to achieve specified goals. To this end  the company must offer competitive remuneration to motivate the executive management.

Total remuneration consists of base salary and variable pay  pension and other benefits. Long-term variable pay is excluded in the calculation of the total remuneration and the relative proportion of the remuneration components.Fixed remunerationIn establishing the base salary for the CEO and members of the executive management  the scope and complexity of the position in question  as well as the individual's performance is taken into account. The executive managements' salaries are  like the other components of remuneration  subject to annual review by the Remuneration Committee  with the support of external salary statistics ensure that the salaries remain competitive. The base salary constitutes a maximum of 65 percent of total remuneration in the event of a maximum outcome of short-term variable pay.Short-term variable remunerationThe remuneration is paid in accordance with goals achieved. The criteria  such as order intake or EBIT  are established in order to contribute to the company's business strategy  long-term interests and thus to the company's long-term value creation. The fulfillment of the criteria is determined through the company's audited annual accounts. Short-term variable pay can amount to a maximum of 110 percent of base salary and 55 percent of total remuneration. Variable pay shall not be pensionable  unless otherwise provided by mandatory law or obligations in applicable collective bargaining agreements. The outcome is prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board of Directors in connection with the end of the qualification period and the remuneration is thereafter paid out. The company has no contractual right to recover the remuneration.Long-term variable remunerationMembers of the executive management can be offered incentive programs  which mainly should be share or share price-related. An incentive program is intended to improve the participants' commitment to the company's development and shall be introduced on market-based terms.Resolutions on share or share price-related incentive programs must be passed at an Annual General Meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines.Other long-term remunerationThere are already existing agreements on long-term variable pay linked to continued employment for certain members of the executive management.BenefitsPensionMembers of the executive management employed in Sweden after 2012 are covered by the contribution-defined plan under ITP1. Members of the executive management employed prior to 1 January 2022 have a supplementary contribution-defined pension plan in addition to the ITP plan. The retirement age for members of the executive management employed in Sweden is 65 years. For members of the executive management employed outside of Sweden  locally competitive pension plans and retirement ages are applied.Other benefitsOther benefits e.g. car benefits and health care plans are established based on them being competitive in the local market.Pension and other benefits constitute a maximum of 40 percent of total remuneration in the event of a maximum outcome of short-term variable pay.Special adjustmentsRegarding employment conditions that are governed by rules other than those applying in Sweden  appropriate adjustments may be made in order to comply with such mandatory rules or local practice  whereby the overall purpose of these guidelines shall be met.Notice of termination and severance payThe employment or contractual agreements of members of the executive management shall be valid until further notice or for a specified period of time.For the CEO  in the event of termination by the company  a twelve months notice period and twelve months severance pay apply.For members of the executive management employed in Sweden  the mutual notice period is a maximum of six months. Upon termination by the company  six months' severance pay also applies. During notice period  the current employment contract runs with associated benefits. In cases where severance pay would be paid  no other benefits will be paid after the expiry of the notice period. For other members of the executive management who are locally employed outside of Sweden  employment or contractual agreements shall comply with mandatory rules applicable in the relevant jurisdiction or local practice  entailing that e.g. other term of the employment (or term of contract as the case may be)  other notice periods and other agreements on severance pay may be applicable in the individual case.Salary and terms of employmentIn preparing the Board of Directors' proposal for guidelines on remuneration to members of the executive management  the salaries and terms of employment for the company's other employees have been taken into account. Information about the executive managements' total remuneration  components of their remuneration  as well as increases in remuneration and rates of increase over time have been obtained and have constituted a part of the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' decision basis in their evaluation of the fairness of the guidelines and the limitations arising from them.The resolution processThe Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines when there is a need for significant changes to the guidelines  however at least every four years. The Board of Directors' proposal is prepared by the Remuneration Committee. The Chairman of the Board of Directors may also be Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. In order to manage conflicts of interest  other members of the Remuneration Committee who are elected by the Annual General Meeting must be independent in relation to the company and members of the executive management.The Remuneration Committee shall  inter alia  monitor and evaluate the application of the guidelines for remuneration to members of the executive management resolved by the Annual General Meeting. When the Remuneration Committee has prepared the proposal  it is submitted to the Board of Directors for decision. The CEO or other members of members of the executive management shall not be present while the Board of Directors addresses issues related to remuneration and passes resolutions about them  insofar as they are affected by the issues.If the Annual General Meeting resolves not to adopt guidelines when there is a proposal for such  the Board of Directors shall submit a new proposal no later than at the next Annual General Meeting. In such cases  remuneration shall be paid in accordance with the current guidelines or  if no guidelines exist  in accordance with the company's practice.External advisors are used in the preparation of these matters when deemed necessary.Review of the guidelinesThe guidelines for remuneration to members of the executive management were reviewed ahead of the 2022 Annual General Meeting  and did not result in any adjustments.Item 16: Proposal regarding composition of nomination committeeThe nomination committee proposes that a new nomination committee for the 2023 Annual General Meeting is appointed by the Chairman of the Board – at the latest by the end of the third quarter of 2022 – contacting the three largest or otherwise known shareholders per 31 August  2022. The term of office shall run until a new nomination committee commences its service.The composition of the nomination committee shall be published no later than six months before the company's Annual General Meeting.The responsibility of the nomination committee regarding the 2023 Annual General Meeting includes proposing (i) chairman of the meeting  (ii) the number of Board members  (iii) election of members of the Board and Chairman of the Board and remuneration to Board members and the Chairman of the Board and remuneration to members of Board committees  (iv) election of auditor and remuneration to auditor and (v) the process for appointment of a new nomination committee.The nomination committee proposes that the Annual General Meeting decides that the instruction to the nomination committee shall be the same as last year.Item 17: The Board of Directors' proposal on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve to issue new sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors up until the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to issue new shares  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. Shares may be paid in kind  through set-off or with other conditions set forth in Chapter 13  Section 5  first paragraph item 6 in the Swedish Companies Act. The Board of Directors may otherwise set the terms of such share issuance.

The issue price shall be determined on marketable grounds and the number of issued shares may not exceed ten percent of the total amount of outstanding shares in the company per the day of this notice.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and the right to decide on payment through set-off  in kind or other condition as set forth in the Swedish Companies Act is to enable the company to issue shares in order to acquire shares  business or product rights.Majority requirementsA valid resolution under item 17 above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.Item 18: The Board of Directors' proposal on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve for the company to acquire the company's own sharesThe Board of Directors shall be authorized  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to decide to acquire the company's own shares in accordance with the following.Acquisition may only be made by a maximum of so many shares that  at any given time  the company's own holdings do not exceed five percent of all shares in the company Acquisition of shares in the company may only be made on Nasdaq Stockholm (the ""Exchange"") Acquisition of shares on the Exchange may only take place at a price within the price range recorded on the Exchange at any given time The payment for the shares shall be paid in cash The authorization may be used on one or several occasions up until the end of the 2023 Annual General MeetingThe purpose of the above authorizations to acquire shares is to enable delivery of shares to participants in LTIP 2022 (the introduction of a new long term incentive program  LTIP 2022  is subject to a separate resolution in item 19 in the notice for the 2022 Annual General Meeting) and to be able to continuously adjust the company's capital structure to the company's capital requirements.Shares that have been acquired by the company and which have not been reserved in order to secure the company's delivery of shares under LTIP 2022 are intended to be canceled following a resolution thereof at the 2023 Annual General Meeting.Majority requirementsA valid resolution under item 18 above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.Item 19: The Board of Directors' proposal regarding Long Term Incentive Program 2022 (LTIP 2022)Mycronic's Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting passes a resolution on the implementation of a Long Term Incentive Program 2022 (LTIP 2022). This proposal is divided into four items:A. Terms of LTIP 2022B. Transfer of the company's own shares under LTIP 2022 and hedging activitiesC. Hedging of LTIP 2022 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyD. Other matters related to LTIP 2022A. Terms of LTIP 2022A.1 IntroductionThe Board wishes to establish a long-term incentive program for certain key employees in order to encourage personal long-term ownership of Mycronic shares as well as to increase and enhance its ability to recruit  retain and motivate employees. The Board therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance share program 2022 (""LTIP 2022""). The intention is also to use LTIP 2021 to unite the interest of the employees with the interests of shareholders.Participants may  after a qualifying period  receive allotments of Mycronic ordinary shares without consideration. The number of allotted shares will depend on the fulfilment of certain performance targets. The term of LTIP 2022 is more than three years.A.2 Basic features of LTIP 2022The LTIP 2022 will be directed towards certain key employees in the Mycronic Group. The participants are based in Sweden and other countries where the Mycronic Group is active. Each participant may be entitled  after a certain qualification period (defined below)  provided continued employment during the entire period (except from ""Good Leavers"")  and depending on the fulfilment of certain performance targets linked to Mycronic's Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")  to receive allotment of Mycronic shares (""Performance Shares""). The participant shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares. Performance Shares are Mycronic ordinary shares.A.3 Participation in LTIP 2022LTIP 2022 is directed towards a maximum of 70 employees  divided in three categories of participants:Category Maximum number of shares per personA) CEO (maximum 1 person) 8 900B) Management Group (maximum 10 persons) 3 400C) Other key employees (maximum 59 persons) 1 400Any resolution on participation or implementation of LTIP 2022 shall be conditional on that it  in the Board's judgement  can be offered with reasonable administrative costs and financial effects.A.4 Allotment of Performance SharesAllotment of Performance Shares within LTIP 2022 will be made during a limited period of time following the Annual General Meeting 2025. The period up to this date is referred to as the qualification period (vesting period). A condition for the participant to receive allotment of Performance Shares is that the participant remains an employee of the Mycronic Group during the full qualification period up until allotment. Allotment of Performance Shares also requires that the EPS performance targets are fulfilled. The Board shall establish a customary definition of Good Leavers and determine whether any allocation shall be made to participants who are considered Good Leavers.The performance target is Mycronic's EPS and the performance target shall be established by the Board. Partial fulfilment of the performance targets will result in partial allotment of Performance Shares. Performance under a certain level will result in no allotment. The EPS targets and the outcome will be communicated to the shareholders after the allotment of Performance Shares to participants.Prior to the allotment of Performance Shares  the Board shall assess whether the allotment is reasonable in relation to the company's financial results  position and performance  as well as other factors.If significant changes take place within the Mycronic Group  or on the market  which  by the assessment of the Board  would mean that the terms for allocation/transfer of shares according to LTIP 2022 is no longer reasonable  the Board shall have the right to implement an adjustment to LTIP 2022  including  among others  the right to reduce the number of Performance Shares allocated/transferred  or not to allocate/transfer Performance Shares at all.A.5 Implementation and administration etceteraThe Board  with the assistance of the remuneration committee  shall in accordance with the resolutions by the Annual General Meeting set forth herein be responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2022. The Board may also decide on the implementation of an alternative cash based incentive for participants in countries where the allotment of Performance Shares is not appropriate  as well as if otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTIP 2022.The intention is that the Board shall launch LTIP 2022 as soon as practically possible after the Annual General Meeting.In the event that the general meeting does not resolve in accordance with item B with the required majority  the Company shall hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party in accordance with what is stated in item C below.B. Transfer of the company's own shares under LTIP 2022 and hedging activities.B1. Number of sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that transfer of up to 125 500 Mycronic shares under LTIP 2022 may be made in accordance with the below. The number of shares is calculated on the basis of maximum participation and maximum fulfilment of performance requirements.B2. Other conditions for transfer of Mycronic sharesMycronic shares may be transferred to the participants in LTIP 2022.Share transfers to participants in LTIP 2022 shall be made without the participants paying consideration and shall be carried out at the time and subject to the other conditions under which participants in LTIP 2022 have the right to be allotted shares.The number of Mycronic shares that might be transferred under LTIP 2022 shall be subject to customary re-calculation principles and may  consequently  be subject to re-calculation due to a bonus issue  share split  dividends and/or other similar events. Resolutions resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting 2022 shall not be included in a re-calculation of the number of shares.B.3 Grounds for the Board's proposal and alternative hedging via an equity swap agreement with a third party etceteraSince the Board believes that the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer Mycronic shares under LTIP 2022 is obtained through transfer of own shares  the Board proposes that transfers are secured as described above in this item B. Should the necessary majority not be obtained for the proposal in item B  the Board will enter into a share swap agreement  in accordance with item C below.Share swap agreement will also be relevant should this be more appropriate  for example due to the fact that the acquisition of own shares cannot be made to the extent required to be able to transfer shares under LTIP 2022.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights to acquire the own shares is that the company shall be able to secure the delivery of shares under LTIP 2022.C. Hedge of LTIP 2022 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyIn the event that the necessary majority is not obtained for item B above  the company will hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer shares in the company under LTIP 2022. The relevant number of shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed under item B above. The cost of hedging by entering into an equity swap agreement  excluding any dividends and without regard to the development of Mycronic's share price  exceeds SEK 1 million during the term of the program.D. Other matters in relation to LTIP 2022D.1 Majority requirements etc.The resolution according to item A above shall require a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. A valid resolution under item B above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.D.2 Estimated costs  expenses and financial effects of LTIP 2022LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the share awards should be expensed as personnel costs over the qualification period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security contributions will be recognized as an expense in the income statement through regular provisions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The amount of these regular provisions will be revalued in line with the trend in the value of the right to Performance Shares  and the contributions payable on the allotment of Performance Shares.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 178  and that the performance targets are achieved so that 50 percent of the maximum number of Performance Shares vest  including a share price increase of 50 percent during the qualification period and an annual employee turnover of 5 percent  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to SEK 14.1 million before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of SEK 4.7 million before tax.Assuming that the performance targets are achieved so that 100 percent of the maximum number of Performance Shares vest  and otherwise the same assumptions as above  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to SEK 28.2 million before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of SEK 9.4 million before tax.LTIP 2022 will comprise maximum 125 500 shares in total  which corresponds to 0.13 percent of the total outstanding shares and votes in the company on a fully diluted basis.The above calculations are based on a decision on hedging in accordance with item B.In the view of the Board  the positive effects expected to arise from LTIP 2022  outweigh the costs associated with LTIP 2022.D.3 The Board's explanatory statementAn individual long-term ownership commitment among the participants in LTIP 2022 is expected to stimulate greater interest and motivation in the company's business operations  results and strategy. Moreover  the Board wishes to increase the ability of Mycronic to retain important key employees. The Board believes that the implementation of LTIP 2022 will benefit Mycronic and its shareholders. LTIP 2022 will provide a competitive and motivation-improving incentive for executives and other key employees within the Group.LTIP 2022 has been designed to reward the participants for increased shareholder value by allotting shares  based on the fulfilment of conditions in respect of results and operations. By linking the employees' remuneration to the development of Mycronic's results and value  the long-term value growth of Mycronic is rewarded. Based on these circumstances  the Board considers that the implementation of LTIP 2022 will have a positive effect on the Mycronic Group's continued development  and will therefore be beneficial to the shareholders and Mycronic.D.4 Other share-related incentive programsThe company's share-related incentive programs are described on pages 49-51 in the company's annual report.D.5 Adjustment AuthorizationThe Board  or a person appointed by the Board  shall be authorized to make adjustments to the above resolutions that may be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB respectively.D.6 Preparation of the itemThe basis for LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the Board of the company. The work has been supported by external advisors and has been made in consultation with shareholders. The Board has thereafter decided to present this proposal for the general meeting. Except for the staff that have prepared the matter upon instruction from the Board  no employee that may be a participant of LTIP 2022 has participated in the preparations of the program's terms.The financial statements and the audit report regarding the financial year 2021  as well as the nomination committee's and the Board of Director's complete proposals including related documentation will be available at the company at Nytorpsvägen 9 in Täby not later than by 14 April 2022  on the company website and will also be sent by post to shareholders requesting so and stating their postal address. The same applies to the Board of Directors report in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551) and the auditor's opinion in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 54 of the same law.The total number of shares and votes in the company amounts to 97 916 509. The company does not hold any of these shares. Shareholders are reminded of the right to  at the Annual General Meeting  ask questions to the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act  Chapter 7  Section 32.For information on how your personal data is processed  please see https://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfTäby in March 2022Mycronic AB (publ)The Board of DirectorsN.B.

(the ""Stock Option Program 2022/2025"")  which materially has the same structure as the stock option programs adopted by the Annual General Meeting in 2019 (""Stock Option Program 2019/2022"") and the Annual General Meeting 2020 (""Stock Option Program 2020/2023"").The objective of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is to link a portion of the employees' remuneration to INVISIO's long-term performance and value creation for the shareholders. Thereby the long-term interests of the employees aligns with the interests of the shareholders. In addition  the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 will be an important tool for INVISIO to recruit  retain and motivate the company's employees and the board considers the program beneficial for both INVISIO and its shareholders in the coming years. Board members elected by the general meeting are not allowed to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.A. ADOPTION OF THE PROGRAM1. The Stock Option Program 2022/2025 in briefAll INVISIO group employees shall be entitled to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.Based on performance  position and the employee's importance to the INVISIO group  the employees will be granted stock options which entitle the participants to acquire shares in INVISIO during 2025  subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 (the ""Stock Options""). If the participant (i) throughout the entire vesting period of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  which runs from the allotment of the Stock Option up to and including 8 May 2025 (the ""Vesting Period"")  with certain exceptions  is employed by the INVISIO group and (ii) to the extent the performance based criteria for the Stock Options has been reached during 6 May 2022 – 8 May 2025 (the ""Measurement Period"")  the participants will be entitled to acquire shares in INVISIO during May – June 2025.To ensure INVISIO's undertaking to deliver shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  the board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 700 000 warrants (each warrant entitles to subscription for one (1) share in INVISIO) to a wholly-owned Danish subsidiary  INVISIO A/S (the ""Subsidiary""). To such extent the performance criteria of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is reached  the warrants shall be exercised to deliver shares in INVISIO to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.2. CostsPursuant to IFRS 2  the Stock Options are to be recorded as a personnel expense during the Vesting Period and should be reported directly against equity. Based on the assumption of a share price of SEK 160 at the time of allotment and calculated by using the Black & Scholes and Monte Carlo methods  the estimated total reported cost for the Stock Options is approx. SEK 13.8 million for the period 2022/2025.In the event of a positive price trend  social security costs will arise due to the Stock Options. These costs shall be written off during the tenor of the Stock Options based on the value changes of the Stock Options.Based on the assumption that all 700 000 Stock Options will be exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO on 15 May 2025  and the INVISIO share price increases with 30 per cent and outperforms the SIXPRX Index (see definition below in item 5.5) by 20 percentage points during the Vesting Period  the social security costs are estimated to be approx. SEK 3.0 million. The costs are continuously reviewed during the Vesting Period.3. Dilution and effects on important key ratiosUp to 700 000 Stock Options may be issued to the participants in the program. The maximum number of shares in INVISIO which may be subscribed for in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is 700 000  corresponding to an increase of the share capital of a maximum of SEK 700 000. Based on the current number of outstanding shares  the maximum dilution resulting from the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 will be approx. 1.5 per cent of outstanding shares and votes  provided that all Stock Options are exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO.

The guidelines encompass remuneration to the Board of Directors  the CEO and the executive management  however  these guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the Annual General Meeting.The Board of Directors shall be entitled to temporarily depart from these guidelines  in whole or in part  if special reasons justify doing so in an individual case and such deviation is necessary in order to meet the company's long-term interests or to ensure the company's financial viability. If such a departure occurs  it must be reported in the remuneration report before the next Annual General Meeting. The guidelines pertain to the period starting from the 2022 Annual General Meeting. Any issue regarding departure from the guidelines shall be prepared by the remuneration committee and decided by the Board of Directors.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interest and sustainabilityMycronic is a global high-tech company that develops  manufactures and supplies market-leading production equipment with high requirements on precision and flexibility to the electronics industry. Mycronic has three priorities within the framework of the company's long-term strategy. These are: consolidating the company's strong position within the Pattern Generators division; increasing or retaining profitability in the High Flex  High Volume and Global Technologies divisions; and increasing the company's proximity to customers. The strategy also includes creating value through a focus on sustainability.The Board of Directors considers that it is critical for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  that the company is able to recruit and retain members of the executive management with the competence and capacity to achieve specified goals. To this end  the company must offer competitive remuneration to motivate the executive management.

Long-term variable pay is excluded in the calculation of the total remuneration and the relative proportion of the remuneration components.Fixed remunerationIn establishing the base salary for the CEO and members of the executive management  the scope and complexity of the position in question  as well as the individual's performance is taken into account. The executive managements' salaries are  like the other components of remuneration  subject to annual review by the Remuneration Committee  with the support of external salary statistics ensure that the salaries remain competitive. The base salary constitutes a maximum of 65 percent of total remuneration in the event of a maximum outcome of short-term variable pay.Short-term variable remunerationThe remuneration is paid in accordance with goals achieved. The criteria  such as order intake or EBIT  are established in order to contribute to the company's business strategy  long-term interests and thus to the company's long-term value creation. The fulfillment of the criteria is determined through the company's audited annual accounts. Short-term variable pay can amount to a maximum of 110 percent of base salary and 55 percent of total remuneration. Variable pay shall not be pensionable  unless otherwise provided by mandatory law or obligations in applicable collective bargaining agreements. The outcome is prepared by the Remuneration Committee and approved by the Board of Directors in connection with the end of the qualification period and the remuneration is thereafter paid out. The company has no contractual right to recover the remuneration.Long-term variable remunerationMembers of the executive management can be offered incentive programs  which mainly should be share or share price-related. An incentive program is intended to improve the participants' commitment to the company's development and shall be introduced on market-based terms.Resolutions on share or share price-related incentive programs must be passed at an Annual General Meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines.Other long-term remunerationThere are already existing agreements on long-term variable pay linked to continued employment for certain members of the executive management.BenefitsPensionMembers of the executive management employed in Sweden after 2012 are covered by the contribution-defined plan under ITP1. Members of the executive management employed prior to 1 January 2022 have a supplementary contribution-defined pension plan in addition to the ITP plan. The retirement age for members of the executive management employed in Sweden is 65 years. For members of the executive management employed outside of Sweden  locally competitive pension plans and retirement ages are applied.Other benefitsOther benefits e.g. car benefits and health care plans are established based on them being competitive in the local market.Pension and other benefits constitute a maximum of 40 percent of total remuneration in the event of a maximum outcome of short-term variable pay.Special adjustmentsRegarding employment conditions that are governed by rules other than those applying in Sweden  appropriate adjustments may be made in order to comply with such mandatory rules or local practice  whereby the overall purpose of these guidelines shall be met.Notice of termination and severance payThe employment or contractual agreements of members of the executive management shall be valid until further notice or for a specified period of time.For the CEO  in the event of termination by the company  a twelve months notice period and twelve months severance pay apply.For members of the executive management employed in Sweden  the mutual notice period is a maximum of six months.

In cases where severance pay would be paid  no other benefits will be paid after the expiry of the notice period. For other members of the executive management who are locally employed outside of Sweden  employment or contractual agreements shall comply with mandatory rules applicable in the relevant jurisdiction or local practice  entailing that e.g. other term of the employment (or term of contract as the case may be)  other notice periods and other agreements on severance pay may be applicable in the individual case.Salary and terms of employmentIn preparing the Board of Directors' proposal for guidelines on remuneration to members of the executive management  the salaries and terms of employment for the company's other employees have been taken into account. Information about the executive managements' total remuneration  components of their remuneration  as well as increases in remuneration and rates of increase over time have been obtained and have constituted a part of the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' decision basis in their evaluation of the fairness of the guidelines and the limitations arising from them.The resolution processThe Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines when there is a need for significant changes to the guidelines  however at least every four years. The Board of Directors' proposal is prepared by the Remuneration Committee. The Chairman of the Board of Directors may also be Chairman of the Remuneration Committee. In order to manage conflicts of interest  other members of the Remuneration Committee who are elected by the Annual General Meeting must be independent in relation to the company and members of the executive management.The Remuneration Committee shall  inter alia  monitor and evaluate the application of the guidelines for remuneration to members of the executive management resolved by the Annual General Meeting. When the Remuneration Committee has prepared the proposal  it is submitted to the Board of Directors for decision. The CEO or other members of members of the executive management shall not be present while the Board of Directors addresses issues related to remuneration and passes resolutions about them  insofar as they are affected by the issues.If the Annual General Meeting resolves not to adopt guidelines when there is a proposal for such  the Board of Directors shall submit a new proposal no later than at the next Annual General Meeting. In such cases  remuneration shall be paid in accordance with the current guidelines or  if no guidelines exist  in accordance with the company's practice.External advisors are used in the preparation of these matters when deemed necessary.Review of the guidelinesThe guidelines for remuneration to members of the executive management were reviewed ahead of the 2022 Annual General Meeting  and did not result in any adjustments.Item 16: Proposal regarding composition of nomination committeeThe nomination committee proposes that a new nomination committee for the 2023 Annual General Meeting is appointed by the Chairman of the Board – at the latest by the end of the third quarter of 2022 – contacting the three largest or otherwise known shareholders per 31 August  2022. The term of office shall run until a new nomination committee commences its service.The composition of the nomination committee shall be published no later than six months before the company's Annual General Meeting.The responsibility of the nomination committee regarding the 2023 Annual General Meeting includes proposing (i) chairman of the meeting  (ii) the number of Board members  (iii) election of members of the Board and Chairman of the Board and remuneration to Board members and the Chairman of the Board and remuneration to members of Board committees  (iv) election of auditor and remuneration to auditor and (v) the process for appointment of a new nomination committee.The nomination committee proposes that the Annual General Meeting decides that the instruction to the nomination committee shall be the same as last year.Item 17: The Board of Directors' proposal on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve to issue new sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors up until the end of the 2023 Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to issue new shares  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. Shares may be paid in kind  through set-off or with other conditions set forth in Chapter 13  Section 5  first paragraph item 6 in the Swedish Companies Act. The Board of Directors may otherwise set the terms of such share issuance. The authorization shall however not comprise a right for the Board to issue shares against cash payment and with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The issue price shall be determined on marketable grounds and the number of issued shares may not exceed ten percent of the total amount of outstanding shares in the company per the day of this notice.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and the right to decide on payment through set-off  in kind or other condition as set forth in the Swedish Companies Act is to enable the company to issue shares in order to acquire shares  business or product rights.Majority requirementsA valid resolution under item 17 above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.Item 18: The Board of Directors' proposal on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve for the company to acquire the company's own sharesThe Board of Directors shall be authorized  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to decide to acquire the company's own shares in accordance with the following.Acquisition may only be made by a maximum of so many shares that  at any given time  the company's own holdings do not exceed five percent of all shares in the company Acquisition of shares in the company may only be made on Nasdaq Stockholm (the ""Exchange"") Acquisition of shares on the Exchange may only take place at a price within the price range recorded on the Exchange at any given time The payment for the shares shall be paid in cash The authorization may be used on one or several occasions up until the end of the 2023 Annual General MeetingThe purpose of the above authorizations to acquire shares is to enable delivery of shares to participants in LTIP 2022 (the introduction of a new long term incentive program  LTIP 2022  is subject to a separate resolution in item 19 in the notice for the 2022 Annual General Meeting) and to be able to continuously adjust the company's capital structure to the company's capital requirements.Shares that have been acquired by the company and which have not been reserved in order to secure the company's delivery of shares under LTIP 2022 are intended to be canceled following a resolution thereof at the 2023 Annual General Meeting.Majority requirementsA valid resolution under item 18 above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.Item 19: The Board of Directors' proposal regarding Long Term Incentive Program 2022 (LTIP 2022)Mycronic's Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting passes a resolution on the implementation of a Long Term Incentive Program 2022 (LTIP 2022). This proposal is divided into four items:A. Terms of LTIP 2022B. Transfer of the company's own shares under LTIP 2022 and hedging activitiesC. Hedging of LTIP 2022 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyD. Other matters related to LTIP 2022A. Terms of LTIP 2022A.1 IntroductionThe Board wishes to establish a long-term incentive program for certain key employees in order to encourage personal long-term ownership of Mycronic shares as well as to increase and enhance its ability to recruit  retain and motivate employees. The Board therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance share program 2022 (""LTIP 2022""). The intention is also to use LTIP 2021 to unite the interest of the employees with the interests of shareholders.Participants may  after a qualifying period  receive allotments of Mycronic ordinary shares without consideration. The number of allotted shares will depend on the fulfilment of certain performance targets. The term of LTIP 2022 is more than three years.A.2 Basic features of LTIP 2022The LTIP 2022 will be directed towards certain key employees in the Mycronic Group. The participants are based in Sweden and other countries where the Mycronic Group is active. Each participant may be entitled  after a certain qualification period (defined below)  provided continued employment during the entire period (except from ""Good Leavers"")  and depending on the fulfilment of certain performance targets linked to Mycronic's Earnings Per Share (""EPS"")  to receive allotment of Mycronic shares (""Performance Shares""). The participant shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares. Performance Shares are Mycronic ordinary shares.A.3 Participation in LTIP 2022LTIP 2022 is directed towards a maximum of 70 employees  divided in three categories of participants:Category Maximum number of shares per personA) CEO (maximum 1 person) 8 900B) Management Group (maximum 10 persons) 3 400C) Other key employees (maximum 59 persons) 1 400Any resolution on participation or implementation of LTIP 2022 shall be conditional on that it  in the Board's judgement  can be offered with reasonable administrative costs and financial effects.A.4 Allotment of Performance SharesAllotment of Performance Shares within LTIP 2022 will be made during a limited period of time following the Annual General Meeting 2025. The period up to this date is referred to as the qualification period (vesting period). A condition for the participant to receive allotment of Performance Shares is that the participant remains an employee of the Mycronic Group during the full qualification period up until allotment. Allotment of Performance Shares also requires that the EPS performance targets are fulfilled. The Board shall establish a customary definition of Good Leavers and determine whether any allocation shall be made to participants who are considered Good Leavers.The performance target is Mycronic's EPS and the performance target shall be established by the Board. Partial fulfilment of the performance targets will result in partial allotment of Performance Shares. Performance under a certain level will result in no allotment. The EPS targets and the outcome will be communicated to the shareholders after the allotment of Performance Shares to participants.Prior to the allotment of Performance Shares  the Board shall assess whether the allotment is reasonable in relation to the company's financial results  position and performance  as well as other factors.If significant changes take place within the Mycronic Group  or on the market  which  by the assessment of the Board  would mean that the terms for allocation/transfer of shares according to LTIP 2022 is no longer reasonable  the Board shall have the right to implement an adjustment to LTIP 2022  including  among others  the right to reduce the number of Performance Shares allocated/transferred  or not to allocate/transfer Performance Shares at all.A.5 Implementation and administration etceteraThe Board  with the assistance of the remuneration committee  shall in accordance with the resolutions by the Annual General Meeting set forth herein be responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2022. The Board may also decide on the implementation of an alternative cash based incentive for participants in countries where the allotment of Performance Shares is not appropriate  as well as if otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTIP 2022.The intention is that the Board shall launch LTIP 2022 as soon as practically possible after the Annual General Meeting.In the event that the general meeting does not resolve in accordance with item B with the required majority  the Company shall hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party in accordance with what is stated in item C below.B. Transfer of the company's own shares under LTIP 2022 and hedging activities.B1. Number of sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that transfer of up to 125 500 Mycronic shares under LTIP 2022 may be made in accordance with the below. The number of shares is calculated on the basis of maximum participation and maximum fulfilment of performance requirements.B2. Other conditions for transfer of Mycronic sharesMycronic shares may be transferred to the participants in LTIP 2022.Share transfers to participants in LTIP 2022 shall be made without the participants paying consideration and shall be carried out at the time and subject to the other conditions under which participants in LTIP 2022 have the right to be allotted shares.The number of Mycronic shares that might be transferred under LTIP 2022 shall be subject to customary re-calculation principles and may  consequently  be subject to re-calculation due to a bonus issue  share split  dividends and/or other similar events. Resolutions resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting 2022 shall not be included in a re-calculation of the number of shares.B.3 Grounds for the Board's proposal and alternative hedging via an equity swap agreement with a third party etceteraSince the Board believes that the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer Mycronic shares under LTIP 2022 is obtained through transfer of own shares  the Board proposes that transfers are secured as described above in this item B. Should the necessary majority not be obtained for the proposal in item B  the Board will enter into a share swap agreement  in accordance with item C below.Share swap agreement will also be relevant should this be more appropriate  for example due to the fact that the acquisition of own shares cannot be made to the extent required to be able to transfer shares under LTIP 2022.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights to acquire the own shares is that the company shall be able to secure the delivery of shares under LTIP 2022.C. Hedge of LTIP 2022 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyIn the event that the necessary majority is not obtained for item B above  the company will hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer shares in the company under LTIP 2022. The relevant number of shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed under item B above. The cost of hedging by entering into an equity swap agreement  excluding any dividends and without regard to the development of Mycronic's share price  exceeds SEK 1 million during the term of the program.D. Other matters in relation to LTIP 2022D.1 Majority requirements etc.The resolution according to item A above shall require a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. A valid resolution under item B above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution.D.2 Estimated costs  expenses and financial effects of LTIP 2022LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the share awards should be expensed as personnel costs over the qualification period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security contributions will be recognized as an expense in the income statement through regular provisions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The amount of these regular provisions will be revalued in line with the trend in the value of the right to Performance Shares  and the contributions payable on the allotment of Performance Shares.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 178  and that the performance targets are achieved so that 50 percent of the maximum number of Performance Shares vest  including a share price increase of 50 percent during the qualification period and an annual employee turnover of 5 percent  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to SEK 14.1 million before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of SEK 4.7 million before tax.Assuming that the performance targets are achieved so that 100 percent of the maximum number of Performance Shares vest  and otherwise the same assumptions as above  the total cost for LTIP 2022  including social security costs  is estimated to SEK 28.2 million before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of SEK 9.4 million before tax.LTIP 2022 will comprise maximum 125 500 shares in total  which corresponds to 0.13 percent of the total outstanding shares and votes in the company on a fully diluted basis.The above calculations are based on a decision on hedging in accordance with item B.In the view of the Board  the positive effects expected to arise from LTIP 2022  outweigh the costs associated with LTIP 2022.D.3 The Board's explanatory statementAn individual long-term ownership commitment among the participants in LTIP 2022 is expected to stimulate greater interest and motivation in the company's business operations  results and strategy. Moreover  the Board wishes to increase the ability of Mycronic to retain important key employees. The Board believes that the implementation of LTIP 2022 will benefit Mycronic and its shareholders. LTIP 2022 will provide a competitive and motivation-improving incentive for executives and other key employees within the Group.LTIP 2022 has been designed to reward the participants for increased shareholder value by allotting shares  based on the fulfilment of conditions in respect of results and operations. By linking the employees' remuneration to the development of Mycronic's results and value  the long-term value growth of Mycronic is rewarded. Based on these circumstances  the Board considers that the implementation of LTIP 2022 will have a positive effect on the Mycronic Group's continued development  and will therefore be beneficial to the shareholders and Mycronic.D.4 Other share-related incentive programsThe company's share-related incentive programs are described on pages 49-51 in the company's annual report.D.5 Adjustment AuthorizationThe Board  or a person appointed by the Board  shall be authorized to make adjustments to the above resolutions that may be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB respectively.D.6 Preparation of the itemThe basis for LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the Board of the company. The work has been supported by external advisors and has been made in consultation with shareholders. The Board has thereafter decided to present this proposal for the general meeting. Except for the staff that have prepared the matter upon instruction from the Board  no employee that may be a participant of LTIP 2022 has participated in the preparations of the program's terms.The financial statements and the audit report regarding the financial year 2021  as well as the nomination committee's and the Board of Director's complete proposals including related documentation will be available at the company at Nytorpsvägen 9 in Täby not later than by 14 April 2022  on the company website and will also be sent by post to shareholders requesting so and stating their postal address. The same applies to the Board of Directors report in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551) and the auditor's opinion in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 54 of the same law.The total number of shares and votes in the company amounts to 97 916 509. The company does not hold any of these shares. Shareholders are reminded of the right to  at the Annual General Meeting  ask questions to the Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act  Chapter 7  Section 32.For information on how your personal data is processed  please see https://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfTäby in March 2022Mycronic AB (publ)The Board of DirectorsN.B.

The 2022 Axway API Adoption Survey  a commissioned …,"PHOENIX--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Axway (Euronext: AXW.PA)  an API Management leader  finds in a new study that APIs offer a valuable return on investment – but only if organizations drive consumption of their APIs.The 2022 Axway API Adoption Survey  a commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting in December 2021 on behalf of Axway  analysts surveyed more than 300 IT and business decision-makers tasked with driving digital business at global organizations.72% of respondents say they expect an estimated 26.4% digital business growth on average if they could increase API adoption.However  there’s still a significant gap between API development and API consumption: 71% of those surveyed said they didn't achieve the business results planned from their APIs – often due to a lack of API adoption  UX issues  as well as lack of API performance metrics and related insights.“Many enterprises are enthusiastic about APIs  but it’s essential to focus on creating the right APIs  ones that will deliver business value. What people often lack is a holistic view of their APIs to make data-driven decisions ” says Axway Chief Catalyst Brian Pagano.86% of API decision-makers agree the value of their APIs is not in their existence alone  but in their consumption. 59% have seen or expect to see increased revenue from API traffic if they had an API management product that closes the gap between development and consumption.Yet companies often face cultural challenges as well as technological obstacles  both internally (legacy systems  IT complexity  inflexible processes  slow API adoption) and externally (complicated partner onboarding).“By improving the efficiency and effectiveness of our API development and management process  we’re cutting the time it takes from ideation to service deployment — helping us to bring value-added services to our customers faster than ever ” said Jim Cornelius  Vice President  Solution Architect at Robert W. Baird & Co.“If there are any challenges with API consumption or authentication  the Amplify API Management Platform allows us to troubleshoot them and get to the root cause rapidly "" adds Cornelius.“The right API management platform helps close the gap between development and usage through centralized  automated governance  leading to increased revenue and more valuable APIs – not to mention a decrease in API complexity ” said Pagano.Outcomes may be helped by experts who specialize in digital transformation and API technology. Axway Catalysts  for example  advise organizations looking to align their API strategy with larger  transformative business goals. As the study highlights  this kind of vendor expertise and support can help make the cultural shift required to truly leverage the power and promise of APIs.Join us for a webinar discussing the findings and what this means for companies looking to drive business with APIs.

Pomacle is at the heart of a new and fully French renewable isododecane production chain. Its commercial launch will take place under the “Isonaturane® 12” brand at In-Cosmetics in Paris in early April. The Company is accelerating its scale-up trajectory and reaffirming its ambitions in aviation biofuels.Start of commercial production in PomacleThe Company’s first commercial unit  located on the ARD site in Pomacle-Bazancourt  near Reims  has begun production on schedule. The first batches of biosourced isobutene have been manufactured at this unit in March 2022.This new and fully French production chain  using raw materials sourced locally  was established thanks to developments in the manufacturing process  which now relies on subcontractors both upstream (industrial fermentation) and downstream (green chemistry).Participation in the In-Cosmetics trade showTo promote this emerging sector  Global Bioenergies is to exhibit its flagship ingredient at In-Cosmetics from 5 to 7 April. In-Cosmetics is the world’s leading trade show for cosmetic ingredients. Isonaturane® 12 will be marketed to the big names in cosmetics and major manufacturers in the field.Daphne Galvez  Global Bioenergies Head of Sales  said: “In-Cosmetics is a great place to showcase innovations and the ideal venue to launch a new ingredient on the market. It will represent a new milestone for Global Bioenergies: Isonaturane® 12 has cleared all the regulatory hurdles. It has been validated at market scale with our LAST® make-up brand  the first in the world to combine longwear  waterproof and no transfer properties with natural origin. Our aim is now to distribute this innovative ingredient to players in the field  in order to help them convert their make-up ranges to naturalness without any compromise on performance. The start-up of the new unit will enable us to respond to sampling requests from numerous prospects  and complete referencing procedures prior to the commercial delivery of material in the second half of 2022.”Story continuesAccelerated scale-up prospectsThe success of the unit’s start-up without any major difficulties means that the scale-up schedule can be accelerated: the Company now expects to reach full capacity by the end of 2022  rather than over 18 months as initially projected. That will take the unit’s isobutene annual production capacity to 100 tonnes. The isobutene will then be converted into isododecane for the make-up ingredients market.The scale-up to 1 000 tonnes  planned for late 2024 or early 2025  is starting to look like a realistic prospect. The aim will be to target the broader dermo-cosmetics and hair care markets. That will put Global Bioenergies in a strong position to target the much larger aviation biofuels market by 2026 or 2027. Using the ingredient in this sector will bring a significant environmental impact (CO 2 reductions)  while at the same time helping reduce Europe’s energy dependency.Marc Delcourt  Chief Executive Officer of Global Bioenergies  said: “The fight against global warming and the quest to achieve Europe’s strategic challenges have become central concerns across the board  and remind us of the relevance of the Company’s strategy and investments since its creation in 2008. Our target markets  cosmetic ingredients in the short term and aviation biofuels in the medium term  are booming: the number of potential customers is increasing rapidly  as are the potential competitors for our Company. We can now state that our process  patiently developed over more than 10 years  is unique and offers specific and decisive advantages that will enable us to compete in the cosmetic ingredients market. In the aviation biofuels market  it will be necessary to improve performance further  but we believe that to be achievable within 12 to 24 months. We will then boast the best fermentation process in the world to decarbonise air transport.”About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies has developed a process to convert plant-derived resources into a family of compounds used in the cosmetics industry as well as the energy and materials sectors. In 2021  the Group entered the market with the launch of LAST®  its own make-up brand with formulas based on a key ingredient produced via its technology. The Company is constantly seeking to enhance the performance of its process while gradually ramping up production capacities in order to supply ingredients to major cosmetics manufacturers  thereby promoting naturalness in the industry whilst improving its carbon footprint.

I am proud of the team maintaining their focus on execution while operating in a challenging market environment. We reached numerous milestones in 2021 and feel we are well positioned to further build on this momentum in 2022 ” commented Olivier Taelman  Nyxoah’s Chief Executive Officer. “Through the BETTER SLEEP study results  we are now able to offer an effective solution for CCC patients with an expanded CE mark indication in Europe  and we are working hard to initiate a CCC-focused IDE trial in the US. Particularly encouraging are the strong responder rates in all patient cohorts  further increasing our confidence in positive outcomes from the ongoing DREAM study.”Story continues“We have also been happy with our commercial progress in Europe  focusing on Germany  where we obtained a dedicated DRG code.” continued Mr. Taelman. “We already had 12 active implant sites in December 2021 and continue to expand rapidly. In addition  we have secured a DRG code in Switzerland and hospital reimbursement in Spain while we await final reimbursement decisions in the Netherlands and Belgium. Our commercial strategy is based on a deep understanding of the patient journey  building strong relationships with implanting surgeons and further strengthening their relationships with referring sleep physicians  in combination with digital marketing programs.”Mr. Taelman continued  “We secured CE mark MR conditional labeling for Genio®  enabling all implanted patients to safely undergo 1.5T and 3T MRI diagnostics scans. Genio® is now the only HGNS device with an MRI compatibility label for full-body and 3T. This illustrates our patient-centric strategy  and you can soon expect to hear more on the progress made by our R&D team. Short term  we expect to launch the next generation Genio® 2.1  which includes a patient-centric smartphone app and will incorporate a position sensor to adjust stimulation levels based on sleeping position. Looking further into the future  we are proud of our collaboration with Vanderbilt University and Dr. Kent that should result in novel treatment options for OSA patients  starting with Ansa Cervicalis stimulation.”“With our second successful IPO in the span of 10 months last July  we have a strong balance sheet that provides ample liquidity to complete the DREAM study  conduct our U.S. CCC IDE study  invest in pre-commercial activities in the U.S.  and remain committed to our important R&D priorities.

Following EU approval for the additive's use in February 2022  the parties have decided to launch this pilot immediately. The Dutch feed supplier Agrifirm will supply the feed additive to the participating farmers. Through innovations like this  Dutch dairy farmers can build on sustainability improvements over recent years and contribute to a sustainable food production system.DSM Logo.The Bovaer® pilot collaboration between the Dutch companies FrieslandCampina  DSM  and Agrifirm marks an important step forward in increasing the sustainability of the dairy sector. Some 200 FrieslandCampina dairy farms in the Netherlands will take part in the pilot in the second half of 2022. Providing the results are positive  the use of Bovaer® will be further upscaled from 2023.Hein Schumacher  CEO of Royal FrieslandCampina: ""Our ultimate goal is for all of our dairy products to be climate neutral. Though we can't achieve this overnight  we're working toward it. In addition to solutions like switching to green energy – preferably generated by our members – reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of our cows is one of the routes towards reaching our climate goal. This requires innovation – and now Bovaer  a truly innovative feed additive from DSM that significantly reduces cows' methane emissions  is part of the solution. We know that our members are always open to innovation and improvements in our sustainability performance  and with this pilot we will be the first dairy company in Europe to gain valuable practical experience with Bovaer.""Dimitri de Vreeze  Co-CEO of Royal DSM: ""There's no time to lose when it comes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Cutting methane emissions is the fastest way to combat global warming  as was underlined during the most recent UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow. I'm proud that we  FrieslandCampina and DSM  can offer dairy farmers a solution that will help to make a major contribution toward tackling one of the greatest challenges of our time. Collaboration  new ways of thinking and pioneering innovations are crucial to making dairy farming more sustainable. It's important that dairy farmers are rewarded for their sustainability performance.""Story continuesInnovationBovaer® is a feed additive for cows and other ruminants. DSM has researched and developed this additive over ten years. Just a quarter of a teaspoon of Bovaer® added daily to each cow's feed will enable a consistent reduction in methane emissions of 30 percent  on average. This feed additive therefore contributes to a significant and immediate reduction in the environmental footprint of meat and dairy products. With its Food System Commitments  DSM addresses several of the most urgent societal and environmental challenges facing the world's food consumption and production up to 2030. One of its commitments is to enable a 20% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in dairy production. Since the end of last year  Bovaer® has been approved for use in Brazil and Chile  and  at the start of 2022  it also received EU approval.30 percent fewer methane emissionsTogether with its member dairy farmers  FrieslandCampina  aims to achieve a 33 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions on its farms by 2030. To this end  the dairy cooperative is working on various solutions  such as generating sustainable energy on farms  using guaranteed deforestation-free soy in cattle feed  and thanks to this project reducing cow methane emission using Bovaer®. Previous tests with Bovaer® at the Dairy Campus in Leeuwarden showed an average reduction in methane in enteric emissions* per kilogram of milk of 30 percent. This leads to a reduction of approximately 10 percent in CO 2 footprint.During the pilot  the participating dairy farms will feed Bovaer® to their cattle for a period of six months. It will be added to the feed by the feed supplier  Agrifirm  an agricultural cooperative. In addition  there will be talks with other feed suppliers in the follow-up phase.Dick Hordijk  CEO of Royal Agrifirm Group: ""As an agricultural cooperative  we are constantly working on feed solutions that help to improve food production and hence enable us to continue to feed future generations in a responsible manner. This additive is one of the solutions that will help to reduce emissions  so we're very enthusiastic about it.""During the pilot  the results and experiences of farmers will be gathered through workshops and surveys. The economic aspects  together with the costs and benefits  will naturally be considered as well. FrieslandCampina will ensure that every dairy farmer receives fair payment for the supplied milk and reward for the sustainability efforts they make on their farm.* Enteric emissions are the methane emissions that primarily arise during fermentation in the first stomach of ruminants such as cattle.For more information DSM Media Relations Andre van der Elsen tel. +31 (0) 45 5782421 email media.contacts@dsm.com FrieslandCampina Jan-Willem ter Avest M +31 (0)683639940press@frieslandcampina.comForward-looking statementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements with respect to DSM's future (financial) performance and position.

The all-comers cohort will recruit both KIR3DL2 expressors and non-expressors to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment outcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay as a companion diagnostic. The KIR3DL2 non-expressing Cohort 3 has been closed to recruitment. As per the Simon 2-stage design  the number of responses to move to stage 2 was not reached  as such  recruitment into this cohort is stopped. Cohort 3 included KIR3DL2 non-expressing patients assigned via a KIR3DL2 immunohistochemistry assay for use on frozen biopsy samples and as a tool for stratification.In June 2021  the Company announced preliminary data from its Phase 2 TELLOMAK trial  in which lacutamab demonstrated a 35% overall global response rate in patients with MF that express KIR3DL2 (Cohort 2). This first trial data set also established safety and demonstrated skin improvement. Lacutamab reached the pre-determined threshold to advance to stage 2 (six confirmed responses). These results were presented in an oral presentation at the 16th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma (16-ICML).Two parallel clinical trials to study lacutamab in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing  relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) are ongoing: Phase 1b trial: a Company-sponsored Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate lacutamab as a monotherapy in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed PTCL. Phase 2 KILT (anti-KIR in T Cell Lymphoma) trial: The Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) initiated an investigator-sponsored  randomized trial to evaluate lacutamab in combination with chemotherapy GEMOX (gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin) versus GEMOX alone in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed/refractory PTCL.ANKET™ (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):In December 2021  the Company announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi  evaluating IPH6101/SAR443579  the first NKp46/CD16‑based NK cell engager  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high risk-myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).

The start of the trial has triggered a milestone payment from Sanofi to Innate. In November 2021  Innate Pharma in collaboration with Sanofi  presented preclinical data from Innate’s proprietary  multi-specific NK cell engager platform  ANKET TM   at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC). Data on IPH6101/SAR443579  using Innate’s proprietary multi-specific antibody format (Gauthier et al. Cell 2019) that targets CD123 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and co-engages NKp46 and CD16a on NK cells was presented. In preclinical studies  IPH6101/SAR443579 demonstrated potent antitumor activity against AML cell lines  including those resistant to ADCC by a comparator anti-CD123 antibody. IPH6101/SAR443579 also promoted strong and specific NK-cell activation and induced cytokine secretion only in the presence of AML target cells. In addition  IPH6101/SAR443579 had sustained pharmacodynamic effects in non-human primates  combining efficient depletion of CD123-expressing cells with minor systemic cytokine release in comparison to T-cell engagers. As expected  it also had a favorable safety profile.  at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC).

After a median follow-up of 16.3 months  preliminary data suggest anti-tumor activity in the triplet of monalizumab  cetuximab and durvalumab in first-line treatment of R/M HNSCC. As of August 1  2021  40 patients were enrolled. Thirteen patients had a confirmed response with a 32.5% overall response rate (95% confidence interval (CI): 20-48)  including three complete responses. Seven out of 13 responders were still on treatment. Median duration of response was not yet reached (95% CI: 7.1-not available). The survival rate at 12 months was 58.6% (95% CI: 45-77) and the median overall survival was 15 months (95% CI: 11.4 - not available).In September 2021  AstraZeneca commenced a Phase 2 clinical study  NeoCOAST-2  that includes a treatment arm with durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy and monalizumab in resectable  early-stage NSCLC.In September 2021  AstraZeneca presented a late-breaker abstract on the randomized COAST Phase 2 trial in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC at the ESMO Congress. The presentation highlighted progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) results for durvalumab in combination with monalizumab  Innate’s lead partnered asset  and oleclumab  AstraZeneca’s anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody. After a median follow-up of 11.5 months  the results of an interim analysis showed a 10-month PFS rate of 72.7% for durvalumab plus monalizumab  versus 39.2% with durvalumab alone in unresectable  Stage III NSCLC patients following chemoradiation therapy. The results also showed an increase in the primary endpoint of confirmed ORR for durvalumab plus monalizumab over durvalumab alone (36% vs. 18%).IPH5201 (anti-CD39)  partnered with AstraZeneca:AstraZeneca is conducting a Phase 1 trial in solid tumors with IPH5201 alone or in combination with durvalumab (anti-PD-L1).

She left the Company on January 2022.Financial highlights for 2021:The key elements of Innate’s financial position and financial results as of and for the year ended December 31  2021 are as follows:Cash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets amounting to €159.7 million 2 (€m) as of December 31  2021 (€190.6m as of December 31  2020)  including non-current financial instruments amounting to €39.9m (€38.9m as of December 31  2020).(€m) as of December 31  2021 (€190.6m as of December 31  2020)  including non-current financial instruments amounting to €39.9m (€38.9m as of December 31  2020). As of December 31  2021  financial liabilities amount to €44.3m (€19.1m as of December 31  2020). This change is mainly linked to proceeds relating to State-Guaranteed Loans (Prêts Garantis par l’Etat “PGE”) of €28.7m from Société Générale (€20.0m) and BNP Paribas (€8.7m) collected by the Company on December 2021.Revenue and other income from continuing operations 3 amounted to €24.7m in 2021 (2020: €69.8m  -64.6%). It mainly comprises revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements (€12.1m in 2021 vs €56.2m in 2020  -78.4%)  and research tax credit (€10.3m in 2021 vs €13.1m in 2020  -21.2%): Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreement with AstraZeneca amounted to €9.1m in 2021 (€49.0m in 2020  -81.4%) and mainly resulted from (i) the spreading of the upfront and opt-in payments received from AstraZeneca and (ii) the invoicing to AstraZeneca of certain fees for the work performed by Innate for the partnered programs. The variation between the two periods is notably explained by the (i) decrease in direct monalizumab research and development costs over the period  in connection with the Phase 1 & 2 trials maturity  and (ii) the absence of revenue relating to IPH5201 in 2021  the Company having fulfilled all of its commitments on preclinical work related to the start of Phase 1 as of December 31 2020. Revenue of €3.0m from Sanofi following the initiation of a GLP-tox Study and the launching of the first Phase 1 clinical trial in humans in relapsed of refractory AML with IPH6101/SAR443579  respectively in January and December 2021. The variation in the research tax credit mainly results from a decrease in the amortization for the intangible assets related to acquired licenses (monalizumab and IPH5201).amounted to €24.7m in 2021 (2020: €69.8m  -64.6%). It mainly comprises revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements (€12.1m in 2021 vs €56.2m in 2020  -78.4%)  and research tax credit (€10.3m in 2021 vs €13.1m in 2020  -21.2%): Operating expenses from continuing operations amounted to €72.5m in 2021 (2020: €68.7m  +5.6%): General and administrative (G&A) expenses from continuing activities amounted to €25.5m in 2021 (2020: €19.0m  +34.4% 4 ). This increase results cumulatively from (i) an increase in wages mainly resulting from restructuring costs and higher annual bonuses level in 2021  (ii) an increase in non-scientific advisory fees and (iii) an increase in other general and administrative expenses. Research and development (R&D) expenses from continuing activities amounted to €47.0m in 2021 (2020: €49.7m  -5.4%). This variation mainly results from a (i) decrease in depreciation and amortization of intangible assets acquired by the Company (IPH5201  fully amortized since December 2020  and monalizumab) partly offset by (ii) an increase in direct research and development expenses (clinical and non-clinical).A net financial income of €2.3m in 2021 (2020: €1.9m loss).A net loss from Lumoxiti discontinued operations of €7.3m in 2021 (2020 : net loss of €63.2m  -88.4%) mainly resulting from the Settlement Amount of $6.2m 5 (€5.5m as of December 31  2021) to be paid to AstraZeneca on April 30  2022  as part of the Termination and Transition agreement effective as of June 30  2021. The net loss in 2020 mainly resulted from the full impairment of Lumoxiti rights following the Company decision to return the marketing rights of Lumoxiti in the United States and in Europe to AstraZeneca.(€5.5m as of December 31  2021) to be paid to AstraZeneca on April 30  2022  as part of the Termination and Transition agreement effective as of June 30  2021. The net loss in 2020 mainly resulted from the full impairment of Lumoxiti rights following the Company decision to return the marketing rights of Lumoxiti in the United States and in Europe to AstraZeneca. A net loss of €52.8m in 2021 (2020: net loss of €64.0m).The table below summarizes the IFRS consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31  2021  including 2020 comparative information.In thousands of euros  except for data per share December 31  2021 December 31  2020(1) Revenue and other income 24 703 69 773 Research and development (47 004) (49 708) Selling  general and administrative (25 524) (18 986) Total operating expenses (72 528) (68 694) Operating income (loss) (47 825) 1 079 Net financial income (loss) 2 347 (1 908) Income tax expense — — Net income (loss) from continuing operations (45 478) (829) Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (7 331) (63 155) Net income (loss) (52 809) (63 984) Weighted average number of shares outstanding (in thousands) 79 543 78 935 Basic income (loss) per share (0.66) (0.81) Diluted income (loss) per share (0.66) (0.81) Basic income (loss) per share from continuing operations (0.57) (0.01) Diluted income (loss) per share from continuing operations (0.57) (0.01) Basic income (loss) per share from discontinued operations (0.09) (0.80) Diluted income (loss) per share from discontinued operations (0.09) (0.80) December 31  2021 December 31  2020 Cash  cash equivalents and financial asset 159 714 190 571 Total assets 267 496 307 423 Shareholders’ equity 107 440 155 976 Total financial debt 44 251 19 087(1) The 2020 comparatives have been restated to consider the impact of classifying the Lumoxiti business as discontinued operations in 2021.About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma’s broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of natural killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens  as well as antibody engineering.

Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements mainly results from the spreading of the initial payments and the exercise of options related to the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015 and October 2018  on the basis of the completion of work that the Company is committed to carry out. The evolution in 2021 is mainly due to:A €26.1 million decrease in revenue related to monalizumab to €7.5 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €33.6 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This decrease is mainly explained by the decrease in direct monalizumab research and development costs over the period  in connection with the Phase 1 & 2 trials maturity. As of December 31  2021  the deferred revenue related to monalizumab amounts to €20.2 million (€12.1 million as “Deferred revenue—Current portion” and €8.0 million as “Deferred revenue—Non-current portion”).A €13.4 million decrease in revenue related to IPH5201. Nil for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €13.4 million for the year ended December 31  2020. As a reminder  as of December 31  2020  the Company having fulfilled all of its commitments on preclinical work related to the start of Phase 1 of the IPH5201 program  the initial payment of $50.0 million and the milestone payment of $5.0 million were fully recognized in revenue.A €0.9 million decrease in revenue from invoicing of research and development costs to €1.6 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €2.5 million for the year ended December 31  2020. Pursuant to our agreements with AstraZeneca  research and development costs related to avdoralimab in oncology are equally shared between us and AstraZeneca and research and development costs related to IPH5201 are fully borne by AstraZeneca. The decrease between the two periods is mainly explained by the decrease in research and development costs relating to IPH5201 re-invoiced to AstraZeneca following the transition of the program in Phase 1 clinical trial  supported AstraZeneca.A €4.0 million decrease in revenue from collaboration and research license agreement with Sanofi  to €3.0 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €7.0 million for the year ended December 31  2020. In January 2021  a GLP-tox study was initiated for the IPH6101/SAR443579 program. Additionally  in December  2021  the Company announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial launched by Sanofi in humans with IPH6101/SAR443579 in relapsed or refractory AML. These trials triggered two milestone payments from Sanofi to Innate  planned in the research collaboration between the two companies  fully recognized in revenue as of December 31  2021. As a reminder  in December 2020  Sanofi informed the Company of its intention to advance IPH6101/SAR443579 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. This decision triggered a milestone payment of €7.0 million from Sanofi to the Company  fully recognized in revenue as of December 31  2020.Government funding for research expendituresGovernment funding for research expenditures decreased by €1.0 million  or 7.5%  to €12.6 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €13.6 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This change is primarily a result of a decrease in the research tax credit of €2.8 million  which is mainly due to a decrease in the amortization expense relating to the intangible assets related to the acquired licenses (see R&D expenses).The research tax credit is calculated as 30% of the amount of research and development expenses  net of grants received  eligible for the research tax credit for the fiscal year. The Company is again eligible to the SME status under European Union criteria as of December 31  2021. Consecutively  the Company is eligible for the early repayment by the French treasury of the 2021 research tax credit during the fiscal year 2022.Operating expensesThe table below presents our operating expenses from continuing operations for the years ended December 31  2021 and 2020:In thousands of euros December 31  2021 December 31  2020(1) Research and development expenses (47 004) (49 708) Selling  general and administrative expenses (25 524) (18 986) Operating expenses (72 528) (68 694)(1) The 2020 comparatives have been restated to consider the impact of classifying the Lumoxiti business as discontinued operations in 2021.Research and development expensesResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses from continuing operations decreased by €2.7 million  or 5.4%  to €47.0 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €49.7 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This decrease mainly results from a decrease of €5.1 million in research and development depreciation and amortization of intangible assets acquired by the Company  partly offset by an increase of €3.3 million in direct research and development expenses (clinical and non-clinical). R&D expenses represented a total of 64.8% and 72.4% of the total operating expenses from continued operations for the years ended December 31  2021 and 2020  respectively.They include direct R&D expenses (subcontracting costs and consumables)  depreciation and amortization  and personnel expenses. Direct R&D expenses increased by €3.3 million  or 14.0%  to €26.7 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €23.4 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase is mainly due to: (i) a €5.0 million increase in expenses relating to the lacutamab program and (ii) a €1.5 million increase in expenses related to non-clinical development program relating notably to IPH65. These increases are partly offset by a €1.9 million and €1.3 million decreases in expenses relating to the monalizumab and avdoralimab programs  respectively.Also  as of December 31  2021  the collaboration liabilities relating to monalizumab and the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015  October 2018 and September 2020 amounted to €40.4m  as compared to collaborations liabilities of €46.7m as of December 31  2020. This decrease of €6.3m mainly results from the payments made in 2021 to AstraZeneca relating to the co-funding of the monalizumab program  including the INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 trial.Personnel and other expenses allocated to R&D decreased by €6.0 million  or 22.8%  to €20.3 million for the year ended December 2021  as compared to an amount of €26.3 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This decrease is mainly due to the decrease by €5.2 million in amortization relating to monalizumab rights (extension of the depreciation horizon due to the extension of the duration of certain clinical trials) and IPH5201 rights (full amortization at December 31  2020).General and administrative expensesGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses from continuing operations increased by €6.5 million  or 34.4%6 to €25.5 million for the year ended December 31  2021 as compared to €19.0 million for the year ended December 31  2020. G&A expenses represented a total of 35.2% and 27.6% of the total operating expenses for the years ended December 31  2021 and 2020  respectively.Personnel expenses (including share-based compensation) include the compensation paid to our employees and consultants  and increased by €2.6 million  or 31.9%  to €10.9 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €8.3 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase mainly results from an increase in wages of €2.0 million  mainly resulting from restructuring costs and higher annual bonuses level in 2021. This increase is completed by the increase in share-based payments of €0.6 million.G&A expenses also include non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses which mostly consist of auditing  accounting  legal and hiring fees. These expenses increased by €0.7 million  or 15.0%  to €5.1 million for the year ended December 31  2021  compared to an amount of €4.4 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase results mainly from (i) an increase of auditing and accounting fees  recruitment fees and investor relation consultancy fees partly offset by (ii) a decrease of costs related to the launch of the Company's new ERP in 2020 and the support by external service providers in the context of compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley law following the listing of the Company in the United States in October 2019.Other G&A expenses relate to intellectual property  the costs of maintaining laboratory equipment and our premises  depreciation and amortization and other general  administrative expenses. These expenses increased by €3.2 million or 51.5% to €9.5 million for the year ended December 31 2021  as compared to an amount of €6.3 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase related notably to insurance costs  which increased in fiscal year 2021  following the listing of the Company in the United States in October 2019. It also includes increases related to staff training (catch-up observed in 2021 following the impact of COVID-19 in 2020) and local taxes.Financial income (loss)  netWe recognized a net financial gain of €2.3 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €1.9 million net financial loss for the year ended December 31  2020. This change results mainly from the change in the fair value of certain financial instruments (loss of €0.6 million in 2020 as compared to a €1.1 million gain in 2021) and a net foreign exchange gain of €1.2 million in 2021 as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of €1.6 million in 2020.Net loss from discontinued operationsFurther to the Company decision to terminate the Lumoxiti Agreement in December 2020  a Termination and Transition Agreement was negotiated and executed  effective as of June 30  2021 terminating the Lumoxiti Agreement as well as Lumoxiti related agreements (including the supply agreement  the quality agreement and other related agreements) and transferring the U.S. marketing authorization and distribution rights of Lumoxiti back to AstraZeneca. The marketing authorization has been transferred back to AstraZeneca which has reimbursed Innate for all Lumoxiti related costs  expenses and benefited net sales.Subsequently  operations related to Lumoxiti are presented as discontinued operations from October 1  2021.As a consequence  net result from discontinued operations relating to Lumoxiti decreased by €55.8m  or -88.4%  to a €7.3 million net loss for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to a €63.2 million net loss for the year ended December 31  2020. Net loss for the year ended December 31  2021 mainly resulting from the Settlement Amount of $6.2m (€5.5m as of December 31  2021) to be paid to AstraZeneca on April 30  2022  as part of the Termination and Transition agreement. Net loss for the year ended December 31  2020 mainly resulted from the full impairment of Lumoxiti rights following the Company’s decision to return the marketing rights of Lumoxiti in the United States and in Europe to AstraZeneca and the costs incurred for the marketing of Lumoxiti and for our U.S subsidiary  including the related personnel costs.Balance sheet itemsCash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets (current and non-current) amounted to €159.7 million as of December 31  2021  as compared to €190.6 million as of December 31  2020. Net cash as of December 31  2021 (cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets less current financial liabilities) amounted to €89.1 million (€149.5 million as of December 31  2020).The other key balance sheet items as of December 31  2021 are:Deferred revenue of €37.9 million (including €25.4 million booked as ‘Deferred revenue – non-current portion’) and collaboration liabilities of €40.4 million (including €33.0 million booked as ‘Collaboration liability – non-current portion’) relating to the remainder of the initial payment received from AstraZeneca with respect to monalizumab  not yet recognized as revenue or used to co-fund the research and the development work performed by AstraZeneca including co-funding of the monalizumab program with AstraZeneca  notably the INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 trial;Deferred revenue of €17.4 million relating to the initial payment for preclinical molecules  entirely classified as ‘Deferred revenue – non-current portion’;Intangible assets for a net book value of €44.2 million  mainly corresponding to the rights and licenses relating to the acquisitions of monalizumab and avdoralimab (€46.3 million as of December 30  2020); variation between the two periods is mainly explained by the amortization of monalizumab rights;Current receivables of €18.4 million  mainly resulting from the French government in relation to the research tax credit for 2021 (€10.3 million).Non-current receivables from the French government in relation to the research tax credit for 2019 and 2020 of €29.8 million;Shareholders’ equity of €107.4 million  including the net loss of the period of €52.8 million;Financial liabilities amounting to €44.3 million (€19.1 million as of December 31  2020).Cash-flow itemsThe net cash flow used over the year ended December 31  2021 amounted to €33.0 million  compared to a net cash flow used of €66.1 million for the year ended December 31  2020.The net cash flow used during the period under review mainly results from the following:Net cash used from operating activities of €58.5 million  mainly explained by the net cash consumption of operating activities less the receipts for a total amount of €10.0 million from Sanofi (in January  February and December 2021) in connection with the IPH6101/SAR443579 agreement signed in 2016  following Sanofi's decision at the end of 2020 to advance IPH6101/SAR443579 towards regulatory preclinical studies for a new investigational drug  and the launch of the first related Phase 1 trial in December 2021. Restated for these receipts  net cash flows used by operating activities for the year ended December  2021 are down by €24.6 million. This decrease is mainly due to the discontinuation of Lumoxiti-related activities in connection with the Company's decision at the end of 2020 to return the commercial rights in the United States and Europe to AstraZeneca  under the termination and transition agreement signed in 2021. As a result  net cash flow consumed by operating activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation amounted to €3.6 million for the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to €22.4 million for the year 2020.Net cash used in investing activities for an amount of €0.9 million. As a reminder  net cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31  2020 amounted €13.4 million which mainly resulted from (i) a €13.4 million ($15.0 million) additional consideration paid  in January 2020  to AstraZeneca regarding Lumoxiti following the submission of the Biologics License Application to the European Medicine Agency (EMA) in November 2019 (ii) a €2.7 million additional consideration paid to Orega Biotech in April 2020 regarding IPH5201 following the dosing of a first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial  in March 2020 and (iii) the acquisition of financial assets for a net amount of €3.0 million. Such items were partially offset by the reimbursement by AstraZeneca in relation to the 2019 cost sharing mechanism for the commercialization of Lumoxiti (€7.0 million). As a result  net cash flows consumed by investing activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation were nil for year ended December 31  2021 as compared to €6.6 million for year ended December 31 2020.Net cash flows from financing activities for an amount of €26.8 million. On January 5  2022  the Company announced that it had obtained a non-dilutive financing of €28.7 million in the form of two State-Guaranteed Loans (Prêts Garantis “PGE”) from Société Générale (€20.0 million) and BNP Paribas (€8.7 million). The funds related to these two PGEs were collected by the Company on December 27 and 30  2021 respectively. Loan repayments amounted to €2.1 million for the year ended December 31  2021 compared to €2.2 million for the year ended December 31  2020. In addition  net cash flow from financing activities related to Lumoxiti discontinued operation are nil for year ended December 31  2021 and 2020  respectively.Post period eventBetween December 31  2021  closing date of the financial year  and March 23  2022  closing date of the consolidated financial statements by the Executive Board  the military operations in Ukraine took place  which began on February 24  2022 and the sanctions taken against the Russia by many States having an impact on the activity of many international groups and which will have an impact on the world economy.

But gross lending was also £1.3bn lower year on year as the bank targeted more profitable customer segments..Meanwhile  Bank of Ireland’s venture capital arm has invested €1.8m in Dublin City University’s Pilot Photonics spin-out.Kernel Capital confirmed its investment on Thursday in the tech start-up  which has patented a technique that can create multiple lasers from one device.Photonics is the science of light and is used in manufacturing  medical devices  telecoms  security and also to scan groceries in supermarkets.The technology was developed over more than a decade of research and development (R&D) at DCU  Trinity College Dublin and the Tyndall National Institute in Cork.Pilot Photonics is led by chief executive William Oppermann  who founded data storage start-up and fellow Kernel Capital investee company MPSTOR.

1444,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2022/03/24/backed-by-spacs-ipos-hit-new-heights-in-2021/,Backed by SPACs  IPOs Hit New Heights in 2021,The global IPO market made up for lost time in 2021. After a slow 2019 and a pandemic-battered 2020  new issues came roaring back last year—3 021 listings (inc. SPACs) raised US$601.2 billion  valuing the newly floated companies at US$2.7 trillion. Overall  t…,The global IPO market made up for lost time in 2021. After a slow 2019 and a pandemic-battered 2020  new issues came roaring back last year—3 021 listings (inc. SPACs) raised US$601.2 billion  valuing the newly floated companies at US$2.7 trillion. Overall  this was a year-on-year increase of 88 percent in volume and 87 percent by value.A proportion of last year’s activity reflected pent-up demand  with new issues that might have taken place in the previous year deferred until 2021. But even without that effect  last year was remarkable  with IPO activity hitting new heights.One significant driver was the continuing boom in the market for special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs)—particularly evident in the first half of 2021 and the expansion to European markets. Last year’s global IPO figures included the launch of no fewer than 681 SPACs  which collectively raised US$172.3 billion. That was a major increase from 2020  itself a record year for blank check companies.Nevertheless  excluding SPACs  the IPO market still enjoyed a record year  with 2 340 new issues raising US$428.9 billion. By volume  IPO activity rose 73 percent compared to 2020; by value  2021 was 81 percent ahead.A boom across regionsUnlike in some previous years  the IPO surge was global  rather than restricted to the largest markets. That said  the biggest listing in 2021  the flotation of Rivian Automotive  came in the US. The California-based company designs  develops and manufactures electric vehicles and accessories for the consumer and commercial markets  and raised US$13.7 billion when it listed on Nasdaq.The Asia-Pacific region had a bumper year  with six of the top-ten deals taking place in the region. The largest of these saw Hong Kong–based Kuaishou  which derives its income from live streaming and online marketing  list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange raising US$6.2 billion—the world’s second-biggest new issue.South Korea’s Coupang took the third spot in last year’s IPO rankings  raising US$4.6 billion. Coupang’s IPO in New York reflected investors’ appetite for a business that is often compared to Amazon and owns more than 100 fulfillment and logistics centers.And listings were not limited to the major capital markets. For example  Indonesian e-commerce company Bukalapak listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange  raising US$1.5 billion. The company listed at a market cap of US$6 billion  making it the country’s first listed tech unicorn.In Europe  meanwhile  the biggest listing was for Poland’s InPost  a parcels and collections business that raised US$3.9 billion on Euronext Amsterdam.In Latin America  the top deals were all in Brazil. Many of these deals were related to technology—and in particular  fintech. The highest-profile of these was the IPO of digital banking group Nu Holdings—South America’s largest new issue of the year. Nu raised US$2.7 billion in the IPO.These deals highlight that technology was a major driver of the IPO surge  encouraged by the societal changes that the pandemic accelerated.Meanwhile  private equity (PE) was not shy about going public  adding to the 2021 IPO frenzy. The listing of UK PE firm Bridgepoint  which raised US$1.2 billion  and French PE firm Antin Infrastructure  which raised US$742 million  caught the attention of European peers. The spectacular stock market performance of Sweden’s EQT AB since its 2019 listing—at its highest in November 2021  up 542 percent—also focused minds.

This webcast will also be available on the Company’s website. Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/qieuu6atPeter Bühler  Valneva’s Chief Financial Officer  commented  “2021 was an exceptional year for Valneva  marked by unprecedented R&D progress and our successful Nasdaq listing. We reported positive Phase 3 results for two vaccine candidates (COVID-19 and chikungunya) and we expect both vaccines  if approved  to make a positive change to people’s lives. With close to €350 million in cash  we entered 2022 in a strong position and will continue to focus on gaining regulatory approvals and preparing market entry for our key late-stage programs.”Clinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesLYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Further positive Phase 2 results reportedValneva and Pfizer2 are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. The vaccine candidate covers the six OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe.In February 2022  Valneva and Pfizer reported further positive Phase 2 data for VLA153 confirming the robust immunogenicity profile observed for adults (18-65 years) in previous Phase 2 studies. The companies are also evaluating VLA15 in pediatric participants aged 5 to 17 years  with first data expected in the second quarter of 2022. Based on the latest Phase 2 results  Valneva and Pfizer plan to proceed with a three-dose primary series vaccination schedule for adults (18-65 years) in a planned Phase 3 clinical trial  which they expect to initiate in the third quarter of 2022  subject to regulatory approval.SARS-CoV-2 VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA2001First Emergency Use Authorization grantedVLA2001 is currently the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted vaccine candidate in clinical trials against COVID-19 in Europe. It is produced using Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for the Company’s commercial Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®.Valneva remains focused on achieving regulatory approvals of VLA2001. In March 2022  VLA2001 was granted emergency use authorization from the Kingdom of Bahrain4. Valneva now expects to deliver the first VLA2001 shipments to Bahrain at the end of March 2022 as per the purchase agreement signed in December 20215.VLA2001 is in advanced review processes with the EMA and UK MHRA  as recently communicated6. Subject to acceptance of Valneva’s responses by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)  Valneva anticipates receiving a positive CHMP recommendation for conditional approval of VLA2001 for primary immunization in adults 18 to 55 years of age in April 2022. Following such conditional approval  the Company would expect to start delivering planned doses of VLA2001 to European countries in the second quarter of 2022. Valneva signed an agreement with the European Commission (EC) in November 2021 to supply up to 60 million doses of VLA2001 over two years  including 24.3 million doses in 20227 and the remainder via options in 2023.In order to gradually expand the label and indications of VLA2001 to further age groups  Valneva is currently conducting additional clinical studies  including for potential use as a homologous and heterologous booster vaccine in the course of 2022.CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1553Final Positive Phase 3 Results reportedValneva is developing a single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to over 120 countries.In March 2022  Valneva announced successful completion of the Phase 3 pivotal trial of VLA15538. The final six-month analysis confirmed the very high level of seroprotection reported in August 2021. Six months after receiving a single vaccination  96.3% of participants showed protective CHIKV neutralizing antibody titers. VLA1553’s good safety and tolerability profile was also consistent with topline Phase 3 data. Valneva now expects to commence the pre-submission process with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second quarter of 2022.The Company also previously reported positive topline lot-to-lot manufacturing consistency results for VLA15539. This is one of the standard requirements for vaccine licensure  and final lot-to-lot results are expected in the second quarter of 2022.Valneva also initiated a Phase 3 trial in adolescents in January 2022. The trial  conducted in Brazil by Instituto Butantan  is designed to support label extension to this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults in the U.S10. Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  the trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic region.Commercial VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is the only Japanese encephalitis vaccine licensed and available in the U.S.  Canada and Europe.Sales of IXIARO® were €45.1 million in 2021 compared to €48.5 million in 2020. While the COVID-19 pandemic continued to adversely impact the travel industry and vaccine sales to the private market  the impact on IXIARO® sales was mitigated by the Company’s contract with the U.S. Government’s Department of Defense (DoD).CHOLERA / ETEC11-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.DUKORAL® recorded sales of €2.4 million in 2021 compared to €13.3 million in 2020. 2021 sales continued to be significantly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on the travel industry.Full Year 2021 Financial Review(Audited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €348.1 million in 2021 compared to €110.3 million in 2020  an increase of 216%.Product sales decreased by 4.5% to €63.0 million in 2021 compared to €65.9 million in 2020 as the travel industry continued to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. On a constant exchange rate (CER) basis  product sales also decreased by 4.5% in 2021 as compared to 2020.IXIARO®/JESPECT® product sales decreased by 6.9% (5.7% at CER) to €45.1 million in 2021 compared to €48.5 million in 2020. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was mitigated by sales to the U.S. Government’s Department of Defense (DoD) during the period. DUKORAL® product sales declined by 81.7% (82.4% at CER) to €2.4 million in 2021 compared to €13.3 million in 2020. Third Party product sales grew by 271.0% to €15.4 million in 2021 from €4.2 million in 2020. The increase in Third Party product sales was driven by incremental sales related to Valneva’s distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic for the sales of Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur®  which commenced in certain territories in 2021.Other Revenues amounted to €285.1 million in 2021 compared to €44.4 million in 2020. This increase was attributable to revenues recognized in relation to the terminated UK COVID-19 vaccine supply agreement for non-refundable payments received up to December 31st  2021.Operating Result and EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €187.9 million in 2021. Gross margin on product sales was 36.5% compared to 36.6% in 2020. COGS of €22.6 million were related to IXIARO®/JESPECT® product sales  yielding a product gross margin of 50.0%. COGS of €7.6 million were related to DUKORAL® product sales  causing a negative product gross margin. Of the remaining 2021 COGS  €9.9 million were related to the Third-Party product distribution business  €122.8 million to the COVID-19 business and €25.1 million to cost of services. COGS for the COVID-19 business in 2021 included write-offs of materials and onerous purchase agreements resulting from the termination of the UK VLA2001 supply agreement. In 2020  overall COGS were €54.3 million  of which €41.8 million related to cost of goods and €12.5 million related to cost of services.Research and development investments continued to increase in 2021  growing to €173.3 million compared to €84.5 million in 2020. This was mainly driven by investments in Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate  VLA2001  as well as Phase 3 clinical study costs for Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine program  VLA1553. Excluding COVID-19  research and development investments amounted to €59.4 million in 2021 compared to €65.5 million in 2020. Marketing and distribution expenses in 2021 amounted to €23.6 million compared to €18.3 million in 2020. Marketing and distribution expenses in 2021 notably included €3.8 million of expenses (compared to €0.6 million in 2020) related to the launch preparation costs of the chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  and also included higher expenses related to the Company’s employee share-based compensation programs  which offset cost containment measures taken as a result of the pandemic’s impact on the travel vaccine business. General and administrative expenses increased to €47.6 million in 2021 from €27.5 million in 2020  mainly driven by increased costs to support corporate transactions such as the Company’s initial public offering on Nasdaq  increased resources in support of incremental COVID-19 activities  and higher costs related to the Company’s employee share-based compensation programs.Other income  net of other expenses  increased to €23.0 million in 2021 from €19.1 million in 2020. This increase was mainly driven by increased R&D tax credits directly resulting from increased R&D spending.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €61.4 million in 2021 compared to an operating loss of €55.1 million in 2020. EBITDA loss in 2021 was €47.1 million compared to an EBITDA loss of €45.2 million in 2020.Net ResultIn 2021  Valneva generated a net loss of €73.4 million compared to a net loss of €64.4 million in 2020.Finance expense and currency effects in 2021 resulted in a net finance expense of €8.6 million  compared to a net finance expense of €10.0 million in 2020. This was mainly a result of foreign exchange gains amounting to €8.1 million in 2021  primarily driven by revaluation gains of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange gain (including gains on derivative financial instruments) of €0.6 million in 2020. Interest charges increased to €17.0 million in 2021 compared to €10.7 million in 2020. This growth was mainly driven by increased interest charges related to refund liabilities.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash generated by operating activities amounted to €76.9 million in 2021 compared to €137.7 million in 2020  mainly driven by pre-payments related to the vaccine supply agreement signed with the EC. Net cash generated by operating activities in 2020 was mainly derived from the $130 million upfront payment received from Pfizer related to the Lyme R&D collaboration agreement  as well as payments received from the UK government in relation to the UK VLA2001 supply agreement.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €93.1 million in 2021 compared to €19.3 million in 2020  mainly as a result of COVID manufacturing related construction activities across production sites in Scotland and Sweden  as well as equipment purchases.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €154.5 million in 2021  which was mainly a result of proceeds from the issuance of new shares in the U.S. initial public offering and European private placement (Global Offering). Cash inflows in 2020 amounted to €21.7 million and mainly consisted of net proceeds from the financing arrangement with U.S. healthcare funds Deerfield and OrbiMed  offset by €20.0 million of repayments of borrowings to the European Investment Bank.Liquid funds increased to €346.7 million as of December 31  2021  compared to €204.4 million as of December 31  2020. The cash increase resulted from significant cash in-flows most notably COVID related payments received from UK government and EC member states as well as net proceeds from the Global Offering in May and October 2021.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results as well as the non-IFRS measure of EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provides additional analytical tools. EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization.A reconciliation of EBITDA to operating loss  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million 12 months ending December 31  2021 2020 Operating Loss (61.4) (55.1) Add: Amortization 6.6 6.0 Depreciation 7.7 3.8 Impairment of Tangible Assets - 0.1 EBITDA (47.1) (45.2)About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  production and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

The all-comers cohort will recruit both KIR3DL2 expressors and non-expressors to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment outcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay as a companion diagnostic. The KIR3DL2 non-expressing Cohort 3 has been closed to recruitment. As per the Simon 2-stage design  the number of responses to move to stage 2 was not reached  as such  recruitment into this cohort is stopped. Cohort 3 included KIR3DL2 non-expressing patients assigned via a KIR3DL2 immunohistochemistry assay for use on frozen biopsy samples and as a tool for stratification.In June 2021  the Company announced preliminary data from its Phase 2 TELLOMAK trial  in which lacutamab demonstrated a 35% overall global response rate in patients with MF that express KIR3DL2 (Cohort 2). This first trial data set also established safety and demonstrated skin improvement. Lacutamab reached the pre-determined threshold to advance to stage 2 (six confirmed responses). These results were presented in an oral presentation at the 16th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma (16-ICML).Two parallel clinical trials to study lacutamab in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing  relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) are ongoing:Phase 1b trial: a Company-sponsored Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate lacutamab as a monotherapy in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed PTCL. Phase 2 KILT (anti-KIR in T Cell Lymphoma) trial: The Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) initiated an investigator-sponsored  randomized trial to evaluate lacutamab in combination with chemotherapy GEMOX (gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin) versus GEMOX alone in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed/refractory PTCL.ANKET™ (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):In December 2021  the Company announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi  evaluating IPH6101/SAR443579  the first NKp46/CD16‑based NK cell engager  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high risk-myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). The purpose of the dose escalation and dose expansion study  which is sponsored by Sanofi  is to evaluate the safety  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics and initial clinical activity of IPH6101/SAR443579  Innate’s lead ANKET TM asset  in various CD123-expressing hematological malignancies. The start of the trial has triggered a milestone payment from Sanofi to Innate.asset  in various CD123-expressing hematological malignancies. The start of the trial has triggered a milestone payment from Sanofi to Innate. In November 2021  Innate Pharma in collaboration with Sanofi  presented preclinical data from Innate’s proprietary  multi-specific NK cell engager platform  ANKET TM   at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC). Data on IPH6101/SAR443579  using Innate’s proprietary multi-specific antibody format (Gauthier et al. Cell 2019) that targets CD123 on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and co-engages NKp46 and CD16a on NK cells was presented. In preclinical studies  IPH6101/SAR443579 demonstrated potent antitumor activity against AML cell lines  including those resistant to ADCC by a comparator anti-CD123 antibody. IPH6101/SAR443579 also promoted strong and specific NK-cell activation and induced cytokine secretion only in the presence of AML target cells. In addition  IPH6101/SAR443579 had sustained pharmacodynamic effects in non-human primates  combining efficient depletion of CD123-expressing cells with minor systemic cytokine release in comparison to T-cell engagers. As expected  it also had a favorable safety profile.  at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC).

Specifically  Innate shared data from its tetra-specific ANKET TM molecule  which is the first NK cell engager technology to engage two NK cell activating receptors (NKp46 and CD16)  a cytokine receptor (IL-2Rb) and a tumor antigen via a single molecule. In preclinical studies  the tetra-specific ANKET TM demonstrated in vitro the ability to induce human NK cell proliferation  cytokine production and cytolytic activity against cancer cells expressing the targeted antigen. The tetra-specific ANKET TM also demonstrated in vivo anti-tumor efficacy in several tumor models  allowing regression of established tumors as well as control of metastasis  associated with increased NK cell infiltration  cytokine and chemokine production at the tumor site. ANKET TM also showed a pharmacodynamic effect  low systemic cytokine release and a manageable safety profile in non-human primates.platform  at the Federation of Clinical Immunology Societies meeting.

In January 2021  it was announced that Sanofi will transition IPH6101/SAR443579 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. The decision triggered a €7 million milestone payment from Sanofi to Innate. In addition  in January 2021  a GLP-tox study was initiated for the IPH6101/SAR443579 program.IPH64  the other drug candidate of the research collaboration with Sanofi is progressing and the Company look forward to updates on this asset.The Company’s proprietary tetra-specific ANKETTM IPH65 is progressing to IND enabling studies.Monalizumab (anti-NKG2A antibody)  partnered with AstraZeneca:In March 2022  the Phase 2 NeoCOAST study assessing the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy and oleclumab or monalizumab and adjuvant treatment in participants with resectable  early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been accepted for an oral presentation on 11 April 2022 at the Annual Meeting 2022 of the American Association for Cancer Research.In February 2022  AstraZeneca initiated a Phase 3 clinical trial  PACIFIC-9  evaluating durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab (anti-NKG2A) or AstraZeneca’s oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT).In December 2021  the Company presented data from the Phase 2 expansion cohort (‘cohort 3’)  exploring the triplet combination of monalizumab  cetuximab and durvalumab in the first-line treatment of patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer (R/M HNSCC) at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Immuno-Oncology Congress 2021. After a median follow-up of 16.3 months  preliminary data suggest anti-tumor activity in the triplet of monalizumab  cetuximab and durvalumab in first-line treatment of R/M HNSCC. As of August 1  2021  40 patients were enrolled. Thirteen patients had a confirmed response with a 32.5% overall response rate (95% confidence interval (CI): 20-48)  including three complete responses. Seven out of 13 responders were still on treatment. Median duration of response was not yet reached (95% CI: 7.1-not available). The survival rate at 12 months was 58.6% (95% CI: 45-77) and the median overall survival was 15 months (95% CI: 11.4 - not available).In September 2021  AstraZeneca commenced a Phase 2 clinical study  NeoCOAST-2  that includes a treatment arm with durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy and monalizumab in resectable  early-stage NSCLC.In September 2021  AstraZeneca presented a late-breaker abstract on the randomized COAST Phase 2 trial in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC at the ESMO Congress. The presentation highlighted progression-free survival (PFS) and overall response rate (ORR) results for durvalumab in combination with monalizumab  Innate’s lead partnered asset  and oleclumab  AstraZeneca’s anti-CD73 monoclonal antibody. After a median follow-up of 11.5 months  the results of an interim analysis showed a 10-month PFS rate of 72.7% for durvalumab plus monalizumab  versus 39.2% with durvalumab alone in unresectable  Stage III NSCLC patients following chemoradiation therapy. The results also showed an increase in the primary endpoint of confirmed ORR for durvalumab plus monalizumab over durvalumab alone (36% vs. 18%).IPH5201 (anti-CD39)  partnered with AstraZeneca:AstraZeneca is conducting a Phase 1 trial in solid tumors with IPH5201 alone or in combination with durvalumab (anti-PD-L1). The data is expected to be presented in 2023.

Laure-Hélène Mercier  Executive Vice President  Chief Financial Officer and member of the Executive Board  decided to step down from her position  after leading the Company through more than 14 years of growth  including an initial public offering in the US. She left the Company on January 2022.Financial highlights for 2021:The key elements of Innate’s financial position and financial results as of and for the year ended December 31  2021 are as follows:Cash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets amounting to €159.7 million 2 (€m) as of December 31  2021 (€190.6m as of December 31  2020)  including non-current financial instruments amounting to €39.9m (€38.9m as of December 31  2020).(€m) as of December 31  2021 (€190.6m as of December 31  2020)  including non-current financial instruments amounting to €39.9m (€38.9m as of December 31  2020). As of December 31  2021  financial liabilities amount to €44.3m (€19.1m as of December 31  2020). This change is mainly linked to proceeds relating to State-Guaranteed Loans (Prêts Garantis par l’Etat “PGE”) of €28.7m from Société Générale (€20.0m) and BNP Paribas (€8.7m) collected by the Company on December 2021.Revenue and other income from continuing operations 3 amounted to €24.7m in 2021 (2020: €69.8m  -64.6%). It mainly comprises revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements (€12.1m in 2021 vs €56.2m in 2020  -78.4%)  and research tax credit (€10.3m in 2021 vs €13.1m in 2020  -21.2%): Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreement with AstraZeneca amounted to €9.1m in 2021 (€49.0m in 2020  -81.4%) and mainly resulted from (i) the spreading of the upfront and opt-in payments received from AstraZeneca and (ii) the invoicing to AstraZeneca of certain fees for the work performed by Innate for the partnered programs. The variation between the two periods is notably explained by the (i) decrease in direct monalizumab research and development costs over the period  in connection with the Phase 1 & 2 trials maturity  and (ii) the absence of revenue relating to IPH5201 in 2021  the Company having fulfilled all of its commitments on preclinical work related to the start of Phase 1 as of December 31 2020. Revenue of €3.0m from Sanofi following the initiation of a GLP-tox Study and the launching of the first Phase 1 clinical trial in humans in relapsed of refractory AML with IPH6101/SAR443579  respectively in January and December 2021. The variation in the research tax credit mainly results from a decrease in the amortization for the intangible assets related to acquired licenses (monalizumab and IPH5201).amounted to €24.7m in 2021 (2020: €69.8m  -64.6%). It mainly comprises revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements (€12.1m in 2021 vs €56.2m in 2020  -78.4%)  and research tax credit (€10.3m in 2021 vs €13.1m in 2020  -21.2%): Operating expenses from continuing operations amounted to €72.5m in 2021 (2020: €68.7m  +5.6%): General and administrative (G&A) expenses from continuing activities amounted to €25.5m in 2021 (2020: €19.0m  +34.4% 4 ). This increase results cumulatively from (i) an increase in wages mainly resulting from restructuring costs and higher annual bonuses level in 2021  (ii) an increase in non-scientific advisory fees and (iii) an increase in other general and administrative expenses. Research and development (R&D) expenses from continuing activities amounted to €47.0m in 2021 (2020: €49.7m  -5.4%). This variation mainly results from a (i) decrease in depreciation and amortization of intangible assets acquired by the Company (IPH5201  fully amortized since December 2020  and monalizumab) partly offset by (ii) an increase in direct research and development expenses (clinical and non-clinical).A net financial income of €2.3m in 2021 (2020: €1.9m loss).A net loss from Lumoxiti discontinued operations of €7.3m in 2021 (2020 : net loss of €63.2m  -88.4%) mainly resulting from the Settlement Amount of $6.2m 5 (€5.5m as of December 31  2021) to be paid to AstraZeneca on April 30  2022  as part of the Termination and Transition agreement effective as of June 30  2021. The net loss in 2020 mainly resulted from the full impairment of Lumoxiti rights following the Company decision to return the marketing rights of Lumoxiti in the United States and in Europe to AstraZeneca.(€5.5m as of December 31  2021) to be paid to AstraZeneca on April 30  2022  as part of the Termination and Transition agreement effective as of June 30  2021. The net loss in 2020 mainly resulted from the full impairment of Lumoxiti rights following the Company decision to return the marketing rights of Lumoxiti in the United States and in Europe to AstraZeneca. A net loss of €52.8m in 2021 (2020: net loss of €64.0m).The table below summarizes the IFRS consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31  2021  including 2020 comparative information.In thousands of euros  except for data per share December 31  2021 December 31  2020(1) Revenue and other income 24 703 69 773 Research and development (47 004) (49 708) Selling  general and administrative (25 524) (18 986) Total operating expenses (72 528) (68 694) Operating income (loss) (47 825) 1 079 Net financial income (loss) 2 347 (1 908) Income tax expense — — Net income (loss) from continuing operations (45 478) (829) Net income (loss) from discontinued operations (7 331) (63 155) Net income (loss) (52 809) (63 984) Weighted average number of shares outstanding (in thousands) 79 543 78 935 Basic income (loss) per share (0.66) (0.81) Diluted income (loss) per share (0.66) (0.81) Basic income (loss) per share from continuing operations (0.57) (0.01) Diluted income (loss) per share from continuing operations (0.57) (0.01) Basic income (loss) per share from discontinued operations (0.09) (0.80) Diluted income (loss) per share from discontinued operations (0.09) (0.80) December 31  2021 December 31  2020 Cash  cash equivalents and financial asset 159 714 190 571 Total assets 267 496 307 423 Shareholders’ equity 107 440 155 976 Total financial debt 44 251 19 087(1) The 2020 comparatives have been restated to consider the impact of classifying the Lumoxiti business as discontinued operations in 2021.About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma’s broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of natural killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens  as well as antibody engineering.

Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements mainly results from the spreading of the initial payments and the exercise of options related to the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015 and October 2018  on the basis of the completion of work that the Company is committed to carry out. The evolution in 2021 is mainly due to:A €26.1 million decrease in revenue related to monalizumab to €7.5 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €33.6 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This decrease is mainly explained by the decrease in direct monalizumab research and development costs over the period  in connection with the Phase 1 & 2 trials maturity. As of December 31  2021  the deferred revenue related to monalizumab amounts to €20.2 million (€12.1 million as “Deferred revenue—Current portion” and €8.0 million as “Deferred revenue—Non-current portion”).A €13.4 million decrease in revenue related to IPH5201. Nil for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €13.4 million for the year ended December 31  2020. As a reminder  as of December 31  2020  the Company having fulfilled all of its commitments on preclinical work related to the start of Phase 1 of the IPH5201 program  the initial payment of $50.0 million and the milestone payment of $5.0 million were fully recognized in revenue.A €0.9 million decrease in revenue from invoicing of research and development costs to €1.6 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €2.5 million for the year ended December 31  2020. Pursuant to our agreements with AstraZeneca  research and development costs related to avdoralimab in oncology are equally shared between us and AstraZeneca and research and development costs related to IPH5201 are fully borne by AstraZeneca. The decrease between the two periods is mainly explained by the decrease in research and development costs relating to IPH5201 re-invoiced to AstraZeneca following the transition of the program in Phase 1 clinical trial  supported AstraZeneca.A €4.0 million decrease in revenue from collaboration and research license agreement with Sanofi  to €3.0 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €7.0 million for the year ended December 31  2020. In January 2021  a GLP-tox study was initiated for the IPH6101/SAR443579 program. Additionally  in December  2021  the Company announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial launched by Sanofi in humans with IPH6101/SAR443579 in relapsed or refractory AML. These trials triggered two milestone payments from Sanofi to Innate  planned in the research collaboration between the two companies  fully recognized in revenue as of December 31  2021. As a reminder  in December 2020  Sanofi informed the Company of its intention to advance IPH6101/SAR443579 into investigational new drug (IND)-enabling studies. This decision triggered a milestone payment of €7.0 million from Sanofi to the Company  fully recognized in revenue as of December 31  2020.Government funding for research expendituresGovernment funding for research expenditures decreased by €1.0 million  or 7.5%  to €12.6 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €13.6 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This change is primarily a result of a decrease in the research tax credit of €2.8 million  which is mainly due to a decrease in the amortization expense relating to the intangible assets related to the acquired licenses (see R&D expenses).The research tax credit is calculated as 30% of the amount of research and development expenses  net of grants received  eligible for the research tax credit for the fiscal year. The Company is again eligible to the SME status under European Union criteria as of December 31  2021. Consecutively  the Company is eligible for the early repayment by the French treasury of the 2021 research tax credit during the fiscal year 2022.Operating expensesThe table below presents our operating expenses from continuing operations for the years ended December 31  2021 and 2020:In thousands of euros December 31  2021 December 31  2020(1) Research and development expenses (47 004) (49 708) Selling  general and administrative expenses (25 524) (18 986) Operating expenses (72 528) (68 694)(1) The 2020 comparatives have been restated to consider the impact of classifying the Lumoxiti business as discontinued operations in 2021.Research and development expensesResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses from continuing operations decreased by €2.7 million  or 5.4%  to €47.0 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €49.7 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This decrease mainly results from a decrease of €5.1 million in research and development depreciation and amortization of intangible assets acquired by the Company  partly offset by an increase of €3.3 million in direct research and development expenses (clinical and non-clinical). R&D expenses represented a total of 64.8% and 72.4% of the total operating expenses from continued operations for the years ended December 31  2021 and 2020  respectively.They include direct R&D expenses (subcontracting costs and consumables)  depreciation and amortization  and personnel expenses. Direct R&D expenses increased by €3.3 million  or 14.0%  to €26.7 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €23.4 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase is mainly due to: (i) a €5.0 million increase in expenses relating to the lacutamab program and (ii) a €1.5 million increase in expenses related to non-clinical development program relating notably to IPH65. These increases are partly offset by a €1.9 million and €1.3 million decreases in expenses relating to the monalizumab and avdoralimab programs  respectively.Also  as of December 31  2021  the collaboration liabilities relating to monalizumab and the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015  October 2018 and September 2020 amounted to €40.4m  as compared to collaborations liabilities of €46.7m as of December 31  2020. This decrease of €6.3m mainly results from the payments made in 2021 to AstraZeneca relating to the co-funding of the monalizumab program  including the INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 trial.Personnel and other expenses allocated to R&D decreased by €6.0 million  or 22.8%  to €20.3 million for the year ended December 2021  as compared to an amount of €26.3 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This decrease is mainly due to the decrease by €5.2 million in amortization relating to monalizumab rights (extension of the depreciation horizon due to the extension of the duration of certain clinical trials) and IPH5201 rights (full amortization at December 31  2020).General and administrative expensesGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses from continuing operations increased by €6.5 million  or 34.4%6 to €25.5 million for the year ended December 31  2021 as compared to €19.0 million for the year ended December 31  2020. G&A expenses represented a total of 35.2% and 27.6% of the total operating expenses for the years ended December 31  2021 and 2020  respectively.Personnel expenses (including share-based compensation) include the compensation paid to our employees and consultants  and increased by €2.6 million  or 31.9%  to €10.9 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €8.3 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase mainly results from an increase in wages of €2.0 million  mainly resulting from restructuring costs and higher annual bonuses level in 2021. This increase is completed by the increase in share-based payments of €0.6 million.G&A expenses also include non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses which mostly consist of auditing  accounting  legal and hiring fees. These expenses increased by €0.7 million  or 15.0%  to €5.1 million for the year ended December 31  2021  compared to an amount of €4.4 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase results mainly from (i) an increase of auditing and accounting fees  recruitment fees and investor relation consultancy fees partly offset by (ii) a decrease of costs related to the launch of the Company's new ERP in 2020 and the support by external service providers in the context of compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley law following the listing of the Company in the United States in October 2019.Other G&A expenses relate to intellectual property  the costs of maintaining laboratory equipment and our premises  depreciation and amortization and other general  administrative expenses. These expenses increased by €3.2 million or 51.5% to €9.5 million for the year ended December 31 2021  as compared to an amount of €6.3 million for the year ended December 31  2020. This increase related notably to insurance costs  which increased in fiscal year 2021  following the listing of the Company in the United States in October 2019. It also includes increases related to staff training (catch-up observed in 2021 following the impact of COVID-19 in 2020) and local taxes.Financial income (loss)  netWe recognized a net financial gain of €2.3 million for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to €1.9 million net financial loss for the year ended December 31  2020. This change results mainly from the change in the fair value of certain financial instruments (loss of €0.6 million in 2020 as compared to a €1.1 million gain in 2021) and a net foreign exchange gain of €1.2 million in 2021 as compared to a net foreign exchange loss of €1.6 million in 2020.Net loss from discontinued operationsFurther to the Company decision to terminate the Lumoxiti Agreement in December 2020  a Termination and Transition Agreement was negotiated and executed  effective as of June 30  2021 terminating the Lumoxiti Agreement as well as Lumoxiti related agreements (including the supply agreement  the quality agreement and other related agreements) and transferring the U.S. marketing authorization and distribution rights of Lumoxiti back to AstraZeneca. The marketing authorization has been transferred back to AstraZeneca which has reimbursed Innate for all Lumoxiti related costs  expenses and benefited net sales.Subsequently  operations related to Lumoxiti are presented as discontinued operations from October 1  2021.As a consequence  net result from discontinued operations relating to Lumoxiti decreased by €55.8m  or -88.4%  to a €7.3 million net loss for the year ended December 31  2021  as compared to a €63.2 million net loss for the year ended December 31  2020. Net loss for the year ended December 31  2021 mainly resulting from the Settlement Amount of $6.2m (€5.5m as of December 31  2021) to be paid to AstraZeneca on April 30  2022  as part of the Termination and Transition agreement. Net loss for the year ended December 31  2020 mainly resulted from the full impairment of Lumoxiti rights following the Company’s decision to return the marketing rights of Lumoxiti in the United States and in Europe to AstraZeneca and the costs incurred for the marketing of Lumoxiti and for our U.S subsidiary  including the related personnel costs.Balance sheet itemsCash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets (current and non-current) amounted to €159.7 million as of December 31  2021  as compared to €190.6 million as of December 31  2020. Net cash as of December 31  2021 (cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets less current financial liabilities) amounted to €89.1 million (€149.5 million as of December 31  2020).The other key balance sheet items as of December 31  2021 are:Deferred revenue of €37.9 million (including €25.4 million booked as ‘Deferred revenue – non-current portion’) and collaboration liabilities of €40.4 million (including €33.0 million booked as ‘Collaboration liability – non-current portion’) relating to the remainder of the initial payment received from AstraZeneca with respect to monalizumab  not yet recognized as revenue or used to co-fund the research and the development work performed by AstraZeneca including co-funding of the monalizumab program with AstraZeneca  notably the INTERLINK-1 Phase 3 trial;Deferred revenue of €17.4 million relating to the initial payment for preclinical molecules  entirely classified as ‘Deferred revenue – non-current portion’;Intangible assets for a net book value of €44.2 million  mainly corresponding to the rights and licenses relating to the acquisitions of monalizumab and avdoralimab (€46.3 million as of December 30  2020); variation between the two periods is mainly explained by the amortization of monalizumab rights;Current receivables of €18.4 million  mainly resulting from the French government in relation to the research tax credit for 2021 (€10.3 million).Non-current receivables from the French government in relation to the research tax credit for 2019 and 2020 of €29.8 million;Shareholders’ equity of €107.4 million  including the net loss of the period of €52.8 million;Financial liabilities amounting to €44.3 million (€19.1 million as of December 31  2020).Cash-flow itemsThe net cash flow used over the year ended December 31  2021 amounted to €33.0 million  compared to a net cash flow used of €66.1 million for the year ended December 31  2020.The net cash flow used during the period under review mainly results from the following:Net cash used from operating activities of €58.5 million  mainly explained by the net cash consumption of operating activities less the receipts for a total amount of €10.0 million from Sanofi (in January  February and December 2021) in connection with the IPH6101/SAR443579 agreement signed in 2016  following Sanofi's decision at the end of 2020 to advance IPH6101/SAR443579 towards regulatory preclinical studies for a new investigational drug  and the launch of the first related Phase 1 trial in December 2021. Restated for these receipts  net cash flows used by operating activities for the year ended December  2021 are down by €24.6 million. This decrease is mainly due to the discontinuation of Lumoxiti-related activities in connection with the Company's decision at the end of 2020 to return the commercial rights in the United States and Europe to AstraZeneca  under the termination and transition agreement signed in 2021. As a result  net cash flow consumed by operating activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation amounted to €3.6 million for the year ended December 31 2021 as compared to €22.4 million for the year 2020.Net cash used in investing activities for an amount of €0.9 million. As a reminder  net cash flow used in investing activities for the year ended December 31  2020 amounted €13.4 million which mainly resulted from (i) a €13.4 million ($15.0 million) additional consideration paid  in January 2020  to AstraZeneca regarding Lumoxiti following the submission of the Biologics License Application to the European Medicine Agency (EMA) in November 2019 (ii) a €2.7 million additional consideration paid to Orega Biotech in April 2020 regarding IPH5201 following the dosing of a first patient in a Phase 1 clinical trial  in March 2020 and (iii) the acquisition of financial assets for a net amount of €3.0 million. Such items were partially offset by the reimbursement by AstraZeneca in relation to the 2019 cost sharing mechanism for the commercialization of Lumoxiti (€7.0 million). As a result  net cash flows consumed by investing activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation were nil for year ended December 31  2021 as compared to €6.6 million for year ended December 31 2020.Net cash flows from financing activities for an amount of €26.8 million. On January 5  2022  the Company announced that it had obtained a non-dilutive financing of €28.7 million in the form of two State-Guaranteed Loans (Prêts Garantis “PGE”) from Société Générale (€20.0 million) and BNP Paribas (€8.7 million). The funds related to these two PGEs were collected by the Company on December 27 and 30  2021 respectively. Loan repayments amounted to €2.1 million for the year ended December 31  2021 compared to €2.2 million for the year ended December 31  2020. In addition  net cash flow from financing activities related to Lumoxiti discontinued operation are nil for year ended December 31  2021 and 2020  respectively.Post period eventBetween December 31  2021  closing date of the financial year  and March 23  2022  closing date of the consolidated financial statements by the Executive Board  the military operations in Ukraine took place  which began on February 24  2022 and the sanctions taken against the Russia by many States having an impact on the activity of many international groups and which will have an impact on the world economy.

See pages 137-139 of the 2020 Universal Registration Document.(2) At constant scope and exchange rates.Consolidated revenues increased by €27.8 million  or 5.6%  to €524.7 million in 2021 compared with €496.9 million in 2020. The positive scope effect of €1.3 million  or 0.3pp  was attributable to Cegedim’s first-time consolidation of new acquisitions Médimust and Kobus Tech. The positive currency impact of €1.6 million  or 0.3pp  was mainly due to the euro’s appreciation against the pound sterling.Like-for-like(2) revenues climbed 5.0% over the period.Recurring operating income(1) decreased by €1.8 million  or 4.4%  to €39.9 million in 2021 compared with €41.7 million in 2020. It represented 7.6% of consolidated revenue in 2021  compared with 8.4% in 2020. The decline is chiefly attributable to a €4.5 million negative impact from lower R&D capitalization and an increase in R&D amortization. In addition  other net non-recurring operating expenses(1) fell by €23.7 million compared with 2020.Other non-recurring operating income and expenses(1) amounted to income of €3.8 million in 2021 compared with a charge of €19.9 million in 2020. The 2021 performance is partly the result of a €4.7 million payment made by a client as part of the early termination of a services contract that was originally supposed to run through 2027. This payment was partly offset by other expenses  notably fees related to disputes or the winding up of non-recurring operations. In 2020 the amount was mainly attributable to €15.0 million of impairments of certain intangible assets related to software businesses  notably on products for doctors in the UK and Belgium.Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by €2.3 million  or 3.8%  to €64.8 million in 2021 compared to €62.5 million in 2020. Amortization related to lease contracts (IFRS 16) was virtually stable  at €16.5 million in 2021 compared to €15.9 million in 2020. The amortization of capitalized R&D expenses over the period increased by €2.7 million  or 9.0%  to €33.3 million in 2021 compared to €30.6 million in 2020. The increase was due to higher R&D capitalization in previous years. Other depreciation & amortization declined by €0.9 million to €15.0 million in 2021 from €15.9 million in 2020.EBITDA (1) increased by €0.5 million  or 0.5%  to €104.7 million in 2021  compared with €104.2 million in 2020. It represented 20.0% of consolidated revenue in 2021  compared with 21.0% in 2020.Financial result increased by €1.7 million  or 20.0%  to €10.4 million in 2021 compared with €8.6 million in 2020. The main reason for the increase was exchange rate impacts related to the pound sterling. We note that the cost of gross financial debt is stable relative to December 31  2020  because the vast majority of debt is at fixed interest rates.Total tax came to €5.8 million in 2021 compared with €2.0 million in 2020  an increase of €3.9 million or 196.8%. This change was principally the result of a combination of increased income taxes  especially for French companies  and a decrease in deferred tax assets.Net profit attributable to the owners of the parent came to €26.2 million in 2021 compared with €10.8 million in 2020. Recurring earnings per share came to €1.8 in 2021 compared with a profit of €1.2 a year earlier. Earnings per share came to €1.9 in 2021 compared with €0.8 a year earlier.Analysis of business trends by divisionSoftware & ServicesIn millions of euros 2021 2020 Change Revenue 292.0 277.2 +5.4% | Like for like (2): +4.4% Recurring operating income(1) 12.8 23.8 (46.1)% Margin 4.4% 8.6% (420) bp Operating income 12.3 6.9 +78.9% Margin 4.2% 2.5% +174 bpRevenues got a boost from stronger growth in computerization activities for health insurers  bolstered by the resumption of project-based business  which positively affected recurring operating income(1).

The acquisition cements Cegedim Santé’s place as France’s number 1 medical software company(3). Pooling the companies’ know-how and expertise is strengthening Cegedim Santé’s range of solutions and improving its ability to adapt to market developments and healthcare professionals’ changing needs.Médimust generated revenues of €1.3 million in 2020 and earned a profit. It began contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope in May 2021.Euris litigationCegedim  jointly with IQVIA (formerly IMS Health)  is being sued by Euris for unfair competition. Cegedim has asked the court to dismiss the case against the Group. On December 17  2018  the Paris Commercial Court granted Cegedim’s request  which IQVIA then appealed.

The maximum tax liability Cegedim faces as a result of the current audit is €20.3 million at December 31  2021. Cegedim still believes that there is not enough risk with respect to this amount or to tax loss carryforwards recorded on its consolidated balance sheet (corresponding to €20 million) to jeopardize their valuation.On October 21  2021  Cegedim SA received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2019  to December 31  2020.

Recurring operating income(1) should remain stable owing to the significant investments planned  especially for Cegedim Santé.These targets may need to be revised if there is a sharp resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic and/or a significant worsening of geopolitical risks.The Group does not expect to make any significant acquisitions in 2022.---------------The Audit Committee met on March 23  2022.

Over the past year  our team executed in evaluating our dynamic shRNA proprietary technology platform and introduced our armored CAR T franchise while delivering important updates across our CAR T pipeline. In addition  we expect our recently announced private placement with Fortress Investment Group to act as a catalyst for our corporate initiatives to advance our intellectual property and allogeneic CAR T product candidates ” commented Filippo Petti  Chief Executive Officer of the Company. “Although we are facing a current challenge with the CYAD-101 Phase 1b trial  the safety of our patients is our first priority  and we are focusing our efforts on the current investigation. The situation does not take away from the important work our team is doing and we believe we can look forward to announcing exciting upcoming milestones in 2022.”Update on Clinical and Preclinical ProgramsCYAD-211 – Allogeneic shRNA-based  anti-BCMA CAR T candidate for r/r MMStory continuesThe dose-escalation  Phase 1 IMMUNICY-1 trial is evaluating the tolerability and clinical activity of a single infusion of CYAD-211 following preconditioning with CyFlu (cyclophosphamide and fludarabine) in patients with r/r MM. At the 63rd American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2021  the Company presented the latest clinical data from the trial that showed a good tolerability profile and evidence of clinical activity. Data showed no dose-limiting toxicities  GvHD or CAR T-related encephalopathy syndrome (CRES). There was one Grade 1 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) event and three patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 treatment-related blood disorders. Three out of 12 total patients with r/r MM evaluated for activity achieved partial response  one in each dose-level  while eight patients had stable disease. All patients had detectable CYAD-211 cells in the peripheral blood  although engraftment was short lasting. The next segment of the IMMUNICY-1 study will evaluate CYAD-211 following enhanced lymphodepleting (eLD) regimens with the aim to improve cell expansion and persistence and potentially maximize the clinical activity of CYAD-211. In addition  the IMMUNICY-1 protocol allows for redosing of CYAD-211 in certain patients. Enrollment in the eLD cohorts of the IMMUNICY-1 trial is ongoing with additional data expected in the second half of 2022.CYAD-101 – Allogeneic TIM-based  NKG2D CAR T Candidate for Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (mCRC).In December 2021  the Company announced the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1b CYAD-101-002 (KEYNOTE-B79) Phase 1b trial. The CYAD-101-002 trial is part of a collaboration with MSD  a tradename of Merck & Co.  Inc.  Kenilworth  NJ  USA  through a subsidiary. The trial is evaluating the Company’s TCR Inhibitory Molecule (TIM)-based allogeneic NKG2D CAR T cell investigational therapy  CYAD-101  administered concurrently with FOLFOX chemotherapy  followed by MSD’s anti-PD-1 therapy  KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab)  in patients with refractory mCRC with microsatellite stable/mismatch-repair proficient disease.In February 2022  the Company voluntarily placed the Phase 1b trial on clinical hold after two fatalities occurred that presented with similar pulmonary findings. Subsequently  in March 2022  the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) put the Company on a clinical hold. The Company is currently investigating these findings and evaluating any similar events in additional patients treated on study. The Company expects to provide additional updates on the trial in the future.CYAD-101 is the only investigational candidate from the Company using the TIM technology.CYAD-203 – Preclinical allogeneic shRNA-based  IL-18-armored NKG2D CAR T for Solid TumorsPreclinical data presented at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) 36th Annual Meeting demonstrated enhanced anti-tumor activity of NKG2D CAR T cells when armored with the cytokine Interleukin-18 (IL-18)  supporting the continued development of CYAD-203 as well as future allogeneic IL-18-armored CAR T candidates.IND-enabling studies are currently in progress alongside production of the clinical grade vector. Submission of the IND application to the FDA for CYAD-203 is anticipated by year-end 2022.CYAD-02 – Autologous NKG2D receptor CAR T Candidate for relapsed or refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia or Myelodysplastic Syndrome (r/r AML / MDS)At the ASH Annual Meeting and Exposition in December 2021  the Company presented the latest clinical data from the Phase 1 CYCLE-1 dose-escalation trial of CYAD-02 for the treatment of r/r AML / MDS. Data from the trial showed that a single shRNA can target two independent genes (MICA/MICB) to enhance the phenotype of the CAR T cells. In addition  the dual knockdown of these genes showed a positive contribution to the initial clinical activity of CYAD-02 as well as a trend towards increased engraftment and persistence compared to our first-generation  autologous NKG2D receptor CAR T candidate  CYAD-01. A comparison of cellular kinetics for CYAD-02 and CYAD-01 trend towards increased engraftment and persistence of CYAD-02  potentially associated with the knockdown of MICA/MICB and reduced fratricide in vivo.Upcoming Anticipated MilestonesEnrollment in the cohorts evaluating enhanced lymphodepletion is ongoing in the CYAD-211 IMMUNICY-1 trial and additional data from the trial are expected in the second half of 2022.IND-enabling studies continue for CYAD-203  with submission of an IND application to the FDA for CYAD-203 anticipated by year-end 2022.Full Year 2021 Financial ReviewAs of December 31  2021  the Company had cash and cash equivalents of €30.0 million ($34.0 million).Based on the Company’s current scope of activities  the Company estimates that its cash and cash equivalents as of December 31  2021  combined with the remaining access to the equity purchase agreement established with Lincoln Park Capital Fund  LLC  should be sufficient to fund operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements until mid-2023.Key financial figures for full-year 2021  compared with full-year 2020  are summarized below:Selected key financial figures (€ millions) Full year 2021 Full year 2020 Revenue - - Research and development expenses (20.8 ) (21.5 ) General and administrative expenses (9.9 ) (9.3 ) Change in fair value of contingent consideration 0.8 9.2 Other income/(expenses) 3.4 4.6 Operating loss (26.4 ) (17.0 ) Loss for the period/year (26.5 ) (17.2 ) Net cash used in operations (26.6 ) (27.7 ) Treasury position(1) 30.0 17.2(1) “Treasury position” is an alternative performance measure determined by adding Short-term investments and Cash and cash equivalents from the statement of financial position prepared in accordance with IFRS. The purpose of this measure by Management is to identify the level of cash available internally (excluding external sources of financing) within 12 months.The Company’s license and collaboration agreements generated no revenue in 2021 and in 2020.Research and Development (R&D) expenses were €20.8 million in 2021 as compared to €21.5 million in 2020  a year-over-year decrease of €0.7 million. The decrease in the Company’s R&D expenses is primarily driven by the Company’s decision to discontinue the development of CYAD-01 in the fourth quarter of 2020  as well as a decrease of the expenses associated with share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrant plan offered to our employees and directors.General and Administrative (G&A) expenses were €9.9 million in 2021 as compared to €9.3 million in 2020  an increase of €0.6 million. This increase is primarily related to higher insurances costs and consulting fees partially compensated by the decrease of the expenses associated with the share-based payments (non-cash expenses) related to the warrants plan offered to our employees and directors.The fair value adjustment (€0.8 million) relating to the contingent consideration and other financial liabilities as of December 31  2021 was mainly driven by updated assumptions associated with the timing of the potential commercialization of the Company’s allogenic CYAD-101 CAR T program for mCRC and autologous CYAD-02 CAR T program for r/r AML/MDS as well as to reflect the future development of the program through potential partnership. The decrease of the liability is also driven by an update to the fair value measurement based on factors such as the weighted average cost of capital  the revaluation of the U.S. dollar against the Euro and updated assumptions on probability of success associated with the Company’s CAR T programs as of December 31  2021.The Company’s other income is associated with grants received from the Walloon Region mainly in the form of recoverable cash advances (RCAs) and R&D tax credit income:Grant income (RCAs): additional grant income has been recognized in 2021 on grants in the form of RCAs. According to IFRS standards  the Company has recognized grant income for the period amounting to €2.7 million and a liability component of €1.6 million is accounted for as a financial liability.Grant income (Others): additional grant income has been recognized in 2021 on grants received from the Federal Belgian Institute for Health Insurance Inami (€0.3 million) and from the regional government (for €1.1 million)  not referring to RCAs and not subject to reimbursement.With respect to R&D tax credit  the current year income is predicated on a R&D tax credit recorded as (€0.7 million)  which has been updated to take into account all information available as of this date and is in line with previous year.In 2021  other income was partially compensated by other expenses including the remeasurement income on the RCAs of €0.3 million for the year 2021 and amendment fees associated with the Dartmouth license agreement signed in December 2021 for €1.1 million.Net loss for the year ended December 31  2021 was €26.5 million  or €1.70 per share  compared to a net loss of €17.2 million  or €1.23 per share  for the same period in 2020. As noted above  the increase in net loss between periods was primarily due to the decrease change in fair value of contingent consideration combined with the decrease on other income/expenses.Net cash used in operations for the year ended December 31  2021  which excludes non-cash effects  amounted to €26.6 million  which is in line with net cash used in operations of €27.7 million for the year ended December 31  2020.Annual Report 2021The Annual Report for the year ended December 31  2021 will be published on March 24  2022  and will be available on the Company’s website  www.celyad.com.

The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 18  Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 10 – Approval of Remuneration ReportThe Board proposes that the AGM resolves to approve the Board's report regarding compensation pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 16 – Proposal for resolution on authorization of the Board to resolve on acquisition and transfer of the company's own sharesThe Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon acquisition of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) acquisition of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm  (ii) acquisition of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM for 2023  (iii) acquisition of shares may only be made so that the shares held by the company at any point in time does not exceed ten (10) percent of all shares in the company  (iv) acquisition of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the acquisition.Furthermore  the Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon transfer of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) transfer of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses  on market terms  (ii) transfer of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM 2023  (iii) the maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of shares held by the company at the time of the Board's resolution  (iv) transfer of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for transferred shares may be made in other forms than cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the transfer.

If the Board decides to adjust the company's capital structure in accordance with (a) above  the Board intends to propose that the company's share capital shall be decreased through share reduction of the repurchased shares.The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.A decision by the AGM on the proposal according to this item must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares present at the AGM in order for the proposal to be adopted.Item 17 – Proposal for a long-term incentive program  including hedging measures by way of a share swap agreement (LTI 2022/2024)Summary of the programThe Annual General Meetings 2019  2020 and 2021 resolved on long-term incentive programs for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (together the ""LTI Programs""). Along the lines of the LTI Programs  the Board proposes that the AGM resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (""LTI 2022/2024""). The main principles for LTI 2022/2024 are set out below.LTI 2022/2024 is proposed to include approximately 90 employees including the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group. In order to participate in LTI 2022/2024 the participants will have to invest in Series B shares in Securitas at market price or nominate series B shares already held  as further set out below. For every Series B share purchased or nominated within the scope of LTI 2022/2024  the company will award so called performance awards free of charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2022/2024 is to create a strong long-term incentive for top executives of the Group  strengthen the Group's ability to retain and recruit top executives  provide competitive remuneration  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the executives concerned by enabling the participants to become substantial shareholders in the company. Through a share-based incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board believes that the implementation of LTI 2022/2024 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and consequently that LTI 2022/2024 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personally invested sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2022/2024  the participants will  with the exceptions stated below  have to either (i) purchase Series B shares in Securitas in the market and nominate such shares to LTI 2022/2024 or (ii) nominate Series B shares vested in LTI 2019/2021 or shares nominated in LTI 2019/2021 (without affecting the condition of LTI 2019/2021  to maintain personally invested shares during the entire vesting period) (""Personally Invested Shares""). Such investment in Personally Invested Shares shall be made during a period of up to one month  to end no later than 31 December 2022 (the ""Investment Period""). The Investment Period shall be determined by the Board and the intent is that the Investment Period will commence after the completion of the acquisition of Stanley Security and the subsequent rights issue.The value of a participant's Personally Invested Shares shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share and shall correspond to minimum 5 percent (all participants) and maximum 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's base salary.If the participant has access to inside information and therefore is prevented from purchasing or nominating Personally Invested Shares during the Investment Period  the Board shall be entitled to extend or postpone the Investment Period in individual cases  but no later than to the next AGM. The Board shall further  in individual cases  be entitled to accept nomination of shares acquired prior to the Investment Period  but not earlier than 1 January 2022  and/or through e.g. a pension insurance as Personally Invested Shares  where the participant  in the Board's opinion  has valid reasons for nominating such shares to LTI 2022/2024.Participants in LTI 2022/2024 and allocationLTI 2022/2024 is proposed to include approximately 90 senior executives and key employees within the Securitas Group  divided in three categories.Category 1For each Personally Invested Share by the CEO of the Group under LTI 2022/2024  the company will award five performance awards to the CEO.Category 2For each Personally Invested Share by another member of Group management (currently thirteen individuals) under LTI 2022/2024  the relevant individual will be awarded four performance awards.Category 3For each Personally Invested Share by another participant under LTI 2022/2024  the relevant individual will be awarded three performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of Securitas Series B shares that the performance awards will entitle the participant to receive depends on the annual development of Securitas' earnings per share[1]  compared to minimum and maximum target levels as defined by the Board  during the measurement period 1 January 2022 – 31 December 2024  where each year during the measurement period is compared to the previous year. The outcome is calculated yearly  whereby one third of the performance awards is measured against the outcome for 2022  one third is measured against the outcome for 2023 and one third is measured against the outcome for 2024.If the minimum level is not reached for the relevant year  each performance award pertaining to that year will entitle participants to receive zero Series B shares  whereas if the maximum level is reached  each performance award pertaining to the relevant year will entitle participants to receive one Series B share. If the outcome falls between the minimum level and the maximum level  participants' entitlement to Series B shares will be calculated linearly between zero and one series B share per performance award. The Board intends to present the fulfilment of the performance-based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2024.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.The performance awards shall be awarded free of charge at the end of the Investment Period  subject to vesting.Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free of charge (subject to the performance condition set out above) three years after allotment of the award (the ""Vesting Period"")  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  is still employed by the Securitas Group as per 31 December 2024 and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2022/2024 during the entire Vesting Period.To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive after the Vesting Period.The number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive may be subject to recalculation due to share issues  splits  reverse splits and similar dispositions.The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The performance awards can be awarded by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2022/2024 in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Securitas Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2022/2024 no longer are appropriate. Such adjustments include a right for the Board to resolve on a reduction of the number of Series B shares that the performance awards would entitle a participant to receive  if the number of Series B shares that a participant would be entitled to – considering Securitas' result and financial position  other circumstances regarding the Group's development and the conditions on the stock market – would be clearly unreasonable.Furthermore  in the event that the Board considers that the delivery of shares under LTI 2022/2024 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Participation in LTI 2022/2024 also presumes that such participation is lawful and that such participation in Securitas' opinion can take place with reasonable administrative costs and economic efforts. The Board shall be entitled to implement an alternative incentive solution for employees in such countries where participation in LTI 2022/2024 is not advisable  which alternative solution shall  as far as practically possible  correspond to the terms of the LTI 2022/2024.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2022/2024 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 75 percent (CEO)  50 percent (other members of Group management) or 30 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to the number of Personally Invested Shares being maximized  meaning that the value of the participant's Personally Invested Shares corresponds to 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary  that the participant maintains the full amount of Personally Invested Shares during the entire Vesting Period  and that the participant  with some exceptions  still is employed as per 31 December 2024  and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved.The maximum number of Series B shares that a participant may nominate as Personally Invested Shares  and thus the total number of performance awards that may be allotted  shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share. The total number of issued shares in the company amounts to 365 058 897 shares.Based on the assumption that the share price for the company's Series B share amounts to SEK 111  LTI 2022/2024 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 661 675 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.18 percent of the total number of issued shares in the company and 0.13 percent of the total number of votes in the company.The costs for LTI 2022/2024 should be expensed as personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Provided that the performance-based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2022/2024 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 73.5 million  allocated over the Vesting Period. Estimated social security costs and financing costs are included in such amount.The Board proposes the AGM to resolve to authorize the Board to resolve on repurchase of shares in the company and to transfer such shares on a regulated market to cover social security costs and financing costs associated with LTI 2022/2024 (see separate item on the agenda).The costs for LTI 2022/2024 are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the Securitas Group.The Board deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior management and key employees  which may be further increased through LTI 2022/2024  outweighs the costs related to LTI 2022/2024.All estimates are based on at each time applicable foreign exchange rates according to Reuters. Information on previous incentive schemes for 2019  2020 and 2021 and the LTI Programs can be found in the Annual Report 2021  Notes 9 and 12.Delivery of shares under LTI 2022/2024 and hedging measuresTo ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2022/2024  the company may enter into a share-swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to employees participating in LTI 2022/2024. The cost for the swap is estimated at a maximum of SEK 600 000 assuming that the performance-based condition is fully achieved.Preparation of the proposal and voting majorityLTI 2022/2024 has been initiated by the Board and the Remuneration Committee of Securitas in consultation with major shareholders and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive schemes. LTI 2022/2024 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board. The resolution must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast  or  in case of equal voting  by the opinion supported by the Chair of the AGM.Item 18 – Proposal for amendment of the Articles of AssociationFor the purpose of adjusting the limits for the share capital and the number of shares in the Articles of Association in light of the new issue of shares with preferential right for the company's shareholders  which the Board intends to resolve upon based on the authorization from the annual general meeting proposed under item 19 of the agenda  the Board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend § 4 and the first and second section of § 5 in the Articles of Association in accordance with the following.Present wording Proposed wording § 4 The share capital shall be no less than SEK two hundred million (200 000 000) and no more than SEK eight hundred million (800 000 000). § 4 The share capital shall be no less than SEK three hundred million (300 000 000) and no more than SEK one thousand two hundred million (1 200 000 000).

1471,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ucb-sa-nv-convening-notice-060000136.html,UCB SA/NV - CONVENING NOTICE TO THE GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS 2022,*** Unofficial English translation – For convenience purposes only *** UCB SA/NV - Public Limited Liability CompanyAllée de la Recherche 60  1070...,"UCB*** Unofficial English translation – For convenience purposes only ***UCB SA/NV - Public Limited Liability CompanyAllée de la Recherche 60  1070 BrusselsEnterprise nr. 0403.053.608 (RLE Brussels)www.ucb.com(""UCB SA/NV"" or the “Company”)CONVENING NOTICE TO THE GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERSThe Board of Directors invites the shareholders for the ordinary and extraordinary general meeting of shareholders (the “General Meeting”) which will be held on Thursday  28 April 2022  at 11:00 am CEST  at the registered office of UCB SA/NV  Allée de la Recherche 60 - 1070 Brussels  for the purpose of considering and voting on the items shown on the agenda set out below.Depending on the evolution of the Covid-19 pandemic and the related measures taken by our governments and public authorities  we may need to further adapt the conditions and practicalities of the in-person participation in our General Meeting and reserve the right to communicate further instructions in this respect. As we cannot predict which Covid-19 measures shall be applicable on the day of the General Meeting  we are proposing a webcasting of the General Meeting. To mitigate potential health risks for participants  there will be no social event  reception  or catering at the occasion of our General Meeting. If you prefer to avoid in-person presence  notably for health safety reasons  you may always cast your vote by proxy by giving mandate to the person of your choice or the one proposed by UCB SA/NV and also register for the webcasting (live stream with no interactions as explained in the participation formalities below).Applicable formalities are detailed at the end of this convening notice. Shareholders may  to the extent indicated  also use the Lumi Connect platform (formerly known as AGM+ platform) ( https://www.lumiconnect.com/en/events ) to complete all participation formalities and vote by proxy at the General Meeting.ORDINARY PARTReport of the Board of Directors on the annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 Report of the statutory auditor on the annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 Communication of the consolidated annual accounts of the UCB Group relating to the financial year ended 31 December 2021 Approval of the annual accounts of UCB SA/NV for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 and appropriation of the resultsStory continuesProposed resolution :The General Meeting approves the annual accounts of UCB SA/NV for the financial year ended31 December 2021 and the appropriation of the results reflected therein  including the approval of a gross dividend of € 1.30 per share (*).(*) The UCB shares held by UCB SA/NV (own shares) are not entitled to a dividend. Therefore  the aggregate amount to be distributed to the shareholders may fluctuate depending on the number of UCB shares held by UCB SA/NV (own shares) on the dividend approval date.Approval of the remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 December 2021The Belgian Code of Companies and Associations (BCCA) requires the General Meeting to approve the remuneration report each year by separate vote. This report includes a description of the remuneration policy that was applicable in 2021 and information on remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors and of the Executive Committee. The format and content of the remuneration report are compliant with the requirements of the Law of 28 April 2020 implementing the Shareholders Right Directive II (SRD II) in Belgian law and amending the BCCA.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting approves the remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.Approval of changes to the Remuneration of the BoardIn accordance with the Belgian Corporate Governance Code 2020 (the “Code 2020”) and the BCCA  UCB’s Remuneration Policy was submitted to and approved by General Meeting of 29 April 2021. This policy was applicable as from the financial year starting on 1 January 2021. For 2022  UCB would like to propose an adjustment to this policy in relation to the remuneration of the Board of Directors  which requires the approval of the General Meeting in accordance with art 2:50 of the BCCA. The proposed change is an increase of the remuneration of the Board committee chairs  to be effective upon approval by the General Meeting. This proposal results from a benchmark review that was carried out in view to ensure that UCB SA/NV could attract the best candidates for chairing its special committees  by proposing an appropriate level of compensation  also considering that the compensation of the Board members and especially for their roles in special committees have not been reviewed nor adjusted since 2019. In addition  we observe increasing demands on our board members  in particular for our Committee Chairs  where the environment and related governance legislation have become more complex  resulting in higher workload. The proposed increased remuneration corresponds to a level closer to the regressed median of our European Pharma reference UCB peer group (i.e. relevant peer pharma median data  adjusted to UCB’s revenue size)  as disclosed in the Remuneration Report 2021 and can be summarized as follows: (i) Audit Committee Chair: from EUR 33 500 EUR (current) to EUR 45 000 (proposed); (ii) Governance  Nomination and Compensation Committee Chair: from EUR 22 500 (current) to EUR 35 000 (proposed) and (iii) Scientific Committee Chair: from EUR 33 500 (current) to EUR 35 000 (proposed).In addition  it is proposed to convert the previously approved special travel allowance for our Board members residing in a country with at least 5 hours of time zone difference with Belgium (EUR 7 500 per meeting  with at least 6 meetings per year)  into a fixed lump-sum allowance of EUR 45 000  irrespective of the actual travel. This is mainly to consider the inconvenience of attending meetings which are mostly in Europe.The other components of the remuneration of the Board remain unchanged. For more details on the total remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors  please refer to the Remuneration Report available on UCB website.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting (i) fixes the annual remuneration of the Chair of the Audit Committee at EUR 45 000  the annual remuneration of the Chair of the Governance  Nomination and Compensation Committee at EUR 35 000 and the annual remuneration of the Chair of the Scientific Committee at EUR 35 000 and (ii) approves the conversion of the travel allowance of 7 500 Euro per meeting into a fixed lump-sum travel allowance of EUR 45 000 per member of the Board of Directors residing in a country where the time zone difference with Belgium is 5 hours or more (in addition to regular travel expense reimbursement).Discharge in favour of the directorsPursuant to the BCCA  the General Meeting must  after approval of the annual accounts  vote on the discharge of liability of the directors for the financial year ended on 31 December 2021.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting grants discharge to the directors for the performance of their duties during the financial year ended 31 December 2021.Discharge in favour of the statutory auditorPursuant to the BCCA  the General Meeting must  after approval of the annual accounts  vote on the discharge of liability of the statutory auditor (Mazars).Proposed resolution :The General Meeting grants discharge to the statutory auditor for the performance of its duties during the financial year ended 31 December 2021.Directors: renewal of mandates of (independent) directorsThe mandates of Mrs. Kay Davies  Mr. Jean-Christophe Tellier and Mr. Cédric van Rijckevorsel shall expire at this General Meeting. Upon recommendation of the Governance  Nomination and Compensation Committee (“GNCC”)  the Board of Directors proposes: (i) the renewal of the mandate of Mrs. Kay Davies as independent director for a term of 4 years and (ii) the renewal of the mandate of Mr. Jean-Christophe Tellier and Mr. Cédric van Rijckevorsel as directors for a term of 4 years. While Mrs. Kay Davies reached the age limit in 2021  the Board is proposing to renew her mandate as permitted under section 3.2.4 of its Charter of Corporate Governance. Mrs. Kay Davies is chairing the Scientific Committee of the Board and is bringing a unique scientific contribution at the level of the Board. Applying the age limitation rule without exception would have led to a simultaneous change of the two scientists of the Board in the period 2021-2022. Given the long development cycles in creating new medicines that can span more than a decade  coupled with new drug research modalities such as gene therapy where UCB is investing in new platforms  proposing the re-election of Mrs. Kay Davis for a new mandate is considered by the Board the best option to maintain continuity in the follow up of this key scientific evolution for UCB. It also allows the company to count another new key scientist in the Board (Susan Gasser). Her re-election is guaranteeing that UCB maintains a sufficient level of gender diversity in the Board as requested by Belgian law. If re-elected  Mrs. Kay Davies shall continue to be the Chair of the Scientific Committee and member of the GNCC. She meets the independence criteria stipulated by article 7:87 of the BCCA  by provision 3.5 of the Code 2020 and by the Board of Directors. Subject to the abovementioned renewals by the General Meeting  the Board will continue to be composed of a majority of independent directors.Proposed resolutions :9.1. A) The General Meeting renews the appointment of Mrs. Kay Davies (*) as director for a term of four years until the close of the annual General Meeting of 2026.B) The General Meeting acknowledges that  from the information made available to the Company  Mrs. Kay Davies qualifies as an independent director according to the independence criteria provided for by article 7:87 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  by provision 3.5 of the 2020 Belgian Corporate Governance Code and by the Board and appoints her as independent director.9.2. The General Meeting renews the appointment of Mr. Jean-Christophe Tellier (*) as director for a term of four years until the close of the annual General Meeting of 2026.9.3. The General Meeting renews the appointment of Mr. Cédric van Rijckevorsel (*) as director for a term of four years until the close of the annual General Meeting of 2026.(*) Curriculum vitae and details are available at https://www.ucb.com/investors/UCB-shareholders/Shareholders-meeting-2022SPECIAL PART10. Long-Term Incentive Plans - Program of free allocation of sharesThis approval requested from the General Meeting is not as such required by Belgian law but is sought in order to ensure transparency and  as the case may be  compliance with foreign law for certain jurisdictions where our Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTI plans) are offered to our employees. For more information on UCB’s LTI plans  please refer to the 2021 remuneration report. For the avoidance of doubt  UCB confirms that it covers all its obligations under the LTI Plans with existing shares  i.e. through share buybacks  so there is no dilution for existing shareholders of UCB SA/NV.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting approves the decision of the Board of Directors to allocate an estimated number of 960 000 free shares:a) of which an estimated number of 800 000 shares to eligible employees under the Long-Term Inventive policy (LTI policy)  namely to 2 474 individuals  according to the applicable allocation criteria. These free shares will only vest if and when the eligible employees are still employed within the UCB Group three years after the grant of the awards;b) of which an estimated number of 160 000 shares to eligible employees under the Performance Share Plan  namely to 141 individuals  according to the applicable allocation criteria. These free shares will be delivered after a three-year vesting period and the number of shares actually allocated will vary from 0% to 150% of the number of shares initially granted depending on the level of achievement of the performance conditions set by the Board of UCB SA/NV at the moment of grant.The estimated figures under a) and b) do not take into account employees hired or promoted to eligible levels between 1 January 2022 and 1 April 2022.11. Change of control provisions - art. 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and AssociationsPursuant to article 7:151 of the BCCA  the General Meeting is solely competent to approve so-called ‘change of control’ clauses  i.e.  provisions whereby third parties are granted rights having a substantial influence on the assets of the Company or causing a substantial debt or liability for the Company  if the exercise of such rights depends on the launch of a public takeover bid on the shares of the Company or a change of control thereof.

This authorization is for general purposes and cannot be used in case a public takeover bid has been launched on UCB. For further information on the use and purposes of the authorized capital  please refer to the special report of the Board of Directors prepared in accordance with article 7:199 of the BCCA.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting resolves to renew the authorization to the Board of Directors to increase the capital of the Company within the framework of the authorized capital for another two (2) years  and to amend article 6 of the Articles of Association accordingly to reflect this renewal.Subject to the approval of this resolution  the text of article 6 of the Articles of Association of the Company will be amended as follows:“ Article 6The capital can be increased one or more times by a decision of a General Meeting of shareholders constituted under the conditions required to modify the Articles of Association.The Board of Directors is authorized to increase the share capital amongst other by way of the issuance of shares  convertible bonds or subscription rights  in one or more transactions  within the limits set by law i. with up to 5% of the share capital at the time of the decision of the Board of Directors to make use of this authorization  in the event of a capital increase with cancellation or limitation of the preferential subscription rights of the shareholders (whether or not for the benefit of one or more specific persons who are not part of the personnel of the Company or of its subsidiaries  as defined in the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations) ii. with up to 10% of the share capital at the time of the decision of the Board of Directors to make use of this authorization  in the event of a capital increase without cancellation or limitation of the preferential subscription rights of the existing shareholders.In any event  the total amount by which the Board of Directors may increase the share capital by a combination of the authorizations set forth in (i) and (ii) above  is limited to 10% of the share capital at the time of the decision of the Board of Directors to make use of this authorization.The Board of Directors is moreover expressly authorized to make use of this authorization  within the limits as set out under (i) and (ii) of the second paragraph above  for the following operations:1. a capital increase or the issuance of convertible bonds or subscription rights with cancellation or limitation of the preferential subscription rights of the existing shareholders 2. a capital increase or the issuance of convertible bonds or subscription rights with cancellation or limitation of the preferential subscription rights of the existing shareholders for the benefit of one or more specific persons who are not part of the personnel of the Company or of its subsidiaries  as defined in the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  and3. a capital increase by incorporation of reserves.Any such capital increase may take any and all forms  including  but not limited to  contributions in cash or in kind  with or without share premium  with issuance of shares below  above or at par value  the incorporation of reserves and/or share premiums and/or profits carried forward  to the maximum extent permitted by the law.Any decision of the Board of Directors to use this authorization requires a 75% majority within the Board of Directors.This authorization is granted for a period of two (2) years as from the date of the publication in the appendices to the Belgian Official Gazette of the resolution of the Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting held on 28 April 2022.The Board of Directors is empowered  with full power of substitution  to amend the Articles of Association to reflect the capital increase(s) resulting from the exercise of its powers pursuant to this article.”Acquisition of own shares – renewal of authorizationIn accordance with article 7:215 of the BCCA  it is proposed to the General Meeting to renew the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the extraordinary general meeting of 30 April 2020 to acquire own shares for up to 10% of the total number of shares of the Company  for two (2) years expiring on 30 June 2024. The previous authorization of 30 April 2020 will remain valid until it expires on 30 June 2022 and the new authorization will be effective as of 1 July 2022. As per previous years  this is a general-purpose authorization for share buybacks. It cannot be used in case a public takeover bid has been launched on UCB. The Board of Directors may for example (and without being limited thereto) use this authorization to service the Long-Term Incentive Plans of the UCB Group for employees and management.Proposed resolution :The Board of Directors is authorized to acquire  directly or indirectly  whether on or outside of the stock exchange  by way of purchase  exchange  contribution or any other way  up to 10% of the total number of the Company’s shares  as calculated on the date of each acquisition  for a price or an exchange value per share which will not be (i) higher than the highest price of the Company’s shares on Euronext Brussels on the day of the acquisition and (ii) lower than one (1) euro  without prejudice to article 8:5 of the royal decree of 29 April 2019 implementing the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations. As a result of such acquisition(s)  the Company  together with its direct or indirect subsidiaries  as well as persons acting on their own behalf but for the account of the Company or its direct or indirect subsidiaries  may not hold more than 10% of the total number of shares issued by the Company at the moment of the acquisition concerned. This authorization is granted for a period of two years starting on 1 July 2022 and expiring on 30 June 2024. This authorization extends to any acquisitions of the Company’s shares  directly or indirectly  by the Company’s direct subsidiaries in accordance with article 7:221 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations. The authorization granted by the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company on 30 April 2020 remains valid until 30 June 2022.Modification of Article 19  §1 of Articles of Association relating to the signature of the board minutes  to bring it in line with Article 7:95 §1 of the BCCAArticle 19  §1 of the Articles of Association of UCB SA/NV currently provides that the minutes of the Board meeting should be signed by all directors present at the meeting. This requirement is going beyond the rule of article 7:95 § 1 of the BCCA which requires that the minutes are signed by the Chair and any other director who wish to sign. It is therefore proposed to simplify this signature requirement of the Articles of Association by requesting the signature of the Chair and the Vice-Chair of the Board and any other director who wish so. Should the Chair or the Vice-Chair be unable to sign for any reason  any other director can sign the minutes. This should also help the implementation of electronic signature for the minutes of the Board. This change has no impact on shareholders rights.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting resolves to amend article 19  §1 of the Articles of Association to bring it in line with Article 7:95 §1 of the BCCA  as follows:“The proceedings of the Board shall be set down in minutes  to be kept in a special register and signed by the Chair and the Vice-Chair  as well as any other directors present at the meeting who express their wish to do so. In the event the Chair or the Vice-Chair are unable to sign for any reason  any other director can sign the minutes”.***PARTICIPATION FORMALITIESIn order to participate in the General Meeting  shareholders must comply with the following formalities:Kindly note that all due dates and times mentioned herein are the final deadlines and that these will not be extended due to a weekend  holiday or for any other reason.

As record date for the dividend  the Board proposes May 9  2022. If the AGM so resolves  the dividend is expected to be distributed by Euroclear starting May 12  2022. The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 18  Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 10 – Approval of Remuneration ReportThe Board proposes that the AGM resolves to approve the Board's report regarding compensation pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 16 – Proposal for resolution on authorization of the Board to resolve on acquisition and transfer of the company's own sharesThe Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon acquisition of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) acquisition of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm  (ii) acquisition of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM for 2023  (iii) acquisition of shares may only be made so that the shares held by the company at any point in time does not exceed ten (10) percent of all shares in the company  (iv) acquisition of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the acquisition.Furthermore  the Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon transfer of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) transfer of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses  on market terms  (ii) transfer of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM 2023  (iii) the maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of shares held by the company at the time of the Board's resolution  (iv) transfer of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for transferred shares may be made in other forms than cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the transfer. The authorization includes the right to resolve on deviation of the preferential rights of shareholders.The purpose of the proposed authorizations is to (a) allow the Board to adjust the company's capital structure  to contribute to shareholder value  (b) be able to exploit attractive acquisition opportunities by fully or partly financing future acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (c) ensure the company's undertakings in respect of share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants of incentive programs)  including covering social security costs. If the Board decides to adjust the company's capital structure in accordance with (a) above  the Board intends to propose that the company's share capital shall be decreased through share reduction of the repurchased shares.The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.A decision by the AGM on the proposal according to this item must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares present at the AGM in order for the proposal to be adopted.Item 17 – Proposal for a long-term incentive program  including hedging measures by way of a share swap agreement (LTI 2022/2024)Summary of the programThe Annual General Meetings 2019  2020 and 2021 resolved on long-term incentive programs for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (together the ""LTI Programs""). Along the lines of the LTI Programs  the Board proposes that the AGM resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (""LTI 2022/2024""). The main principles for LTI 2022/2024 are set out below.LTI 2022/2024 is proposed to include approximately 90 employees including the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group. In order to participate in LTI 2022/2024 the participants will have to invest in Series B shares in Securitas at market price or nominate series B shares already held  as further set out below. For every Series B share purchased or nominated within the scope of LTI 2022/2024  the company will award so called performance awards free of charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2022/2024 is to create a strong long-term incentive for top executives of the Group  strengthen the Group's ability to retain and recruit top executives  provide competitive remuneration  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the executives concerned by enabling the participants to become substantial shareholders in the company. Through a share-based incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board believes that the implementation of LTI 2022/2024 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and consequently that LTI 2022/2024 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personally invested sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2022/2024  the participants will  with the exceptions stated below  have to either (i) purchase Series B shares in Securitas in the market and nominate such shares to LTI 2022/2024 or (ii) nominate Series B shares vested in LTI 2019/2021 or shares nominated in LTI 2019/2021 (without affecting the condition of LTI 2019/2021  to maintain personally invested shares during the entire vesting period) (""Personally Invested Shares""). Such investment in Personally Invested Shares shall be made during a period of up to one month  to end no later than 31 December 2022 (the ""Investment Period""). The Investment Period shall be determined by the Board and the intent is that the Investment Period will commence after the completion of the acquisition of Stanley Security and the subsequent rights issue.The value of a participant's Personally Invested Shares shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share and shall correspond to minimum 5 percent (all participants) and maximum 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's base salary.If the participant has access to inside information and therefore is prevented from purchasing or nominating Personally Invested Shares during the Investment Period  the Board shall be entitled to extend or postpone the Investment Period in individual cases  but no later than to the next AGM. The Board shall further  in individual cases  be entitled to accept nomination of shares acquired prior to the Investment Period  but not earlier than 1 January 2022  and/or through e.g. a pension insurance as Personally Invested Shares  where the participant  in the Board's opinion  has valid reasons for nominating such shares to LTI 2022/2024.Participants in LTI 2022/2024 and allocationLTI 2022/2024 is proposed to include approximately 90 senior executives and key employees within the Securitas Group  divided in three categories.Category 1For each Personally Invested Share by the CEO of the Group under LTI 2022/2024  the company will award five performance awards to the CEO.Category 2For each Personally Invested Share by another member of Group management (currently thirteen individuals) under LTI 2022/2024  the relevant individual will be awarded four performance awards.Category 3For each Personally Invested Share by another participant under LTI 2022/2024  the relevant individual will be awarded three performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of Securitas Series B shares that the performance awards will entitle the participant to receive depends on the annual development of Securitas' earnings per share[1]  compared to minimum and maximum target levels as defined by the Board  during the measurement period 1 January 2022 – 31 December 2024  where each year during the measurement period is compared to the previous year. The outcome is calculated yearly  whereby one third of the performance awards is measured against the outcome for 2022  one third is measured against the outcome for 2023 and one third is measured against the outcome for 2024.If the minimum level is not reached for the relevant year  each performance award pertaining to that year will entitle participants to receive zero Series B shares  whereas if the maximum level is reached  each performance award pertaining to the relevant year will entitle participants to receive one Series B share. If the outcome falls between the minimum level and the maximum level  participants' entitlement to Series B shares will be calculated linearly between zero and one series B share per performance award. The Board intends to present the fulfilment of the performance-based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2024.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.The performance awards shall be awarded free of charge at the end of the Investment Period  subject to vesting.Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free of charge (subject to the performance condition set out above) three years after allotment of the award (the ""Vesting Period"")  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  is still employed by the Securitas Group as per 31 December 2024 and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2022/2024 during the entire Vesting Period.and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2022/2024 during the entire Vesting Period. To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive after the Vesting Period.The number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive may be subject to recalculation due to share issues  splits  reverse splits and similar dispositions.The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The performance awards can be awarded by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2022/2024 in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Securitas Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2022/2024 no longer are appropriate. Such adjustments include a right for the Board to resolve on a reduction of the number of Series B shares that the performance awards would entitle a participant to receive  if the number of Series B shares that a participant would be entitled to – considering Securitas' result and financial position  other circumstances regarding the Group's development and the conditions on the stock market – would be clearly unreasonable.Furthermore  in the event that the Board considers that the delivery of shares under LTI 2022/2024 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Participation in LTI 2022/2024 also presumes that such participation is lawful and that such participation in Securitas' opinion can take place with reasonable administrative costs and economic efforts. The Board shall be entitled to implement an alternative incentive solution for employees in such countries where participation in LTI 2022/2024 is not advisable  which alternative solution shall  as far as practically possible  correspond to the terms of the LTI 2022/2024.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2022/2024 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 75 percent (CEO)  50 percent (other members of Group management) or 30 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to the number of Personally Invested Shares being maximized  meaning that the value of the participant's Personally Invested Shares corresponds to 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary  that the participant maintains the full amount of Personally Invested Shares during the entire Vesting Period  and that the participant  with some exceptions  still is employed as per 31 December 2024  and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved.The maximum number of Series B shares that a participant may nominate as Personally Invested Shares  and thus the total number of performance awards that may be allotted  shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share. The total number of issued shares in the company amounts to 365 058 897 shares.Based on the assumption that the share price for the company's Series B share amounts to SEK 111  LTI 2022/2024 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 661 675 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.18 percent of the total number of issued shares in the company and 0.13 percent of the total number of votes in the company.The costs for LTI 2022/2024 should be expensed as personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Provided that the performance-based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2022/2024 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 73.5 million  allocated over the Vesting Period. Estimated social security costs and financing costs are included in such amount.The Board proposes the AGM to resolve to authorize the Board to resolve on repurchase of shares in the company and to transfer such shares on a regulated market to cover social security costs and financing costs associated with LTI 2022/2024 (see separate item on the agenda).The costs for LTI 2022/2024 are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the Securitas Group.The Board deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior management and key employees  which may be further increased through LTI 2022/2024  outweighs the costs related to LTI 2022/2024.All estimates are based on at each time applicable foreign exchange rates according to Reuters. Information on previous incentive schemes for 2019  2020 and 2021 and the LTI Programs can be found in the Annual Report 2021  Notes 9 and 12.Delivery of shares under LTI 2022/2024 and hedging measuresTo ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2022/2024  the company may enter into a share-swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to employees participating in LTI 2022/2024. The cost for the swap is estimated at a maximum of SEK 600 000 assuming that the performance-based condition is fully achieved.Preparation of the proposal and voting majorityLTI 2022/2024 has been initiated by the Board and the Remuneration Committee of Securitas in consultation with major shareholders and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive schemes. LTI 2022/2024 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board. The resolution must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast  or  in case of equal voting  by the opinion supported by the Chair of the AGM.Item 18 – Proposal for amendment of the Articles of AssociationFor the purpose of adjusting the limits for the share capital and the number of shares in the Articles of Association in light of the new issue of shares with preferential right for the company's shareholders  which the Board intends to resolve upon based on the authorization from the annual general meeting proposed under item 19 of the agenda  the Board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend § 4 and the first and second section of § 5 in the Articles of Association in accordance with the following.Present wording Proposed wording § 4 The share capital shall be no less than SEK two hundred million (200 000 000) and no more than SEK eight hundred million (800 000 000). § 4 The share capital shall be no less than SEK three hundred million (300 000 000) and no more than SEK one thousand two hundred million (1 200 000 000).

Shares of class A may be issued up to a maximum number of one hundred and sixty million (160 000 000) and shares of class B to a maximum number of six hundred and forty million (640 000 000). § 5 The number of shares issued shall be no less than three hundred million (300 000 000) and no more than one thousand two hundred million (1 200 000 000).

Shares of class A may be issued up to a maximum number of two hundred and forty million (240 000 000) and shares of class B to a maximum number of one thousand two hundred million (1 200 000 000).A decision by the AGM on the proposal according to this item is  according to the Swedish Companies Act  valid only if it is supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast and the shares present at the AGM and if the owners of one-half of all shares of series A and nine-tenths of the shares of series A represented at the meeting consent to the amendment of the Articles of Association.Item 19 – Proposal for resolution on authorization of the Board to resolve on new issue of sharesFor the purpose of refinancing the bridge facilities that finance Securitas' acquisition of Stanley Security  the Board proposes the AGM to authorize the Board to resolve on issue of new shares with preferential rights for the company's shareholders during the period up to the Annual General Meeting 2023. The total number of shares that may be issued shall amount to the number of shares that corresponds to issue proceeds in SEK corresponding to approximately USD 915 million  and shall be within the limits of the share capital.

As record date for the dividend  the Board proposes May 9  2022. If the AGM so resolves  the dividend is expected to be distributed by Euroclear starting May 12  2022. The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 18  Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 10 – Approval of Remuneration ReportThe Board proposes that the AGM resolves to approve the Board's report regarding compensation pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 16 – Proposal for resolution on authorization of the Board to resolve on acquisition and transfer of the company's own sharesThe Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon acquisition of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) acquisition of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm  (ii) acquisition of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM for 2023  (iii) acquisition of shares may only be made so that the shares held by the company at any point in time does not exceed ten (10) percent of all shares in the company  (iv) acquisition of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the acquisition.Furthermore  the Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon transfer of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) transfer of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses  on market terms  (ii) transfer of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM 2023  (iii) the maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of shares held by the company at the time of the Board's resolution  (iv) transfer of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for transferred shares may be made in other forms than cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the transfer. The authorization includes the right to resolve on deviation of the preferential rights of shareholders.The purpose of the proposed authorizations is to (a) allow the Board to adjust the company's capital structure  to contribute to shareholder value  (b) be able to exploit attractive acquisition opportunities by fully or partly financing future acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (c) ensure the company's undertakings in respect of share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants of incentive programs)  including covering social security costs. If the Board decides to adjust the company's capital structure in accordance with (a) above  the Board intends to propose that the company's share capital shall be decreased through share reduction of the repurchased shares.The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.A decision by the AGM on the proposal according to this item must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares present at the AGM in order for the proposal to be adopted.Item 17 – Proposal for a long-term incentive program  including hedging measures by way of a share swap agreement (LTI 2022/2024)Summary of the programThe Annual General Meetings 2019  2020 and 2021 resolved on long-term incentive programs for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (together the ""LTI Programs""). Along the lines of the LTI Programs  the Board proposes that the AGM resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (""LTI 2022/2024""). The main principles for LTI 2022/2024 are set out below.LTI 2022/2024 is proposed to include approximately 90 employees including the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group. In order to participate in LTI 2022/2024 the participants will have to invest in Series B shares in Securitas at market price or nominate series B shares already held  as further set out below. For every Series B share purchased or nominated within the scope of LTI 2022/2024  the company will award so called performance awards free of charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2022/2024 is to create a strong long-term incentive for top executives of the Group  strengthen the Group's ability to retain and recruit top executives  provide competitive remuneration  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the executives concerned by enabling the participants to become substantial shareholders in the company. Through a share-based incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board believes that the implementation of LTI 2022/2024 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and consequently that LTI 2022/2024 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personally invested sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2022/2024  the participants will  with the exceptions stated below  have to either (i) purchase Series B shares in Securitas in the market and nominate such shares to LTI 2022/2024 or (ii) nominate Series B shares vested in LTI 2019/2021 or shares nominated in LTI 2019/2021 (without affecting the condition of LTI 2019/2021  to maintain personally invested shares during the entire vesting period) (""Personally Invested Shares""). Such investment in Personally Invested Shares shall be made during a period of up to one month  to end no later than 31 December 2022 (the ""Investment Period""). The Investment Period shall be determined by the Board and the intent is that the Investment Period will commence after the completion of the acquisition of Stanley Security and the subsequent rights issue.The value of a participant's Personally Invested Shares shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share and shall correspond to minimum 5 percent (all participants) and maximum 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's base salary.If the participant has access to inside information and therefore is prevented from purchasing or nominating Personally Invested Shares during the Investment Period  the Board shall be entitled to extend or postpone the Investment Period in individual cases  but no later than to the next AGM. The Board shall further  in individual cases  be entitled to accept nomination of shares acquired prior to the Investment Period  but not earlier than 1 January 2022  and/or through e.g. a pension insurance as Personally Invested Shares  where the participant  in the Board's opinion  has valid reasons for nominating such shares to LTI 2022/2024.Participants in LTI 2022/2024 and allocationLTI 2022/2024 is proposed to include approximately 90 senior executives and key employees within the Securitas Group  divided in three categories.Category 1For each Personally Invested Share by the CEO of the Group under LTI 2022/2024  the company will award five performance awards to the CEO.Category 2For each Personally Invested Share by another member of Group management (currently thirteen individuals) under LTI 2022/2024  the relevant individual will be awarded four performance awards.Category 3For each Personally Invested Share by another participant under LTI 2022/2024  the relevant individual will be awarded three performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of Securitas Series B shares that the performance awards will entitle the participant to receive depends on the annual development of Securitas' earnings per share[1]  compared to minimum and maximum target levels as defined by the Board  during the measurement period 1 January 2022 – 31 December 2024  where each year during the measurement period is compared to the previous year. The outcome is calculated yearly  whereby one third of the performance awards is measured against the outcome for 2022  one third is measured against the outcome for 2023 and one third is measured against the outcome for 2024.If the minimum level is not reached for the relevant year  each performance award pertaining to that year will entitle participants to receive zero Series B shares  whereas if the maximum level is reached  each performance award pertaining to the relevant year will entitle participants to receive one Series B share. If the outcome falls between the minimum level and the maximum level  participants' entitlement to Series B shares will be calculated linearly between zero and one series B share per performance award. The Board intends to present the fulfilment of the performance-based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2024.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.The performance awards shall be awarded free of charge at the end of the Investment Period  subject to vesting.Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free of charge (subject to the performance condition set out above) three years after allotment of the award (the ""Vesting Period"")  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  is still employed by the Securitas Group as per 31 December 2024 and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2022/2024 during the entire Vesting Period.To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive after the Vesting Period.The number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive may be subject to recalculation due to share issues  splits  reverse splits and similar dispositions.The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The performance awards can be awarded by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2022/2024 in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Securitas Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2022/2024 no longer are appropriate. Such adjustments include a right for the Board to resolve on a reduction of the number of Series B shares that the performance awards would entitle a participant to receive  if the number of Series B shares that a participant would be entitled to – considering Securitas' result and financial position  other circumstances regarding the Group's development and the conditions on the stock market – would be clearly unreasonable.Furthermore  in the event that the Board considers that the delivery of shares under LTI 2022/2024 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Participation in LTI 2022/2024 also presumes that such participation is lawful and that such participation in Securitas' opinion can take place with reasonable administrative costs and economic efforts. The Board shall be entitled to implement an alternative incentive solution for employees in such countries where participation in LTI 2022/2024 is not advisable  which alternative solution shall  as far as practically possible  correspond to the terms of the LTI 2022/2024.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2022/2024 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 75 percent (CEO)  50 percent (other members of Group management) or 30 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to the number of Personally Invested Shares being maximized  meaning that the value of the participant's Personally Invested Shares corresponds to 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary  that the participant maintains the full amount of Personally Invested Shares during the entire Vesting Period  and that the participant  with some exceptions  still is employed as per 31 December 2024  and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved.The maximum number of Series B shares that a participant may nominate as Personally Invested Shares  and thus the total number of performance awards that may be allotted  shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share. The total number of issued shares in the company amounts to 365 058 897 shares.Based on the assumption that the share price for the company's Series B share amounts to SEK 111  LTI 2022/2024 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 661 675 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.18 percent of the total number of issued shares in the company and 0.13 percent of the total number of votes in the company.The costs for LTI 2022/2024 should be expensed as personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Provided that the performance-based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2022/2024 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 73.5 million  allocated over the Vesting Period. Estimated social security costs and financing costs are included in such amount.The Board proposes the AGM to resolve to authorize the Board to resolve on repurchase of shares in the company and to transfer such shares on a regulated market to cover social security costs and financing costs associated with LTI 2022/2024 (see separate item on the agenda).The costs for LTI 2022/2024 are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the Securitas Group.The Board deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior management and key employees  which may be further increased through LTI 2022/2024  outweighs the costs related to LTI 2022/2024.All estimates are based on at each time applicable foreign exchange rates according to Reuters. Information on previous incentive schemes for 2019  2020 and 2021 and the LTI Programs can be found in the Annual Report 2021  Notes 9 and 12.Delivery of shares under LTI 2022/2024 and hedging measuresTo ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2022/2024  the company may enter into a share-swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to employees participating in LTI 2022/2024. The cost for the swap is estimated at a maximum of SEK 600 000 assuming that the performance-based condition is fully achieved.Preparation of the proposal and voting majorityLTI 2022/2024 has been initiated by the Board and the Remuneration Committee of Securitas in consultation with major shareholders and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive schemes. LTI 2022/2024 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board. The resolution must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast  or  in case of equal voting  by the opinion supported by the Chair of the AGM.Item 18 – Proposal for amendment of the Articles of AssociationFor the purpose of adjusting the limits for the share capital and the number of shares in the Articles of Association in light of the new issue of shares with preferential right for the company's shareholders  which the Board intends to resolve upon based on the authorization from the annual general meeting proposed under item 19 of the agenda  the Board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend § 4 and the first and second section of § 5 in the Articles of Association in accordance with the following.Present wording Proposed wording § 4 The share capital shall be no less than SEK two hundred million (200 000 000) and no more than SEK eight hundred million (800 000 000). § 4 The share capital shall be no less than SEK three hundred million (300 000 000) and no more than SEK one thousand two hundred million (1 200 000 000).

Shares of class A may be issued up to a maximum number of two hundred and forty million (240 000 000) and shares of class B to a maximum number of one thousand two hundred million (1 200 000 000).A decision by the AGM on the proposal according to this item is  according to the Swedish Companies Act  valid only if it is supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast and the shares present at the AGM and if the owners of one-half of all shares of series A and nine-tenths of the shares of series A represented at the meeting consent to the amendment of the Articles of Association.Item 19 – Proposal for resolution on authorization of the Board to resolve on new issue of sharesFor the purpose of refinancing the bridge facilities that finance Securitas' acquisition of Stanley Security  the Board proposes the AGM to authorize the Board to resolve on issue of new shares with preferential rights for the company's shareholders during the period up to the Annual General Meeting 2023.

Thereby the long-term interests of the employees aligns with the interests of the shareholders. In addition  the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 will be an important tool for INVISIO to recruit  retain and motivate the company's employees and the board considers the program beneficial for both INVISIO and its shareholders in the coming years. Board members elected by the general meeting are not allowed to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.A. ADOPTION OF THE PROGRAM1. The Stock Option Program 2022/2025 in briefAll INVISIO group employees shall be entitled to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.Based on performance  position and the employee's importance to the INVISIO group  the employees will be granted stock options which entitle the participants to acquire shares in INVISIO during 2025  subject to the terms and conditions of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 (the ""Stock Options""). If the participant (i) throughout the entire vesting period of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  which runs from the allotment of the Stock Option up to and including 8 May 2025 (the ""Vesting Period"")  with certain exceptions  is employed by the INVISIO group and (ii) to the extent the performance based criteria for the Stock Options has been reached during 6 May 2022 – 8 May 2025 (the ""Measurement Period"")  the participants will be entitled to acquire shares in INVISIO during May – June 2025.To ensure INVISIO's undertaking to deliver shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  the board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 700 000 warrants (each warrant entitles to subscription for one (1) share in INVISIO) to a wholly-owned Danish subsidiary  INVISIO A/S (the ""Subsidiary""). To such extent the performance criteria of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is reached  the warrants shall be exercised to deliver shares in INVISIO to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.2. CostsPursuant to IFRS 2  the Stock Options are to be recorded as a personnel expense during the Vesting Period and should be reported directly against equity. Based on the assumption of a share price of SEK 160 at the time of allotment and calculated by using the Black & Scholes and Monte Carlo methods  the estimated total reported cost for the Stock Options is approx. SEK 13.8 million for the period 2022/2025.In the event of a positive price trend  social security costs will arise due to the Stock Options. These costs shall be written off during the tenor of the Stock Options based on the value changes of the Stock Options.Based on the assumption that all 700 000 Stock Options will be exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO on 15 May 2025  and the INVISIO share price increases with 30 per cent and outperforms the SIXPRX Index (see definition below in item 5.5) by 20 percentage points during the Vesting Period  the social security costs are estimated to be approx. SEK 3.0 million. The costs are continuously reviewed during the Vesting Period.3. Dilution and effects on important key ratiosUp to 700 000 Stock Options may be issued to the participants in the program. The maximum number of shares in INVISIO which may be subscribed for in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is 700 000  corresponding to an increase of the share capital of a maximum of SEK 700 000. Based on the current number of outstanding shares  the maximum dilution resulting from the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 will be approx. 1.5 per cent of outstanding shares and votes  provided that all Stock Options are exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO. The total dilution resulting from all Stock Options being exercised to acquire new shares in INVISIO in Stock Option Program 2019/2022  Stock Option Program 2020/2023 and Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is approximately 4.1 per cent based on the number of outstanding shares and votes as of today.The costs and dilution are expected to have only a marginal effect on the key ratios of INVISIO.4. Other share related incentive programsThere are two ongoing share related incentive programs in INVISIO  the Stock Option Program 2019/2022  adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2019  and the Stock Option Program 2020/2023  adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020.5. Main terms and conditions for the Stock Option Program 2022/20255.1 Issuance and allotment of Stock OptionsA maximum of 700 000 Stock Options may be allotted to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.

Persons who  at the time of allotment  have resigned from their employment  or who have been dismissed from their employment by INVISIO  will not be granted Stock Options. Future employees  who have not yet commenced their employment at the time of allotment  may  conditioned upon that the employment commences on 1 December 2022 at the latest  be offered to participate in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 if the board considers it compatible with the objective of the program.The participants may be granted the maximum number of Stock Options as stated below.Category 1 – CEO may be granted a maximum of 24 000 Stock Options.Category 2 – a maximum of six senior executives  may be granted a maximum of 12 000 Stock Options per person.Category 3 – other employees  approx. 183 persons  may be granted a maximum of 6 000 Stock Options per person.Allotment of Stock Options shall be based on inter alia the participant's performance  position and importance for INVISIO.No employee is guaranteed to be granted Stock Options.5.3 Stock Option price and purchase priceThe granted Stock Options are received free of charge.After the Stock Options have been granted and vested  and to the extent the performance criteria for the Stock Options have been reached  each Stock Option entitles to the acquisition of one (1) share in INVISIO at a price corresponding to the average share price of INVISIO's share during the period 1 April 2022 – 30 April 2022 (the ""Purchase Price""). The average share price shall be calculated as the average for each trading day calculated average volume-weighted price paid for the INVISIO share on Nasdaq Stockholm  round off to the nearest full ten öre whereby five öre shall be round off upwards.5.4 Vesting conditionsIf  for whatever reason  a participant's employment with the INVISIO group would come to an end before the end of the Vesting Period  the Stock Options will lapse and cannot be exercised.

(SIXPRX displays the average development (including dividends) on Nasdaq Stockholm adjusted for stock fund placement limitations.)In order for all (100 per cent) of the Stock Options to entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO it is required that the share price development for INVISIO surpasses SIXPRX with 20 percentage points. If the share price development surpasses SIXPRX with 10 percentage points  half (50 per cent) of the participant's Stock Options will entitle the participant to acquire shares in INVISIO. If the share price development for the INVISIO share surpasses SIXPRX with more than 10 but with less than 20 percentage points  the Stock Options will entitle to acquisition of shares in INVISIO on a linear basis between 50 to 100 per cent. If the share price development in INVISIO does not surpasses SIXPRX with 10 percentage points  all (100 per cent) of the Stock Options will lapse.5.6 ExerciseThe exercise of Stock Options to acquire new shares in INVISIO may  to the extent the performance criteria for the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 is reached and the participant has fulfilled the vesting conditions  occur during the period 15 May – 30 June 2025 (the ""Exercise Period"").The Exercise Period may be postponed if the board deems it suitable.The Stock Options will automatically lapse and may no longer be exercised at the end of the Exercise Period.5.7 Transfer and pledgingStock Options are non-transferrable and may not be pledged.5.8 RecalculationAs far as the warrants  which have been issued to secure delivery of shares to the participants in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  are subject to recalculation according to the terms and conditions for warrants  the Stock Options shall be recalculated accordingly.Recalculation shall take place in the event of e.g. bonus issues  rights issues  reverse share splits and share splits in accordance with the terms and conditions for warrants 2022/2025  which are available on INVISIO's website.5.9 Change of controlIn the event of a change of control in INVISIO  which inter alia includes that someone  directly or indirectly  owns or controls 50 per cent or more of the votes in INVISIO as well as in certain other events  participants have a right to exercise granted Stock Options in advance  i.e. even during the Vesting Period.5.10 Preparation and administrationThe Stock Options shall be subject to the provisions of separate agreements with each participant.The board shall be responsible for preparing the agreements with the participants and the administration of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  with its primary terms and conditions being in accordance with the resolution by the Annual General Meeting.

Further  the board may make other adjustments  including to resolve to reduce the number of Stock Options which may be exercised to acquire new shares (wholly or partially) for all employees or certain categories of employees which are encompassed by the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  if significant changes occur in the INVISIO group or on the market that the board considers entailing that the conditions for acquisition of new shares in the Stock Option Program 2022/2025 no longer fulfils the objective of the Stock Option Program 2022/2025.B. ISSUANCE OF WARRANTSIn order to secure the delivery of shares pursuant to the Stock Option Program 2022/2025  the board of INVISIO proposes that INVISIO  deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues a maximum of 700 000 warrants  Series 2022/2025  entitling to subscription of new shares in INVISIO as follows.1. The warrants shall be issued free of charge.

The term of subscription may be extended by the board.4. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of shares from the day the warrants are registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 31 December 2025.5. The warrants shall have a subscription price at subscription of new share corresponding to the average share price of the INVISIO share during the period 1 April 2022 – 30 April 2022 (i.e. the same price as the Purchase Price  defined in item A).

Most Read from BloombergChina Plane Crash Update: Search Continues for Second Black BoxPutin Adviser Chubais Quits Over Ukraine War ,(Bloomberg) -- Russia faces another hurdle in servicing its international debt just days before fresh interest payments come due.Most Read from BloombergThe National Settlement Depository in Moscow  which receives the Russian government’s payments on some of its foreign bonds for distribution  announced Friday that one path for those funds had been frozen.The NSD’s account with Clearstream -- the Luxembourg-based bank that settles the payments -- was blocked on March 24  the Russian company said in a statement on its website. A decision to restart would be based on a review by regulators in Luxembourg  it said.A Clearstream spokeswoman declined to comment.The latest move adds to the web of restrictions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine triggered sweeping sanctions and capital controls. Since the penalties were imposed  investors have pored over company and government bond payments at every stage of their journey to holders’ accounts.“Every twist further not only makes the technical ability to pay harder for Russia  it tests the limits of its willingness to pay ” said Lutz Roehmeyer  the chief investment officer at Berlin-based Capitulum Asset Management GmbH. “If Russia is isolated completely it could lead to a situation where paying foreign debt makes no sense anymore.”Some restrictions already exist for the other big settlement system -- Euroclear -- and the Clearstream decision could make the process more fraught.Next week  the government is due to make two interest payments for almost $190 million in total on dollar-denominated bonds  including one due March 31 that’s slated to be handled by Clearstream.Story continuesDespite warnings from credit-rating agencies and a delayed coupon payment this week  the government has so far avoided a default since the war started. Investors have written down the value of their Russian holdings  with the nation set to be removed next week from all of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s bond indexes that global funds are benchmarked against.READ MORE: All Five NYC Pensions Will Quit Russian Assets  Citing InvasionRussian companies whose owners have been hit by sanctions have also encountered roadblocks along the way.Severstal  a steel and mining company majority owned by Russian billionaire Alexey Mordashov -- who is sanctioned in the EU and the U.K. but not in the U.S. -- inched closer to a default after Citigroup Inc. blocked a coupon payment whose grace period expired on Wednesday.Evraz WoesA payment from Evraz  another steel and mining company in which billionaire Roman Abramovich has a stake  was processed after being initially blocked by Societe Generale SA. Abramovich is similarly subject to sanctions in the EU and the U.K. but not the U.S.Clearstream has so far been involved in successful payments for companies including natural-gas giant Gazprom PJSC and state leasing company GTLK  as well as $117 million of coupons paid by the sovereign last week.The settlement system won’t participate in Russia’s next interest payment due on 28 March -- a $102 million coupon on notes maturing in 2035  which comes with an option to pay in rubles.But three days later  Russia’s $87.5 million coupon on notes maturing in 2030 is due  and Clearstream will help settle that payment  according to the bond’s prospectus.A month into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  and with international sanctions intensifying  some investors say default is a matter of time.“Russia’s bonds are already pricing in a huge amount of uncertainty ” said Matthew Morgan  a London-based investment director for fixed-income and multi-asset strategies at Jupiter Asset Management.“The big question here is at what point does Russia just decide not to pay -- that’s way more important than these technicalities.”(Updates with comment from Clearstream in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.03,0.45,0.52,mixed,0.04,0.19,0.77,True,English,"['Bond Payment Uncertainty', 'Clearstream Hurdle', 'Russia', 'Berlin-based Capitulum Asset Management GmbH', 'natural-gas giant Gazprom PJSC', 'state leasing company GTLK', 'The National Settlement Depository', 'other big settlement system', 'Jupiter Asset Management', 'chief investment officer', 'Five NYC Pensions', 'Societe Generale SA', 'London-based investment director', 'fresh interest payments', 'two interest payments', 'mining company majority', 'next interest payment', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'billionaire Roman Abramovich', 'A Clearstream spokeswoman', 'government bond payments', 'The NSD', 'big question', 'Russian billionaire', 'Russian company', 'successful payments', 'international debt', 'one path', 'Luxembourg-based bank', 'latest move', 'capital controls', 'holders’ accounts', 'technical ability', 'Lutz Roehmeyer', 'foreign debt', 'credit-rating agencies', 'Russian holdings', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'bond indexes', 'Russian Assets', 'Alexey Mordashov', 'U.K.', 'U.S.', 'Citigroup Inc.', 'grace period', '$102 million coupon', '$87.5 million coupon', 'huge amount', 'Matthew Morgan', 'multi-asset strategies', 'fourth paragraph', 'coupon payment', 'Russian government', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'foreign bonds', 'dollar-denominated bonds', 'sweeping sanctions', 'global funds', 'Russian companies', 'Evraz Woes', 'international sanctions', 'Clearstream decision', 'hurdle', 'Moscow', 'distribution', 'March', 'statement', 'website', 'review', 'regulators', 'restrictions', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'penalties', 'investors', 'stage', 'journey', 'limits', 'willingness', 'situation', 'sense', 'Euroclear', 'process', 'total', 'Story', 'warnings', 'default', 'value', 'Co.', 'All', 'owners', 'roadblocks', 'way', 'Severstal', 'steel', 'Wednesday', 'stake', 'coupons', 'sovereign', 'notes', 'option', 'rubles', 'prospectus', 'matter', 'time', 'uncertainty', 'fixed-income', 'point', 'technicalities', 'Updates', 'comment']",2022-03-25,2022-03-25,ca.finance.yahoo.com

Adoption of the annual accounts8. Resolution on the use of the profit shown on the balance sheet and the payment of dividendThe distributable funds on the balance sheet of the Company as at 31 December 2021 were EUR 104 524 157.76  of which the profit for the financial year 2021 was EUR 22 587 579.69. The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of EUR 0.20 per share to be distributed for the year 2021 and that the other distributable earnings be held in unrestricted equity (for the year 2020 a dividend of EUR 0.24 per share was distributed). The Board proposes that the dividend for the financial year 2021 will be paid in two instalments. The first dividend instalment  EUR 0.08 per share  is to be paid to shareholders registered in the Company's register of shareholders maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd on the first dividend instalment payment record date of April 22  2022.

The Board proposes that it be authorized to decide  if necessary  on a new dividend payment record date and pay date for the second instalment if the rules and statutes of the Finnish book-entry system change or otherwise so require.Since the dividend proposed by the Board of Directors is less than the minority dividend set forth in Chapter 13 Section 7 of the Finnish Companies Act  the company shall distribute the minority dividend if a demand to this effect is made by shareholders who have at least one tenth of all shares. The amount of minority dividend equals half of the profit of the financial year but cannot exceed 8 % of the company's own equity.

The dividend proposed by the Board of Directors  EUR 0.20 per share  equals a total of EUR 7 996 061.20 calculated based on the amount of shares on the date of this notice.

It is proposed that the other provisions on the date of appointment and composition of members be accordingly brought forward by one month.After the amendment  the second and third paragraph of Section 2 of the Rules of Procedure would read as follows:""The right to appoint members representing the shareholders belongs to the three (3) shareholders  whose proportions of the votes of all shares of the Company are the largest  according to the shareholder register held by the Euroclear Finland Oy on the first business day of August preceding the Annual General Meeting. If a shareholder who has decentralized their holdings  for example to multiple funds  and who has a responsibility according to the Securities Law (746/2012  with amendments) to take these holdings into account when announcing the changes in their share of ownership  presents at the latest on the last business day of July preceding the Annual General Meeting  a written and justifiable request regarding the matter to the Chairman of the Board of Directors  the holdings of such a shareholder in several funds or register shall be added together when calculating the decisive voting power.If an owner of nominee registered shares wishes to use their right to appointment  they must present reliable evidence of the number of shares owned by them on the first business day of August of the year preceding the Annual General Meeting.

The index assesses the readiness of the states in terms of their export performance and potential.The coastal states are the best performers in the Export Preparedness Index 2021 prepared by the NITI Aayog  in partnership with the Institute of Competitiveness.

A decision to restart would be based on a review by regulators in Luxembourg  it said.A Clearstream spokeswoman declined to comment.The latest move adds to the web of restrictions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine triggered sweeping sanctions and capital controls. Since the penalties were imposed  investors have pored over company and government bond payments at every stage of their journey to holders’ accounts.“Every twist further not only makes the technical ability to pay harder for Russia  it tests the limits of its willingness to pay ” said Lutz Roehmeyer  the chief investment officer at Berlin-based Capitulum Asset Management GmbH. “If Russia is isolated completely it could lead to a situation where paying foreign debt makes no sense anymore.”Some restrictions already exist for the other big settlement system -- Euroclear -- and the Clearstream decision could make the process more fraught.Next week  the government is due to make two interest payments for almost $190 million in total on dollar-denominated bonds  including one due March 31 that’s slated to be handled by Clearstream.Story continuesDespite warnings from credit-rating agencies and a delayed coupon payment this week  the government has so far avoided a default since the war started.

Others hit several days late. And an increasing number are getting stuck in a web of financial intermediaries that are struggling to comply with international sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies.,(Bloomberg) -- Some payments arrived on time. Others hit several days late. And an increasing number are getting stuck in a web of financial intermediaries that are struggling to comply with international sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies.Most Read from BloombergA month since the country’s invasion of Ukraine  investors are starting to realize just how narrow the path is for Russia -- and some of its biggest corporations -- to avoid default. That’s casting a pall over a country that was once a darling of emerging-market investors and now looks set to lose 15 years of economic gains by the end of 2023  according to one estimate.“The longer this goes on the uglier it is likely to get ” said Lee Buchheit  a sovereign debt expert who advised Russia and dozens of other countries on debt restructuring. “Putin has put the Russian Federation in a situation where it is a pariah diplomatically  economically and even socially in most of the world. Is he really going to lose a lot of sleep thinking that he has stained his external debt record? I don’t think so.”The Russian government has so far managed to make coupon payments on three of its Eurobonds  including one due this week  although not without some delays.Yet on Friday Russia’s National Settlement Depository said operations via Clearstream  one of the biggest clearinghouses in the world  haven’t been going through since Thursday  when its account was blocked. That makes it unclear how the sovereign will get payments on certain bonds to foreign investors.Russian companies whose owners have been hit by sanctions have already hit roadblocks  in spite of showing every intention to pay.Story continuesSeverstal  a steel and mining company majority owned by Russian billionaire Alexey Mordashov -- who is sanctioned in the EU and the U.K. but not in the U.S. -- inched closer to a default after Citigroup Inc. blocked a coupon payment whose grace period expired on Wednesday.A payment from Evraz  another steel and mining company in which billionaire Roman Abramovich has a stake  has reached the paying agent after being initially blocked by Societe Generale SA. Abramovich is similarly subject to sanctions in the EU and the U.K. but not the U.S.Other companies including natural gas giant Gazprom and Russian Railways have payments due this month.“The trading system is breaking down ” Robert Koenigsberger  chief investment officer at Gramercy Funds Management said in a webcast this week. “It is more likely than not that we will see a default in Russia.”Companies in countries from Slovakia to Turkey have also started to feel the financial impact of the conflict  especially if they have direct exposure to Russia. Emerging market corporate debt has lost $49 billion in value over the past month alone  according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The value destruction has been quite immense for investors ” said Anthony Kettle  an emerging-markets portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management. “As a consequence to all this  value probably looks good in EM  but it is a reminder of the tail risk events that can occur.”Sanctions and varying interpretations of sanctions by the financial intermediaries along the payment chain have led bondholders to run daily checks with their back office and custodians to confirm whether funds have been received.Citigroup is the paying agent for about four dozen bonds tied to Russian companies  according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While some -- including Gazprom and Norilsk Nickel -- have successfully made coupon payments in recent days  others have seen payments stall. In addition to Severstal  Citigroup has blocked a $19.3 million interest payment sent by EuroChem Group.In yet another twist  search engine provider Yandex is at risk of default because its debt is convertible into shares that have been suspended as part of the sanctions  which has led the company to hire restructuring advisers.Still  some investors are beginning to spot pockets of value in Russian bonds as interest payments  for the most part  continue to be made  especially in nearer-term maturities.“The willingness of the Russian corporate and sovereign borrowers to pay coupons and service their debt is encouraging ” said Persella Ioannides  a portfolio manager at MeritKapital  a money manager with emerging markets investments. “Moves by the central bank of Russia and the Kremlin to support the ruble will also help cashflows.”Others see the potential for a domino effect where investors want out  traders step back from facilitating transactions and the settlement system fails.“We don’t think investing in Russia makes any sense here at all ” said Koenigsberger.(Updates with potential impact on Russian economy in second paragraph and drop in value for emerging market corporate debt in 11th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.02,0.3,0.68,mixed,0.08,0.13,0.79,True,English,"['Russia High-Wire Act', 'Default Leaves', 'Bondholders', 'Edge', 'natural gas giant Gazprom', 'Emerging market corporate debt', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'emerging markets investments', 'Societe Generale SA', 'chief investment officer', 'BlueBay Asset Management', 'search engine provider', 'external debt record', 'National Settlement Depository', 'Gramercy Funds Management', 'tail risk events', 'four dozen bonds', 'emerging-markets portfolio manager', 'sovereign debt expert', 'billionaire Roman Abramovich', '$19.3 million interest payment', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Russian corporate', 'Russian billionaire', 'debt restructuring', 'settlement system', 'money manager', 'Russian Federation', 'Russian government', 'Russian Railways', 'Russian bonds', 'Russian economy', 'increasing number', 'financial intermediaries', 'biggest corporations', 'economic gains', 'one estimate', 'Lee Buchheit', 'biggest clearinghouses', 'Alexey Mordashov', 'U.K.', 'U.S.', 'coupon payment', 'grace period', 'paying agent', 'trading system', 'financial impact', 'direct exposure', 'past month', 'Anthony Kettle', 'varying interpretations', 'payment chain', 'daily checks', 'back office', 'Norilsk Nickel', 'recent days', 'EuroChem Group', 'restructuring advisers', 'nearer-term maturities', 'sovereign borrowers', 'Persella Ioannides', 'central bank', 'domino effect', 'second paragraph', '11th paragraph', 'Russian companies', 'interest payments', 'Other companies', 'mining company', 'other countries', 'Robert Koenigsberger', 'most part', 'potential impact', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'emerging-market investors', 'foreign investors', 'Citigroup Inc.', 'value destruction', 'international sanctions', 'time', 'Others', 'web', 'allies', 'country', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'path', 'default', 'pall', 'darling', '15 years', 'end', 'uglier', 'dozens', 'situation', 'pariah', 'world', 'lot', 'sleep', 'Eurobonds', 'delays', 'Friday', 'operations', 'Clearstream', 'Thursday', 'account', 'owners', 'roadblocks', 'spite', 'intention', 'Story', 'Severstal', 'steel', 'Wednesday', 'Evraz', 'stake', 'Slovakia', 'Turkey', 'conflict', 'data', 'consequence', 'reminder', 'bondholders', 'custodians', 'addition', 'twist', 'Yandex', 'shares', 'pockets', 'willingness', 'coupons', 'MeritKapital', 'Moves', 'Kremlin', 'ruble', 'cashflows', 'traders', 'transactions', 'sense', 'Updates']",2022-03-25,2022-03-25,nz.finance.yahoo.com

March 25  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Kalera AS (“Kalera” or the “Company”) (Euronext Growth Oslo: KAL  Bloomberg: KSLLF)  one of the preeminent leafy green vertical farming companies and a leader in plant science for producing high-quality produce in controlled environments  today announced that Curtis McWilliams will become Chairman of the Board upon the completion of its previously announced merger with its Luxembourg subsidiary Kalera S.A. (the ""LuxCo merger"")  which is expected to be completed in April. McWilliams is currently serving as Interim CEO of Kalera while Heidrick & Struggles continues to make progress in its search for a permanent CEO. That search is progressing well. McWilliams will relinquish his Interim CEO role once the permanent CEO is in place.“Curtis is the ideal candidate to serve as Chairman of Kalera’s board”  said Kim Lopdrup  a Kalera Director. “Curtis has extensive experience in leading the boards of several U.S. public companies and  given his service as Interim CEO of Kalera  he understands Kalera’s story at an intimate level. He has developed strong trust and followership among employees  business partners  and investors.”“I am very excited about this opportunity ” said McWilliams. “While Kalera offers a portfolio of incredible products and technology  its greatest asset is the knowledge and proven execution the management team contributes to our business. They have an unwavering commitment to achieving our vision of growing the freshest  cleanest  most nutritious leafy greens for people around the globe.”McWilliams is a veteran executive with over 25 years of experience in finance and Real Estate. He currently serves as Non-Executive Chairman of Ardmore Shipping Corporation (NYSE: ASC)  as a Director of Braemar Hotels and Resorts (NYSE: BHR)  and as a Director of Modiv  Inc. (NYSE: MDV).

He earned an MBA with a concentration in Finance from the University of Chicago and a Bachelor of Science in Engineering degree from Princeton University.McWilliams was proposed to join Kalera’s board on June 28  2021; elected to the board on November 1  2021 with effect from completion of the LuxCo merger; and appointed Interim CEO on December 9  2021.Lopdrup was previously proposed and elected as Kalera’s next Chairman  but he has informed Kalera’s Board that some recent personal developments will make it impossible for him to continue giving Kalera the time and attention the company needs and deserves. Lopdrup said  “I have greatly enjoyed my time on Kalera’s Board. The company grows the best leafy greens I have ever tasted. They are ultra-fresh  ultra-clean and ultra-sustainable. The employees are amazing  too. I am sad that I will not be able to actively participate in the next phase of the Company’s journey  but I will continue to cheer the team on as they implement their exciting plans and will forever be a loyal customer.”About Kalera: Kalera is a vertical farming company headquartered in Orlando  Florida.

As a practicing physician regularly seeing people living with this uncommon form of cancer  I am encouraged to see the potential Cabometyx may bring for these patients with so few options.”The CHMP positive opinion was based on results from the pivotal COSMIC-311 Phase III trial in which  at a planned interim analysis with a median follow-up of 6.2 months  Cabometyx demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by 78% versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.22; 96% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.36; p<0.0001).1 Another primary endpoint  the objective response rate (ORR)  also favoured Cabometyx with 15% vs. 0% for placebo (p=0.028) at a median follow-up of 8.9 months  but did not meet the criteria for statistical significance. A further analysis  with a median follow-up of 10.1 months  was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2021  whereby Cabometyx continued to demonstrate superior median progression-free survival of 11.0 versus 1.9 months and a maintained reduction in the risk of disease progression or death of 78% versus placebo (HR: 0.22  96% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15-0.32; p<0.0001).2 The safety profile identified in the COSMIC-311 trial across the two analyses was consistent with that previously observed for Cabometyx  and adverse events were managed with dose modifications.1 2Steven Hildemann  M.D. PhD  Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Head of Global Medical Affairs and Global Patient Safety at Ipsen  said “ With the promising interim results from the COSMIC-311 trial further reinforced by the maintained significant progression-free survival benefit demonstrated in the final analysis  we are pleased that the CHMP has concluded that Cabometyx may offer an important treatment option for people affected by this uncommon cancer. Following this positive opinion  we look forward to receiving the final decision from the European Commission  potentially bringing Cabometyx one step closer to reaching a patient population in critical need of new treatment options.”This positive CHMP opinion follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval in September 2021 of Cabometyx for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic DTC that has progressed following prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible.About radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAI-R DTC)In 2020  over 580 000 new cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed worldwide.3 Thyroid cancer is the ninth most commonly occurring cancer globally and incidence is three times higher in women than in men  with the disease representing one in every 20 cancers diagnosed among women.3 While cancerous thyroid tumors include differentiated  medullary and anaplastic forms  differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) makes up about 90 to 95% of cases.5 6 These include papillary  follicular and Hürthle cell cancer.5 6 DTC is typically treated with surgery  followed by ablation of the remaining thyroid tissue with radioactive iodine (RAI)  but approximately 5 to 15% of cases are resistant to RAI treatment.7 Patients who develop RAI-R DTC have a poor prognosis with an average estimated survival of three to five years.8About the COSMIC-311 trialCOSMIC-311 is a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial that enrolled 258 patients at 164 sites globally.1 2 Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Cabometyx 60 mg or placebo once-daily.1 The primary endpoints were progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population as well as ORR in the first 100 randomly assigned patients (objective response rate intention-to-treat [OITT] population)  both evaluated by a blinded independent radiology committee. Additional endpoints include safety  overall survival and quality of life.1 Exelixis is the sponsor of COSMIC-311  and Ipsen is co-funding the trial. More information about this trial is available at ClinicalTrials.gov.About Cabometyx (cabozantinib)In the U.S.  Cabometyx tablets are approved for the treatment of people living with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC); for the treatment of people living with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib; for people living with RAI-R DTC who have been previously treated with VEGFR-targeted therapy; and for patients living with advanced RCC as a first-line treatment in combination with nivolumab.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ""believes""  ""anticipates"" and ""expects"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons and also taking into consideration assessment delays of certain clinical trials in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances  new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

Any person subsequently offering  selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however  a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.The information provided in this release and any offer materials relating to the Notes are addressed to and directed only at persons in the United Kingdom (a) that have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (the “Order”)  (b) falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies  unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Order  (c) to whom this announcement may otherwise be directed without contravention of Section 21 of the FSMA or (d) to whom this announcement may otherwise be lawfully communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”).

The human papilloma virus (HPV)  which is a sexually transmitted infection  is implicated in most cases of cervical cancer  though the factors that lead an infection with HPV to become cancerous are unknownvi. While cervical cancer is highly preventable and treatable  and Canada has set the goal of eliminating cervical cancer by 2040iii  in 2021 an estimated 1450 Canadians were diagnosed with the disease  and 380 died as a result of itvii.About LibtayoLibtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T-cells. By binding to PD-1  Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation.The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Current clinical development programs include Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC irrespective of PD-L1 expression and Libtayo in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational  and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.Libtayo is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people's lives.

March 25  2022 /PRNewswire/ --Stellantis unveiled its new 3.0-liter Hurricane twin-turbo inline six-cylinder engine that delivers better fuel economy and fewer emissions than larger engines while at the same time generates more horsepower and torque than many naturally aspirated V-8 and boosted six-cylinder powerplants. The 3.0-liter Hurricane twin-turbo I-6 HO  shown  generates more than 500 hp.New 3.0-liter Hurricane twin-turbo inline six-cylinder engine puts out less tailpipe emissions and uses less gasoline than larger engines  yet delivers V-8 levels of powerRobust architecture enables Stellantis propulsion systems to deliver two distinct variants – one tuned for efficiency  one tuned for performanceHurricane twin-turbo I-6 designed to account for potential future integration with electrification for low-emission vehicles (LEVs)State-of-the-art technologies include Plasma Transfer Wire Arc (PTWA) sprayed cylinder coating  high-pressure gasoline direct injectionFirst vehicles with Hurricane reach dealership showrooms this yearCleaner-running Hurricane twin-turbo moves Stellantis toward its commitment of a 50% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030 and to be Carbon Net Zero by 2038  key elements of the Dare Forward 2030 strategic planStellantis today revealed its new  3.0-liter  twin-turbo  inline  six-cylinder engine  named Hurricane  that delivers better fuel economy and fewer emissions than larger engines while at the same time generates more horsepower and torque than many competitors' naturally aspirated V-8 and boosted six-cylinder power plants.Designed with an inherently smooth-running I-6 configuration and state-of-the-art technology  the Hurricane twin-turbo's robust base architecture enables Stellantis propulsion systems engineers to create two distinct variants:Standard Output (SO): Optimized for fuel economy  including the use of cooled exhaust gas circulation (EGR)  while delivering enhanced power and torque (more than 400 hp/450 lb.-ft. of torque)High Output (HO): Optimized for great performance (more than 500 hp/475 lb.-ft.) while maintaining significant fuel economy during heavy use  such as towing.The Hurricane twin-turbo achieves this V-8-rivaling performance while being up to 15% more efficient than larger engines.""As Stellantis aims to become the U.S. leader in electrification  with a 50% battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales mix by 2030  internal combustion engines will play a key role in our portfolio for years to come and we owe it to our customers and the environment to provide the cleanest  most efficient propulsion possible "" said Micky Bly  Stellantis head of propulsion systems. ""The Hurricane twin-turbo is a no-compromise engine that delivers better fuel economy and an important reduction in greenhouse gases without asking our customers to give up performance.""Story continuesReducing greenhouse gas emissions is one part of Stellantis' commitment to cut its carbon footprint by 50% by 2030 and to lead the transportation industry by achieving Net Carbon Zero by 2038. Those goals are key elements of the Stellantis Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan.Specific horsepower and torque ratings will vary based on vehicle. The first vehicles powered by the Hurricane twin-turbo I-6 reach dealership showrooms this year.The foundation of the Hurricane twin-turbo is a deep-skirt cast-aluminum block with a structural aluminum alloy oil pan. Cross-bolted steel main bearing caps contain the strong rotating assembly of a forged steel crankshaft and forged steel connecting rods.Stellantis propulsion system engineers employed a suite of state-of-the-art technologies for the Hurricane twin-turbo to deliver reduced emissions and attain big-engine power:Two low-inertia  high-flow turbochargers for rapid response to throttle inputsPlasma Transfer Wire Arc (PTWA) coating in the cylinder bores for an ultra-thin  low-friction wear surfaceHigh-pressure (5 075 psi/350 bar) direct fuel injection with pumps (single for SO/dual for HO) actuated by a dedicated chain-driven shaftDual overhead camshafts with wide-range  fully independent variable valve timingFuel-saving engine stop-start (ESS) function with robust starter motor for quick restartsEngine-mounted water-to-air charge cooler with a dedicated coolingContinuously variable displacement oil pump with integrated scavenge stageThe Incredible Power of AirEach turbocharger in the Hurricane twin-turbo I-6 feeds three cylinders. From a performance standpoint  two smaller turbochargers with less inertia spin up faster and deliver boost to the engine at lower rpm than a single  large turbo.The compressed air passes through an engine-mounted water-to-air charge air cooler to reduce its temperature. Cooler air is denser  enabling better performance via advanced ignition timing  and helping manage in-cylinder temperatures. An electric pump circulates coolant after the engine is shut down to help cool the turbocharger units for enhanced durability.The high-pressure direct fuel injection system runs at 5 075 psi (350 bar) and uses injectors mounted centrally in the combustion chamber. This design promotes finer atomization and super-fine control of fuel delivery into the cylinder for higher power and lower emissions.The Hurricane's turbochargers are optimized for each version. The turbos on the Hurricane SO deliver peak boost of 22 psi  while the Hurricane HO turbos deliver 26 psi of peak boost.Helping the Hurricane HO deliver its enhanced performance are lightweight  oil-jet cooled  forged aluminum pistons with an anodized top ring land and a diamond-like coating (DLC) on the pins to minimize friction. The Hurricane HO runs with a 9.5:1 compression ratio and uses 91 octane premium fuel.With a focus on fuel economy  the Hurricane SO uses cast aluminum pistons with cast iron top ring land insert  running with a 10.4:1 compression ratio. It's use of cooled EGR helps reduce engine pumping losses and manage in-cylinder temperatures. Premium fuel is recommended.Tough Coating for The CylindersLess friction  reduced weight and unparalleled wear resistance from a thermal sprayed microstructure of metallic and oxide components that metallurgically transform are the key benefits of the PTWA coating inside the cylinders  an alternative to the traditional cast-in-place or pressed-in cast iron cylinder liners. The PTWA coating is ultra-thin  compared with 3 to 4 millimeters of a cast iron liner and has 10 times the wear resistance.The PTWA coating is applied to the Hurricane block during the manufacturing process at the Saltillo North Engine Plant. The process  adapted from the aerospace industry  melts a steel alloy wire at 2 300 degrees Celsius (4 150 degrees Fahrenheit)  producing microscopic particles sprayed onto the cylinder walls at high velocities  where the particles splat-cool to form the coating and form a physical bond to the aluminum cylinder bore.Access the entire press release.StellantisStellantis N.V.

Our annual 2021 Form 20-F filing with the SEC is available at www.sec.gov/edgar .Furthermore  Galapagos NV (hereinafter the Company) has the honor to invite its shareholders  holders of subscription rights  members of the supervisory board and statutory auditor to its extraordinary and annual shareholders’ meetings that will be held sequentially on Tuesday 26 April 2022 at 1:00 p.m. (CET) and 2:00 p.m. (CET)  respectively  at the Company’s registered office.The items on the agenda of the extraordinary and annual shareholders’ meetings include  amongst other items: i) the amendment of the Company’s articles of association to implement a one-tier board structure  ii) the appointment of Paul Stoffels* as a director  iii) the appointments of Jérôme Contamine and Dan Baker as independent directors  and iv) the approval of an amended remuneration policy of the Company.The supervisory board proposed a one-tier board structure as it strongly believes that this unitary structure will strengthen the decision-making processes and the agility of the organization. The supervisory board’s considerations included that a one-tier board would allow for increased information flow and would provide directors with a greater understanding of the Company’s business and strategy as the executive and non-executive directors would be in direct and consistent contact. A unitary board would also allow for fast approvals to execute on the Company’s strategy to drive long-term shareholder value.Story continuesIf approved  the new board of directors intends to appoint Paul Stoffels* chair of the board. Paul Stoffels* has been appointed CEO of the Company  effective as from 1 April 2022. The board believes that the combined chair/CEO role will allow him to fully leverage his leadership capabilities and to efficiently set and implement the Company’s direction and strategy  including business development opportunities.To ensure that the independent directors can continue to actively oversee the CEO and management  the new board (if approved) also intends to appoint a lead non-executive director if and as long as the CEO serves as chair. The role and responsibility of the lead non-executive director will be to act as the principal liaison between the non-executive members of the (new) board and the chair/CEO  to ensure the independence of the board of directors from the chair/CEO and executive management  to support the chair/CEO and to ensure continuity within the board. The lead non-executive director would have the authority to call meetings of the non-executive directors at any time and would also automatically be a vice-chair of the board of directors.Biographies of proposed new board membersPaul Stoffels*  MD was Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and CSO of Johnson & Johnson  setting the company wide innovation agenda and leading the pharmaceutical research and product pipeline as well as the external initiatives.

The overall profitability of these activities was impacted by significant costs incurred by the Fintech Division to support its business development and the integration of PROKOV EDITIONS. Despite these impacts  the profit margin of these Divisions remained high at 33.18% (vs. 37.65% in 2020) while they continue to invest in R&D to support their goals for national and international development.Net Profit rose 25.97% to €41.15m up from €32.67m in 2020 (the impact of the IP BOX option is €2.94m).Basic earnings per share rose 27.78% to €2.60 (€2.04 in 2020).PHARMAGEST INTERACTIVE will propose to the Annual General Meeting on 28 June 2022 a gross dividend per share of €1.05 (+10.5%).

In order to rationalise  harmonise and optimise PHARMAGEST INTERACTIVE's commercial representation  and in view of BGM INFORMATIQUE's performance in marketing PHARMAGEST INTERACTIVE's software and hardware  effective 1 January 2022  BGM INFORMATIQUE was entrusted with exclusive responsibility for monitoring ADI’s installed base (approximately 900 customers).Increased interoperability of the Digital Healthcare Platform under the pandaLAB HUB brandBy developing synergies between the Group's various subsidiaries  the Digital Healthcare Platform (DHP) has been enhanced by the addition of new functional and technical features for healthcare professionals (appointment scheduling service  e-Ordo DHP  Hospital-at-Home / Nursing Home link  Nursing Care / Pharmacy link  Primary Care Physician / Pharmacy link) and for patients. New services now communicate with the DHP via the Group's software: the Pharmaceutical Record  the Shared Medical Record  the Shared Directory of Healthcare Professionals  and the National Health Identity system. At the same time  the Group is continuing the demonstration phase of this application ecosystem within regional health boards and regional hospital networks  and also promoting this offer to institutions and partners (manufacturers  integrators  regional clusters).Enhancement of the PANDALAB offerIn addition to PANDALAB's initial offering for healthcare professionals (pandaLAB Pro)  currently being integrated into all software solutions of its ecosystem  Pharmagest Group has leveraged its technical and functional interoperability expertise to develop pandaLAB HUB (formally the Digital Healthcare Platform) and promote sharing information and synergies between business applications but also to reinforce relations with patients. As a result  new services are now available to them through the pandaLAB Ma santé app (making appointments  sending prescriptions  vaccination booklet  medicine cabinet  etc.).Strategic partnership with ELSAN GroupThrough this strategic partnership  Pharmagest Group’s subsidiary  PANDALAB  will accelerate the deployment of its secure instant messaging app  pandaLAB Pro. Making Pandalab Pro available to ELSAN’s 120 private clinics and hospitals will contribute to Pharmagest Group’s goal of establishing pandaLAB Pro’s position as a key communications tool connecting all healthcare professionals  whether in private practice  social care establishments or hospitals in France and in Europe.Acquisition of PROKOV EDITIONS: Pharmagest Group extends its scope to include medical software.This acquisition completes Pharmagest Group’s range of business software dedicated to healthcare professionals by expanding its coverage to general practitioners.

Much more than a business software solution ID.  it is a complete and innovative ecosystem  the connecting patients  the team and the pharmacy network  incorporating exclusive new features while retaining the best of LGPI pharmacy management suite.Operations in Italy are strengthenedSince entering Italy in 2018  Pharmagest Group has continued to develop its Pharmacies / Wholesaler-Distributor businesses  expand its Italian branch network  and enhance its range of functional and technical solutions applicable to the European market as a whole or specifically to the Italian market. PHARMAGEST ITALIA is now setting new goals: both in the Pharmacy sector  by investing nearly €9m over 5 years to become ID. the 3rd largest software company in the Italian market with a 20% market share  and in the Wholesaler / Distributor sector by optimising the recently acquired ATHESIA assets.Outlook for the Health and Social Care Facilities (HSCF) Solutions DivisionMALTA INFORMATIQUE intends to continue its expansion in Europe and in 2022 will enter the United Kingdom.Driven by its successful expansion in Belgium initiated in 2020 with MALTA BELGIUM  MALTA INFORMATIQUE plans to build on the solid foundations of CAREMEDS and to shift the focus of its business model (distribution of pill dispensing systems) to software publishing. By integrating TITANLINK into the CAREMEDS installed base  MALTA INFORMATIQUE will be able to provide an expanded offering to the UK's 12 000 pharmacies and 11 000 retirement homes.

The rebound of the operating margins in the second half of the year shows that the new activities are becoming well integrated.

The acquisitions of Geosonic France  Geoplus  Subgeo and Asper represent 11% revenue growth  in addition to the organic growth of 17% of the existing activities in 2021.Story continuesIn terms of the activities  both the Environment and the Geotechnology segments grew at virtually the same rate: the revenue of the Environment department increased by 24%  to an annual turnover of € 27.9 million (compared to € 22.4 million in 2020)  while  thanks in part to the integration of Geosonic in France  Geotechnology achieved a growth of 31% and ended the year with a revenue of € 35.1 million (€ 26.8 million in 2020). With this  the share of the geotechnical activities increased from 54% to 56%.The French operations confirmed their strong performance of the first half of the year and  with 53% of the revenue  now represent more than half of the Group. The overall 38% growth in revenue  from € 24.1 million in 2020 to € 33.2 million this year  was largely driven by the above-mentioned acquisitions  i.e. 21%  while the existing activities improved by 17%.The geotechnical activities in Belgium continued their strong growth  and the Environment divisions benefited from the strongly increased demand  both in terms of PFAS and asbestos. The Translab subsidiary bridges both activities here  and has expanded its originally asbestos-focussed operations using environmentally-targeted laboratory tests. In addition to the 3% growth due to the contribution from the newly acquired Asper in July  this results in an organic growth of 17%  which led to an increase in the total revenue in Belgium from € 15.4 million to € 18.4 million in 2021.The Dutch companies in the Group also confirmed their strong performance of the first half of the year  with a purely organic growth of 16%. Although the consultancy services were under pressure in an increasingly tight employment market  the environmental leg was the growth factor here  thanks to a large increase in field work.EBITDA increases to € 8.1 millionThe EBITDA amounted to € 8.1 million  an increase of € 559 thousand. After a margin decline in the first half of the year due to the integration costs of the French acquisitions  a clear recovery is now visible  with an EBITDA margin of 13.3% compared to the revenue in the second half of the year. The integration of the acquisitions is advancing well  and it is expected that they will be able to contribute positively to the profitability of the Group in 2022.The tightness in the employment market remains an issue  however. In order to further support growth  the Group continues to actively search for competent profiles  while maintaining a continued focus on the training and education of existing employees. Rising salary costs due to the additional recruitment  both recent and expected indexations  as well as the short-term absorption of staff shortages through temporary employment agencies  will remain a focus of attention in the future.Depreciations increased from € 4.5 to € 5.0 million. ABO-GROUP continues to invest in the renovation and expansion of its machinery in order to be able to respond adequately to the needs of its customers. Several new machines were purchased in 2021  including several drill and probing machines  as well as specialised laboratory equipment.The financial result has slightly increased  in line with the increased debt level. In France  the Group could again rely on a R&D tax credit amounting to € 355 thousand (compared to € 270 thousand in 2020). The net profit remained stable at € 2.0 million (€ 0.19 per share).Solid € 6.8 million operating cash flow and net debt of 1.1x EBITDAThe net cash flow from operating activities amounted to € 6.8 million (-22% compared to 2020)  driven by the increase of the working capital requirements due to the strong growth in revenue. The trade receivables and other short-term assets increased by € 3.5 million  while the trade payables and other short-term liabilities increased by € 2.8 million  resulting in the operating capital increasing by € 730 thousand at the end of the year.As a result of the recent acquisitions  as well as the investments in operating capital and fixed assets  the net financial debt increased by 25%  from € 7.4 million at the end of 2020 to € 9.3 million. With a ratio of 1.1x to the operating result before depreciation  the debt ratio remains very healthy and provides the Group with room to consider new acquisitions.The balance sheet total increased from € 57.0 to € 65.6 million. On the assets side  this mainly reflects the recent acquisitions  as well as the above-mentioned increase in operating capital  while  on the liabilities side  the short and long-term debts increased. Total equity also increased further to € 20.5 million (compared to € 19.0 million at the end of 2020). The equity ratio settled at a healthy 31.2%.The full consolidated income statement and balance sheet  the statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow statement are shown below.Outlook2022 started with the momentum from 2021  with a first acquisition being an indicator of further growth ambitionsIn 2022  ABO-GROUP is continuing with the momentum of 2021  with a strong commercial performance in the first months of the year. The order books of the various subsidiaries are well filled  and provide confidence for the rest of the year.In addition  the Group was already able to announce its first acquisition in 2022  i.e. the acquisition of the soil activities of Colsen in Zeeland (the Netherlands) and  as always  is actively looking for other interesting targets that can further strengthen the Group’s product portfolio and geographic reach within its domestic markets. The Group considers it likely that additional announcements will follow.The Board and the operating managements are convinced that the Group is on-track to achieve the targeted development that was outlined last year  with the aim of reaching the revenue cap of € 100 million by the end of 2025 at the latest. The strong organic growth figures in 2021 demonstrate that the Group has the capacity to expand its activities on its own. In combination with targeted acquisitions that tap into new markets  segments or skills  ABO-GROUP is well positioned to deliver the technical market leadership it is aiming for in its domestic markets.Financial calendar22/04/2022: Publication of the 2021 annual report and invitation to the General Meeting25/05/2021: General Meeting16/09/2021: Figures for the first half of 2022Statement of the statutory auditorThe statutory auditor  EY Bedrijfsrevisoren BV  represented by Paul Eelen  has confirmed that the audit  which is substantially complete  has to date not revealed any material misstatement in the consolidated income statement  the consolidated statement of comprehensive income  the consolidated balance sheet  the consolidated statement of changes in equity or the consolidated statement of cash flow as included in this press release.About the ABO-GROUPABO-GROUP is a specialised  listed engineering office focussing on geotechnology  environment and soil remediation.

As we cannot predict which Covid-19 measures shall be applicable on the day of the General Meeting  we are proposing a webcasting of the General Meeting. To mitigate potential health risks for participants  there will be no social event  reception  or catering at the occasion of our General Meeting. If you prefer to avoid in-person presence  notably for health safety reasons  you may always cast your vote by proxy by giving mandate to the person of your choice or the one proposed by UCB SA/NV and also register for the webcasting (live stream with no interactions as explained in the participation formalities below).Applicable formalities are detailed at the end of this convening notice. Shareholders may  to the extent indicated  also use the Lumi Connect platform (formerly known as AGM+ platform) ( https://www.lumiconnect.com/en/events ) to complete all participation formalities and vote by proxy at the General Meeting.ORDINARY PARTReport of the Board of Directors on the annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 Report of the statutory auditor on the annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 Communication of the consolidated annual accounts of the UCB Group relating to the financial year ended 31 December 2021 Approval of the annual accounts of UCB SA/NV for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 and appropriation of the resultsStory continuesProposed resolution :The General Meeting approves the annual accounts of UCB SA/NV for the financial year ended31 December 2021 and the appropriation of the results reflected therein  including the approval of a gross dividend of € 1.30 per share (*).(*) The UCB shares held by UCB SA/NV (own shares) are not entitled to a dividend. Therefore  the aggregate amount to be distributed to the shareholders may fluctuate depending on the number of UCB shares held by UCB SA/NV (own shares) on the dividend approval date.Approval of the remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 December 2021The Belgian Code of Companies and Associations (BCCA) requires the General Meeting to approve the remuneration report each year by separate vote. This report includes a description of the remuneration policy that was applicable in 2021 and information on remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors and of the Executive Committee. The format and content of the remuneration report are compliant with the requirements of the Law of 28 April 2020 implementing the Shareholders Right Directive II (SRD II) in Belgian law and amending the BCCA.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting approves the remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.Approval of changes to the Remuneration of the BoardIn accordance with the Belgian Corporate Governance Code 2020 (the “Code 2020”) and the BCCA  UCB’s Remuneration Policy was submitted to and approved by General Meeting of 29 April 2021. This policy was applicable as from the financial year starting on 1 January 2021. For 2022  UCB would like to propose an adjustment to this policy in relation to the remuneration of the Board of Directors  which requires the approval of the General Meeting in accordance with art 2:50 of the BCCA. The proposed change is an increase of the remuneration of the Board committee chairs  to be effective upon approval by the General Meeting. This proposal results from a benchmark review that was carried out in view to ensure that UCB SA/NV could attract the best candidates for chairing its special committees  by proposing an appropriate level of compensation  also considering that the compensation of the Board members and especially for their roles in special committees have not been reviewed nor adjusted since 2019. In addition  we observe increasing demands on our board members  in particular for our Committee Chairs  where the environment and related governance legislation have become more complex  resulting in higher workload. The proposed increased remuneration corresponds to a level closer to the regressed median of our European Pharma reference UCB peer group (i.e. relevant peer pharma median data  adjusted to UCB’s revenue size)  as disclosed in the Remuneration Report 2021 and can be summarized as follows: (i) Audit Committee Chair: from EUR 33 500 EUR (current) to EUR 45 000 (proposed); (ii) Governance  Nomination and Compensation Committee Chair: from EUR 22 500 (current) to EUR 35 000 (proposed) and (iii) Scientific Committee Chair: from EUR 33 500 (current) to EUR 35 000 (proposed).In addition  it is proposed to convert the previously approved special travel allowance for our Board members residing in a country with at least 5 hours of time zone difference with Belgium (EUR 7 500 per meeting  with at least 6 meetings per year)  into a fixed lump-sum allowance of EUR 45 000  irrespective of the actual travel. This is mainly to consider the inconvenience of attending meetings which are mostly in Europe.The other components of the remuneration of the Board remain unchanged. For more details on the total remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors  please refer to the Remuneration Report available on UCB website.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting (i) fixes the annual remuneration of the Chair of the Audit Committee at EUR 45 000  the annual remuneration of the Chair of the Governance  Nomination and Compensation Committee at EUR 35 000 and the annual remuneration of the Chair of the Scientific Committee at EUR 35 000 and (ii) approves the conversion of the travel allowance of 7 500 Euro per meeting into a fixed lump-sum travel allowance of EUR 45 000 per member of the Board of Directors residing in a country where the time zone difference with Belgium is 5 hours or more (in addition to regular travel expense reimbursement).Discharge in favour of the directorsPursuant to the BCCA  the General Meeting must  after approval of the annual accounts  vote on the discharge of liability of the directors for the financial year ended on 31 December 2021.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting grants discharge to the directors for the performance of their duties during the financial year ended 31 December 2021.Discharge in favour of the statutory auditorPursuant to the BCCA  the General Meeting must  after approval of the annual accounts  vote on the discharge of liability of the statutory auditor (Mazars).Proposed resolution :The General Meeting grants discharge to the statutory auditor for the performance of its duties during the financial year ended 31 December 2021.Directors: renewal of mandates of (independent) directorsThe mandates of Mrs. Kay Davies  Mr. Jean-Christophe Tellier and Mr. Cédric van Rijckevorsel shall expire at this General Meeting. Upon recommendation of the Governance  Nomination and Compensation Committee (“GNCC”)  the Board of Directors proposes: (i) the renewal of the mandate of Mrs. Kay Davies as independent director for a term of 4 years and (ii) the renewal of the mandate of Mr. Jean-Christophe Tellier and Mr. Cédric van Rijckevorsel as directors for a term of 4 years. While Mrs. Kay Davies reached the age limit in 2021  the Board is proposing to renew her mandate as permitted under section 3.2.4 of its Charter of Corporate Governance. Mrs. Kay Davies is chairing the Scientific Committee of the Board and is bringing a unique scientific contribution at the level of the Board. Applying the age limitation rule without exception would have led to a simultaneous change of the two scientists of the Board in the period 2021-2022. Given the long development cycles in creating new medicines that can span more than a decade  coupled with new drug research modalities such as gene therapy where UCB is investing in new platforms  proposing the re-election of Mrs. Kay Davis for a new mandate is considered by the Board the best option to maintain continuity in the follow up of this key scientific evolution for UCB. It also allows the company to count another new key scientist in the Board (Susan Gasser). Her re-election is guaranteeing that UCB maintains a sufficient level of gender diversity in the Board as requested by Belgian law. If re-elected  Mrs. Kay Davies shall continue to be the Chair of the Scientific Committee and member of the GNCC. She meets the independence criteria stipulated by article 7:87 of the BCCA  by provision 3.5 of the Code 2020 and by the Board of Directors. Subject to the abovementioned renewals by the General Meeting  the Board will continue to be composed of a majority of independent directors.Proposed resolutions :9.1. A) The General Meeting renews the appointment of Mrs. Kay Davies (*) as director for a term of four years until the close of the annual General Meeting of 2026.B) The General Meeting acknowledges that  from the information made available to the Company  Mrs. Kay Davies qualifies as an independent director according to the independence criteria provided for by article 7:87 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  by provision 3.5 of the 2020 Belgian Corporate Governance Code and by the Board and appoints her as independent director.9.2. The General Meeting renews the appointment of Mr. Jean-Christophe Tellier (*) as director for a term of four years until the close of the annual General Meeting of 2026.9.3. The General Meeting renews the appointment of Mr. Cédric van Rijckevorsel (*) as director for a term of four years until the close of the annual General Meeting of 2026.(*) Curriculum vitae and details are available at https://www.ucb.com/investors/UCB-shareholders/Shareholders-meeting-2022SPECIAL PART10. Long-Term Incentive Plans - Program of free allocation of sharesThis approval requested from the General Meeting is not as such required by Belgian law but is sought in order to ensure transparency and  as the case may be  compliance with foreign law for certain jurisdictions where our Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTI plans) are offered to our employees. For more information on UCB’s LTI plans  please refer to the 2021 remuneration report. For the avoidance of doubt  UCB confirms that it covers all its obligations under the LTI Plans with existing shares  i.e. through share buybacks  so there is no dilution for existing shareholders of UCB SA/NV.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting approves the decision of the Board of Directors to allocate an estimated number of 960 000 free shares:a) of which an estimated number of 800 000 shares to eligible employees under the Long-Term Inventive policy (LTI policy)  namely to 2 474 individuals  according to the applicable allocation criteria. These free shares will only vest if and when the eligible employees are still employed within the UCB Group three years after the grant of the awards;b) of which an estimated number of 160 000 shares to eligible employees under the Performance Share Plan  namely to 141 individuals  according to the applicable allocation criteria. These free shares will be delivered after a three-year vesting period and the number of shares actually allocated will vary from 0% to 150% of the number of shares initially granted depending on the level of achievement of the performance conditions set by the Board of UCB SA/NV at the moment of grant.The estimated figures under a) and b) do not take into account employees hired or promoted to eligible levels between 1 January 2022 and 1 April 2022.11. Change of control provisions - art. 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and AssociationsPursuant to article 7:151 of the BCCA  the General Meeting is solely competent to approve so-called ‘change of control’ clauses  i.e.  provisions whereby third parties are granted rights having a substantial influence on the assets of the Company or causing a substantial debt or liability for the Company  if the exercise of such rights depends on the launch of a public takeover bid on the shares of the Company or a change of control thereof. These clauses are standard requests from our creditors and/or in the legal documentation of our financing arrangements.11.1 EMTN Program – renewalUCB SA/NV has entered into a Euro Medium Term Note Program dated 6 March 2013 for an amount ofEUR 3 000 000 000  with last update of the Base Prospectus on 8 March 2021  whereby the amount was increased to EUR 5 000 000 000  as this program may be further amended  extended or updated from time to time (the “EMTN Program”). The terms of the EMTN Program provide for a change of control clause - condition 5 (e) (i) - under which  for any of the Notes issued under the EMTN Program where a change of control put is included in the relevant final terms  any and all of the holders of such notes can  in certain circumstances  require UCB SA/NV to redeem that Note  following a change of control at the level of UCB SA/NV  upon exercise of the change of control put  for a value equal to the put redemption amount increased with  if appropriate  interest accrued until the date of exercise of the change of control put (all as more particularly described in the Base Prospectus of the EMTN Program). In accordance with said article 7:151 of the BCCA  this clause must be approved by the General Meeting and it is hereby proposed to renew this approval for any series of notes issued under the EMTN Program including such clause during the next 12 months.Proposed resolution :Pursuant to article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  the General Meeting renews its approval: (i) of condition 5 (e) (i) of the Terms and Conditions of the EMTN Program (Redemption at the Option of Noteholders – Upon a Change of Control (Change of Control Put))  in respect of any series of notes to which such condition is made applicable being issued under the Program from 28 April 2022 until 27 April 2023  under which any and all of the holders of the relevant notes can  in certain circumstances when a change of control at the level of UCB SA/NV occurs  require UCB SA/NV to redeem that note on the change of control put date at the put redemption amount together  if appropriate  with interest accrued to such change of control put date  following a change of control of UCB SA/NV; and (ii) of any other provision of the EMTN Program or notes issued under the EMTN Program granting rights to third parties which could affect an obligation on UCB SA/NV where in each case the exercise of these rights is dependent on the occurrence of a change of control.11.2 European Investment Bank Facility Agreement of EUR 350 million entered on 18 November 2021UCB SA/NV has entered a Facility Agreement in the amount of EUR 350 000 000 between  amongst others  UCB SA/NV as borrower  and the European Investment Bank as lender  dated 18 November 2021  including clauses according to which the loan  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  could in certain circumstances become immediately due and payable  at the discretion of the European Investment Bank and following a change of control of UCB SA/NV.Proposed resolution :Pursuant to article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of the Companies and Associations  the General Meeting approves (i) Article 4.3 A (3) of the EUR 350 000 000 Facility Agreement entered into between  amongst others  UCB SA/NV as borrower  and the European Investment Bank as lender  dated 18 November 2021  under which the loan  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  could in certain circumstances become immediately due and payable  at the discretion of the European Investment Bank and following a change of control of UCB SA/NV  as it falls within the scope of Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  (ii) as well as any other provisions of the European Investment Bank Facility Agreement which may fall within the scope of Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.11.3 Term Facility Agreement of USD 800 million entered on 19 January 2022UCB SA/NV has entered a Term Facility Agreement in the amount of USD 800 000 000 between  amongst others  UCB SA/NV and UCB Biopharma SRL  as borrowers  and BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV and Barclays Bank PLC as bookrunners dated January 19  2022 including clauses  according to which any and all of the lenders can  in certain circumstances  cancel their commitments and require repayment of their participations in the loans  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  following a change of control of UCB SA/NV.Proposed resolution:Pursuant to article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of the Companies and Associations  the General Meeting approves (i) Clause 7.2 (b) of the USD 800 million Term Facility Agreement entered into between  amongst others  UCB SA/NV and UCB Biopharma SRL  as borrowers  and BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV and Barclays Bank PLC as bookrunners dated January 19  2022  under which any and all of the lenders can  in certain circumstances  cancel their commitments and require repayment of their participations in the loan  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  following a change of control of UCB SA/NV  as it falls within the scope of Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  (ii) as well as Clause 21.15 (Disposals) (in combination with Clause 22.2 (Other obligations) and Clause 22.12 (Acceleration)) and any other provisions of the Term Facility Agreement which may fall within the scope of Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.EXTRAORDINARY PART (Extraordinary General Meeting)The Extraordinary General Meeting will only validly deliberate on the items on its agenda if at least half of the capital is present or represented  in accordance with article 7:153 of the BCCA. If this condition is not met  a new Extraordinary General Meeting with the same agenda will be convened for 23 May 2022 at 11:00 am CEST. This second Extraordinary General Meeting will validly deliberate irrespective of the number of shares present or represented.Special Report of the Board of DirectorsSubmission of the special report prepared by the Board of Directors in accordance with article 7:199 of the BCCA in which the Board requests the renewal of its powers in relation to the authorized capital and indicates the special circumstances where it may use its powers under the authorized capital and the purposes that it shall pursue.Renewal of the powers of the Board of Directors under the authorized capital and amendment to article 6 of the Articles of Association.It is proposed to the General Meeting to renew the two (2) year authorization granted by the General Meeting of 30 April 2020 to the Board of Directors for another two (2) years  to decide  under the authorized capital  to increase the capital of the Company  within the limits of article 7:198 of the BCCA  with an amount of up to 5% of the share capital (calculated at the time of use of this authorization) in case of cancellation or limitation of the preferential subscription rights of the shareholders  or with an amount of up to 10% of the capital in case there is no limitation nor cancellation of the preferential subscription rights of existing shareholders. This authorization is for general purposes and cannot be used in case a public takeover bid has been launched on UCB. For further information on the use and purposes of the authorized capital  please refer to the special report of the Board of Directors prepared in accordance with article 7:199 of the BCCA.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting resolves to renew the authorization to the Board of Directors to increase the capital of the Company within the framework of the authorized capital for another two (2) years  and to amend article 6 of the Articles of Association accordingly to reflect this renewal.Subject to the approval of this resolution  the text of article 6 of the Articles of Association of the Company will be amended as follows:“ Article 6The capital can be increased one or more times by a decision of a General Meeting of shareholders constituted under the conditions required to modify the Articles of Association.The Board of Directors is authorized to increase the share capital amongst other by way of the issuance of shares  convertible bonds or subscription rights  in one or more transactions  within the limits set by law i. with up to 5% of the share capital at the time of the decision of the Board of Directors to make use of this authorization  in the event of a capital increase with cancellation or limitation of the preferential subscription rights of the shareholders (whether or not for the benefit of one or more specific persons who are not part of the personnel of the Company or of its subsidiaries  as defined in the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations) ii. with up to 10% of the share capital at the time of the decision of the Board of Directors to make use of this authorization  in the event of a capital increase without cancellation or limitation of the preferential subscription rights of the existing shareholders.In any event  the total amount by which the Board of Directors may increase the share capital by a combination of the authorizations set forth in (i) and (ii) above  is limited to 10% of the share capital at the time of the decision of the Board of Directors to make use of this authorization.The Board of Directors is moreover expressly authorized to make use of this authorization  within the limits as set out under (i) and (ii) of the second paragraph above  for the following operations:1. a capital increase or the issuance of convertible bonds or subscription rights with cancellation or limitation of the preferential subscription rights of the existing shareholders 2. a capital increase or the issuance of convertible bonds or subscription rights with cancellation or limitation of the preferential subscription rights of the existing shareholders for the benefit of one or more specific persons who are not part of the personnel of the Company or of its subsidiaries  as defined in the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  and3. a capital increase by incorporation of reserves.Any such capital increase may take any and all forms  including  but not limited to  contributions in cash or in kind  with or without share premium  with issuance of shares below  above or at par value  the incorporation of reserves and/or share premiums and/or profits carried forward  to the maximum extent permitted by the law.Any decision of the Board of Directors to use this authorization requires a 75% majority within the Board of Directors.This authorization is granted for a period of two (2) years as from the date of the publication in the appendices to the Belgian Official Gazette of the resolution of the Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting held on 28 April 2022.The Board of Directors is empowered  with full power of substitution  to amend the Articles of Association to reflect the capital increase(s) resulting from the exercise of its powers pursuant to this article.”Acquisition of own shares – renewal of authorizationIn accordance with article 7:215 of the BCCA  it is proposed to the General Meeting to renew the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the extraordinary general meeting of 30 April 2020 to acquire own shares for up to 10% of the total number of shares of the Company  for two (2) years expiring on 30 June 2024. The previous authorization of 30 April 2020 will remain valid until it expires on 30 June 2022 and the new authorization will be effective as of 1 July 2022. As per previous years  this is a general-purpose authorization for share buybacks. It cannot be used in case a public takeover bid has been launched on UCB. The Board of Directors may for example (and without being limited thereto) use this authorization to service the Long-Term Incentive Plans of the UCB Group for employees and management.Proposed resolution :The Board of Directors is authorized to acquire  directly or indirectly  whether on or outside of the stock exchange  by way of purchase  exchange  contribution or any other way  up to 10% of the total number of the Company’s shares  as calculated on the date of each acquisition  for a price or an exchange value per share which will not be (i) higher than the highest price of the Company’s shares on Euronext Brussels on the day of the acquisition and (ii) lower than one (1) euro  without prejudice to article 8:5 of the royal decree of 29 April 2019 implementing the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations. As a result of such acquisition(s)  the Company  together with its direct or indirect subsidiaries  as well as persons acting on their own behalf but for the account of the Company or its direct or indirect subsidiaries  may not hold more than 10% of the total number of shares issued by the Company at the moment of the acquisition concerned. This authorization is granted for a period of two years starting on 1 July 2022 and expiring on 30 June 2024. This authorization extends to any acquisitions of the Company’s shares  directly or indirectly  by the Company’s direct subsidiaries in accordance with article 7:221 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations. The authorization granted by the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company on 30 April 2020 remains valid until 30 June 2022.Modification of Article 19  §1 of Articles of Association relating to the signature of the board minutes  to bring it in line with Article 7:95 §1 of the BCCAArticle 19  §1 of the Articles of Association of UCB SA/NV currently provides that the minutes of the Board meeting should be signed by all directors present at the meeting. This requirement is going beyond the rule of article 7:95 § 1 of the BCCA which requires that the minutes are signed by the Chair and any other director who wish to sign. It is therefore proposed to simplify this signature requirement of the Articles of Association by requesting the signature of the Chair and the Vice-Chair of the Board and any other director who wish so. Should the Chair or the Vice-Chair be unable to sign for any reason  any other director can sign the minutes. This should also help the implementation of electronic signature for the minutes of the Board. This change has no impact on shareholders rights.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting resolves to amend article 19  §1 of the Articles of Association to bring it in line with Article 7:95 §1 of the BCCA  as follows:“The proceedings of the Board shall be set down in minutes  to be kept in a special register and signed by the Chair and the Vice-Chair  as well as any other directors present at the meeting who express their wish to do so. In the event the Chair or the Vice-Chair are unable to sign for any reason  any other director can sign the minutes”.***PARTICIPATION FORMALITIESIn order to participate in the General Meeting  shareholders must comply with the following formalities:Kindly note that all due dates and times mentioned herein are the final deadlines and that these will not be extended due to a weekend  holiday or for any other reason.

The crisis has spurred Russian sanctions  the tightening of cybersecurity  and changes in the global IP scene.To help businesses and legal professionals navigate this volatile and quickly evolving crisis  Wolters Kluwer legal experts have developed special reports covering the following areas:Cybersecurity: As cyber threats increase with the ongoing invasion  cybersecurity experts continue to raise the alarm concerning potential cyberattacks against Ukrainian targets as well as attacks against the U.S. and other NATO countries. Recent federal cybersecurity action includes provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act that kicked off rulemaking to require reporting of ransomware payments and create a Cyber Incident Review Office within CISA.

On the contrary  IP offices throughout Europe have pledged assistance and support to Ukrainian rights holders whose pending actions are disrupted by the conflict. On March 4   the USPTO announced that it had terminated engagement with officials from Russia's IP Agency (Rospatent) and with the Eurasian Patent Organization (EAPO). The USPTO also announced it terminated engagement with the national IP office of Belarus   an action that will affect Russian rights holders seeking to extend protection to the U.S.  as well as U.S. businesses that continue to operate in Russia .

LINK The SEC: An initial consideration for many U.S. companies and private issuers subject to SEC disclosure regulations was whether to cease any business in Russia   an action many companies have now taken. Companies in the U.S. with material business in Russia or Ukraine continue to monitor the crisis and prepare to potentially update existing SEC disclosures to reflect the risk of doing business in these countries. With reports that some diplomatic talks have occurred between Russia and Ukraine   businesses might begin to reconsider their decisions to cease business operations in Russia   but need to remain mindful that sanctions may not be lifted for some period of time after the conflict ends.

LINK Economic Sanctions: Since the start of the invasion  President Biden has taken many executive actions that have led to a slew of economic sanctions against a wide swath of the Russian economy  its leadership  and oligarchy. The first action taken by OFAC was sanctioning two major Russian state-owned financial institutions  imposing additional restrictions on Russian sovereign debt  and sanctioning five Kremlin-connected elites. OFAC has also sanctioned additional regime elites and business executives who are associates and facilitators of the Russian regime.

March 25  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- New 3.0-liter Hurricane twin-turbo inline six-cylinder engine puts out less tailpipe emissions and uses less gasoline than larger engines  yet delivers V-8 levels of power Robust architecture enables Stellan…,"Stellantis today revealed its new  3.0-liter  twin-turbo  inline  six-cylinder engine  named Hurricane  that delivers better fuel economy and fewer emissions than larger engines while at the same time generates more horsepower and torque than many competitors' naturally aspirated V-8 and boosted six-cylinder power plants.Designed with an inherently smooth-running I-6 configuration and state-of-the-art technology  the Hurricane twin-turbo's robust base architecture enables Stellantis propulsion systems engineers to create two distinct variants:Standard Output (SO): Optimized for fuel economy  including the use of cooled exhaust gas circulation (EGR)  while delivering enhanced power and torque (more than 400 hp/450 lb.-ft. of torque)High Output (HO): Optimized for great performance (more than 500 hp/475 lb.-ft.) while maintaining significant fuel economy during heavy use  such as towing.The Hurricane twin-turbo achieves this V-8-rivaling performance while being up to 15% more efficient than larger engines.""As Stellantis aims to become the U.S. leader in electrification  with a 50% battery-electric vehicle (BEV) sales mix by 2030  internal combustion engines will play a key role in our portfolio for years to come and we owe it to our customers and the environment to provide the cleanest  most efficient propulsion possible "" said Micky Bly  Stellantis head of propulsion systems. ""The Hurricane twin-turbo is a no-compromise engine that delivers better fuel economy and an important reduction in greenhouse gases without asking our customers to give up performance.""Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is one part of Stellantis' commitment to cut its carbon footprint by 50% by 2030 and to lead the transportation industry by achieving Net Carbon Zero by 2038. Those goals are key elements of the Stellantis Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan.Specific horsepower and torque ratings will vary based on vehicle. The first vehicles powered by the Hurricane twin-turbo I-6 reach dealership showrooms this year.The foundation of the Hurricane twin-turbo is a deep-skirt cast-aluminum block with a structural aluminum alloy oil pan. Cross-bolted steel main bearing caps contain the strong rotating assembly of a forged steel crankshaft and forged steel connecting rods.Stellantis propulsion system engineers employed a suite of state-of-the-art technologies for the Hurricane twin-turbo to deliver reduced emissions and attain big-engine power:Two low-inertia  high-flow turbochargers for rapid response to throttle inputsPlasma Transfer Wire Arc (PTWA) coating in the cylinder bores for an ultra-thin  low-friction wear surfaceHigh-pressure (5 075 psi/350 bar) direct fuel injection with pumps (single for SO/dual for HO) actuated by a dedicated chain-driven shaftDual overhead camshafts with wide-range  fully independent variable valve timingFuel-saving engine stop-start (ESS) function with robust starter motor for quick restartsEngine-mounted water-to-air charge cooler with a dedicated coolingContinuously variable displacement oil pump with integrated scavenge stageThe Incredible Power of AirEach turbocharger in the Hurricane twin-turbo I-6 feeds three cylinders. From a performance standpoint  two smaller turbochargers with less inertia spin up faster and deliver boost to the engine at lower rpm than a single  large turbo.The compressed air passes through an engine-mounted water-to-air charge air cooler to reduce its temperature. Cooler air is denser  enabling better performance via advanced ignition timing  and helping manage in-cylinder temperatures. An electric pump circulates coolant after the engine is shut down to help cool the turbocharger units for enhanced durability.The high-pressure direct fuel injection system runs at 5 075 psi (350 bar) and uses injectors mounted centrally in the combustion chamber. This design promotes finer atomization and super-fine control of fuel delivery into the cylinder for higher power and lower emissions.The Hurricane's turbochargers are optimized for each version. The turbos on the Hurricane SO deliver peak boost of 22 psi  while the Hurricane HO turbos deliver 26 psi of peak boost.Helping the Hurricane HO deliver its enhanced performance are lightweight  oil-jet cooled  forged aluminum pistons with an anodized top ring land and a diamond-like coating (DLC) on the pins to minimize friction. The Hurricane HO runs with a 9.5:1 compression ratio and uses 91 octane premium fuel.With a focus on fuel economy  the Hurricane SO uses cast aluminum pistons with cast iron top ring land insert  running with a 10.4:1 compression ratio. It's use of cooled EGR helps reduce engine pumping losses and manage in-cylinder temperatures. Premium fuel is recommended.Tough Coating for The CylindersLess friction  reduced weight and unparalleled wear resistance from a thermal sprayed microstructure of metallic and oxide components that metallurgically transform are the key benefits of the PTWA coating inside the cylinders  an alternative to the traditional cast-in-place or pressed-in cast iron cylinder liners. The PTWA coating is ultra-thin  compared with 3 to 4 millimeters of a cast iron liner and has 10 times the wear resistance.The PTWA coating is applied to the Hurricane block during the manufacturing process at the Saltillo North Engine Plant. The process  adapted from the aerospace industry  melts a steel alloy wire at 2 300 degrees Celsius (4 150 degrees Fahrenheit)  producing microscopic particles sprayed onto the cylinder walls at high velocities  where the particles splat-cool to form the coating and form a physical bond to the aluminum cylinder bore.Access the entire press release.StellantisStellantis N.V.

Since June 8  2021 the Company has been listed on Euronext Milan from Borsa Italiana.The resources collected during the IPO – equal to 44.5 million euros – proved to be key in finalizing the acquisition of Perini Navi  one of the most prestigious brands in the sailing superyacht industry. The acquisition took place on December 22  2021 through New Sail S.r.l. a subsidiary fully owned by TISG  for a total value of 80 million euros.The operation was financed by cash availability and long-term bank credit lines.The total value of the Order Book of Shipbuilding and Refit as of December 31  2021 is equal to 827 million euros  with wide visibility until 2026 of the projects under construction  about 80% of which is presented by yachts in the +50m range. At the end of 2021  the Net Backlog of Shipbuilding and Refit is equal to 536 million euros.The revenue breakdown by geographical area shows a higher relevance of the American market.In particular  this increase is driven by the stronger brand awareness in the Region  stimulated by the collaboration with renowned US brokers  that allowed the Company to enter the American market for big dimension yachts as confirmed by the sale of an Admiral 82m mega yacht at the end of 2021.Giovanni Costantino  Founder & CEO of The Italian Sea Group“The year 2021 has been particularly important for The Italian Sea Group  with the further strengthening of our business in the mega yacht segment and in strategic markets like the US ” says Giovanni Costantino  Founder & CEO of The Italian Sea Group. “Soon afterwards the Perini Navi acquisition  finalized at the end of January  the production sites of Viareggio and La Spezia are already operational  the majority of employees have been reinstated and we have launched important projects with great commitment and energy  with the goal of further strengthening such a prestigious brand in the global yachting world. The results announced today confirm the success of our business strategy that focuses on the continuous research of excellence  innovation and quality. Based on these results  that allow us to look at the many future opportunities with great optimism and commitment  we confirm the 2022 Guidance.”An additional element which is significant to the Company’s strategy is the consolidation in the sailing yacht segment  which is experiencing a strong increase in demand also thanks to the increasing interest from owners towards sustainability and the environment. As a confirmation of this  TISG has undertaken the completion of a 60m sailing yacht for a US client (order originally acquired from the previous Perini Navi property).Collaborations with brands of the caliber of Giorgio Armani and Automobili Lamborghini have contributed to further strengthen the Company positioning in the luxury segment and  as a confirmation of what was announced during IPO  TISG intends to finalize another important partnership.The Italian Sea Group is a global operator in the luxury yachting industry  listed on Euronext Milan (“EXM”) and active in the construction and refit of motor yachts and sailing yachts up to 140 meters.
