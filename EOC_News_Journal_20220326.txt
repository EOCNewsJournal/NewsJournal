As record date for the dividend  the Board proposes May 9  2022. If the AGM so resolves  the dividend is expected to be distributed by Euroclear starting May 12  2022. The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 18  Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 10 – Approval of Remuneration ReportThe Board proposes that the AGM resolves to approve the Board's report regarding compensation pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 16 – Proposal for resolution on authorization of the Board to resolve on acquisition and transfer of the company's own sharesThe Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon acquisition of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) acquisition of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm  (ii) acquisition of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM for 2023  (iii) acquisition of shares may only be made so that the shares held by the company at any point in time does not exceed ten (10) percent of all shares in the company  (iv) acquisition of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the acquisition.Furthermore  the Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon transfer of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) transfer of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses  on market terms  (ii) transfer of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM 2023  (iii) the maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of shares held by the company at the time of the Board's resolution  (iv) transfer of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for transferred shares may be made in other forms than cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the transfer. The authorization includes the right to resolve on deviation of the preferential rights of shareholders.The purpose of the proposed authorizations is to (a) allow the Board to adjust the company's capital structure  to contribute to shareholder value  (b) be able to exploit attractive acquisition opportunities by fully or partly financing future acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (c) ensure the company's undertakings in respect of share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants of incentive programs)  including covering social security costs. If the Board decides to adjust the company's capital structure in accordance with (a) above  the Board intends to propose that the company's share capital shall be decreased through share reduction of the repurchased shares.The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.A decision by the AGM on the proposal according to this item must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares present at the AGM in order for the proposal to be adopted.Item 17 – Proposal for a long-term incentive program  including hedging measures by way of a share swap agreement (LTI 2022/2024)Summary of the programThe Annual General Meetings 2019  2020 and 2021 resolved on long-term incentive programs for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (together the ""LTI Programs""). Along the lines of the LTI Programs  the Board proposes that the AGM resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (""LTI 2022/2024""). The main principles for LTI 2022/2024 are set out below.LTI 2022/2024 is proposed to include approximately 90 employees including the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group. In order to participate in LTI 2022/2024 the participants will have to invest in Series B shares in Securitas at market price or nominate series B shares already held  as further set out below. For every Series B share purchased or nominated within the scope of LTI 2022/2024  the company will award so called performance awards free of charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2022/2024 is to create a strong long-term incentive for top executives of the Group  strengthen the Group's ability to retain and recruit top executives  provide competitive remuneration  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the executives concerned by enabling the participants to become substantial shareholders in the company. Through a share-based incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board believes that the implementation of LTI 2022/2024 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and consequently that LTI 2022/2024 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personally invested sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2022/2024  the participants will  with the exceptions stated below  have to either (i) purchase Series B shares in Securitas in the market and nominate such shares to LTI 2022/2024 or (ii) nominate Series B shares vested in LTI 2019/2021 or shares nominated in LTI 2019/2021 (without affecting the condition of LTI 2019/2021  to maintain personally invested shares during the entire vesting period) (""Personally Invested Shares""). Such investment in Personally Invested Shares shall be made during a period of up to one month  to end no later than 31 December 2022 (the ""Investment Period""). The Investment Period shall be determined by the Board and the intent is that the Investment Period will commence after the completion of the acquisition of Stanley Security and the subsequent rights issue.The value of a participant's Personally Invested Shares shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share and shall correspond to minimum 5 percent (all participants) and maximum 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's base salary.If the participant has access to inside information and therefore is prevented from purchasing or nominating Personally Invested Shares during the Investment Period  the Board shall be entitled to extend or postpone the Investment Period in individual cases  but no later than to the next AGM. The Board shall further  in individual cases  be entitled to accept nomination of shares acquired prior to the Investment Period  but not earlier than 1 January 2022  and/or through e.g. a pension insurance as Personally Invested Shares  where the participant  in the Board's opinion  has valid reasons for nominating such shares to LTI 2022/2024.Participants in LTI 2022/2024 and allocationLTI 2022/2024 is proposed to include approximately 90 senior executives and key employees within the Securitas Group  divided in three categories.Category 1For each Personally Invested Share by the CEO of the Group under LTI 2022/2024  the company will award five performance awards to the CEO.Category 2For each Personally Invested Share by another member of Group management (currently thirteen individuals) under LTI 2022/2024  the relevant individual will be awarded four performance awards.Category 3For each Personally Invested Share by another participant under LTI 2022/2024  the relevant individual will be awarded three performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of Securitas Series B shares that the performance awards will entitle the participant to receive depends on the annual development of Securitas' earnings per share[1]  compared to minimum and maximum target levels as defined by the Board  during the measurement period 1 January 2022 – 31 December 2024  where each year during the measurement period is compared to the previous year. The outcome is calculated yearly  whereby one third of the performance awards is measured against the outcome for 2022  one third is measured against the outcome for 2023 and one third is measured against the outcome for 2024.If the minimum level is not reached for the relevant year  each performance award pertaining to that year will entitle participants to receive zero Series B shares  whereas if the maximum level is reached  each performance award pertaining to the relevant year will entitle participants to receive one Series B share. If the outcome falls between the minimum level and the maximum level  participants' entitlement to Series B shares will be calculated linearly between zero and one series B share per performance award. The Board intends to present the fulfilment of the performance-based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2024.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.The performance awards shall be awarded free of charge at the end of the Investment Period  subject to vesting.Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free of charge (subject to the performance condition set out above) three years after allotment of the award (the ""Vesting Period"")  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  is still employed by the Securitas Group as per 31 December 2024 and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2022/2024 during the entire Vesting Period.To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive after the Vesting Period.The number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive may be subject to recalculation due to share issues  splits  reverse splits and similar dispositions.The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The performance awards can be awarded by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2022/2024 in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Securitas Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2022/2024 no longer are appropriate. Such adjustments include a right for the Board to resolve on a reduction of the number of Series B shares that the performance awards would entitle a participant to receive  if the number of Series B shares that a participant would be entitled to – considering Securitas' result and financial position  other circumstances regarding the Group's development and the conditions on the stock market – would be clearly unreasonable.Furthermore  in the event that the Board considers that the delivery of shares under LTI 2022/2024 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Participation in LTI 2022/2024 also presumes that such participation is lawful and that such participation in Securitas' opinion can take place with reasonable administrative costs and economic efforts. The Board shall be entitled to implement an alternative incentive solution for employees in such countries where participation in LTI 2022/2024 is not advisable  which alternative solution shall  as far as practically possible  correspond to the terms of the LTI 2022/2024.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2022/2024 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 75 percent (CEO)  50 percent (other members of Group management) or 30 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to the number of Personally Invested Shares being maximized  meaning that the value of the participant's Personally Invested Shares corresponds to 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary  that the participant maintains the full amount of Personally Invested Shares during the entire Vesting Period  and that the participant  with some exceptions  still is employed as per 31 December 2024  and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved.The maximum number of Series B shares that a participant may nominate as Personally Invested Shares  and thus the total number of performance awards that may be allotted  shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share. The total number of issued shares in the company amounts to 365 058 897 shares.Based on the assumption that the share price for the company's Series B share amounts to SEK 111  LTI 2022/2024 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 661 675 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.18 percent of the total number of issued shares in the company and 0.13 percent of the total number of votes in the company.The costs for LTI 2022/2024 should be expensed as personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Provided that the performance-based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2022/2024 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 73.5 million  allocated over the Vesting Period. Estimated social security costs and financing costs are included in such amount.The Board proposes the AGM to resolve to authorize the Board to resolve on repurchase of shares in the company and to transfer such shares on a regulated market to cover social security costs and financing costs associated with LTI 2022/2024 (see separate item on the agenda).The costs for LTI 2022/2024 are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the Securitas Group.The Board deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior management and key employees  which may be further increased through LTI 2022/2024  outweighs the costs related to LTI 2022/2024.All estimates are based on at each time applicable foreign exchange rates according to Reuters. Information on previous incentive schemes for 2019  2020 and 2021 and the LTI Programs can be found in the Annual Report 2021  Notes 9 and 12.Delivery of shares under LTI 2022/2024 and hedging measuresTo ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2022/2024  the company may enter into a share-swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to employees participating in LTI 2022/2024. The cost for the swap is estimated at a maximum of SEK 600 000 assuming that the performance-based condition is fully achieved.Preparation of the proposal and voting majorityLTI 2022/2024 has been initiated by the Board and the Remuneration Committee of Securitas in consultation with major shareholders and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive schemes.

As we cannot predict which Covid-19 measures shall be applicable on the day of the General Meeting  we are proposing a webcasting of the General Meeting. To mitigate potential health risks for participants  there will be no social event  reception  or catering at the occasion of our General Meeting. If you prefer to avoid in-person presence  notably for health safety reasons  you may always cast your vote by proxy by giving mandate to the person of your choice or the one proposed by UCB SA/NV and also register for the webcasting (live stream with no interactions as explained in the participation formalities below).Applicable formalities are detailed at the end of this convening notice. Shareholders may  to the extent indicated  also use the Lumi Connect platform (formerly known as AGM+ platform) ( https://www.lumiconnect.com/en/events ) to complete all participation formalities and vote by proxy at the General Meeting.ORDINARY PARTReport of the Board of Directors on the annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 Report of the statutory auditor on the annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 Communication of the consolidated annual accounts of the UCB Group relating to the financial year ended 31 December 2021 Approval of the annual accounts of UCB SA/NV for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 and appropriation of the resultsStory continuesProposed resolution :The General Meeting approves the annual accounts of UCB SA/NV for the financial year ended31 December 2021 and the appropriation of the results reflected therein  including the approval of a gross dividend of € 1.30 per share (*).(*) The UCB shares held by UCB SA/NV (own shares) are not entitled to a dividend. Therefore  the aggregate amount to be distributed to the shareholders may fluctuate depending on the number of UCB shares held by UCB SA/NV (own shares) on the dividend approval date.Approval of the remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 December 2021The Belgian Code of Companies and Associations (BCCA) requires the General Meeting to approve the remuneration report each year by separate vote. This report includes a description of the remuneration policy that was applicable in 2021 and information on remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors and of the Executive Committee. The format and content of the remuneration report are compliant with the requirements of the Law of 28 April 2020 implementing the Shareholders Right Directive II (SRD II) in Belgian law and amending the BCCA.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting approves the remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.Approval of changes to the Remuneration of the BoardIn accordance with the Belgian Corporate Governance Code 2020 (the “Code 2020”) and the BCCA  UCB’s Remuneration Policy was submitted to and approved by General Meeting of 29 April 2021. This policy was applicable as from the financial year starting on 1 January 2021. For 2022  UCB would like to propose an adjustment to this policy in relation to the remuneration of the Board of Directors  which requires the approval of the General Meeting in accordance with art 2:50 of the BCCA. The proposed change is an increase of the remuneration of the Board committee chairs  to be effective upon approval by the General Meeting. This proposal results from a benchmark review that was carried out in view to ensure that UCB SA/NV could attract the best candidates for chairing its special committees  by proposing an appropriate level of compensation  also considering that the compensation of the Board members and especially for their roles in special committees have not been reviewed nor adjusted since 2019. In addition  we observe increasing demands on our board members  in particular for our Committee Chairs  where the environment and related governance legislation have become more complex  resulting in higher workload. The proposed increased remuneration corresponds to a level closer to the regressed median of our European Pharma reference UCB peer group (i.e. relevant peer pharma median data  adjusted to UCB’s revenue size)  as disclosed in the Remuneration Report 2021 and can be summarized as follows: (i) Audit Committee Chair: from EUR 33 500 EUR (current) to EUR 45 000 (proposed); (ii) Governance  Nomination and Compensation Committee Chair: from EUR 22 500 (current) to EUR 35 000 (proposed) and (iii) Scientific Committee Chair: from EUR 33 500 (current) to EUR 35 000 (proposed).In addition  it is proposed to convert the previously approved special travel allowance for our Board members residing in a country with at least 5 hours of time zone difference with Belgium (EUR 7 500 per meeting  with at least 6 meetings per year)  into a fixed lump-sum allowance of EUR 45 000  irrespective of the actual travel. This is mainly to consider the inconvenience of attending meetings which are mostly in Europe.The other components of the remuneration of the Board remain unchanged. For more details on the total remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors  please refer to the Remuneration Report available on UCB website.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting (i) fixes the annual remuneration of the Chair of the Audit Committee at EUR 45 000  the annual remuneration of the Chair of the Governance  Nomination and Compensation Committee at EUR 35 000 and the annual remuneration of the Chair of the Scientific Committee at EUR 35 000 and (ii) approves the conversion of the travel allowance of 7 500 Euro per meeting into a fixed lump-sum travel allowance of EUR 45 000 per member of the Board of Directors residing in a country where the time zone difference with Belgium is 5 hours or more (in addition to regular travel expense reimbursement).Discharge in favour of the directorsPursuant to the BCCA  the General Meeting must  after approval of the annual accounts  vote on the discharge of liability of the directors for the financial year ended on 31 December 2021.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting grants discharge to the directors for the performance of their duties during the financial year ended 31 December 2021.Discharge in favour of the statutory auditorPursuant to the BCCA  the General Meeting must  after approval of the annual accounts  vote on the discharge of liability of the statutory auditor (Mazars).Proposed resolution :The General Meeting grants discharge to the statutory auditor for the performance of its duties during the financial year ended 31 December 2021.Directors: renewal of mandates of (independent) directorsThe mandates of Mrs. Kay Davies  Mr. Jean-Christophe Tellier and Mr. Cédric van Rijckevorsel shall expire at this General Meeting. Upon recommendation of the Governance  Nomination and Compensation Committee (“GNCC”)  the Board of Directors proposes: (i) the renewal of the mandate of Mrs. Kay Davies as independent director for a term of 4 years and (ii) the renewal of the mandate of Mr. Jean-Christophe Tellier and Mr. Cédric van Rijckevorsel as directors for a term of 4 years. While Mrs. Kay Davies reached the age limit in 2021  the Board is proposing to renew her mandate as permitted under section 3.2.4 of its Charter of Corporate Governance. Mrs. Kay Davies is chairing the Scientific Committee of the Board and is bringing a unique scientific contribution at the level of the Board. Applying the age limitation rule without exception would have led to a simultaneous change of the two scientists of the Board in the period 2021-2022. Given the long development cycles in creating new medicines that can span more than a decade  coupled with new drug research modalities such as gene therapy where UCB is investing in new platforms  proposing the re-election of Mrs. Kay Davis for a new mandate is considered by the Board the best option to maintain continuity in the follow up of this key scientific evolution for UCB. It also allows the company to count another new key scientist in the Board (Susan Gasser). Her re-election is guaranteeing that UCB maintains a sufficient level of gender diversity in the Board as requested by Belgian law. If re-elected  Mrs. Kay Davies shall continue to be the Chair of the Scientific Committee and member of the GNCC. She meets the independence criteria stipulated by article 7:87 of the BCCA  by provision 3.5 of the Code 2020 and by the Board of Directors. Subject to the abovementioned renewals by the General Meeting  the Board will continue to be composed of a majority of independent directors.Proposed resolutions :9.1. A) The General Meeting renews the appointment of Mrs. Kay Davies (*) as director for a term of four years until the close of the annual General Meeting of 2026.B) The General Meeting acknowledges that  from the information made available to the Company  Mrs. Kay Davies qualifies as an independent director according to the independence criteria provided for by article 7:87 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  by provision 3.5 of the 2020 Belgian Corporate Governance Code and by the Board and appoints her as independent director.9.2. The General Meeting renews the appointment of Mr. Jean-Christophe Tellier (*) as director for a term of four years until the close of the annual General Meeting of 2026.9.3. The General Meeting renews the appointment of Mr. Cédric van Rijckevorsel (*) as director for a term of four years until the close of the annual General Meeting of 2026.(*) Curriculum vitae and details are available at https://www.ucb.com/investors/UCB-shareholders/Shareholders-meeting-2022SPECIAL PART10. Long-Term Incentive Plans - Program of free allocation of sharesThis approval requested from the General Meeting is not as such required by Belgian law but is sought in order to ensure transparency and  as the case may be  compliance with foreign law for certain jurisdictions where our Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTI plans) are offered to our employees. For more information on UCB’s LTI plans  please refer to the 2021 remuneration report. For the avoidance of doubt  UCB confirms that it covers all its obligations under the LTI Plans with existing shares  i.e. through share buybacks  so there is no dilution for existing shareholders of UCB SA/NV.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting approves the decision of the Board of Directors to allocate an estimated number of 960 000 free shares:a) of which an estimated number of 800 000 shares to eligible employees under the Long-Term Inventive policy (LTI policy)  namely to 2 474 individuals  according to the applicable allocation criteria. These free shares will only vest if and when the eligible employees are still employed within the UCB Group three years after the grant of the awards;b) of which an estimated number of 160 000 shares to eligible employees under the Performance Share Plan  namely to 141 individuals  according to the applicable allocation criteria. These free shares will be delivered after a three-year vesting period and the number of shares actually allocated will vary from 0% to 150% of the number of shares initially granted depending on the level of achievement of the performance conditions set by the Board of UCB SA/NV at the moment of grant.The estimated figures under a) and b) do not take into account employees hired or promoted to eligible levels between 1 January 2022 and 1 April 2022.11. Change of control provisions - art. 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and AssociationsPursuant to article 7:151 of the BCCA  the General Meeting is solely competent to approve so-called ‘change of control’ clauses  i.e.  provisions whereby third parties are granted rights having a substantial influence on the assets of the Company or causing a substantial debt or liability for the Company  if the exercise of such rights depends on the launch of a public takeover bid on the shares of the Company or a change of control thereof. These clauses are standard requests from our creditors and/or in the legal documentation of our financing arrangements.11.1 EMTN Program – renewalUCB SA/NV has entered into a Euro Medium Term Note Program dated 6 March 2013 for an amount ofEUR 3 000 000 000  with last update of the Base Prospectus on 8 March 2021  whereby the amount was increased to EUR 5 000 000 000  as this program may be further amended  extended or updated from time to time (the “EMTN Program”). The terms of the EMTN Program provide for a change of control clause - condition 5 (e) (i) - under which  for any of the Notes issued under the EMTN Program where a change of control put is included in the relevant final terms  any and all of the holders of such notes can  in certain circumstances  require UCB SA/NV to redeem that Note  following a change of control at the level of UCB SA/NV  upon exercise of the change of control put  for a value equal to the put redemption amount increased with  if appropriate  interest accrued until the date of exercise of the change of control put (all as more particularly described in the Base Prospectus of the EMTN Program). In accordance with said article 7:151 of the BCCA  this clause must be approved by the General Meeting and it is hereby proposed to renew this approval for any series of notes issued under the EMTN Program including such clause during the next 12 months.Proposed resolution :Pursuant to article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  the General Meeting renews its approval: (i) of condition 5 (e) (i) of the Terms and Conditions of the EMTN Program (Redemption at the Option of Noteholders – Upon a Change of Control (Change of Control Put))  in respect of any series of notes to which such condition is made applicable being issued under the Program from 28 April 2022 until 27 April 2023  under which any and all of the holders of the relevant notes can  in certain circumstances when a change of control at the level of UCB SA/NV occurs  require UCB SA/NV to redeem that note on the change of control put date at the put redemption amount together  if appropriate  with interest accrued to such change of control put date  following a change of control of UCB SA/NV; and (ii) of any other provision of the EMTN Program or notes issued under the EMTN Program granting rights to third parties which could affect an obligation on UCB SA/NV where in each case the exercise of these rights is dependent on the occurrence of a change of control.11.2 European Investment Bank Facility Agreement of EUR 350 million entered on 18 November 2021UCB SA/NV has entered a Facility Agreement in the amount of EUR 350 000 000 between  amongst others  UCB SA/NV as borrower  and the European Investment Bank as lender  dated 18 November 2021  including clauses according to which the loan  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  could in certain circumstances become immediately due and payable  at the discretion of the European Investment Bank and following a change of control of UCB SA/NV.Proposed resolution :Pursuant to article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of the Companies and Associations  the General Meeting approves (i) Article 4.3 A (3) of the EUR 350 000 000 Facility Agreement entered into between  amongst others  UCB SA/NV as borrower  and the European Investment Bank as lender  dated 18 November 2021  under which the loan  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  could in certain circumstances become immediately due and payable  at the discretion of the European Investment Bank and following a change of control of UCB SA/NV  as it falls within the scope of Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  (ii) as well as any other provisions of the European Investment Bank Facility Agreement which may fall within the scope of Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.11.3 Term Facility Agreement of USD 800 million entered on 19 January 2022UCB SA/NV has entered a Term Facility Agreement in the amount of USD 800 000 000 between  amongst others  UCB SA/NV and UCB Biopharma SRL  as borrowers  and BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV and Barclays Bank PLC as bookrunners dated January 19  2022 including clauses  according to which any and all of the lenders can  in certain circumstances  cancel their commitments and require repayment of their participations in the loans  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  following a change of control of UCB SA/NV.Proposed resolution:Pursuant to article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of the Companies and Associations  the General Meeting approves (i) Clause 7.2 (b) of the USD 800 million Term Facility Agreement entered into between  amongst others  UCB SA/NV and UCB Biopharma SRL  as borrowers  and BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV and Barclays Bank PLC as bookrunners dated January 19  2022  under which any and all of the lenders can  in certain circumstances  cancel their commitments and require repayment of their participations in the loan  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  following a change of control of UCB SA/NV  as it falls within the scope of Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  (ii) as well as Clause 21.15 (Disposals) (in combination with Clause 22.2 (Other obligations) and Clause 22.12 (Acceleration)) and any other provisions of the Term Facility Agreement which may fall within the scope of Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.EXTRAORDINARY PART (Extraordinary General Meeting)The Extraordinary General Meeting will only validly deliberate on the items on its agenda if at least half of the capital is present or represented  in accordance with article 7:153 of the BCCA.

For further information on the use and purposes of the authorized capital  please refer to the special report of the Board of Directors prepared in accordance with article 7:199 of the BCCA.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting resolves to renew the authorization to the Board of Directors to increase the capital of the Company within the framework of the authorized capital for another two (2) years  and to amend article 6 of the Articles of Association accordingly to reflect this renewal.Subject to the approval of this resolution  the text of article 6 of the Articles of Association of the Company will be amended as follows:“ Article 6The capital can be increased one or more times by a decision of a General Meeting of shareholders constituted under the conditions required to modify the Articles of Association.The Board of Directors is authorized to increase the share capital amongst other by way of the issuance of shares  convertible bonds or subscription rights  in one or more transactions  within the limits set by law i. with up to 5% of the share capital at the time of the decision of the Board of Directors to make use of this authorization  in the event of a capital increase with cancellation or limitation of the preferential subscription rights of the shareholders (whether or not for the benefit of one or more specific persons who are not part of the personnel of the Company or of its subsidiaries  as defined in the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations) ii. with up to 10% of the share capital at the time of the decision of the Board of Directors to make use of this authorization  in the event of a capital increase without cancellation or limitation of the preferential subscription rights of the existing shareholders.In any event  the total amount by which the Board of Directors may increase the share capital by a combination of the authorizations set forth in (i) and (ii) above  is limited to 10% of the share capital at the time of the decision of the Board of Directors to make use of this authorization.The Board of Directors is moreover expressly authorized to make use of this authorization  within the limits as set out under (i) and (ii) of the second paragraph above  for the following operations:1. a capital increase or the issuance of convertible bonds or subscription rights with cancellation or limitation of the preferential subscription rights of the existing shareholders 2. a capital increase or the issuance of convertible bonds or subscription rights with cancellation or limitation of the preferential subscription rights of the existing shareholders for the benefit of one or more specific persons who are not part of the personnel of the Company or of its subsidiaries  as defined in the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  and3. a capital increase by incorporation of reserves.Any such capital increase may take any and all forms  including  but not limited to  contributions in cash or in kind  with or without share premium  with issuance of shares below  above or at par value  the incorporation of reserves and/or share premiums and/or profits carried forward  to the maximum extent permitted by the law.Any decision of the Board of Directors to use this authorization requires a 75% majority within the Board of Directors.This authorization is granted for a period of two (2) years as from the date of the publication in the appendices to the Belgian Official Gazette of the resolution of the Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting held on 28 April 2022.The Board of Directors is empowered  with full power of substitution  to amend the Articles of Association to reflect the capital increase(s) resulting from the exercise of its powers pursuant to this article.”Acquisition of own shares – renewal of authorizationIn accordance with article 7:215 of the BCCA  it is proposed to the General Meeting to renew the authorization granted to the Board of Directors by the extraordinary general meeting of 30 April 2020 to acquire own shares for up to 10% of the total number of shares of the Company  for two (2) years expiring on 30 June 2024. The previous authorization of 30 April 2020 will remain valid until it expires on 30 June 2022 and the new authorization will be effective as of 1 July 2022. As per previous years  this is a general-purpose authorization for share buybacks. It cannot be used in case a public takeover bid has been launched on UCB. The Board of Directors may for example (and without being limited thereto) use this authorization to service the Long-Term Incentive Plans of the UCB Group for employees and management.Proposed resolution :The Board of Directors is authorized to acquire  directly or indirectly  whether on or outside of the stock exchange  by way of purchase  exchange  contribution or any other way  up to 10% of the total number of the Company’s shares  as calculated on the date of each acquisition  for a price or an exchange value per share which will not be (i) higher than the highest price of the Company’s shares on Euronext Brussels on the day of the acquisition and (ii) lower than one (1) euro  without prejudice to article 8:5 of the royal decree of 29 April 2019 implementing the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations. As a result of such acquisition(s)  the Company  together with its direct or indirect subsidiaries  as well as persons acting on their own behalf but for the account of the Company or its direct or indirect subsidiaries  may not hold more than 10% of the total number of shares issued by the Company at the moment of the acquisition concerned. This authorization is granted for a period of two years starting on 1 July 2022 and expiring on 30 June 2024. This authorization extends to any acquisitions of the Company’s shares  directly or indirectly  by the Company’s direct subsidiaries in accordance with article 7:221 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations. The authorization granted by the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company on 30 April 2020 remains valid until 30 June 2022.Modification of Article 19  §1 of Articles of Association relating to the signature of the board minutes  to bring it in line with Article 7:95 §1 of the BCCAArticle 19  §1 of the Articles of Association of UCB SA/NV currently provides that the minutes of the Board meeting should be signed by all directors present at the meeting. This requirement is going beyond the rule of article 7:95 § 1 of the BCCA which requires that the minutes are signed by the Chair and any other director who wish to sign. It is therefore proposed to simplify this signature requirement of the Articles of Association by requesting the signature of the Chair and the Vice-Chair of the Board and any other director who wish so. Should the Chair or the Vice-Chair be unable to sign for any reason  any other director can sign the minutes. This should also help the implementation of electronic signature for the minutes of the Board. This change has no impact on shareholders rights.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting resolves to amend article 19  §1 of the Articles of Association to bring it in line with Article 7:95 §1 of the BCCA  as follows:“The proceedings of the Board shall be set down in minutes  to be kept in a special register and signed by the Chair and the Vice-Chair  as well as any other directors present at the meeting who express their wish to do so. In the event the Chair or the Vice-Chair are unable to sign for any reason  any other director can sign the minutes”.***PARTICIPATION FORMALITIESIn order to participate in the General Meeting  shareholders must comply with the following formalities:Kindly note that all due dates and times mentioned herein are the final deadlines and that these will not be extended due to a weekend  holiday or for any other reason.

For every Series B share purchased or nominated within the scope of LTI 2022/2024  the company will award so called performance awards free of charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2022/2024 is to create a strong long-term incentive for top executives of the Group  strengthen the Group's ability to retain and recruit top executives  provide competitive remuneration  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the executives concerned by enabling the participants to become substantial shareholders in the company. Through a share-based incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board believes that the implementation of LTI 2022/2024 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and consequently that LTI 2022/2024 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personally invested sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2022/2024  the participants will  with the exceptions stated below  have to either (i) purchase Series B shares in Securitas in the market and nominate such shares to LTI 2022/2024 or (ii) nominate Series B shares vested in LTI 2019/2021 or shares nominated in LTI 2019/2021 (without affecting the condition of LTI 2019/2021  to maintain personally invested shares during the entire vesting period) (""Personally Invested Shares""). Such investment in Personally Invested Shares shall be made during a period of up to one month  to end no later than 31 December 2022 (the ""Investment Period""). The Investment Period shall be determined by the Board and the intent is that the Investment Period will commence after the completion of the acquisition of Stanley Security and the subsequent rights issue.The value of a participant's Personally Invested Shares shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share and shall correspond to minimum 5 percent (all participants) and maximum 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's base salary.If the participant has access to inside information and therefore is prevented from purchasing or nominating Personally Invested Shares during the Investment Period  the Board shall be entitled to extend or postpone the Investment Period in individual cases  but no later than to the next AGM. The Board shall further  in individual cases  be entitled to accept nomination of shares acquired prior to the Investment Period  but not earlier than 1 January 2022  and/or through e.g. a pension insurance as Personally Invested Shares  where the participant  in the Board's opinion  has valid reasons for nominating such shares to LTI 2022/2024.Participants in LTI 2022/2024 and allocationLTI 2022/2024 is proposed to include approximately 90 senior executives and key employees within the Securitas Group  divided in three categories.Category 1For each Personally Invested Share by the CEO of the Group under LTI 2022/2024  the company will award five performance awards to the CEO.Category 2For each Personally Invested Share by another member of Group management (currently thirteen individuals) under LTI 2022/2024  the relevant individual will be awarded four performance awards.Category 3For each Personally Invested Share by another participant under LTI 2022/2024  the relevant individual will be awarded three performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of Securitas Series B shares that the performance awards will entitle the participant to receive depends on the annual development of Securitas' earnings per share[1]  compared to minimum and maximum target levels as defined by the Board  during the measurement period 1 January 2022 – 31 December 2024  where each year during the measurement period is compared to the previous year. The outcome is calculated yearly  whereby one third of the performance awards is measured against the outcome for 2022  one third is measured against the outcome for 2023 and one third is measured against the outcome for 2024.If the minimum level is not reached for the relevant year  each performance award pertaining to that year will entitle participants to receive zero Series B shares  whereas if the maximum level is reached  each performance award pertaining to the relevant year will entitle participants to receive one Series B share. If the outcome falls between the minimum level and the maximum level  participants' entitlement to Series B shares will be calculated linearly between zero and one series B share per performance award. The Board intends to present the fulfilment of the performance-based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2024.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.The performance awards shall be awarded free of charge at the end of the Investment Period  subject to vesting.Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free of charge (subject to the performance condition set out above) three years after allotment of the award (the ""Vesting Period"")  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  is still employed by the Securitas Group as per 31 December 2024 and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2022/2024 during the entire Vesting Period.and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2022/2024 during the entire Vesting Period. To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive after the Vesting Period.The number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive may be subject to recalculation due to share issues  splits  reverse splits and similar dispositions.The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The performance awards can be awarded by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2022/2024 in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Securitas Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2022/2024 no longer are appropriate. Such adjustments include a right for the Board to resolve on a reduction of the number of Series B shares that the performance awards would entitle a participant to receive  if the number of Series B shares that a participant would be entitled to – considering Securitas' result and financial position  other circumstances regarding the Group's development and the conditions on the stock market – would be clearly unreasonable.Furthermore  in the event that the Board considers that the delivery of shares under LTI 2022/2024 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Participation in LTI 2022/2024 also presumes that such participation is lawful and that such participation in Securitas' opinion can take place with reasonable administrative costs and economic efforts. The Board shall be entitled to implement an alternative incentive solution for employees in such countries where participation in LTI 2022/2024 is not advisable  which alternative solution shall  as far as practically possible  correspond to the terms of the LTI 2022/2024.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2022/2024 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 75 percent (CEO)  50 percent (other members of Group management) or 30 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to the number of Personally Invested Shares being maximized  meaning that the value of the participant's Personally Invested Shares corresponds to 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary  that the participant maintains the full amount of Personally Invested Shares during the entire Vesting Period  and that the participant  with some exceptions  still is employed as per 31 December 2024  and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved.The maximum number of Series B shares that a participant may nominate as Personally Invested Shares  and thus the total number of performance awards that may be allotted  shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share. The total number of issued shares in the company amounts to 365 058 897 shares.Based on the assumption that the share price for the company's Series B share amounts to SEK 111  LTI 2022/2024 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 661 675 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.18 percent of the total number of issued shares in the company and 0.13 percent of the total number of votes in the company.The costs for LTI 2022/2024 should be expensed as personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Provided that the performance-based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2022/2024 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 73.5 million  allocated over the Vesting Period. Estimated social security costs and financing costs are included in such amount.The Board proposes the AGM to resolve to authorize the Board to resolve on repurchase of shares in the company and to transfer such shares on a regulated market to cover social security costs and financing costs associated with LTI 2022/2024 (see separate item on the agenda).The costs for LTI 2022/2024 are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the Securitas Group.The Board deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior management and key employees  which may be further increased through LTI 2022/2024  outweighs the costs related to LTI 2022/2024.All estimates are based on at each time applicable foreign exchange rates according to Reuters. Information on previous incentive schemes for 2019  2020 and 2021 and the LTI Programs can be found in the Annual Report 2021  Notes 9 and 12.Delivery of shares under LTI 2022/2024 and hedging measuresTo ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2022/2024  the company may enter into a share-swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to employees participating in LTI 2022/2024. The cost for the swap is estimated at a maximum of SEK 600 000 assuming that the performance-based condition is fully achieved.Preparation of the proposal and voting majorityLTI 2022/2024 has been initiated by the Board and the Remuneration Committee of Securitas in consultation with major shareholders and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive schemes. LTI 2022/2024 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board. The resolution must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast  or  in case of equal voting  by the opinion supported by the Chair of the AGM.Item 18 – Proposal for amendment of the Articles of AssociationFor the purpose of adjusting the limits for the share capital and the number of shares in the Articles of Association in light of the new issue of shares with preferential right for the company's shareholders  which the Board intends to resolve upon based on the authorization from the annual general meeting proposed under item 19 of the agenda  the Board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend § 4 and the first and second section of § 5 in the Articles of Association in accordance with the following.Present wording Proposed wording § 4 The share capital shall be no less than SEK two hundred million (200 000 000) and no more than SEK eight hundred million (800 000 000). § 4 The share capital shall be no less than SEK three hundred million (300 000 000) and no more than SEK one thousand two hundred million (1 200 000 000).

Shares of class A may be issued up to a maximum number of two hundred and forty million (240 000 000) and shares of class B to a maximum number of one thousand two hundred million (1 200 000 000).A decision by the AGM on the proposal according to this item is  according to the Swedish Companies Act  valid only if it is supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast and the shares present at the AGM and if the owners of one-half of all shares of series A and nine-tenths of the shares of series A represented at the meeting consent to the amendment of the Articles of Association.Item 19 – Proposal for resolution on authorization of the Board to resolve on new issue of sharesFor the purpose of refinancing the bridge facilities that finance Securitas' acquisition of Stanley Security  the Board proposes the AGM to authorize the Board to resolve on issue of new shares with preferential rights for the company's shareholders during the period up to the Annual General Meeting 2023.

The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 18  Section 4 of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 10 – Approval of Remuneration ReportThe Board proposes that the AGM resolves to approve the Board's report regarding compensation pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act.Item 16 – Proposal for resolution on authorization of the Board to resolve on acquisition and transfer of the company's own sharesThe Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon acquisition of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) acquisition of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm  (ii) acquisition of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM for 2023  (iii) acquisition of shares may only be made so that the shares held by the company at any point in time does not exceed ten (10) percent of all shares in the company  (iv) acquisition of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for acquired shares shall be made in cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the acquisition.Furthermore  the Board proposes that the AGM authorizes the Board to resolve upon transfer of the company's own shares of Series B according to the following terms: (i) transfer of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses  on market terms  (ii) transfer of shares may take place on one or several occasions during the time up to the AGM 2023  (iii) the maximum number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the number of shares held by the company at the time of the Board's resolution  (iv) transfer of shares shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time  meaning the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price  (v) payment for transferred shares may be made in other forms than cash  and (vi) the Board should be authorized to decide upon any additional terms for the transfer. The authorization includes the right to resolve on deviation of the preferential rights of shareholders.The purpose of the proposed authorizations is to (a) allow the Board to adjust the company's capital structure  to contribute to shareholder value  (b) be able to exploit attractive acquisition opportunities by fully or partly financing future acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (c) ensure the company's undertakings in respect of share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants of incentive programs)  including covering social security costs. If the Board decides to adjust the company's capital structure in accordance with (a) above  the Board intends to propose that the company's share capital shall be decreased through share reduction of the repurchased shares.The Board has presented a motivated statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.A decision by the AGM on the proposal according to this item must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as the shares present at the AGM in order for the proposal to be adopted.Item 17 – Proposal for a long-term incentive program  including hedging measures by way of a share swap agreement (LTI 2022/2024)Summary of the programThe Annual General Meetings 2019  2020 and 2021 resolved on long-term incentive programs for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (together the ""LTI Programs""). Along the lines of the LTI Programs  the Board proposes that the AGM resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group (""LTI 2022/2024""). The main principles for LTI 2022/2024 are set out below.LTI 2022/2024 is proposed to include approximately 90 employees including the CEO  other members of Group management and certain other key employees within the Securitas Group. In order to participate in LTI 2022/2024 the participants will have to invest in Series B shares in Securitas at market price or nominate series B shares already held  as further set out below. For every Series B share purchased or nominated within the scope of LTI 2022/2024  the company will award so called performance awards free of charge in accordance with the terms stipulated below.The rationale for the proposalThe purpose of LTI 2022/2024 is to create a strong long-term incentive for top executives of the Group  strengthen the Group's ability to retain and recruit top executives  provide competitive remuneration  and to align the interests of the shareholders with the interests of the executives concerned by enabling the participants to become substantial shareholders in the company. Through a share-based incentive program  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's future earnings and value growth. In light of the above  the Board believes that the implementation of LTI 2022/2024 will have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and consequently that LTI 2022/2024 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Personally invested sharesIn order to participate in LTI 2022/2024  the participants will  with the exceptions stated below  have to either (i) purchase Series B shares in Securitas in the market and nominate such shares to LTI 2022/2024 or (ii) nominate Series B shares vested in LTI 2019/2021 or shares nominated in LTI 2019/2021 (without affecting the condition of LTI 2019/2021  to maintain personally invested shares during the entire vesting period) (""Personally Invested Shares""). Such investment in Personally Invested Shares shall be made during a period of up to one month  to end no later than 31 December 2022 (the ""Investment Period""). The Investment Period shall be determined by the Board and the intent is that the Investment Period will commence after the completion of the acquisition of Stanley Security and the subsequent rights issue.The value of a participant's Personally Invested Shares shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share and shall correspond to minimum 5 percent (all participants) and maximum 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participant's base salary.If the participant has access to inside information and therefore is prevented from purchasing or nominating Personally Invested Shares during the Investment Period  the Board shall be entitled to extend or postpone the Investment Period in individual cases  but no later than to the next AGM. The Board shall further  in individual cases  be entitled to accept nomination of shares acquired prior to the Investment Period  but not earlier than 1 January 2022  and/or through e.g. a pension insurance as Personally Invested Shares  where the participant  in the Board's opinion  has valid reasons for nominating such shares to LTI 2022/2024.Participants in LTI 2022/2024 and allocationLTI 2022/2024 is proposed to include approximately 90 senior executives and key employees within the Securitas Group  divided in three categories.Category 1For each Personally Invested Share by the CEO of the Group under LTI 2022/2024  the company will award five performance awards to the CEO.Category 2For each Personally Invested Share by another member of Group management (currently thirteen individuals) under LTI 2022/2024  the relevant individual will be awarded four performance awards.Category 3For each Personally Invested Share by another participant under LTI 2022/2024  the relevant individual will be awarded three performance awards.Performance conditionThe number of Securitas Series B shares that the performance awards will entitle the participant to receive depends on the annual development of Securitas' earnings per share[1]  compared to minimum and maximum target levels as defined by the Board  during the measurement period 1 January 2022 – 31 December 2024  where each year during the measurement period is compared to the previous year. The outcome is calculated yearly  whereby one third of the performance awards is measured against the outcome for 2022  one third is measured against the outcome for 2023 and one third is measured against the outcome for 2024.If the minimum level is not reached for the relevant year  each performance award pertaining to that year will entitle participants to receive zero Series B shares  whereas if the maximum level is reached  each performance award pertaining to the relevant year will entitle participants to receive one Series B share. If the outcome falls between the minimum level and the maximum level  participants' entitlement to Series B shares will be calculated linearly between zero and one series B share per performance award. The Board intends to present the fulfilment of the performance-based condition in the Annual Report for the financial year 2024.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.The performance awards shall be awarded free of charge at the end of the Investment Period  subject to vesting.Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share free of charge (subject to the performance condition set out above) three years after allotment of the award (the ""Vesting Period"")  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  is still employed by the Securitas Group as per 31 December 2024 and has maintained the full amount of Personally Invested Shares purchased or nominated under LTI 2022/2024 during the entire Vesting Period.To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  the company will compensate the participants for distributed dividend during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive after the Vesting Period.The number of Series B shares that each performance award may entitle the participant to receive may be subject to recalculation due to share issues  splits  reverse splits and similar dispositions.The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The performance awards can be awarded by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2022/2024 in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Securitas Group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTI 2022/2024 no longer are appropriate. Such adjustments include a right for the Board to resolve on a reduction of the number of Series B shares that the performance awards would entitle a participant to receive  if the number of Series B shares that a participant would be entitled to – considering Securitas' result and financial position  other circumstances regarding the Group's development and the conditions on the stock market – would be clearly unreasonable.Furthermore  in the event that the Board considers that the delivery of shares under LTI 2022/2024 cannot be achieved at reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  participants may instead be offered a cash settlement.Participation in LTI 2022/2024 also presumes that such participation is lawful and that such participation in Securitas' opinion can take place with reasonable administrative costs and economic efforts. The Board shall be entitled to implement an alternative incentive solution for employees in such countries where participation in LTI 2022/2024 is not advisable  which alternative solution shall  as far as practically possible  correspond to the terms of the LTI 2022/2024.Scope and cost of the programLTI 2022/2024 may  if the share price for the company's Series B share remains the same during the program's term  result in a maximum amount corresponding to 75 percent (CEO)  50 percent (other members of Group management) or 30 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary (excluding social security costs). Such outcome is subject to the number of Personally Invested Shares being maximized  meaning that the value of the participant's Personally Invested Shares corresponds to 15 percent (the CEO)  12.5 percent (other members of Group management) or 10 percent (other participants)  respectively  of the participants annual base salary  that the participant maintains the full amount of Personally Invested Shares during the entire Vesting Period  and that the participant  with some exceptions  still is employed as per 31 December 2024  and that the performance based condition has been fully achieved.The maximum number of Series B shares that a participant may nominate as Personally Invested Shares  and thus the total number of performance awards that may be allotted  shall be based on the market price for the company's Series B share. The total number of issued shares in the company amounts to 365 058 897 shares.Based on the assumption that the share price for the company's Series B share amounts to SEK 111  LTI 2022/2024 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 661 675 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.18 percent of the total number of issued shares in the company and 0.13 percent of the total number of votes in the company.The costs for LTI 2022/2024 should be expensed as personnel costs over the Vesting Period. Provided that the performance-based condition is fully achieved  the cost for LTI 2022/2024 before tax is  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  estimated to approximately SEK 73.5 million  allocated over the Vesting Period. Estimated social security costs and financing costs are included in such amount.The Board proposes the AGM to resolve to authorize the Board to resolve on repurchase of shares in the company and to transfer such shares on a regulated market to cover social security costs and financing costs associated with LTI 2022/2024 (see separate item on the agenda).The costs for LTI 2022/2024 are expected to have marginal effect on key ratios of the Securitas Group.The Board deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior management and key employees  which may be further increased through LTI 2022/2024  outweighs the costs related to LTI 2022/2024.All estimates are based on at each time applicable foreign exchange rates according to Reuters. Information on previous incentive schemes for 2019  2020 and 2021 and the LTI Programs can be found in the Annual Report 2021  Notes 9 and 12.Delivery of shares under LTI 2022/2024 and hedging measuresTo ensure the delivery of Series B shares under LTI 2022/2024  the company may enter into a share-swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to employees participating in LTI 2022/2024. The cost for the swap is estimated at a maximum of SEK 600 000 assuming that the performance-based condition is fully achieved.Preparation of the proposal and voting majorityLTI 2022/2024 has been initiated by the Board and the Remuneration Committee of Securitas in consultation with major shareholders and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of previous incentive schemes. LTI 2022/2024 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the Board. The resolution must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast  or  in case of equal voting  by the opinion supported by the Chair of the AGM.Item 18 – Proposal for amendment of the Articles of AssociationFor the purpose of adjusting the limits for the share capital and the number of shares in the Articles of Association in light of the new issue of shares with preferential right for the company's shareholders  which the Board intends to resolve upon based on the authorization from the annual general meeting proposed under item 19 of the agenda  the Board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend § 4 and the first and second section of § 5 in the Articles of Association in accordance with the following.Present wording Proposed wording § 4 The share capital shall be no less than SEK two hundred million (200 000 000) and no more than SEK eight hundred million (800 000 000). § 4 The share capital shall be no less than SEK three hundred million (300 000 000) and no more than SEK one thousand two hundred million (1 200 000 000).

Shares of class A may be issued up to a maximum number of two hundred and forty million (240 000 000) and shares of class B to a maximum number of one thousand two hundred million (1 200 000 000).A decision by the AGM on the proposal according to this item is  according to the Swedish Companies Act  valid only if it is supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast and the shares present at the AGM and if the owners of one-half of all shares of series A and nine-tenths of the shares of series A represented at the meeting consent to the amendment of the Articles of Association.Item 19 – Proposal for resolution on authorization of the Board to resolve on new issue of sharesFor the purpose of refinancing the bridge facilities that finance Securitas' acquisition of Stanley Security  the Board proposes the AGM to authorize the Board to resolve on issue of new shares with preferential rights for the company's shareholders during the period up to the Annual General Meeting 2023.

McWilliams will relinquish his Interim CEO role once the permanent CEO is in place.“Curtis is the ideal candidate to serve as Chairman of Kalera’s board”  said Kim Lopdrup  a Kalera Director. “Curtis has extensive experience in leading the boards of several U.S. public companies and  given his service as Interim CEO of Kalera  he understands Kalera’s story at an intimate level. He has developed strong trust and followership among employees  business partners  and investors.”“I am very excited about this opportunity ” said McWilliams. “While Kalera offers a portfolio of incredible products and technology  its greatest asset is the knowledge and proven execution the management team contributes to our business. They have an unwavering commitment to achieving our vision of growing the freshest  cleanest  most nutritious leafy greens for people around the globe.”McWilliams is a veteran executive with over 25 years of experience in finance and Real Estate.

Lopdrup said  “I have greatly enjoyed my time on Kalera’s Board. The company grows the best leafy greens I have ever tasted. They are ultra-fresh  ultra-clean and ultra-sustainable. The employees are amazing  too. I am sad that I will not be able to actively participate in the next phase of the Company’s journey  but I will continue to cheer the team on as they implement their exciting plans and will forever be a loyal customer.”About Kalera: Kalera is a vertical farming company headquartered in Orlando  Florida.

As a practicing physician regularly seeing people living with this uncommon form of cancer  I am encouraged to see the potential Cabometyx may bring for these patients with so few options.”The CHMP positive opinion was based on results from the pivotal COSMIC-311 Phase III trial in which  at a planned interim analysis with a median follow-up of 6.2 months  Cabometyx demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by 78% versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.22; 96% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.36; p<0.0001).1 Another primary endpoint  the objective response rate (ORR)  also favoured Cabometyx with 15% vs. 0% for placebo (p=0.028) at a median follow-up of 8.9 months  but did not meet the criteria for statistical significance. A further analysis  with a median follow-up of 10.1 months  was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2021  whereby Cabometyx continued to demonstrate superior median progression-free survival of 11.0 versus 1.9 months and a maintained reduction in the risk of disease progression or death of 78% versus placebo (HR: 0.22  96% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15-0.32; p<0.0001).2 The safety profile identified in the COSMIC-311 trial across the two analyses was consistent with that previously observed for Cabometyx  and adverse events were managed with dose modifications.1 2Steven Hildemann  M.D. PhD  Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Head of Global Medical Affairs and Global Patient Safety at Ipsen  said “ With the promising interim results from the COSMIC-311 trial further reinforced by the maintained significant progression-free survival benefit demonstrated in the final analysis  we are pleased that the CHMP has concluded that Cabometyx may offer an important treatment option for people affected by this uncommon cancer. Following this positive opinion  we look forward to receiving the final decision from the European Commission  potentially bringing Cabometyx one step closer to reaching a patient population in critical need of new treatment options.”This positive CHMP opinion follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval in September 2021 of Cabometyx for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic DTC that has progressed following prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible.About radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAI-R DTC)In 2020  over 580 000 new cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed worldwide.3 Thyroid cancer is the ninth most commonly occurring cancer globally and incidence is three times higher in women than in men  with the disease representing one in every 20 cancers diagnosed among women.3 While cancerous thyroid tumors include differentiated  medullary and anaplastic forms  differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) makes up about 90 to 95% of cases.5 6 These include papillary  follicular and Hürthle cell cancer.5 6 DTC is typically treated with surgery  followed by ablation of the remaining thyroid tissue with radioactive iodine (RAI)  but approximately 5 to 15% of cases are resistant to RAI treatment.7 Patients who develop RAI-R DTC have a poor prognosis with an average estimated survival of three to five years.8About the COSMIC-311 trialCOSMIC-311 is a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial that enrolled 258 patients at 164 sites globally.1 2 Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Cabometyx 60 mg or placebo once-daily.1 The primary endpoints were progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population as well as ORR in the first 100 randomly assigned patients (objective response rate intention-to-treat [OITT] population)  both evaluated by a blinded independent radiology committee. Additional endpoints include safety  overall survival and quality of life.1 Exelixis is the sponsor of COSMIC-311  and Ipsen is co-funding the trial. More information about this trial is available at ClinicalTrials.gov.About Cabometyx (cabozantinib)In the U.S.  Cabometyx tablets are approved for the treatment of people living with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC); for the treatment of people living with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib; for people living with RAI-R DTC who have been previously treated with VEGFR-targeted therapy; and for patients living with advanced RCC as a first-line treatment in combination with nivolumab.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ""believes""  ""anticipates"" and ""expects"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons and also taking into consideration assessment delays of certain clinical trials in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances  new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

(Sanofi) announced the approval of Libtayo® (cemiplimab) for the treatment of adult patients with cervical cancer who have progressed on or after prior platinum-based chemotherapy and who require additional systemic therapy to treat recurrent or metastatic disease. The approval is based on the Phase 3 EMPOWER-Cervical 1 Study of Cemiplimab in Adults With Cervical Cancer (NCT03257267). The trial  which was the largest-ever randomized clinical trial in advanced cervical cancer  included patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer whose histology was either squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma. Participants were randomized to receive either cemiplimab or the investigator's choice of chemotherapy. The primary endpoint for the trial was overall survivali.Sanofi logo (CNW Group/Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc.)Mark Surka  Ph.DOncology Medical Head  Sanofi Canada""While rates of cervical cancer in Canada are thankfully decliningii  due in large part to the effectiveness of the HPV vaccine in preventing cervical pre-cancers from formingiii  Canada still sees 1400 women diagnosed with this disease every yeariv and who need treatment options.

The human papilloma virus (HPV)  which is a sexually transmitted infection  is implicated in most cases of cervical cancer  though the factors that lead an infection with HPV to become cancerous are unknownvi. While cervical cancer is highly preventable and treatable  and Canada has set the goal of eliminating cervical cancer by 2040iii  in 2021 an estimated 1450 Canadians were diagnosed with the disease  and 380 died as a result of itvii.About LibtayoLibtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T-cells. By binding to PD-1  Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation.The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Current clinical development programs include Libtayo in combination with chemotherapy for advanced NSCLC irrespective of PD-L1 expression and Libtayo in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational  and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.Libtayo is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people's lives.

""The Hurricane twin-turbo is a no-compromise engine that delivers better fuel economy and an important reduction in greenhouse gases without asking our customers to give up performance.""Story continuesReducing greenhouse gas emissions is one part of Stellantis' commitment to cut its carbon footprint by 50% by 2030 and to lead the transportation industry by achieving Net Carbon Zero by 2038. Those goals are key elements of the Stellantis Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan.Specific horsepower and torque ratings will vary based on vehicle. The first vehicles powered by the Hurricane twin-turbo I-6 reach dealership showrooms this year.The foundation of the Hurricane twin-turbo is a deep-skirt cast-aluminum block with a structural aluminum alloy oil pan. Cross-bolted steel main bearing caps contain the strong rotating assembly of a forged steel crankshaft and forged steel connecting rods.Stellantis propulsion system engineers employed a suite of state-of-the-art technologies for the Hurricane twin-turbo to deliver reduced emissions and attain big-engine power:Two low-inertia  high-flow turbochargers for rapid response to throttle inputsPlasma Transfer Wire Arc (PTWA) coating in the cylinder bores for an ultra-thin  low-friction wear surfaceHigh-pressure (5 075 psi/350 bar) direct fuel injection with pumps (single for SO/dual for HO) actuated by a dedicated chain-driven shaftDual overhead camshafts with wide-range  fully independent variable valve timingFuel-saving engine stop-start (ESS) function with robust starter motor for quick restartsEngine-mounted water-to-air charge cooler with a dedicated coolingContinuously variable displacement oil pump with integrated scavenge stageThe Incredible Power of AirEach turbocharger in the Hurricane twin-turbo I-6 feeds three cylinders. From a performance standpoint  two smaller turbochargers with less inertia spin up faster and deliver boost to the engine at lower rpm than a single  large turbo.The compressed air passes through an engine-mounted water-to-air charge air cooler to reduce its temperature. Cooler air is denser  enabling better performance via advanced ignition timing  and helping manage in-cylinder temperatures. An electric pump circulates coolant after the engine is shut down to help cool the turbocharger units for enhanced durability.The high-pressure direct fuel injection system runs at 5 075 psi (350 bar) and uses injectors mounted centrally in the combustion chamber. This design promotes finer atomization and super-fine control of fuel delivery into the cylinder for higher power and lower emissions.The Hurricane's turbochargers are optimized for each version. The turbos on the Hurricane SO deliver peak boost of 22 psi  while the Hurricane HO turbos deliver 26 psi of peak boost.Helping the Hurricane HO deliver its enhanced performance are lightweight  oil-jet cooled  forged aluminum pistons with an anodized top ring land and a diamond-like coating (DLC) on the pins to minimize friction. The Hurricane HO runs with a 9.5:1 compression ratio and uses 91 octane premium fuel.With a focus on fuel economy  the Hurricane SO uses cast aluminum pistons with cast iron top ring land insert  running with a 10.4:1 compression ratio. It's use of cooled EGR helps reduce engine pumping losses and manage in-cylinder temperatures. Premium fuel is recommended.Tough Coating for The CylindersLess friction  reduced weight and unparalleled wear resistance from a thermal sprayed microstructure of metallic and oxide components that metallurgically transform are the key benefits of the PTWA coating inside the cylinders  an alternative to the traditional cast-in-place or pressed-in cast iron cylinder liners. The PTWA coating is ultra-thin  compared with 3 to 4 millimeters of a cast iron liner and has 10 times the wear resistance.The PTWA coating is applied to the Hurricane block during the manufacturing process at the Saltillo North Engine Plant. The process  adapted from the aerospace industry  melts a steel alloy wire at 2 300 degrees Celsius (4 150 degrees Fahrenheit)  producing microscopic particles sprayed onto the cylinder walls at high velocities  where the particles splat-cool to form the coating and form a physical bond to the aluminum cylinder bore.Access the entire press release.StellantisStellantis N.V.

The overall 38% growth in revenue  from € 24.1 million in 2020 to € 33.2 million this year  was largely driven by the above-mentioned acquisitions  i.e. 21%  while the existing activities improved by 17%.The geotechnical activities in Belgium continued their strong growth  and the Environment divisions benefited from the strongly increased demand  both in terms of PFAS and asbestos. The Translab subsidiary bridges both activities here  and has expanded its originally asbestos-focussed operations using environmentally-targeted laboratory tests. In addition to the 3% growth due to the contribution from the newly acquired Asper in July  this results in an organic growth of 17%  which led to an increase in the total revenue in Belgium from € 15.4 million to € 18.4 million in 2021.The Dutch companies in the Group also confirmed their strong performance of the first half of the year  with a purely organic growth of 16%. Although the consultancy services were under pressure in an increasingly tight employment market  the environmental leg was the growth factor here  thanks to a large increase in field work.EBITDA increases to € 8.1 millionThe EBITDA amounted to € 8.1 million  an increase of € 559 thousand. After a margin decline in the first half of the year due to the integration costs of the French acquisitions  a clear recovery is now visible  with an EBITDA margin of 13.3% compared to the revenue in the second half of the year. The integration of the acquisitions is advancing well  and it is expected that they will be able to contribute positively to the profitability of the Group in 2022.The tightness in the employment market remains an issue  however. In order to further support growth  the Group continues to actively search for competent profiles  while maintaining a continued focus on the training and education of existing employees. Rising salary costs due to the additional recruitment  both recent and expected indexations  as well as the short-term absorption of staff shortages through temporary employment agencies  will remain a focus of attention in the future.Depreciations increased from € 4.5 to € 5.0 million. ABO-GROUP continues to invest in the renovation and expansion of its machinery in order to be able to respond adequately to the needs of its customers. Several new machines were purchased in 2021  including several drill and probing machines  as well as specialised laboratory equipment.The financial result has slightly increased  in line with the increased debt level. In France  the Group could again rely on a R&D tax credit amounting to € 355 thousand (compared to € 270 thousand in 2020). The net profit remained stable at € 2.0 million (€ 0.19 per share).Solid € 6.8 million operating cash flow and net debt of 1.1x EBITDAThe net cash flow from operating activities amounted to € 6.8 million (-22% compared to 2020)  driven by the increase of the working capital requirements due to the strong growth in revenue. The trade receivables and other short-term assets increased by € 3.5 million  while the trade payables and other short-term liabilities increased by € 2.8 million  resulting in the operating capital increasing by € 730 thousand at the end of the year.As a result of the recent acquisitions  as well as the investments in operating capital and fixed assets  the net financial debt increased by 25%  from € 7.4 million at the end of 2020 to € 9.3 million. With a ratio of 1.1x to the operating result before depreciation  the debt ratio remains very healthy and provides the Group with room to consider new acquisitions.The balance sheet total increased from € 57.0 to € 65.6 million. On the assets side  this mainly reflects the recent acquisitions  as well as the above-mentioned increase in operating capital  while  on the liabilities side  the short and long-term debts increased. Total equity also increased further to € 20.5 million (compared to € 19.0 million at the end of 2020). The equity ratio settled at a healthy 31.2%.The full consolidated income statement and balance sheet  the statement of changes in equity and the consolidated cash flow statement are shown below.Outlook2022 started with the momentum from 2021  with a first acquisition being an indicator of further growth ambitionsIn 2022  ABO-GROUP is continuing with the momentum of 2021  with a strong commercial performance in the first months of the year. The order books of the various subsidiaries are well filled  and provide confidence for the rest of the year.In addition  the Group was already able to announce its first acquisition in 2022  i.e. the acquisition of the soil activities of Colsen in Zeeland (the Netherlands) and  as always  is actively looking for other interesting targets that can further strengthen the Group’s product portfolio and geographic reach within its domestic markets. The Group considers it likely that additional announcements will follow.The Board and the operating managements are convinced that the Group is on-track to achieve the targeted development that was outlined last year  with the aim of reaching the revenue cap of € 100 million by the end of 2025 at the latest. The strong organic growth figures in 2021 demonstrate that the Group has the capacity to expand its activities on its own. In combination with targeted acquisitions that tap into new markets  segments or skills  ABO-GROUP is well positioned to deliver the technical market leadership it is aiming for in its domestic markets.Financial calendar22/04/2022: Publication of the 2021 annual report and invitation to the General Meeting25/05/2021: General Meeting16/09/2021: Figures for the first half of 2022Statement of the statutory auditorThe statutory auditor  EY Bedrijfsrevisoren BV  represented by Paul Eelen  has confirmed that the audit  which is substantially complete  has to date not revealed any material misstatement in the consolidated income statement  the consolidated statement of comprehensive income  the consolidated balance sheet  the consolidated statement of changes in equity or the consolidated statement of cash flow as included in this press release.About the ABO-GROUPABO-GROUP is a specialised  listed engineering office focussing on geotechnology  environment and soil remediation.

As we cannot predict which Covid-19 measures shall be applicable on the day of the General Meeting  we are proposing a webcasting of the General Meeting. To mitigate potential health risks for participants  there will be no social event  reception  or catering at the occasion of our General Meeting. If you prefer to avoid in-person presence  notably for health safety reasons  you may always cast your vote by proxy by giving mandate to the person of your choice or the one proposed by UCB SA/NV and also register for the webcasting (live stream with no interactions as explained in the participation formalities below).Applicable formalities are detailed at the end of this convening notice. Shareholders may  to the extent indicated  also use the Lumi Connect platform (formerly known as AGM+ platform) ( https://www.lumiconnect.com/en/events ) to complete all participation formalities and vote by proxy at the General Meeting.ORDINARY PARTReport of the Board of Directors on the annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 Report of the statutory auditor on the annual accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 Communication of the consolidated annual accounts of the UCB Group relating to the financial year ended 31 December 2021 Approval of the annual accounts of UCB SA/NV for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 and appropriation of the resultsStory continuesProposed resolution :The General Meeting approves the annual accounts of UCB SA/NV for the financial year ended31 December 2021 and the appropriation of the results reflected therein  including the approval of a gross dividend of € 1.30 per share (*).(*) The UCB shares held by UCB SA/NV (own shares) are not entitled to a dividend. Therefore  the aggregate amount to be distributed to the shareholders may fluctuate depending on the number of UCB shares held by UCB SA/NV (own shares) on the dividend approval date.Approval of the remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 December 2021The Belgian Code of Companies and Associations (BCCA) requires the General Meeting to approve the remuneration report each year by separate vote. This report includes a description of the remuneration policy that was applicable in 2021 and information on remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors and of the Executive Committee. The format and content of the remuneration report are compliant with the requirements of the Law of 28 April 2020 implementing the Shareholders Right Directive II (SRD II) in Belgian law and amending the BCCA.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting approves the remuneration report for the financial year ended 31 December 2021.Approval of changes to the Remuneration of the BoardIn accordance with the Belgian Corporate Governance Code 2020 (the “Code 2020”) and the BCCA  UCB’s Remuneration Policy was submitted to and approved by General Meeting of 29 April 2021. This policy was applicable as from the financial year starting on 1 January 2021. For 2022  UCB would like to propose an adjustment to this policy in relation to the remuneration of the Board of Directors  which requires the approval of the General Meeting in accordance with art 2:50 of the BCCA. The proposed change is an increase of the remuneration of the Board committee chairs  to be effective upon approval by the General Meeting. This proposal results from a benchmark review that was carried out in view to ensure that UCB SA/NV could attract the best candidates for chairing its special committees  by proposing an appropriate level of compensation  also considering that the compensation of the Board members and especially for their roles in special committees have not been reviewed nor adjusted since 2019. In addition  we observe increasing demands on our board members  in particular for our Committee Chairs  where the environment and related governance legislation have become more complex  resulting in higher workload. The proposed increased remuneration corresponds to a level closer to the regressed median of our European Pharma reference UCB peer group (i.e. relevant peer pharma median data  adjusted to UCB’s revenue size)  as disclosed in the Remuneration Report 2021 and can be summarized as follows: (i) Audit Committee Chair: from EUR 33 500 EUR (current) to EUR 45 000 (proposed); (ii) Governance  Nomination and Compensation Committee Chair: from EUR 22 500 (current) to EUR 35 000 (proposed) and (iii) Scientific Committee Chair: from EUR 33 500 (current) to EUR 35 000 (proposed).In addition  it is proposed to convert the previously approved special travel allowance for our Board members residing in a country with at least 5 hours of time zone difference with Belgium (EUR 7 500 per meeting  with at least 6 meetings per year)  into a fixed lump-sum allowance of EUR 45 000  irrespective of the actual travel. This is mainly to consider the inconvenience of attending meetings which are mostly in Europe.The other components of the remuneration of the Board remain unchanged. For more details on the total remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors  please refer to the Remuneration Report available on UCB website.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting (i) fixes the annual remuneration of the Chair of the Audit Committee at EUR 45 000  the annual remuneration of the Chair of the Governance  Nomination and Compensation Committee at EUR 35 000 and the annual remuneration of the Chair of the Scientific Committee at EUR 35 000 and (ii) approves the conversion of the travel allowance of 7 500 Euro per meeting into a fixed lump-sum travel allowance of EUR 45 000 per member of the Board of Directors residing in a country where the time zone difference with Belgium is 5 hours or more (in addition to regular travel expense reimbursement).Discharge in favour of the directorsPursuant to the BCCA  the General Meeting must  after approval of the annual accounts  vote on the discharge of liability of the directors for the financial year ended on 31 December 2021.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting grants discharge to the directors for the performance of their duties during the financial year ended 31 December 2021.Discharge in favour of the statutory auditorPursuant to the BCCA  the General Meeting must  after approval of the annual accounts  vote on the discharge of liability of the statutory auditor (Mazars).Proposed resolution :The General Meeting grants discharge to the statutory auditor for the performance of its duties during the financial year ended 31 December 2021.Directors: renewal of mandates of (independent) directorsThe mandates of Mrs. Kay Davies  Mr. Jean-Christophe Tellier and Mr. Cédric van Rijckevorsel shall expire at this General Meeting. Upon recommendation of the Governance  Nomination and Compensation Committee (“GNCC”)  the Board of Directors proposes: (i) the renewal of the mandate of Mrs. Kay Davies as independent director for a term of 4 years and (ii) the renewal of the mandate of Mr. Jean-Christophe Tellier and Mr. Cédric van Rijckevorsel as directors for a term of 4 years. While Mrs. Kay Davies reached the age limit in 2021  the Board is proposing to renew her mandate as permitted under section 3.2.4 of its Charter of Corporate Governance. Mrs. Kay Davies is chairing the Scientific Committee of the Board and is bringing a unique scientific contribution at the level of the Board. Applying the age limitation rule without exception would have led to a simultaneous change of the two scientists of the Board in the period 2021-2022. Given the long development cycles in creating new medicines that can span more than a decade  coupled with new drug research modalities such as gene therapy where UCB is investing in new platforms  proposing the re-election of Mrs. Kay Davis for a new mandate is considered by the Board the best option to maintain continuity in the follow up of this key scientific evolution for UCB. It also allows the company to count another new key scientist in the Board (Susan Gasser). Her re-election is guaranteeing that UCB maintains a sufficient level of gender diversity in the Board as requested by Belgian law. If re-elected  Mrs. Kay Davies shall continue to be the Chair of the Scientific Committee and member of the GNCC. She meets the independence criteria stipulated by article 7:87 of the BCCA  by provision 3.5 of the Code 2020 and by the Board of Directors. Subject to the abovementioned renewals by the General Meeting  the Board will continue to be composed of a majority of independent directors.Proposed resolutions :9.1. A) The General Meeting renews the appointment of Mrs. Kay Davies (*) as director for a term of four years until the close of the annual General Meeting of 2026.B) The General Meeting acknowledges that  from the information made available to the Company  Mrs. Kay Davies qualifies as an independent director according to the independence criteria provided for by article 7:87 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  by provision 3.5 of the 2020 Belgian Corporate Governance Code and by the Board and appoints her as independent director.9.2. The General Meeting renews the appointment of Mr. Jean-Christophe Tellier (*) as director for a term of four years until the close of the annual General Meeting of 2026.9.3. The General Meeting renews the appointment of Mr. Cédric van Rijckevorsel (*) as director for a term of four years until the close of the annual General Meeting of 2026.(*) Curriculum vitae and details are available at https://www.ucb.com/investors/UCB-shareholders/Shareholders-meeting-2022SPECIAL PART10. Long-Term Incentive Plans - Program of free allocation of sharesThis approval requested from the General Meeting is not as such required by Belgian law but is sought in order to ensure transparency and  as the case may be  compliance with foreign law for certain jurisdictions where our Long-Term Incentive Plans (LTI plans) are offered to our employees. For more information on UCB’s LTI plans  please refer to the 2021 remuneration report. For the avoidance of doubt  UCB confirms that it covers all its obligations under the LTI Plans with existing shares  i.e. through share buybacks  so there is no dilution for existing shareholders of UCB SA/NV.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting approves the decision of the Board of Directors to allocate an estimated number of 960 000 free shares:a) of which an estimated number of 800 000 shares to eligible employees under the Long-Term Inventive policy (LTI policy)  namely to 2 474 individuals  according to the applicable allocation criteria. These free shares will only vest if and when the eligible employees are still employed within the UCB Group three years after the grant of the awards;b) of which an estimated number of 160 000 shares to eligible employees under the Performance Share Plan  namely to 141 individuals  according to the applicable allocation criteria. These free shares will be delivered after a three-year vesting period and the number of shares actually allocated will vary from 0% to 150% of the number of shares initially granted depending on the level of achievement of the performance conditions set by the Board of UCB SA/NV at the moment of grant.The estimated figures under a) and b) do not take into account employees hired or promoted to eligible levels between 1 January 2022 and 1 April 2022.11. Change of control provisions - art. 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and AssociationsPursuant to article 7:151 of the BCCA  the General Meeting is solely competent to approve so-called ‘change of control’ clauses  i.e.  provisions whereby third parties are granted rights having a substantial influence on the assets of the Company or causing a substantial debt or liability for the Company  if the exercise of such rights depends on the launch of a public takeover bid on the shares of the Company or a change of control thereof. These clauses are standard requests from our creditors and/or in the legal documentation of our financing arrangements.11.1 EMTN Program – renewalUCB SA/NV has entered into a Euro Medium Term Note Program dated 6 March 2013 for an amount ofEUR 3 000 000 000  with last update of the Base Prospectus on 8 March 2021  whereby the amount was increased to EUR 5 000 000 000  as this program may be further amended  extended or updated from time to time (the “EMTN Program”). The terms of the EMTN Program provide for a change of control clause - condition 5 (e) (i) - under which  for any of the Notes issued under the EMTN Program where a change of control put is included in the relevant final terms  any and all of the holders of such notes can  in certain circumstances  require UCB SA/NV to redeem that Note  following a change of control at the level of UCB SA/NV  upon exercise of the change of control put  for a value equal to the put redemption amount increased with  if appropriate  interest accrued until the date of exercise of the change of control put (all as more particularly described in the Base Prospectus of the EMTN Program). In accordance with said article 7:151 of the BCCA  this clause must be approved by the General Meeting and it is hereby proposed to renew this approval for any series of notes issued under the EMTN Program including such clause during the next 12 months.Proposed resolution :Pursuant to article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  the General Meeting renews its approval: (i) of condition 5 (e) (i) of the Terms and Conditions of the EMTN Program (Redemption at the Option of Noteholders – Upon a Change of Control (Change of Control Put))  in respect of any series of notes to which such condition is made applicable being issued under the Program from 28 April 2022 until 27 April 2023  under which any and all of the holders of the relevant notes can  in certain circumstances when a change of control at the level of UCB SA/NV occurs  require UCB SA/NV to redeem that note on the change of control put date at the put redemption amount together  if appropriate  with interest accrued to such change of control put date  following a change of control of UCB SA/NV; and (ii) of any other provision of the EMTN Program or notes issued under the EMTN Program granting rights to third parties which could affect an obligation on UCB SA/NV where in each case the exercise of these rights is dependent on the occurrence of a change of control.11.2 European Investment Bank Facility Agreement of EUR 350 million entered on 18 November 2021UCB SA/NV has entered a Facility Agreement in the amount of EUR 350 000 000 between  amongst others  UCB SA/NV as borrower  and the European Investment Bank as lender  dated 18 November 2021  including clauses according to which the loan  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  could in certain circumstances become immediately due and payable  at the discretion of the European Investment Bank and following a change of control of UCB SA/NV.Proposed resolution :Pursuant to article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of the Companies and Associations  the General Meeting approves (i) Article 4.3 A (3) of the EUR 350 000 000 Facility Agreement entered into between  amongst others  UCB SA/NV as borrower  and the European Investment Bank as lender  dated 18 November 2021  under which the loan  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  could in certain circumstances become immediately due and payable  at the discretion of the European Investment Bank and following a change of control of UCB SA/NV  as it falls within the scope of Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  (ii) as well as any other provisions of the European Investment Bank Facility Agreement which may fall within the scope of Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.11.3 Term Facility Agreement of USD 800 million entered on 19 January 2022UCB SA/NV has entered a Term Facility Agreement in the amount of USD 800 000 000 between  amongst others  UCB SA/NV and UCB Biopharma SRL  as borrowers  and BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV and Barclays Bank PLC as bookrunners dated January 19  2022 including clauses  according to which any and all of the lenders can  in certain circumstances  cancel their commitments and require repayment of their participations in the loans  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  following a change of control of UCB SA/NV.Proposed resolution:Pursuant to article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of the Companies and Associations  the General Meeting approves (i) Clause 7.2 (b) of the USD 800 million Term Facility Agreement entered into between  amongst others  UCB SA/NV and UCB Biopharma SRL  as borrowers  and BNP Paribas Fortis SA/NV and Barclays Bank PLC as bookrunners dated January 19  2022  under which any and all of the lenders can  in certain circumstances  cancel their commitments and require repayment of their participations in the loan  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  following a change of control of UCB SA/NV  as it falls within the scope of Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  (ii) as well as Clause 21.15 (Disposals) (in combination with Clause 22.2 (Other obligations) and Clause 22.12 (Acceleration)) and any other provisions of the Term Facility Agreement which may fall within the scope of Article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations.EXTRAORDINARY PART (Extraordinary General Meeting)The Extraordinary General Meeting will only validly deliberate on the items on its agenda if at least half of the capital is present or represented  in accordance with article 7:153 of the BCCA.

The previous authorization of 30 April 2020 will remain valid until it expires on 30 June 2022 and the new authorization will be effective as of 1 July 2022. As per previous years  this is a general-purpose authorization for share buybacks. It cannot be used in case a public takeover bid has been launched on UCB. The Board of Directors may for example (and without being limited thereto) use this authorization to service the Long-Term Incentive Plans of the UCB Group for employees and management.Proposed resolution :The Board of Directors is authorized to acquire  directly or indirectly  whether on or outside of the stock exchange  by way of purchase  exchange  contribution or any other way  up to 10% of the total number of the Company’s shares  as calculated on the date of each acquisition  for a price or an exchange value per share which will not be (i) higher than the highest price of the Company’s shares on Euronext Brussels on the day of the acquisition and (ii) lower than one (1) euro  without prejudice to article 8:5 of the royal decree of 29 April 2019 implementing the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations. As a result of such acquisition(s)  the Company  together with its direct or indirect subsidiaries  as well as persons acting on their own behalf but for the account of the Company or its direct or indirect subsidiaries  may not hold more than 10% of the total number of shares issued by the Company at the moment of the acquisition concerned. This authorization is granted for a period of two years starting on 1 July 2022 and expiring on 30 June 2024. This authorization extends to any acquisitions of the Company’s shares  directly or indirectly  by the Company’s direct subsidiaries in accordance with article 7:221 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations. The authorization granted by the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company on 30 April 2020 remains valid until 30 June 2022.Modification of Article 19  §1 of Articles of Association relating to the signature of the board minutes  to bring it in line with Article 7:95 §1 of the BCCAArticle 19  §1 of the Articles of Association of UCB SA/NV currently provides that the minutes of the Board meeting should be signed by all directors present at the meeting. This requirement is going beyond the rule of article 7:95 § 1 of the BCCA which requires that the minutes are signed by the Chair and any other director who wish to sign. It is therefore proposed to simplify this signature requirement of the Articles of Association by requesting the signature of the Chair and the Vice-Chair of the Board and any other director who wish so. Should the Chair or the Vice-Chair be unable to sign for any reason  any other director can sign the minutes. This should also help the implementation of electronic signature for the minutes of the Board. This change has no impact on shareholders rights.Proposed resolution :The General Meeting resolves to amend article 19  §1 of the Articles of Association to bring it in line with Article 7:95 §1 of the BCCA  as follows:“The proceedings of the Board shall be set down in minutes  to be kept in a special register and signed by the Chair and the Vice-Chair  as well as any other directors present at the meeting who express their wish to do so. In the event the Chair or the Vice-Chair are unable to sign for any reason  any other director can sign the minutes”.***PARTICIPATION FORMALITIESIn order to participate in the General Meeting  shareholders must comply with the following formalities:Kindly note that all due dates and times mentioned herein are the final deadlines and that these will not be extended due to a weekend  holiday or for any other reason.

Recent federal cybersecurity action includes provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations Act that kicked off rulemaking to require reporting of ransomware payments and create a Cyber Incident Review Office within CISA.

On March 4   the USPTO announced that it had terminated engagement with officials from Russia's IP Agency (Rospatent) and with the Eurasian Patent Organization (EAPO). The USPTO also announced it terminated engagement with the national IP office of Belarus   an action that will affect Russian rights holders seeking to extend protection to the U.S.  as well as U.S. businesses that continue to operate in Russia .

""The Hurricane twin-turbo is a no-compromise engine that delivers better fuel economy and an important reduction in greenhouse gases without asking our customers to give up performance.""Reducing greenhouse gas emissions is one part of Stellantis' commitment to cut its carbon footprint by 50% by 2030 and to lead the transportation industry by achieving Net Carbon Zero by 2038. Those goals are key elements of the Stellantis Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan.Specific horsepower and torque ratings will vary based on vehicle. The first vehicles powered by the Hurricane twin-turbo I-6 reach dealership showrooms this year.The foundation of the Hurricane twin-turbo is a deep-skirt cast-aluminum block with a structural aluminum alloy oil pan. Cross-bolted steel main bearing caps contain the strong rotating assembly of a forged steel crankshaft and forged steel connecting rods.Stellantis propulsion system engineers employed a suite of state-of-the-art technologies for the Hurricane twin-turbo to deliver reduced emissions and attain big-engine power:Two low-inertia  high-flow turbochargers for rapid response to throttle inputsPlasma Transfer Wire Arc (PTWA) coating in the cylinder bores for an ultra-thin  low-friction wear surfaceHigh-pressure (5 075 psi/350 bar) direct fuel injection with pumps (single for SO/dual for HO) actuated by a dedicated chain-driven shaftDual overhead camshafts with wide-range  fully independent variable valve timingFuel-saving engine stop-start (ESS) function with robust starter motor for quick restartsEngine-mounted water-to-air charge cooler with a dedicated coolingContinuously variable displacement oil pump with integrated scavenge stageThe Incredible Power of AirEach turbocharger in the Hurricane twin-turbo I-6 feeds three cylinders. From a performance standpoint  two smaller turbochargers with less inertia spin up faster and deliver boost to the engine at lower rpm than a single  large turbo.The compressed air passes through an engine-mounted water-to-air charge air cooler to reduce its temperature. Cooler air is denser  enabling better performance via advanced ignition timing  and helping manage in-cylinder temperatures. An electric pump circulates coolant after the engine is shut down to help cool the turbocharger units for enhanced durability.The high-pressure direct fuel injection system runs at 5 075 psi (350 bar) and uses injectors mounted centrally in the combustion chamber. This design promotes finer atomization and super-fine control of fuel delivery into the cylinder for higher power and lower emissions.The Hurricane's turbochargers are optimized for each version. The turbos on the Hurricane SO deliver peak boost of 22 psi  while the Hurricane HO turbos deliver 26 psi of peak boost.Helping the Hurricane HO deliver its enhanced performance are lightweight  oil-jet cooled  forged aluminum pistons with an anodized top ring land and a diamond-like coating (DLC) on the pins to minimize friction. The Hurricane HO runs with a 9.5:1 compression ratio and uses 91 octane premium fuel.With a focus on fuel economy  the Hurricane SO uses cast aluminum pistons with cast iron top ring land insert  running with a 10.4:1 compression ratio. It's use of cooled EGR helps reduce engine pumping losses and manage in-cylinder temperatures. Premium fuel is recommended.Tough Coating for The CylindersLess friction  reduced weight and unparalleled wear resistance from a thermal sprayed microstructure of metallic and oxide components that metallurgically transform are the key benefits of the PTWA coating inside the cylinders  an alternative to the traditional cast-in-place or pressed-in cast iron cylinder liners. The PTWA coating is ultra-thin  compared with 3 to 4 millimeters of a cast iron liner and has 10 times the wear resistance.The PTWA coating is applied to the Hurricane block during the manufacturing process at the Saltillo North Engine Plant. The process  adapted from the aerospace industry  melts a steel alloy wire at 2 300 degrees Celsius (4 150 degrees Fahrenheit)  producing microscopic particles sprayed onto the cylinder walls at high velocities  where the particles splat-cool to form the coating and form a physical bond to the aluminum cylinder bore.Access the entire press release.StellantisStellantis N.V.

1555,EuroNext,Google API,https://yachtharbour.com/news/the-italian-sea-group--tisg--reports-strong-financial-growth-5385,The Italian Sea Group (TISG) Reports Strong Financial Growth,1 day ago,In 2021 The Italian Sea Group recorded remarkable growth compared to 2020. Since June 8  2021 the Company has been listed on Euronext Milan from Borsa Italiana.The resources collected during the IPO – equal to 44.5 million euros – proved to be key in finalizing the acquisition of Perini Navi  one of the most prestigious brands in the sailing superyacht industry. The acquisition took place on December 22  2021 through New Sail S.r.l. a subsidiary fully owned by TISG  for a total value of 80 million euros.The operation was financed by cash availability and long-term bank credit lines.The total value of the Order Book of Shipbuilding and Refit as of December 31  2021 is equal to 827 million euros  with wide visibility until 2026 of the projects under construction  about 80% of which is presented by yachts in the +50m range. At the end of 2021  the Net Backlog of Shipbuilding and Refit is equal to 536 million euros.The revenue breakdown by geographical area shows a higher relevance of the American market.In particular  this increase is driven by the stronger brand awareness in the Region  stimulated by the collaboration with renowned US brokers  that allowed the Company to enter the American market for big dimension yachts as confirmed by the sale of an Admiral 82m mega yacht at the end of 2021.Giovanni Costantino  Founder & CEO of The Italian Sea Group“The year 2021 has been particularly important for The Italian Sea Group  with the further strengthening of our business in the mega yacht segment and in strategic markets like the US ” says Giovanni Costantino  Founder & CEO of The Italian Sea Group. “Soon afterwards the Perini Navi acquisition  finalized at the end of January  the production sites of Viareggio and La Spezia are already operational  the majority of employees have been reinstated and we have launched important projects with great commitment and energy  with the goal of further strengthening such a prestigious brand in the global yachting world. The results announced today confirm the success of our business strategy that focuses on the continuous research of excellence  innovation and quality.

Most Read from...,(Bloomberg) -- Russia faces another hurdle in servicing its international debt just days before fresh interest payments come due.Most Read from BloombergThe National Settlement Depository in Moscow  which receives the Russian government’s payments on some of its foreign bonds for distribution  announced Friday that one path for those funds had been frozen.The NSD’s account with Clearstream -- the Luxembourg-based bank that settles the payments -- was blocked on March 24  the Russian company said in a statement on its website. A decision to restart would be based on a review by regulators in Luxembourg  it said.A Clearstream spokeswoman declined to comment.The latest move adds to the web of restrictions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine triggered sweeping sanctions and capital controls. Since the penalties were imposed  investors have pored over company and government bond payments at every stage of their journey to holders’ accounts.“Every twist further not only makes the technical ability to pay harder for Russia  it tests the limits of its willingness to pay ” said Lutz Roehmeyer  the chief investment officer at Berlin-based Capitulum Asset Management GmbH. “If Russia is isolated completely it could lead to a situation where paying foreign debt makes no sense anymore.”Some restrictions already exist for the other big settlement system -- Euroclear -- and the Clearstream decision could make the process more fraught.Next week  the government is due to make two interest payments for almost $190 million in total on dollar-denominated bonds  including one due March 31 that’s slated to be handled by Clearstream.Story continuesDespite warnings from credit-rating agencies and a delayed coupon payment this week  the government has so far avoided a default since the war started. Investors have written down the value of their Russian holdings  with the nation set to be removed next week from all of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s bond indexes that global funds are benchmarked against.READ MORE: All Five NYC Pensions Will Quit Russian Assets  Citing InvasionRussian companies whose owners have been hit by sanctions have also encountered roadblocks along the way.Severstal  a steel and mining company majority owned by Russian billionaire Alexey Mordashov -- who is sanctioned in the EU and the U.K. but not in the U.S. -- inched closer to a default after Citigroup Inc. blocked a coupon payment whose grace period expired on Wednesday.Evraz WoesA payment from Evraz  another steel and mining company in which billionaire Roman Abramovich has a stake  was processed after being initially blocked by Societe Generale SA. Abramovich is similarly subject to sanctions in the EU and the U.K. but not the U.S.Clearstream has so far been involved in successful payments for companies including natural-gas giant Gazprom PJSC and state leasing company GTLK  as well as $117 million of coupons paid by the sovereign last week.The settlement system won’t participate in Russia’s next interest payment due on 28 March -- a $102 million coupon on notes maturing in 2035  which comes with an option to pay in rubles.But three days later  Russia’s $87.5 million coupon on notes maturing in 2030 is due  and Clearstream will help settle that payment  according to the bond’s prospectus.A month into Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  and with international sanctions intensifying  some investors say default is a matter of time.“Russia’s bonds are already pricing in a huge amount of uncertainty ” said Matthew Morgan  a London-based investment director for fixed-income and multi-asset strategies at Jupiter Asset Management.“The big question here is at what point does Russia just decide not to pay -- that’s way more important than these technicalities.”(Updates with comment from Clearstream in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.03,0.45,0.52,mixed,0.04,0.19,0.77,True,English,"['Bond Payment Uncertainty', 'Clearstream Hurdle', 'Russia', 'Berlin-based Capitulum Asset Management GmbH', 'natural-gas giant Gazprom PJSC', 'state leasing company GTLK', 'The National Settlement Depository', 'other big settlement system', 'Jupiter Asset Management', 'chief investment officer', 'Five NYC Pensions', 'Societe Generale SA', 'London-based investment director', 'fresh interest payments', 'two interest payments', 'mining company majority', 'next interest payment', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'billionaire Roman Abramovich', 'A Clearstream spokeswoman', 'government bond payments', 'The NSD', 'big question', 'Russian billionaire', 'Russian company', 'successful payments', 'international debt', 'one path', 'Luxembourg-based bank', 'latest move', 'capital controls', 'holders’ accounts', 'technical ability', 'Lutz Roehmeyer', 'foreign debt', 'credit-rating agencies', 'Russian holdings', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'bond indexes', 'Russian Assets', 'Alexey Mordashov', 'U.K.', 'U.S.', 'Citigroup Inc.', 'grace period', '$102 million coupon', '$87.5 million coupon', 'huge amount', 'Matthew Morgan', 'multi-asset strategies', 'fourth paragraph', 'coupon payment', 'Russian government', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'foreign bonds', 'dollar-denominated bonds', 'sweeping sanctions', 'global funds', 'Russian companies', 'Evraz Woes', 'international sanctions', 'Clearstream decision', 'hurdle', 'Moscow', 'distribution', 'March', 'statement', 'website', 'review', 'regulators', 'restrictions', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'penalties', 'investors', 'stage', 'journey', 'limits', 'willingness', 'situation', 'sense', 'Euroclear', 'process', 'total', 'Story', 'warnings', 'default', 'value', 'Co.', 'All', 'owners', 'roadblocks', 'way', 'Severstal', 'steel', 'Wednesday', 'stake', 'coupons', 'sovereign', 'notes', 'option', 'rubles', 'prospectus', 'matter', 'time', 'uncertainty', 'fixed-income', 'point', 'technicalities', 'Updates', 'comment']",2022-03-25,2022-03-26,finance.yahoo.com

China may have helped hide it,1 day ago,ARI SHAPIRO  HOST:Days after Russia invaded Ukraine  the U.S. and its allies punched back.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN: Together  along with our allies  we are right now enforcing powerful economic sanctions.SHAPIRO: As President Biden explained in the State of the Union address earlier this month  the West was targeting Russia's largest banks and its central bank.(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)BIDEN: Making Putin's $630 billion war fund worthless.SHAPIRO: Well  worthless may be an overstatement because a new investigation finds that Russia may have stashed tens of billions of dollars of that war fund in offshore accounts and that China may be helping. Benn Steil is director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations  and he wrote about his research in Foreign Affairs. Welcome.BENN STEIL: Thank you for having me  Ari.SHAPIRO: I think people are generally familiar with how offshore accounts work  but tell us about how Russia may be using them in this case.STEIL: Yeah. So the reason we got interested in this is that back in 2018  there had been media headlines saying that Russia had dumped nearly all of its holdings of U.S. Treasury bonds. And my co-author and I  Benjamin Della Rocca  we were very skeptical about this because countries need U.S. dollars to pay their international debts.SHAPIRO: So you thought maybe they weren't dumped  just hidden.STEIL: Exactly. So we began digging through various databases  starting with the Russian central bank  and found that the Russian central bank had not  in fact  sold all these securities. So we went looking for where they could possibly be housed at the time  and we found that it was likely that about half the total or about $20 billion was in the Cayman Islands and about $25 billion was in Belgium.SHAPIRO: If the money was in Belgium  what role did China likely play here?STEIL: Right. Well  at the same time that we saw this spike in Treasury holdings in Belgium  we also saw anomalous financial data from Russia's central bank. We saw an enormous increase in currency and deposits held at foreign central banks. So what we believe happened based on the evidence was that Russia deposited tens of billions of dollars of foreign currency with the Chinese central bank. The Chinese central bank used this money to buy U.S. dollars  and then they used those U.S. dollars to buy U.S. Treasury bonds  which are being housed  we believe  in Belgium at a custodial bank called Euroclear. So if we're right  that would indicate that Russia has upwards of $80 billion of U.S. Treasury securities that it can turn into ready money  U.S. dollars  at a moment's notice.SHAPIRO: Are there steps allies could take to close these loopholes?STEIL: Well  in the short term  it would probably be difficult. And the reason I say that is this - almost certainly whatever entity Russia used to buy these Treasury securities  they were being intermediated by yet more entities  probably  we believe  Chinese state-owned banks. So what we believe is that the U.S. Treasury  in conjunction with U.S. allies  is probably going to have to take further action to assist institutions like Euroclear in understanding what its customers are doing to facilitate transactions for others.SHAPIRO: Sounds like if China wanted to cut off Russia  it has a lot of power here.STEIL: Oh  without question. If China wanted to cut off these evasive flows  it could. So it's very important that the Biden administration continue to keep up the pressure on China to get Vladimir Putin to reverse his brutal aggression in Ukraine.SHAPIRO: Benn Steil is director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations. Thanks a lot.STEIL: Thank you for having me  Ari.

""Senior managers"" refers to the CEO and the Deputy CEO of the Group  and senior managers included in Gränges' Group Management. These guidelines will be valid for agreements entered into after the General Meeting's resolution and for changes made to existing agreements thereafter. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration resolved upon by the General Meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityIn short  the company's business strategy is the following.Gränges is continuing to strengthen its core business and is seeking growth in related fields of engineering through developing new businesses and developing sustainable and competitive offers to customers.For more information regarding the company's business strategy  please see https://www.granges.com  as well as the latest annual report including the sustainability report.Gränges shall offer remuneration levels and terms of employment which are necessary to recruit  develop  and retain individuals in Group Management. These individuals shall possess the expertise  motivation and capacity required to uphold  develop  and implement overall value-additive strategic targets for the Gränges Group and  moreover  to support its long-term interests. To obtain this  it is important to sustain fair and internally balanced terms that are at the same time competitive on the market with respect to structure  scope and remuneration levels. These guidelines ensure that individuals in Group Management  regardless of geographical market  may be offered competitive total remuneration  and is aimed at creating increased transparency on remuneration issues. Applicable laws and other relevant regulatory frameworks (both Swedish and foreign) in this area must be complied with at all times. Remuneration and remuneration formsThe basic principle is that the remuneration must be competitive and consist of a balanced combination of fixed salary  variable remuneration  pension benefits  other benefits and terms for dismissal/severance payment. Furthermore  the Board of Directors may prepare and the General Meeting resolve on  share and share-price related incentive programmes. Such a combination of remuneration fosters and supports management and achievement of objectives in both a short and long-term perspective. The various types of remuneration that may be paid out are described below. Fixed salaryThe fixed salary shall consist of customary base salary. The salary shall be based on responsibility  performance  expertise and the complexity and scope of the task. In the event of full payment of variable remuneration  the fixed annual base salary shall comprise 40 per cent of the total cash remuneration  with the exception for persons holding the position as Regional President  where the percentage is no less than 33.33 per cent. Variable remuneration (STI and LTI)The variable remuneration shall comprise both short-term and long-term incentives  without there being any guarantee of variable remuneration.An annual short-term incentive programme (STI)  which provides a cash variable remuneration  shall be offered to the Group Management. The outcome of STI shall be governed by financial and non-financial parameters for the Gränges Group. The financial objective must be related to value creation and the non-financial objective must be linked to the carbon footprint of the business  which is a long-term sustainability goal. The objectives must be designed so that they both promote the Group's business strategy and long-term sustainability goals. At the end of the measurement period for fulfillment of the predefined parameters for payment of STI  a comprehensive evaluation shall be conducted to assess the extent to which these parameters have been met. With regards to financial objectives  the evaluation will be based on the latest financial information made public by the company. With regard to the sustainability objectives  the assessment shall be based on what the company has stated in the sustainability report.Maximum remuneration for STI is 60 per cent of the fixed annual base salary for each individual in Group Management  with exception for the persons holding the position as Regional President  for whom the maximum remuneration can be up to 100 per cent of the fixed annual base salary.The Board shall annually evaluate whether a long-term incentive programme (LTI) is to be adopted or  if a share or share price-related LTI programme  is to be proposed to the Annual General Meeting. These programmes can be cash-based or related to the share/share price. Share or share price-related LTI programmes are resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines. All LTI programmes must have a clear connection to the Group's business strategy and long-term sustainability goals.Please refer to https://www.granges.com for information on previously resolved LTI programmes that have not fallen due for payment.The company does not have any potential deferral periods  but has since 2021  according to agreements  possibility to reclaim variable remuneration. PensionPension shall be paid in accordance with relevant national legislation  applicable collective agreements  and suchlike and  for Swedish individuals in Group Management  is limited to the ITP plan (Industry and Trade Supplemental Pension). Accordingly  there are both premium-based and benefits-based undertakings  based on individual prerequisites and regulatory frameworks. There are two main variants of the ITP plan: ITP 1 applies to individuals born 1 January 1979 or later and ITP 2 applies to individuals born 31 December 1978 or earlier. In order to equalize the differences that can arise between participants in ITP 1 and ITP 2 - in other words  between different individuals in Group Management - certain adjustments are made in relation to the solution indicated by ITP 2 with regard to how much of the remuneration is pensionable. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall be not more than 30 per cent of paid cash fixed and variable remuneration.For the CEO  the pension premiums shall amount to 35 per cent  calculated on fixed monthly remuneration  and are thus premium defined. The retirement age for the CEO is 65 years of age.For foreign individuals in Group Management  a corresponding structure shall apply  based on the circumstances in the relevant country. The pension terms and conditions shall be on market terms. For other individuals in Group Management  the retirement age is 60-65 years of age  depending on the country of employment.For employments governed by rules other than Swedish  the pension may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines. Other benefitsBenefits which are not directly related to fixed salary and variable remuneration  for example a company car and medical care benefits  shall promote the performance of the work and be consistent with standard practice on the market for this target group. The total costs as a consequence of such benefits may not exceed 20 per cent of the fixed annual base salary.For employments governed by rules other than Swedish  other benefits may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines. Special remunerationAdditional cash variable remuneration may be paid out under extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time  and may only be awarded on an individual basis either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining individuals in Group Management or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 20 per cent of the fixed annual base salary and may not be awarded more than once per year and per individual. Any resolution on such remuneration shall be adopted by the Board of Directors based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee. Remuneration to directorsIn certain cases  board directors elected by the General Meeting should be able to receive fees and other remuneration for work carried out on behalf of the company  alongside their work on the Board of Directors. Fees at market rates  approved by the Board of Directors  may be payable for such services. Terms for termination etc.There is a mutual notice of termination period of six months as between the CEO and the company. Upon termination by the company  severance remuneration without set-off is also paid for an additional twelve months. The mutual notice of termination period for the Deputy CEO and other individuals in Group Management shall correspond to six months. Upon termination by the company  severance remuneration for an additional twelve months is paid  without setting off the first six months. Salary and terms of employment for other employeesIn the preparation of this proposal on guidelines  salary and terms of employment for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total remuneration  the components of the remuneration  and increase and rate of increase of remuneration over time  in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Director's basis of decision when evaluating the reasonableness of the guidelines and appurtenant limitations. The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board of Directors resolves  after preparation by the Remuneration Committee  on the structures of remuneration systems  as well as levels and forms of remuneration to individuals in Group Management. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the Annual General Meeting for adoption. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall monitor and evaluate programmes for variable remuneration for individuals in Group Management  the application of the guidelines  and the current remuneration structures and remuneration levels in the company.The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of the company and company management. The CEO and other members of Group Management do not participate in the Board of Director's and/or the Remuneration Committee's processing of  and resolutions regarding  remuneration-related matters insofar as they are affected by such matters. Conflicts of interest are counteracted in all resolutions and any potential conflicts of interest are handled in accordance with the company's framework for governance  consisting out of a code of conduct  policies and guidelines. Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. As stated above  part of the work of the Remuneration Committee is to prepare the Board of Director's resolutions regarding remuneration issues  which includes resolutions on derogations from the guidelines. MiscellaneousThe total remuneration and the other benefits paid to the CEO and the Deputy CEO during the year are stated in the remuneration report. In addition hereto  the total remuneration and the other benefits paid to the individuals in the Group management is stated in the annual report.For further information regarding remuneration  please refer to Gränges annual report and website  https://www.granges.com.Resolution on LTI programme for 2022 for senior managers (item 15)The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting  as a supplement to the annual incentive programme (""STI 2022"")  resolves on a long-term incentive programme (""LTI 2022"") for senior managers  i.e. the CEO and the Deputy CEO of the Group  and senior managers included in Gränges' Group Management  mainly according to the following: STI 2022 measures Value Creation (80 per cent) and the sustainability target carbon dioxide intensity (20 per cent)  for a maximum payout of 60 per cent of annual basic pay. For Regional Presidents the maximum payout is up to 100 per cent of annual basic pay.LTI 2022  where a payout equivalent to the amount of STI 2022 is allocated  and indexed to the total return of the Gränges' share. The vesting periods for LTI 2022 will run over the years 2023  2024  and 2025 (""Vesting periods"") and payment from the LTI-program is made proportionately on an annual basis over a period of three years provided that the individual remains in the Gränges Group's employ. Purpose of Gränges LTI 2022The purpose of Gränges LTI 2022 is to provide remuneration in line with market terms and at the same time stimulate a long-term commitment to Gränges by linking the participants' remuneration to the interests of the shareholders  through a remuneration structure that correspond to an ownership of synthetic shares in Gränges. LTI 2022 is also expected to help Gränges retain and recruit persons with special expertise and relevant experience. The role of Gränges' Board of Directors in LTI 2022Gränges' Board of Directors is authorised to interpret LTI 2022  including but not limited to: Deciding on the participants in LTI 2022.Deciding on the participants' payout from LTI 2022  including determining the development of the total return during the Vesting periods.Adjusting the terms and conditions for LTI 2022 to comply with legal requirements  regulations et cetera.Adjusting the payout for LTI 2022 in the event significant changes take place that affect the Gränges Group or its business environment  resulting in a situation where the terms of LTI 2022 are deemed inappropriate or to give an unreasonable result. Participation in LTI 2022 Payments within the framework of LTI 2022 will only be made to participants who  at the time of the payment  haven't terminated or been terminated from their employment  provided that no local laws or regulations exist entitling participants to LTI payouts. Deviations from this principle (so-called ""good leaver"" agreements) must be approved by Gränges' Board of Directors.In the event of death or retirement occurring during a Vesting period  the participant will be assigned a proportionate payout corresponding to actual working period in relation to the Vesting period  provided that no local laws or regulations exist entitling the participant to a different payout.[1] Total return is then calculated based on the closing price on the last trading day of the month before the date of death or retirement. Assigned amount is paid through a cash payment no later than two months from the date of death or retirement.[2]If a participant is absent due to illness or any other reason for a period of more than three months in total during any Vesting period for LTI 2022  the participant will be allocated a proportional payout for the actual working period relative to the Vesting period  provided that no local laws or regulations exist entitling the participant to a different payout.Gränges' Board of Directors welcomes senior managers to invest in the own share. Administration  payout and paymentsGränges' finance department is responsible for maintaining a register of funds allocated within the framework of LTI 2022 and for proposing payouts  adjusted to the total return of the Gränges' share  for approval by Gränges' Board of Directors.Indexation of the total return in LTI 2022 is calculated as follows: Starting point: The average closing price for the Gränges share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days after the publication date for the 2022 year-end report.Dividends: Dividends during the respective Vesting period will increase the percentage value of LTI 2022  where the percentage is calculated as the dividend in SEK divided by the closing price on the dividend date.Ending points: The average closing price for the Gränges share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days after the publication dates for the year-end reports for the years 2023  2024 and 2025. Payouts under LTI 2022 will as a rule not be regarded as pensionable income. In cases where pension plans define payouts as pensionable income (for example ITP in Sweden)  the payout from LTI 2022 will be reduced as follows: Defined contribution pension plans: The payout is reduced by an amount equivalent to the premium in the defined contribution pension plan relating to LTI 2022.Defined benefit pension plans: The payout is reduced by a factor aimed at achieving a cost-neutral solution for Gränges. Payouts from LTI 2022 take place during 2024  2025 and 2026 in connection with payouts from STI  provided approval has been received from Gränges' Board of Directors. The total payout from STI and paying LTI programmes may not exceed 150 per cent of annual basic pay as of the date of the payout. This shall not apply to the persons holding the position as Regional President  who can receive up to 200 per cent of annual basic pay.Gränges' Annual General Meeting is to decide on new long-term incentive programmes every year. Other outstanding share-related incentive programmesIn order to stimulate long-term involvement  senior managers were offered long-term incentive programmes (LTI 2019  LTI 2020 and LTI 2021) following the adoption of the resolutions by the Annual General Meetings for 2019  2020 and 2021. The programmes are for a term of three years. An amount corresponding to the outcome of the STI for the corresponding year for each participant is reserved in a separate  so-called  LTI bank. Provided that employment with the Gränges Group has not terminated  the amount is paid out at a rate of one-third per year  adjusted to take into account the total return on the Gränges share. Senior managers and other members of the Group Management were in 2020 offered to participate in a long-term investment programme (""IP 2020"")  which is a one-off programme aimed at increasing exposure to the Gränges share. The participants in IP 2020 invested an amount corresponding to up to 50 per cent of an annual basic salary before tax in call options and shares and received in connection thereto a cash contribution which  after tax  amounts to 50 per cent of the annual basic salary  which in the programme is called the ""Net Contribution"". If the participant has resigned or the participant's employment has been terminated within three years from the date of payment of the Net Contribution the contribution has to be refunded to Gränges in its entirety.Resolution on the adoption of a warrant programme or a call option programme (""IP 2022"") for senior managers and other key individuals (item 16)The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting resolves to adopt a warrant programme (the ""Warrant Programme"") through an issue of warrants and approving transfer of the warrants to senior managers and other key individuals in the company and its subsidiaries. Alternatively  the Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting resolves to adopt a call option programme (the ""Call Option Programme"") to senior managers and other key individuals in the company and its subsidaries. Regardless of which of the two programmes the General Meeting resolves to introduce  the adopted programme will be referred to as IP 2022 in the company's future documentation. In the two alternative proposals  participants are proposed to receive a subsidy of the premium paid for the warrants/options.In the two alternative proposals  the Board of Directors proposes that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to enter into one or more share swap agreements with third parties on one or more occasions. Share swap agreements aim to hedge the financial exposure for both the programmes  in the event that employees outside of Sweden are offered a similar cash-based alternative to one of the programmes  and other possible risks arising from the introduction of the Warrant Programme or the Call Option Programme. Regarding the Call Option Programme  the share swap agreement further implies that a third party undertakes to  in its own name  in return for remuneration  buy and transfer shares in the company to the participants in the Call Option Programme in order to secure the company's obligations under the Call Option Programme.The Board of Directors consider it important  and in the interest of all shareholders  that senior managers and other key individuals  who are deemed to be important for the company's continued development  should  through their own investment  be able to take part of and work for a positive value development of the company's shares and thereby achieve increased community of interest with the company's shareholders. The purpose of the Warrant Programme or the Call Option Programme is also to contribute to executives increasing their shareholding in the company in the long term. The two alternative programmes are also expected to create conditions for retaining and recruiting competent staff to Gränges  providing competitive remuneration and reconciling the interests of shareholders and management.This proposal has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with external advisors.A. The Board of Directors' proposal regarding adopting a warrant programme for senior managers and other key individualsA1. Directed issue of warrantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting resolves on a directed issue of not more than 900 000 warrants mainly in accordance with the following terms and conditions.1. The right to subscribe for new warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be granted to the company itself. The intention is that the warrants shall be transferred to approximately 15 senior managers and other key individuals in the company and its subsidiaries in accordance with item A2 below.2. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the issue is part of the adaptation of the Warrant Programme  whereby senior managers and other key individuals are given the opportunity to take part in a positive development in the company. The existence of such a programme is expected to increase the ability to attract and retain qualified employees.3. The warrants are issued free of charge. Upon transfer of the warrants a market-based premium shall be paid  in accordance with A2 (item 4) below.4. Subscription of the warrants shall be made by subscription on a subscription list no later than June 30  2022. The Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period.5. Each warrant shall entail a right to subscribe for one (1) new share in the company at a subscription price corresponding to 115 percent of the volume-weighted average price of the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm OMX Mid Cap during the period as of 5 May 2022 up to and including 18 May 2022. The subscription price shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a Swedish krona (SEK 0.01). SEK 0.005 will be rounded up. When subscribing for shares  the part of the subscription price that exceeds the quota value of the shares shall be added to the unrestricted premium reserve.6. Subscription of shares upon exercise of the warrants shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the warrants during a period of ten (10) trading days from the date of publication of each respective interim report below.- the interim report for the period April 1 - June 30  2025;- the interim report for the period July 1 - September 30  2025;- the interim report for the period October 1 - December 31  2025; and- the interim report for the period January 1 - March 31  2026.In the event that the company has not published an interim report for the period January 1 - March 31  2026 before May 31  2026  the warrant holders shall be entitled to subscribe for shares during a period as of June 1  2026 up to and including June 12  2026. Subscription of shares upon exercise of the warrants shall take place with regard to the insider legislation in force at any given time.7. Shares that have been issued through exercise of warrants entail the right to dividends for the first time on the next record date for dividends that occurs after the new shares has been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and the shares have been entered in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB.8. Special terms and conditions shall otherwise apply to the warrants. As stated in the warrant terms  the subscription price as well as the number of shares that each warrant entitles to may be recalculated in the event that the Board of Directors decides to apply the Net strike formula (Sw. Nettostrike-formeln). Furthermore  recalculation may take place in connection with a bonus issue  reverse split or split of shares  new issue  issue of warrants or convertibles and in certain other situations. Furthermore  the time for exercise of the warrants may be brought forward or postponed in certain situations.9. If all warrants are exercised for subscription of shares  the company's registered share capital will increase by SEK 1 205 797.699526 (subject to the change that may be caused by any recalculation in accordance with the terms and conditions for the warrant).10. The CEO  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall be entitled to make any minor adjustments that may be required in connection with registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.11. Based on the existing number of shares in the company  the dilution as a result of the proposed Warrant Programme  assuming that all warrants are exercised for subscription of shares will be approximately 0.84 percent of both the shares and the votes. The percentage dilution has been calculated according to the formula (number of new shares/total number of shares after exercise of warrants).A2. Approval of transfer of warrants to senior managers and other key individuals in the company and its subsidiariesThe Board of Directors further proposes that the General Meeting resolves to approve that the company transfers a maximum of 900 000 warrants  mainly according to the following.1. The warrants shall be transferred in accordance with the distribution set out below.(a) CEO: not more than 180 000 warrants;(b) Group Management Team: not more than 90 000 warrants per person;(c) Other key individuals: not more than 30 000 warrants per person.2. If participants refrain from acquiring offered warrants in whole or in part  such unacquired warrants shall be distributed pro rata among allotment holders  who have expressed a written interest in acquiring additional warrants  in accordance with the allocation basis set out in item 1 above. Through this method  the person entitled to acquire warrants will not be able to acquire more than an additional 50 percent of the originally offered number of warrants.3. The Board of Directors shall finally determine the allocation in accordance with the principles set out in items 1 and 2 above.4. Upon transfer of the warrants  the market-based premium calculated in accordance with the Black & Scholes warrant valuation model shall be paid for the warrants.5. Transfer of warrants shall be conditional on the transfer being lawfully possible and that the acquirer enters into an option agreement with the company  according to which the acquirer is obliged to offer the company to acquire the warrants in certain situations. Such an agreement shall also include a right for the company to repurchase part of the warrants/call options from the option holder for the market value in order to contribute to the holder's financing at the time of the exercise of the warrants.6. In order to encourage participation in the Warrant Programme  a subsidy may be paid which  after deduction of tax and other applicable fees  amounts to 50 percent of the premium paid for each warrant (""Net Contribution""). If the participant has terminated its employment or been terminated within three years of the payment of the warrant premium  an amount corresponding to the Net Contribution shall be repaid to Gränges. The same applies if the participant has disposed of warrants acquired under the Warrant Programme within a period of three years from the payment of the warrant premium. However  the repayment obligation shall be reduced in relation to how long the participant has worked in Gränges during the term of the warrants and in relation to the number of disposed warrants.7. Transfer of warrants to employees outside Sweden is subject to any tax effects  that there are no legal obstacles and that the Board of Directors considers that such transfer can be made with reasonable administrative and financial resources. The Board of Directors shall have the right to make such minor adjustments to the Warrant Programme as are prompted by applicable foreign laws and regulations. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to resolve that participants should instead be offered the opportunity of a similar cash-based alternative.8. Furthermore  the Board of Directors shall be authorised to enter into one or more share swap agreements with third parties on one or more occasions on market terms. Share swap agreements aim to hedge the financial exposure in the event that employees outside of Sweden are offered a similar cash-based alternative to the programme and the other possible risks that arise from the introduction of the Warrant Programme.B. The Board of Directors' proposal regarding the adoption of a call option programme for senior managers and other key individualsIf the General Meeting does not resolve in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal regarding the introduction of a Warrant Programme in accordance with items 16 A1 and A2 above  the Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting resolves to implement a call option programme mainly according to what is set out below.Terms and conditions for the call options1. Not more than 900 000 call options shall be issued  which corresponds to approximately 0.84 percent of the total number of shares and votes in the company. The call option programme does not entail any dilution for existing shareholders as it is based on call options regarding already issued shares in the company.2. The right to acquire the call options shall be offered to approximately 15 senior managers and other key individuals in the company and its subsidiaries in accordance with the distribution set out below.(a) CEO: not more than 180 000 call options;(b) Group Management Team: a maximum of 90 000 call options per person;(c) Other key individuals: a maximum of 30 000 call options per person.3. If the person entitled to allotment refrains from acquiring offered call options in whole or in part  such unacquired call options shall be distributed pro rata among allotment holders  who have expressed a written interest in acquiring additional call options  in accordance with the allocation basis set out in item 2 above. Through this method  the person entitled to acquire call options  will not be able to acquire more than an additional 50 percent of the originally offered number of call options.4. The Board of Directors shall finally determine the allocation in accordance with the principles set out in items 2 and 3 above.5. Notification of acquisition of call options shall be made no later than 30 June 2022. The Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the acquisition period.6. The call options shall be acquired at a premium corresponding to the market value of the call options calculated in accordance with the Black & Scholes option valuation model.7. The issue of call options to employees outside Sweden is subject to any tax effects  that there are no legal obstacles and that the Board of Directors considers that such allocation can be made with reasonable administrative and financial resources. The Board of Directors shall have the right to make such minor adjustments to the Call Option Programme as are prompted by applicable foreign laws and regulations. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to decide that participants should instead be offered the opportunity of a similar cash-based alternative.8. Each call option entitles to acquisition of one (1) share in the company at an exercise price corresponding to 115 percent of the volume-weighted average price of the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm OMX Mid Cap during the period as of 5 May 2022 up to and including 18 May 2022. The exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a Swedish krona (SEK 0.01). SEK 0.005 will be rounded up.9. Acquisitions of shares based on exercise of call options shall be made during a period of ten (10) trading days from the date of publication of each respective interim report below.- the interim report for the period April 1 - June 30  2025;- the interim report for the period July 1 - September 30  2025;- the interim report for the period October 1 - December 31  2025; and- the interim report for the period January 1 - March 31  2026.In the event that the company has not published an interim report for the period January 1 - March 31  2026 before May 31  2026  the warrant holders shall be entitled to subscribe for shares during a period as of June 1  2026 up to and including June 12  2026. Acquisitions of shares shall take place with regard to the insider legislation in force at any given time.10. The call options are freely transferable. The acquisition of call options shall be conditional on the participant entering into an option agreement with the company  according to which the participant is obliged to offer the company to acquire the call options in certain situations. Such an agreement shall also include a right for the company to repurchase part of the warrants/call options from the option holder for the market value in order to contribute to the holder's financing at the time of the exercise of the call options.11. The number of shares in the company that the call options entitle to  and the exercise price  may be recalculated in accordance with stock market principles due to  among other things  bonus issue  reverse split or split of shares  new issues  extraordinary dividends  reduction of the share capital or similar measures so that the participant receives equivalent rights as before the event. The exercise price and the number of shares that each call option entitles to may also be recalculated in the event that the Board of Directors decides to apply a so-called Net strike formula  which means that the participant may subscribe for fewer shares at the quota value of the shares when exercising the call options. Furthermore  the time for exercise of the call options may be brought forward or postponed in certain cases. For example  the time of exercise of the call options may be brought forward in the event of a public takeover bid.12. In order to encourage participation in the Call Option Programme  a subsidy may be paid which  after deduction of tax and other applicable fees  amounts to 50 percent of the premium paid for each call option (""Net Contribution""). If the participant has terminated his employment or been terminated within three years of the payment of the option premium  an amount corresponding to the Net Contribution shall be repaid to Gränges. The same applies if the participant has disposed of call options acquired under the Call Option Programme within a period of three years from the payment of the option premium. However  the repayment obligation shall be reduced in relation to how long the participant has worked in Gränges during the term of the call options and in relation to the number of disposed call options.13. No new shares will be issued by the company in respect of the shares that may be acquired by the participants through the exercise of issued call options. The shares will instead be delivered by authorising the Board of Directors to  on one or more occasions  enter into one or more share swap agreements with third parties on market terms  through which the third party in its own name acquires and transfers shares to the participants. Share swap agreements also aim to  hedge the financial exposure in the event that employees outside of Sweden are offered a similar cash-based alternative to the programme  and the other possible risks that arise from the introduction of the Call Option Programme.14. Within the framework of the above-mentioned terms and conditions and guidelines  the Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed establishment and management of the Call Option Programme.Costs for the Warrant Programme or the Call Option ProgrammeThe Warrant Programme and the alternative Call Option Programme have been prepared in consultation with external advisors and the costs for this advice are estimated to amount to no more than SEK 280 000. In addition to the cost for this advice  certain administrative costs are expected to arise which are expected to have a marginal impact on the company's key figures.The costs for the Warrant Programme or the Call Option Programme also consist of the subsidy that will be paid in accordance with the above and the social security contributions that relate to this subsidy. The total cost of the subsidy  including social security contributions  is estimated to approximately MSEK 10 after corporate tax. The option premium of approximately MSEK 10 received by the company upon transfer of the warrants or upon transfer of the call options  will correspond to the subsidy  why none of the proposed programmes are expected to entail any significant net burden on the company's equity.Other outstanding share-related incentive programmesIn order to stimulate long-term involvement  senior managers were offered long-term incentive programmes (LTI 2019  LTI 2020 and LTI 2021) following the adoption of the resolutions by the Annual General Meetings for 2019  2020 and 2021. The programmes are for a term of three years. An amount corresponding to the outcome of the STI for the corresponding year for each participant is reserved in a separate  so-called  LTI bank. Provided that employment with the Gränges Group has not terminated  the amount is paid out at a rate of one-third per year  adjusted to take into account the total return on the Gränges share. Senior managers and other members of the Group Management were in 2020 offered to participate in a long-term investment programme (""IP 2020"")  which is a one-off programme aimed at increasing exposure to the Gränges share. The participants in IP 2020 invested an amount corresponding to up to 50 per cent of an annual basic salary before tax in call options and shares and received in connection thereto a cash contribution which  after tax  amounts to 50 per cent of the annual basic salary  which in the programme is called the ""Net Contribution"". If the participant has resigned or the participant's employment has been terminated within three years from the date of payment of the Net Contribution the contribution has to be refunded to Gränges in its entirety. Resolution on issue authorisation (item 17)The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting passes a resolution on issueauthorisation mainly in according to the following:The Board of Directors is to be authorised to  on one or more occasions until the nextAnnual General Meeting  issue new shares and/or convertible bonds as follows.An issue of new shares and/or convertible bonds can be decided with or without regard toshareholders' pre-emption rights. Following this authorisation  a total maximum number ofshares equivalent to 10 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the companyon the date of the General Meeting's authorisation resolution  may be issued in new shareissues and/or through the conversions of convertible bonds (this does not preventconvertible bonds from being combined with conversion terms which  if applied  may resultin a different number of shares).This authorisation is to include the right to issue shares and/or convertible bonds with cashpayment  payment by contribution in kind or payment by way of set-off  and otherwise subject to conditions as set out in Chapter 2  section 5  second paragraph 1-3 and 5 of theSwedish Companies Act.An issue of shares and/or convertible bonds without regard to pre-emption rights for theshareholders with cash payment or payment by way of set-off must take place on marketconditions.The reason for the proposal and the possibility to disapply the shareholders' pre-emptionrights is to allow for flexibility in connection with any acquisitions or the raising of capital.The Board of Directors  or a party designated by the Board  has the right to decide on minorchanges to the General Meeting's resolution that may be necessary in connection withregistration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or due to otherformal requirements. Special majority requirementThe resolutions referred to in item 16 A1 and A2 on the adoption of a warrant programme for the senior managers and other key individuals are conditional on each other and shall be resolved upon as one resolution. A resolution in accordance with the proposal requires that the resolution is supported by shareholders with at least nine-tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the General Meeting.The resolution under item 16 B on the adoption of a call option programme for senior managers and other key individuals is conditional on the General Meeting not resolving in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal under item 16 A1 and A2 on the agenda. For resolutions in accordance with the proposal under item 16 B  the resolution must be supported by shareholders with at least half of the votes cast.For a decision according to item 17 on issue authorisation  to be valid  the proposal must be supported by shareholders holding at least two thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the General Meeting.

The main reason for this situation is that Citigroup Inc. blocked the payment  saying that Severstal should get approval from the US Office of Foreign Assets Control before it could remit the cash. However  the company’s principal shareholder was previously sanctioned by the EU and the UK  but not by the US.“This is an extraordinary situation for us ” said Alexandr Shevelev  Severstal’s CEO. “We continue consultations with partners and are doing our best to ensure that bondholders receive funds in accordance with the terms of the bond issue. I hope that this injustice will be resolved soon and the rights of bondholders will be respected.”If the situation is not settled  there is a risk of Severstal’s creditors calling a default. Moreover  the company is not the only one having trouble in paying its foreign-currency debts. Russia’s Evraz earlier found itself in a similar situation  but on March 22 the company announced that the transaction was successful. NLMK successfully paid a euro-bond coupon  but Russia-based bondholders did not receive the payments as Euroclear and Clearstream do not perform transactions with a Russian depositary.,negative,0.02,0.38,0.6,mixed,0.12,0.12,0.76,True,English,"['default threat', 'interest payment', 'Russia', 'Severstal', 'main flat steel producers', 'five-day grace period', 'Foreign Assets Control', '$12.6 million dollar-bond coupon', 'main reason', 'euro-bond coupon', 'foreign-currency debt', 'Citigroup Inc.', 'principal shareholder', 'Alexandr Shevelev', 'bond issue', 'Russian depositary', 'US Office', 'extraordinary situation', 'similar situation', 'Russia-based bondholders', 'Friday', '25 March', 'GMT', 'Istanbul', 'Severstal', 'country', 'time', 'interest', 'sources', 'company', 'Wednesday', 'payment', 'approval', 'cash', 'UK', 'CEO', 'consultations', 'partners', 'funds', 'accordance', 'terms', 'injustice', 'rights', 'risk', 'creditors', 'default', 'trouble', 'Evraz', 'transaction', 'NLMK', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream']",2022-03-26,2022-03-26,steelorbis.com

Most Read from...,(Bloomberg) -- Russia faces another hurdle in servicing its international debt just days before fresh interest payments come due.Most Read from BloombergThe National Settlement Depository in Moscow  which receives the Russian government’s payments on some of its foreign bonds for distribution  announced Friday that one path for those funds had been frozen.The NSD’s account with Clearstream -- the Luxembourg-based bank that settles the payments -- was blocked on March 24  the Russian company said in a statement on its website. A decision to restart would be based on a review by regulators in Luxembourg  it said.A Clearstream spokeswoman declined to comment.The latest move adds to the web of restrictions imposed on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine triggered sweeping sanctions and capital controls. Since the penalties were imposed  investors have pored over company and government bond payments at every stage of their journey to holders’ accounts.“Every twist further not only makes the technical ability to pay harder for Russia  it tests the limits of its willingness to pay ” said Lutz Roehmeyer  the chief investment officer at Berlin-based Capitulum Asset Management GmbH. “If Russia is isolated completely it could lead to a situation where paying foreign debt makes no sense anymore.”Some restrictions already exist for the other big settlement system -- Euroclear -- and the Clearstream decision could make the process more fraught.Next week  the government is due to make two interest payments for almost $190 million in total on dollar-denominated bonds  including one due March 31 that’s slated to be handled by Clearstream.Story continuesDespite warnings from credit-rating agencies and a delayed coupon payment this week  the government has so far avoided a default since the war started. Investors have written down the value of their Russian holdings  with the nation set to be removed next week from all of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s bond indexes that global funds are benchmarked against.READ MORE: All Five NYC Pensions Will Quit Russian Assets  Citing InvasionRussian companies whose owners have been hit by sanctions have also encountered roadblocks along the way.Severstal  a steel and mining company majority owned by Russian billionaire Alexey Mordashov -- who is sanctioned in the EU and the U.K. but not in the U.S. -- inched closer to a default after Citigroup Inc. blocked a coupon payment whose grace period expired on Wednesday.Evraz WoesA payment from Evraz  another steel and mining company in which billionaire Roman Abramovich has a stake  was processed after being initially blocked by Societe Generale SA.

Others hit several days late. And an increasing number are getting stuck in a web of financial intermediaries...,(Bloomberg) -- Some payments arrived on time. Others hit several days late. And an increasing number are getting stuck in a web of financial intermediaries that are struggling to comply with international sanctions against Russian President Vladimir Putin and his allies.Most Read from BloombergA month since the country’s invasion of Ukraine  investors are starting to realize just how narrow the path is for Russia -- and some of its biggest corporations -- to avoid default. That’s casting a pall over a country that was once a darling of emerging-market investors and now looks set to lose 15 years of economic gains by the end of 2023  according to one estimate.“The longer this goes on the uglier it is likely to get ” said Lee Buchheit  a sovereign debt expert who advised Russia and dozens of other countries on debt restructuring. “Putin has put the Russian Federation in a situation where it is a pariah diplomatically  economically and even socially in most of the world. Is he really going to lose a lot of sleep thinking that he has stained his external debt record? I don’t think so.”The Russian government has so far managed to make coupon payments on three of its Eurobonds  including one due this week  although not without some delays.Yet on Friday Russia’s National Settlement Depository said operations via Clearstream  one of the biggest clearinghouses in the world  haven’t been going through since Thursday  when its account was blocked. That makes it unclear how the sovereign will get payments on certain bonds to foreign investors.Russian companies whose owners have been hit by sanctions have already hit roadblocks  in spite of showing every intention to pay.Story continuesSeverstal  a steel and mining company majority owned by Russian billionaire Alexey Mordashov -- who is sanctioned in the EU and the U.K. but not in the U.S. -- inched closer to a default after Citigroup Inc. blocked a coupon payment whose grace period expired on Wednesday.A payment from Evraz  another steel and mining company in which billionaire Roman Abramovich has a stake  has reached the paying agent after being initially blocked by Societe Generale SA. Abramovich is similarly subject to sanctions in the EU and the U.K. but not the U.S.Other companies including natural gas giant Gazprom and Russian Railways have payments due this month.“The trading system is breaking down ” Robert Koenigsberger  chief investment officer at Gramercy Funds Management said in a webcast this week. “It is more likely than not that we will see a default in Russia.”Companies in countries from Slovakia to Turkey have also started to feel the financial impact of the conflict  especially if they have direct exposure to Russia. Emerging market corporate debt has lost $49 billion in value over the past month alone  according to data compiled by Bloomberg.“The value destruction has been quite immense for investors ” said Anthony Kettle  an emerging-markets portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management. “As a consequence to all this  value probably looks good in EM  but it is a reminder of the tail risk events that can occur.”Sanctions and varying interpretations of sanctions by the financial intermediaries along the payment chain have led bondholders to run daily checks with their back office and custodians to confirm whether funds have been received.Citigroup is the paying agent for about four dozen bonds tied to Russian companies  according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While some -- including Gazprom and Norilsk Nickel -- have successfully made coupon payments in recent days  others have seen payments stall. In addition to Severstal  Citigroup has blocked a $19.3 million interest payment sent by EuroChem Group.In yet another twist  search engine provider Yandex is at risk of default because its debt is convertible into shares that have been suspended as part of the sanctions  which has led the company to hire restructuring advisers.Still  some investors are beginning to spot pockets of value in Russian bonds as interest payments  for the most part  continue to be made  especially in nearer-term maturities.“The willingness of the Russian corporate and sovereign borrowers to pay coupons and service their debt is encouraging ” said Persella Ioannides  a portfolio manager at MeritKapital  a money manager with emerging markets investments. “Moves by the central bank of Russia and the Kremlin to support the ruble will also help cashflows.”Others see the potential for a domino effect where investors want out  traders step back from facilitating transactions and the settlement system fails.“We don’t think investing in Russia makes any sense here at all ” said Koenigsberger.(Updates with potential impact on Russian economy in second paragraph and drop in value for emerging market corporate debt in 11th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.02,0.3,0.68,mixed,0.08,0.13,0.79,True,English,"['Russia High-Wire Act', 'Default Leaves', 'Bondholders', 'Edge', 'natural gas giant Gazprom', 'Emerging market corporate debt', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'emerging markets investments', 'Societe Generale SA', 'chief investment officer', 'BlueBay Asset Management', 'search engine provider', 'external debt record', 'National Settlement Depository', 'Gramercy Funds Management', 'tail risk events', 'four dozen bonds', 'emerging-markets portfolio manager', 'sovereign debt expert', 'billionaire Roman Abramovich', '$19.3 million interest payment', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Russian corporate', 'Russian billionaire', 'debt restructuring', 'settlement system', 'money manager', 'Russian Federation', 'Russian government', 'Russian Railways', 'Russian bonds', 'Russian economy', 'increasing number', 'financial intermediaries', 'biggest corporations', 'economic gains', 'one estimate', 'Lee Buchheit', 'biggest clearinghouses', 'Alexey Mordashov', 'U.K.', 'U.S.', 'coupon payment', 'grace period', 'paying agent', 'trading system', 'financial impact', 'direct exposure', 'past month', 'Anthony Kettle', 'varying interpretations', 'payment chain', 'daily checks', 'back office', 'Norilsk Nickel', 'recent days', 'EuroChem Group', 'restructuring advisers', 'nearer-term maturities', 'sovereign borrowers', 'Persella Ioannides', 'central bank', 'domino effect', 'second paragraph', '11th paragraph', 'Russian companies', 'interest payments', 'Other companies', 'mining company', 'other countries', 'Robert Koenigsberger', 'most part', 'potential impact', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'emerging-market investors', 'foreign investors', 'Citigroup Inc.', 'value destruction', 'international sanctions', 'time', 'Others', 'web', 'allies', 'country', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'path', 'default', 'pall', 'darling', '15 years', 'end', 'uglier', 'dozens', 'situation', 'pariah', 'world', 'lot', 'sleep', 'Eurobonds', 'delays', 'Friday', 'operations', 'Clearstream', 'Thursday', 'account', 'owners', 'roadblocks', 'spite', 'intention', 'Story', 'Severstal', 'steel', 'Wednesday', 'Evraz', 'stake', 'Slovakia', 'Turkey', 'conflict', 'data', 'consequence', 'reminder', 'bondholders', 'custodians', 'addition', 'twist', 'Yandex', 'shares', 'pockets', 'willingness', 'coupons', 'MeritKapital', 'Moves', 'Kremlin', 'ruble', 'cashflows', 'traders', 'transactions', 'sense', 'Updates']",2022-03-25,2022-03-26,finance.yahoo.com

Many have ditched cable and now rely on streaming services for their TV news  sports and entertainment needs.

We also take a look at the good old TV antenna. The easiest way to get your local TV stations wirelessly is to purchase a digital HDTV antenna.

Of course  there are also options for people who want to put a more powerful antenna on the roof of their house for better reception and range. While the number of channels you can clearly receive on a digital HDTV depends on where you live  the good news is that you should be able to receive up to 80 channels or more.high definition antennaWe recommend the ClearStream Eclipse or Vansky antenna. An HD antenna is especially perfect for those who want a traditional TV experience. They’re a one-time purchase for around $20 to $80  they’re easy to set up  and you actually get more channels than you think.

The Sling Orange package doesn’t have local channels  but the Sling Blue package gives you your local FOX  NBC and NBC regional sports channels  among 30 other popular channels like FOX News Channel  MSNBC  CNN and Food Network.But if you’re willing to spend $65 a month on a live TV streaming service  we recommend YouTube TV.

1586,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4497926-stellantis-creation-automotive-giant,Stellantis Stock: The Creation Of An Automotive Giant (NYSE:STLA),Stellantis laid out long-term strategic roadmap promising growth that goes to 2030. See why I believe STLA stock will retain dominance in automotive industry.,tomeng/iStock Unreleased via Getty ImagesStellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) completed a successful merger in January 2021  when both Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  an Italian-American conglomerate with several recognized and high-end brands to its name  merged with the French PSA Group. This made the newly-formed corporation the sixth-largest automaker globally and a crucial player in the industry  given the number of brands. The company is also listed on the Italian Borsa Italiana  the Euronext Paris  and the New York Stock Exchange as STLA.tradingview.comGiven the ease of restrictions and slow resolution of the supply chain crisis  Stellantis was expected to have a stellar year  reporting gains  especially in shipments where the company's brands are recognized. A brief overview of the business and the market at large quickly reveals the company's secure financials and its leading place among the car manufacturers.Company ProfileStellantis N.V. is a recently formed car manufacturing corporation that arose from a merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group. The May 2021 50-50 cross-border merger made the company the fourth-largest automaker globally by volume. The company now manages approximately 400 000 employees spread across the multiple countries it operates in. While the company's headquarters are in Amsterdam  its operations are global  overseeing the supply of its multiple brands. The brands include Jeep  Chrysler  Peugeot  Alfa Romeo  and 12 other car brands more popular abroad than in the US. To manage such an extensive portfolio  the company has multiple assembly plants across Africa  Asia  Europe  South America  North America  and Australia.A year after the $52 billion merger  Stellantis has had enough time to manage operations  helped with the appointment of Carlos Tavares as CEO  who formerly oversaw PSA. The company will need to figure out the best way to market its different brands to different regions of the world. Different brands have appeal depending on which region of the world you are looking at  and Stellantis has a large enough portfolio to cater to many different markets. As a result  the question that remains is how well the automotive industry is doing in all markets.Automotive Industrystatista.comThe global automotive industry hit all-time highs last year by topping $2.7 trillion in revenue by the end of the year. This represents a $200 billion appreciation from the year before and is expected to rise by at least $100 billion in 2022. Technological advancements in vehicle manufacturing  such as self-driving vehicles and the transition into electric vehicles (EV)  have and will continue to contribute to the growth of the industry. With both the pressure and support to transition into cleaner energy  these will also help ensure that the industry remains unaffected by environmental concerns by providing acceptable solutions. Of course  numerous other factors contributed to growth  including the slow but sure resolution of the global supply chain crisis  among other things.Stellantis is well placed to supply the entire global market with the vehicles they need and is working towards addressing the environmental concerns that surround the automotive industry. The company is seeking to target the North American and European markets with low emission vehicles  or LEVs  manufactured by many of the company's brands. The market is expected to grow much faster in Europe  with the company estimating 14% sales in 2021 and 70% by 2030. The company's expectations for the US are expected to reach 40% LEV sales by 2030. The company's roadmap has a lot ahead of it and offers enough to show faith in the company's ability to manage changes. So how did the company perform in its first year after the merger?Financial AnalysisCar sales shot up in 2021  so it would only be natural to analyze the revenue and income Stellantis reported for that year  as these go hand in hand. The company ended the year with $164 billion in net revenue  which was not only a massive leap from the nearly $60 billion reported in 2020 but still higher than what was seen in 2019. This rapid rise came as a direct result of the merger  which saw an increase in North American shipments  which managed a total of 1.764 million shipment units in 2021. South America was reported to have shipped 811 thousand units in the same period. Still  it was Europe that took the cake  with 2.877 million units shipped  over a million more units than what North America reported. Asia  which is globally the largest market  saw a mere 216 thousand combined shipment units  highlighting the need for the corporation on other markets where it may already have an advantage. How did the company manage this influx of revenue?Research and Development (R&D) expenditure almost doubled year-to-year  growing from $2.73 billion in 2020 to $5 billion in 2021. However  it was in Sales  General  and Admin expenses the bulk of the revenue was invested in  with 2021 seeing an increase from $4.8 billion to over $10 billion in the space of 12 months. All of these chipped into what could have been the company's profit  but where necessary investments as the company ramp up production and shipments for the growing demand  while also looking to the long-term future of the company. Still  net income applicable to common shareholders was reported at over $16 billion in 2021  compared to the mere $2.5 billion the year before.nasdaq.comAll of these figures need to account for the merger  which naturally resulted in a complete shift from previous figures reported. The earnings per share consensus for 2022 is currently at $4.24 and is expected to maintain more or less the same in the following two years. In February  the company also announced a total distribution of approximately $3.7 billion from profits of the year  corresponding to about $1.14 per common share.Recent Developments and RisksStellantis has laid out a long-term strategic roadmap that goes all the way to 2030. The company's primary focus continues to be centered around Europe  with most brands either being native or familiar to that continent and the United States  where some brands are also originally from  and a select few are recognized as high-end import vehicles. For this  the company has set aside approximately $33 billion of investments through 2025. Most of this will go into the transition into smart vehicles and efficient vehicles that boast both advanced software technology and reduced emissions. Semiconductors also presented an issue throughout the past year  with the company seeing dips in sales in the third quarter due to a lack of chips  further highlighting the need to invest in better and more efficient technology. In the event that this continues  Stellantis may suffer due to its capital expenditure in ramping up production  but a bottleneck on actual production capabilities due to a lack of supply in the chip department. However  as the supply of semiconductors continues to ramp up  the issue might soon solve itself - the number of vehicles manufactured and sold will directly benefit from a resolution to this problem.In terms of other risks  Stellantis is particularly prone to economic declines. In an expanding economy  consumers buy far more newer cars than in a recession. Given that there is still significant risk of an economic downturn in the near future  this could lead to a worst-case scenario where not only do sales decline  but the loss in income for Stellantis coupled with burning its existing cash on ramping up production leads to a troubling outcome. This is  however  a risk that exists with all automakers. If anything  Stellantis is less prone than others due to its market dominance and global consumer distribution.Key TakeawaysWhether it's a crisis in Eastern Europe  a global chip shortage  a global supply chain crisis  or even a global pandemic  many issues can negatively impact any car manufacturing company. Stellantis can tackle this by doing what most smart companies have opted to do in past times of difficulty  consolidate to form a stronger group. While the merger was in the works since 2019  it nevertheless could not have come at a better time  helping the company profitably navigate from 2021 to the coming years. Stellantis has secured its position as one of the largest players in its industry  and it has climbed there on a steady financial foundation. In the years to come  this will likely continue  and the company will retain its dominance in the automotive industry as it expands along its current-decade strategic roadmap.,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.44,0.23,0.33,True,English,"['Stellantis Stock', 'Automotive Giant', 'The', 'Creation', 'NYSE', 'STLA', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'May 2021 50-50 cross-border merger', 'global supply chain crisis', '216 thousand combined shipment units', 'Italian Borsa Italiana', 'R&D) expenditure', 'numerous other factors', 'Fiat Chrysler Automobiles', 'multiple assembly plants', 'entire global market', 'large enough portfolio', 'low emission vehicles', '1.764 million shipment units', 'Stellantis N.V.', 'French PSA Group', 'global automotive industry', 'many different markets', 'North American shipments', 'car manufacturing corporation', '12 other car brands', '811 thousand units', 'car manufacturers', 'extensive portfolio', 'enough time', 'vehicle manufacturing', 'other things', 'other markets', '2.877 million units', 'multiple countries', 'different regions', 'Getty Images', 'Italian-American conglomerate', 'several recognized', 'crucial player', 'Euronext Paris', 'brief overview', 'secure financials', 'leading place', 'multiple brands', 'Alfa Romeo', 'South America', 'Carlos Tavares', 'best way', 'time highs', '$200 billion appreciation', 'Technological advancements', 'self-driving vehicles', 'electric vehicles', 'cleaner energy', 'environmental concerns', 'acceptable solutions', 'sure resolution', 'European markets', 'Financial Analysis', 'Car sales', 'massive leap', 'rapid rise', 'same period', 'different brands', 'successful merger', '$52 billion merger', 'largest market', 'high-end brands', 'largest automaker', 'slow resolution', '40% LEV sales', 'direct result', 'stellar year', 'first year', 'net revenue', 'Company Profile', '14% sales', 'iStock', 'NYSE', 'STLA', 'January', 'name', 'number', 'ease', 'restrictions', 'gains', 'business', 'volume', '400,000 employees', 'headquarters', 'Amsterdam', 'operations', 'Jeep', 'Peugeot', 'Africa', 'Asia', 'Australia', 'appointment', 'CEO', 'world', 'question', 'transition', 'growth', 'pressure', 'support', 'LEVs', 'expectations', 'roadmap', 'lot', 'faith', 'ability', 'changes', 'income', 'hand', 'total', 'cake', 'mere', 'need', 'advantage', 'influx', 'Research', 'Development', 'General', 'Admin', 'bulk', 'space', '12 months']",2022-03-26,2022-03-26,seekingalpha.com

Thank you for joining us for our discussion of operating and financial results for the full year 2021. A special thank you also to the entire Nyxoah team for their tireless dedication and outstanding performance amid ongoing challenges posed by the COVID pandemic.I'm extremely proud of how our team has exceeded expectations in all our geographies. 2021 was an important year for Nyxoah as we accomplished numerous clinical  regulatory  commercial  and financial milestones and positioned ourself for continued execution and sustainable success in 2022 and beyond. On the clinical and regulatory front  our BETTER SLEEP study achieved its primary endpoint of statistically significant absolute reduction in AHI for the entire cohort  as well as for complete concentric collapse or CCC patients. As a result  we received an expanded CE mark indication to treat CCC patients in Europe.And the U.S. FDA granted us breakthrough device designation for CCC patients. Having achieved a 64% response rate across all cohorts at six months post-implantation  including 67 among known CCC patients  these BETTER SLEEP results help de-risk all DREAM U.S. IDE pivotal study and are giving us confidence that we are incorporating the right learnings to this critically important trial.We have a much greater understanding about patients phenotyping as we advance the dream trial  and we look forward to completing implants next quarter. Our patient-centric focus also includes our separate IDE trial for CCC patients in the U.S.  which we anticipate commencing later this year to make this technology available to the 30% of patients who are contraindicated for hypoglossal neurostimulation in the U.S. and we would know -- and who would no longer have to undergo an invasive Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy  also called DISE procedure. We also made MRI compatibility a top priority from the get-go to ensure that patients always feel safe and do not have to worry about explanting their device to undergo an MRI  of which  there are more than 40 million performed in OSA patients alone every year globally.We were therefore thrilled to secure CE mark MRI conditional labeling to ensure that patients implanted with Genio can undergo full-body 1.5T and 3T MRIs. On the commercial side  we were extremely pleased to move from the innovation budget to securing a dedicated DRG code for hypoglossal neurostimulation in Germany. We are also expanding rapidly and have generated strong demand in other European countries as we managed to secure a dedicated DRG code in Switzerland and have obtained hospital reimbursement in Spain. We are also awaiting reimbursement decisions in Belgium and the Netherlands.Our commercial strategy in Europe is based on a deep understanding of the patient journey  engaging with the implanting ENT surgeons and sleep physicians as key stakeholders in guiding OSA patients to the most appropriate therapy. Building strong relations between both referral and implanting physicians  results in the creation of a center of excellence ecosystem associated with faster therapy penetration and high patient satisfaction. On the financial side  we also successfully completed our second IPO in the span of 10 months  raising 97.8 million to our Nasdaq listing in July after raising 84.8 million euros in our Euronext Brussels IPO in September 2020. We are proud to welcome a strong group of high-quality investors to our existing U.S.and European shareholder base  and we look forward to building a roster further. More importantly  these offerings provided us with ample balance sheet liquidity  a cash balance of 135 million euros as of December 31  2021  that enables us to invest in our key clinical  R&D  and commercial priorities at this critical time for our company. I will go into more detail on each of these pillars. Let me first reiterate to you our overarching strategy.Our proprietary patient-centric Genio system is the only hypoglossal neurostimulation device that requires only one incision  which shortens procedure time to around 60 minutes and reduces the risk of infection compared to multiple incisions. It delivers bilateral stimulation  which we believe results in an expanded total addressable market  eliminates the need for patients to have to undergo the Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy procedure to determine if they have CCC or not. And last  it is compatible with both 1.5T and 3T full-body MRI. We are leveraging our strengthened balance sheet to build a growing body of clinical evidence to ensure that this technology is available to as many moderate-to-severe OSA patients as possible.Our population  that number is more than 1 million new patients per year  including more than 500 000 in the U.S. who are eligible to treat [Audio gap] with and without complete concentric collapse of the soft palate. Last June  we announced that BETTER SLEEP had achieved its primary safety and performance endpoint of statistically significant absolute reduction in baseline AHI at six months for the entire patient cohort  as well as for the non-CCC patient subgroup and  importantly  the CCC patient subgroup. This is a critical development for Nyxoah.And these clinical results  which were presented in a post at the World Sleep Congress earlier this month in Rome  represent the first body of evidence to demonstrate that bilateral hypoglossal neurostimulation can be an effective treatment for patients with CCC  who comprise approximately 30% of the moderate-to-severe OSA patient population and who are contraindicated for other hypoglossal neurostimulation options that are approved in the U.S. The study also generated a statistically significant reduction in oxygen desaturation index  or ODI  across all patient cohorts. Per the Sher criteria  as used in our DREAM U.S. pivotal study  BETTER SLEEP achieved a response rate of 64% for the entire population  60% for the CCC cohort  and 67% for the non-CCC cohort.Considering that as the growing body of clinical data and real-world experience suggest that patient response improves meaningfully between month six and month 12  these strong response rates in all patient cohorts already after six months further increase of confidence in positive outcomes for the ongoing DREAM study  whether we need to demonstrate a response rate above 65% after 12 months. We also note that the mean AHI reduction exceeded 70% among responders in both CCC and non-CCC  making them super responders. In other words  when a patient responds  the type of airway obstruction will not influence the outcomes using the Genio system. World Sleep was an outstanding success for us  as we not only present BETTER SLEEP data but also hosted a physician event entitled ""Shifting Paradigm in OSA Therapy in Genio"" that was attended by more than 55 key opinion leaders from the U.S.and Europe. It was invaluable opportunity for us to present our data directly and ask physicians questions  and we are encouraged by the growing interest and enthusiasm for hypoglossal neurostimulation in general and Genio in particular. To this end  in October  the notified body in Europe expanded our CE Mark indication to include CCC patients among those eligible to be treated with Genio. And Genio is now commercially available in Europe  and the first CCC patients have been successfully implanted in Germany.As a reminder  the ability to treat CCC patients means that all moderate-to-severe OSA patients will no longer have to undergo a DISE procedure to determine if they have CCC. In addition  the U.S. FDA in September granted Genio Breakthrough Device Designation for CCC patients  which provides us with priority review. More on -- more on this in a moment.Turning to our clinical program in the U.S.  the DREAM pivotal study. The DREAM pivotal study is our study in the U.S. that aims to  first  confirm safety and efficacy of the Genio system; and second  support marketing authorization of the Genio system in the U.S. The study plans to involve 134 moderate-to-severe OSA patients who failed first-line top treatment with 12-month efficacy and safety primary endpoint.The trial includes 16 U.S. and six international sites currently activated screening  enrolling  and implanting patients. Let me walk through to our progress on patient enrollment and the funnel that leads from initial enrollment to implantation. As of today  we have enrolled 430 patients  of whom 52 have made it through the funnel to implantation.There are additional 104 patients in active screening who underwent an initial polysomnography and are awaiting a confirmatory PSG to determine if their baseline AHI meets the minimum criteria to be implanted. Based on our experience  approximately 70% of these patients in active screening move to implantation  meaning we likely have enough patients in the funnel to complete the necessary 134 implants. And we continue to enroll new patients as we speak to fill the funnel to ensure that we have more than enough to complete the study. Of those enrolled patients who do not [Inaudible] for enrollment  they screen out because a DISE procedure indicates they have CCC  their BMI is too high  or an initial PSG determined that their AHI is not high enough.But to reiterate  we are encouraged by the pace of enrollment and by the number of patients who -- who are moving through active screening. Today  our focus is further secure our slots and making sure that the PSG -- the baseline PSG can be performed as soon as possible. Now  to be perfectly candid  we fully expected to complete implants by the end of Q1 2022  which is next week. Based on the numbers I just shared with you  we will not hit the target in the next six days.While I do not like to make excuses  it's a fact that the omicron variant caused significant disruptions for hospital  particularly with respect to surgery. Many U.S. states placed moratoriums on elective procedures  as did European countries like Germany  as well as Australia. Even as things begin to open up  the backlog of delayed surgeries meant it was increasingly difficult for surgeons to schedule OR time.We  therefore  saw very little implanting activity in December  and things gradually improved as we moved through January and into February. I'm very pleased to see the strong momentum we have built over the last six to eight weeks as more key physicians have been activated and have accelerated this pace of implantation. We are now confident that we will be able to close old implants during the second quarter  which would put us on track to have full 12-month patient follow-up data in the mid of 2023. We will have much more to say on this specific regulatory pathway as we move through this year  but we expect to pursue a model of PMA pathway that we hope will enable us to secure FDA approval of commercial launch in the U.S.in early 2024. Returning to the discussion of CCC  we have been encouraged by our sprint discussions with the FDA regarding the design of a separate IDE trial focused on CCC patients. We will call this trial ""Access with three C's "" as in CCC. And we hope to commence enrollment later this year.We will have much more to say about this trial  including sample size  design  endpoints  and timing once we have the final word from the FDA regarding our IDE submission  which we anticipate occurring before this summer. Turning now to our commercial progress for 2021. As with our other achievements in 2021  I'm extremely proud of the significant progress we made in our commercial operations. We remain committed to our strategy of going deep  as is going wide  as we focus our efforts on creating a center of excellence ecosystem with high level of clinical expertise between implanting ENT surgeons and sleep physicians  providing more treatment options to their large patient pools.We are first focused on experienced hypoglossal neurostimulation samples  with an existing OSA referral partner. Additionally  we have also managed to open new sites  feeding the funnel of new patients with a customized digital marketing strategy and targeted referral programs. Our focus remains on Germany  where we invested in building a Nyxoah dedicated sales and marketing team of 13 people in order to demonstrate our commercial proof of concept. Supported by the strong endorsement of German KOLs and ENT society  we obtained a dedicated DRG coding in 2021.As of December 31st  we were in 12 active implant sites and expect to be active in '25 before summer 2022. Next to Germany  we also made meaningful headway in other key European markets during 2021. We secured DRG code in Switzerland. We obtained hospital reimbursement in Spain.We continue to await reimbursement decisions in the Netherlands and Belgium. We also further invest in wider market access in the Nordic countries. Last  I would like to turn an update on our R&D activities. As mentioned earlier  in January 2021  we received a CE mark for MRI conditional labeling  ensuring that patients implanted with the Genio system can now undergo full-body 1.5T and 3T MRI scans.MRI compatibility is consistent with our patient-centric mission and aids in patients' quality of life  knowing that over 40 million MRI scans were performed in OSA patients globally in 2020. To date  we remain the only company with an MRI compatibility label for the full body and 3T Tesla  which is the most commonly used MRI setup. We also have submitted to the notified body in Europe and to FDA our Genio 2.1 next-generation system  which includes a new patient-centric smartphone app that will empower both the physician and the patient to track progress. This app will also empower the patients  allowing them to adjust the stimulation amplitude at home.The Genio 2.1 activation chip will integrate multiple sensors  including a position sensor to adjust stimulation levels based on sleeping position and patient movement  what would also be making our technology intelligent. We also remain focused on developing our longer-term pipeline to find new and innovative ways to treat a greater number of OSA patients. To this end  in February 2021  we announced our exclusive licensing agreement with the U.S. Vanderbilt University  allowing us access to technologies and capabilities to develop next-generation obstructive sleep apnea solutions.We are pleased that we can partner with Dr. David Kent  who is the director of the sleep surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center  to develop new neurostimulation technologies  starting with one that focused on the Ansa Cervicalis nerve stimulation. The ability to treat OSA patients in a different way will further expand treatment options for physicians  resulting in enlarging the eligible-to-treat OSA patient population. We are building first prototypes at the moment  and we will have further updates on this project later this year.Finally  I'm pleased to welcome new CFO  Loic Moreau  who joined us January 1st. I will now turn the call over to Loic for our financial discussion.Loic Moreau -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you for the warm welcome  Olivier. Good day to everyone  and thank you for joining us today. I'm thrilled to be part of the team  and I'm excited to embark on this journey with the Nyxoah team and with all our stakeholders. I will provide some highlights from our P&L and our balance sheet.For further details  please refer to our earnings press release issued earlier today and our annual report. Revenue was eight 852 000 for the full year ended December 31  2021  compared to 69 000 for the full year ended December 31  2020. The increase in revenue was attributable to the company commercialization of the Genio system  mainly in Germany  and with some contribution from Spain and Belgium. Revenue for the second half of 2021 was 497 000  a 40% increase versus the first half of the year despite headwinds related to the omicron variant during the fourth quarter  which included a moratorium on elective procedures in Germany.Total cost of goods sold for the full year 2021 was 303 000  with gross profit of 549 000  representing a gross margin of 64.4%. While we're not providing any specific guidance on gross margin for 2022 or beyond  we do expect gross margins to improve over time in line with all the neurostimulation companies as we achieve greater commercial scale. General and administrative expenses rose to 11.1 million for the full year ended December 31  2021  from 7.5 million in 2020  due primarily to increased commercial efforts in Germany and other European markets. We have also scaled up our corporate infrastructure and expect to continue adding headcount across the organization going forward.Research and development expenses increased substantially to 2.4 million in 2021  from 473 000 in 2020 after a capitalization of 3.4 million  driven by our efforts to develop the next generation of our Genio system. Clinical expenses increased to 2.7 million in 2021 from 1.1 million in 2020 after capitalization of 6.1 million euro. The increase was mainly due to: number one  the completion of the BETTER SLEEP trial implantations; second  the ongoing recruitment for the EliSA trial; and third  the initiation and ramp-up of the DREAM IDE trial in the United States. This will remain a key investment focus for us in 2022 as we work to complete DREAM implants and manage patient follow-ups.We also anticipate commencing our access IDE trial for CCC later this year. We expect that R&D and clinical expense will represent roughly two-thirds of our operating expenses in 2022. We realized a net loss of 27.6 million for the full year ended December 31  2021  compared to a net loss of 12.2 million for the 12 months ended December 31  2020. At the end of 2021  cash and cash equivalents totaled 135.5 million compared to 92.3 million euro in December 31  2020.The increase in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to net proceeds that we generated from our July 2021 initial public offering in the U.S.  in which we sold 3 260 000 ordinary shares  including Over-allotment  at a price of $30 per share. This resulted in total gross proceeds of $97.8 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The increase in cash from IPO proceeds was offset by net cash flows used from operating expenses of 25.3 million euro. Based on our current cash balance and burn rate expectations  we have ample liquidity to go to U.S.commercialization in 2024. With that  I will turn the call back to Olivier.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Loic. In closing  I would like to reiterate my excitement for where we stand today as a company while our dedicated team has built an execution culture that produced a number of significant clinical  regulatory  commercial  and financial accomplishments in 2021. And I hope this gives you confidence in our ability to continue to execute in '22 and beyond. For '22  you can expect our full focus to remain on: first  completing the DREAM trial; next  commercial execution in Germany; and commencing our CCC IDE study in the U.S.We are also excited to begin holding quarterly conference calls in 2022. And we look forward to providing Q1 update in May. This concludes the formal part of our presentation. Operator  I will turn the call over to you to begin our Q&A session.Thank you very much.Questions & Answers:Operator[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.Adam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystGreat. Hi  Olivier. Hi  Loic. Congrats on the progress last year and thanks for taking the questions here.Maybe  just to start  we can talk about the U.S. pivotal trial  the DREAM study. Recognize  you know  some of the challenges that COVID-19 has presented  and you're certainly not the only medical technology company to be impacted here. But maybe just talk about the level of confidence in delivering against the revised expectation being done with implants in Q2.What informs that confidence given  I think  the math implies you need to implant 82 patients in the second quarter. And then maybe just talk a little bit more specifically about the trends you're seeing in the trial in recent weeks. I mean  it sounds like you're pleased with the recent momentum  but was hoping you could put a finer point on that. And then I had a follow-up or two.Thanks.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you for the question  Adam. So  today  as I already pointed it out  we are at the 52 implants. So  the calculation is correct that we need to do a little bit more than 80. What is giving us confidence is the fact that the lot of progress made on the enrollment with more than four -- almost 30 patients enrolled.But I think more important is when we drill down one step further in this funnel  having over 100 patients that  in fact  already passed DISE  that passed the first PSG  and that more are waiting for their baseline PSG. As I mentioned  we calculate roughly 70  but I think it can also be a little bit higher. It's a little bit some specific  but the 70% up to 75% of those that will end up in doing and then getting an implant. So  what we see today  enrollment  what is in the funnel  what already has been done  we should be good to reach 134 implants.Now  the other sites that I would like to point out is that  currently  we really have 16 U.S. sites fully up and running on doing implants. Now  what the team did great is they started also finding and going after solutions in order to secure OR time slots and also to collaborate with specialized speed labs to have an acceleration in getting PSGs done where we have the patients that are waiting in the funnel. So  if you combine all this  the focus on already looking OR time  getting more sleep labs to perform PSGs  and having the patient base already in the funnel  passing the first screen out where we lose them on DISE  on BMI  also are not being monitored.That gives us a lot of confidence that we will be able to close by the end of Q2.Adam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystOK. That's really helpful. And maybe just to clarify  it sounds like  in terms of baseline PSGs and securing OR time  it sounds like you have some visibility as we look ahead  and that kind of informs the confidence and expectation that you'll be able to complete implants in Q2. Am I thinking about that? Or did I hear that right  Olivier?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerWell  that is correct. So  and then -- and when we look at the different samples that we are having  our team is  of course  in close and daily contact with them. And we also are introducing some dashboards when we secure the OR time  what patient will go into this funnel. So  there is a concrete execution focus on getting them implanted.Adam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystOK. OK. Very helpful. Thank you.And then for my next question  wanted to ask just a little bit more  you know  broad strokes on on the back-half commercial performance back-half '21  and then thus far into 2022. Just curious to get more color on how that trajectory has looked. I think it would just be helpful to get some baseline for our models. We think about forecasting here in 2022.So  any color there you could provide  Olivier or Loic  would be very appreciated.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerSo  first  I would like to really point out that our commercial proof of concept  we have a full focus on Germany. So  when we are talking about numbers  about implant  it's really focused on Germany. And that's also how we have defined our future success by becoming market leader in the German market. So  coming back second half of the year  more specifically Q4  we were really impacted by omicron.And I am -- I think I'm not the only one who is making that statement. I hate to use that as an excuse  but sometimes  when it's a fact  it's a fact. You know  what we saw during this time is that the team really did a strong job in continuing  identifying  and positioning of technology in new sites. And that will result that we will have up to 25 sites before summer this year.Today  we have 12 who will be doubling the number of sites in the coming four months. And all those sites are identified and the conversations are ongoing. And we are setting them up to do successful Genio employment. That's the first thing.The second thing is -- and without disclosing  I really  really -- and the implant rate or revenue that we see a very strong traction in Q1. And as I mentioned  we are now aligning  also doing Q1 or quarterly earnings calls  so it may be significant. I will be more than happy to further update you with precise numbers on the Q1 activity. But we are really feeling confident  and we're also seeing that specifically in Germany  again  the COVID days are really are the -- really behind  and things are returning back to normal.So  that's the second thing. The third thing is we significantly invested in the data and digital marketing activities and in really fine-tuning and further filling the funnel of referral patients. So  those are the three things we are doing. And I will be very happy to come back to Q1 and telling you the progress we made with specific numbers.Adam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystOK. Understood. We'll stay tuned there. And it's encouraging to hear.It sounds like Q1 is off to a good start  so appreciate that commentary. And then maybe just one last one for me and I'll jump back in the queue. But I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the accounts that you're in today in Germany. Just any early learnings there  Olivier  you know  how are clinicians utilizing Genio  how are they splitting -- or are they splitting between devices or are they picking one device over the other? You know  I know it's relatively early still  but just curious about how your customers and physicians are utilizing the product at their respective practices.Thanks so much for taking the questions.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerSo  I -- first of all  what we hear back overall is that the physicians are extremely pleased to have an alternative or to have a choice within hypoglossal neurostimulation. So far  there was only one option they could propose to patients. And today  they have two options. And this is really something that we are hearing back as a great win  also to address more patients and some patients that may be in the past would be lost hypoglossal neurostimulation.That's the one thing  having the option to choose. Second  what we also are hearing back is by not having the battery implanted  it gives them also a lot of -- or shall I say  a lot of convincing power with patients who are a little bit afraid of surgery. Yet  we stay with a single incision procedure: 60 minutes  skin-to-skin time. It goes fast.And patients that are afraid of surgery are more open also to accept hypoglossal neurostimulation. And then last  what we are hearing back is the scalable software platform that we are offering with patient application  with the opportunity to interact without seeing the patients physically. So  I think those are the three major learnings. We are broadening the number of patients eligible to treat hypoglossal neurostimulation by giving physicians a choice.We see that by making it less invasive  only one procedure  it helps also convincing patients that are a little bit afraid of surgery. And last  with a scalable technology platform  this is also -- and being able to monitor patients without seeing them physically is really a big win.Adam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystVery helpful. Thanks again for taking the questions.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerWith pleasure.OperatorThank you. Our next call -- question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystGreat. Thanks  guys. Good morning. Olivier  maybe the first one for you.And I'll start on DREAM as well. The 104 in active screening  and then I think you said 70% in active screening usually go to implants. And I just want to focus there for a second. Is there any color -- you know  thinking about like the timing of those in active screening to get the implant where then the 12-month clock starts? Is that a one-month process  a three-month process? Just as many details that you can give.Because it's a big number  the 104. That's a high percentage  the 70%. But maybe if you can talk to the timeline that usually accompanies that process would be very helpful.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerNo  Jon  this is really an excellent question. And to answer this  first  I have to say  this is really site-specific. So  when we talk -- when we look at some sites  it's a question of a couple of weeks to push them through. Where in another site  it's a question of a couple of months to push them through.But on average  we are seeing that in order to do this  we are talking about five to six weeks. So  after doing the baseline PSG to the implant  it's five to six weeks on average. But no  as I mentioned before  of course  the challenge of our team and the focus of our team is to shorten those push-through timelines to a maximum and to also incorporate the learnings from sites after doing this in a couple of weeks. But on average  five to six -- five to six weeks  the fastest one.A couple of weeks  the slowest one  they go all the way up to two months.Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystOK. That's very helpful. So  maybe to your point  it's five to six weeks. It gives you the high conviction that you're across the goal line  so to say  by the end of the second quarter where we extrapolate that back to the 104 -- the 70% of the 104.Got it. And then just to pivot a little bit  you know  I believe -- and I might be mistaken. But I believe your filings calls out for SAEs in DREAM. And  you know  I think  one  is that correct? And two  much more importantly  are any of those device-related or any color that you're able to provide in those SAEs? And I ask because I want to be clear  you know  per Inspire's STAR study  well  you know that SAEs are not uncommon at all.But they're called out a lot for device-related. So  maybe if you could comment on that  you know  the number. And then any color you can provide on those would be helpful.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerNo  it's correct. So  having a phase is not uncommon. And I think it's like -- it's something that also surgeons and companies are learning from. In our study  we see that there is no higher number of SAEs than you would expect with other studies.So  the four that you're referring to  at this moment  there are still  I think -- let me try to be precise. I think there are still two that need to be further determined whether it is device-related or procedure-related. So far  what we saw was not device-related  the two that are still under examination. It will become -- it will become more clear going forward.But I also would like to go back to the BETTER SLEEP study and even do our BLAST OSA study when it comes to SAEs  and pointing out that also there  we saw nothing abnormal to say it like this. We had a low number  most of them resolved after time or related to the procedure. And if you put this into perspective in all the studies  it was completely compatible. So  we expect no difference at all in the DREAM study.Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystOK. I'm sorry. Just to -- for clarity purposes  of the four that we know of  two have been defined as not device-related  and two are so-called TBD  to be determined.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThat is correct.Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystOK  great. And last question. Just  you know  to go over to the commercial side of things  maybe just look  you've got  you know  the expanded indication for CCC or the contraindication taken away. And it's a big move.And you can treat a whole other subset of patients. And you can do it without the DISE. Just at a high level  if you can talk to what those active centers -- you know  there's 12 centers are -- or tell you how maybe the feedback has changed since you've been able to treat that whole other subset of patients and  you know  how you think you can build upon that momentum into '22 and beyond. And that's it.Thanks for your time  guys.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerMmm hmm. So  first  it was great to be able to talk and interact with all the 50 implant surgeons during the World Sleep Congress in Rome and also talking about this question. And [Audio gap] We had the first CCC patient implant commercially in Germany. It has simply to do with the effect that we had to wait for the IFU to be adopted and also to give some time to talk and position this with physicians.I think we can go to the next in line. What I thought John was saying  it was his last question.OperatorOK. Our next question comes from Laura Roba with Degroof Petercam. Your line is open.Laura Roba -- Degroof Petercam -- AnalystYes. Good. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question.Thank you for the presentation. Um  one question from my side regarding about the opex trend going forward. You mentioned in the press release this morning further investments to be made in the accounts  ahead of the U.S. commercial launch.Could you provide more granularity on that in terms of timing  for example?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerI will -- I will give this one to our CFO.Loic Moreau -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Absolutely. So  in 2022  this year  we expect to increase headcount mainly in clinical and R&D. We are starting with peak commercialization in U.S.but very lightly this year  as you can imagine. And we would accelerate only when we would have more visibility on the DREAM data and the 12 months which is planned mid-2023. So  you can expect opex increase for the next 12 months. And then based on DREAM data  we will see what level of investment is required to make a successful launch in U.S.in the second half of 2023. That's how we're looking at this.Laura Roba -- Degroof Petercam -- AnalystOK. Thank you. And then another question regarding the number of active sites. So  am I wrong here? Because I think that in H1  you already announced 12 active sites.Does it mean that there were no new active sites in H2?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerSo I think you're referring to Germany.Laura Roba -- Degroof Petercam -- AnalystExactly  yeah.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd that is -- yup. No. And that is correct. That is correct  Laura.So  we opened the first 12 sites. We focused on what we called Tier 1 or high volume sites. In the second half  we identified the service. But the omicron variant came in in Q4.And we really dedicated a focus  in fact  on the ones that were activated. And that's also why you will be seeing -- but  no  you make me say things that I want to save for Q1. But that's why you will also see the acceleration in the first quarter --Laura Roba -- Degroof Petercam -- AnalystOK.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerIn opening more new sites with activity in Germany.Laura Roba -- Degroof Petercam -- AnalystOK. Good to know. Many thanks.OperatorThank you. And we have a question from Ross Osborn with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystHi. Good morning  and congrats on the progress. So  I guess just a couple of questions on cost. I know you have that formal gross margin guidance  but could you walk through some of the headwinds and tailwinds you saw during the second half of 2021 and just how that's progressing year to date  and how you think that's going to shape out for the rest of the year.Loic Moreau -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So  we have a gross margin in '22 of 64.4 million -- sorry  64.4%.This was broadly in line with H1 one. We are not providing guidance for 2020 -- we are not providing guidance for 2022. But as we reach greater scale in terms of -- and volumes  basically  we expect the gross margin to increase substantially and be in line with the -- all the neurostimulation companies.So  progressively '23 -- '22  '23  it will increase gradually as our volume increases.Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystOK. And then I guess.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd just maybe --Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystSorry. Go ahead.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerNo  sorry. And I want to maybe just add something to this one as well. If you look at our technology where we do not have an implantable pulse generator  which is the highest cost if you look at the total implant also there  we are really feeling confident that we are aiming and we will be ending up more in second time  let's say 85-plus percent gross margins. So  that's where our aim is in going forward  in line  of course  with -- goes hand-in-hand with the volume increase.Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystOK. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess just on the opex  did you sort through some of maybe the marketing activities that you currently have going on and maybe any new ones that are going to come out in 2022.And then lastly  can we just talk about maybe some rep hires planned for this year?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So  in terms of marketing cost  this is mainly related to our activities in Europe  specifically in Germany. So we have our team of 13 that's in Germany  and we have digital marketing so indirectly visiting customers  and we are digital marketing as well. So  we will be spending slightly in other countries in Europe.But this is the majority of the team we have in headcount and in Europe for the time being. Maybe on addition to this  do we plan to further hire new headcount? This goes hand-in-hand with the market access or the reimbursement in countries. As I mentioned before  we are waiting Belgium  Netherlands  Nordic countries. We saw that we also made our first hospital budget securitization in Spain.So  important for Nyxoah that we have a dedicated salesforce. And the moment we have a good view on obtaining reimbursement in a specific country  of course  we start hiring  and we will further expand. So  concrete  yes  you can expect  let's say  five to six additional headcount in Europe. And what we already touched on also  in the pre-commercialization for the U.S.  that we want to make sure that we are also making the needed investments in headcount  like for example  a market access director in the U.S.  preparing -- and already preparing the landscape for future reimbursement in the U.S.as well.Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystSounds great. Congrats again. And thanks for taking my questions.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorThank you. And that's all the questions I have. I would like to turn it back to Olivier Taelman for closing remarks.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerYes  thank you. And the closing remarks will be very short. So  first of all  thank you for joining us again. Thanks for the great questions.Thank you very much and looking forward to update you again in the near future. In the near future will be our Q1 earnings call that we will be hosting on May 10th. So  within six weeks  if I'm not mistaken. Thank you  and enjoy the rest of the day.Operator[Operator signoff]Duration: 53 minutesCall participants:Jeremy Feffer -- Vice President  Investor RelationsOlivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerLoic Moreau -- Chief Financial OfficerAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystJon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystLaura Roba -- Degroof Petercam -- AnalystRoss Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystMore NYXH analysisAll earnings call transcripts",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.62,0.2,0.18,True,English,"['Q4 2021 Earnings Call Transcript', 'Nyxoah S.A.', 'NYXH', 'DREAM U.S. IDE pivotal study', 'CE mark MRI conditional labeling', 'Nyxoah full year 2021 earnings conference call', 'expanded CE mark indication', 'invasive Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy', 'full year financial results', 'BETTER SLEEP study', 'separate IDE trial', 'Nyxoah S.A.', 'U.S. markets', 'U.S. FDA', 'chief executive officer', 'risk factors sections', 'significant absolute reduction', 'complete concentric collapse', 'dedicated DRG code', 'other European countries', 'implanting ENT surgeons', 'Q4 2021 Earnings Call', 'chief financial officer', 'BETTER SLEEP results', 'breakthrough device designation', 'entire Nyxoah team', 'investor relations section', 'investor relations website', 'dream trial', 'important year', 'financial milestones', 'MRI compatibility', 'entire cohort', 'actual results', 'important trial', 'Call Participants', 'events section', 'Prepared Remarks', 'vice president', 'Good morning', 'good afternoon', 'Loic Moreau', 'second half', 'answer session', 'press release', 'market trends', 'various assumptions', 'available information', 'undue reliance', 'Form 20-F', 'Exchange Commission', 'special thank', 'tireless dedication', 'ongoing challenges', 'COVID pandemic', 'continued execution', 'sustainable success', 'regulatory front', 'primary endpoint', '64% response rate', 'six months', 'right learnings', 'greater understanding', 'patient-centric focus', 'hypoglossal neurostimulation', 'full-body 1.5T', '3T MRIs', 'commercial side', 'innovation budget', 'strong demand', 'hospital reimbursement', 'reimbursement decisions', 'commercial strategy', 'deep understanding', 'patient journey', 'key stakeholde', 'Jeremy Feffer', 'Olivier Taelman', 'future events', 'CCC patients', 'OSA patients', 'operating activities', 'looking statements', 'current estimates', 'material risks', 'outstanding performance', 'NYXH', 'Contents', 'Questions', 'Answers', 'Operator', 'speaker', 'Catherine', 'everyone', 'company', 'March', 'expectations', 'predictions', 'forward', 'uncertainties', 'obligation', 'list', 'description', 'business', 'Securities', 'discussion', 'geographies', 'clinical', 'AHI', 'cohorts', 'implantation', 'confidence', 'implants', 'technology', 'Genio', 'Germany', 'Switzerland', 'Spain', 'Belgium', 'Netherlands', 'physicians', '2022', '40']",2022-03-25,2022-03-26,fool.com
1588,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-breaking-phase-3-140000922.html,Press release: Late-breaking Phase 3 data at AAD 2022 show Dupixent® (dupilumab) significantly improved signs and symptoms of prurigo nodularis,Late-breaking Phase 3 data at AAD 2022 show Dupixent® (dupilumab) significantly improved signs and symptoms of prurigo nodularis Dupixent significantly...,Sanofi - Aventis GroupeLate-breaking Phase 3 data at AAD 2022 show Dupixent® (dupilumab) significantly improved signs and symptoms of prurigo nodularisDupixent significantly reduced itch at 12 weeks  and at 24 weeks nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced clinically meaningful reductions in itch and skin lesionsThere are currently no approved systemic treatments for prurigo nodularis; regulatory filings for prurigo nodularis planned in the first half of 2022Paris and Tarrytown  N.Y. March 26  2022. Detailed positive results from the Phase 3 PRIME2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Dupixent® (dupilumab) was presented today in a late-breaking session at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2022 Annual Meeting. The companies previously announced topline results from PRIME2 and a second trial called PRIME investigating the use of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. In both trials  Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo. In total  21 scientific abstracts evaluating the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in patients with atopic dermatitis in different age groups  as well as investigational indications – prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria – will be presented at the congress.Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.Professor of Dermatology  Miller School of Medicine  University of Miami  and principal investigator of the PRIME2 trial“Prurigo nodularis is a relentless and often misunderstood itchy skin disease that leaves many patients with uncontrolled symptoms such as unbearable itch and painful skin lesions  along with a significantly impaired quality of life that should not be underestimated. These positive results are the first time a Phase 3 trial has demonstrated that targeting key drivers of type 2 inflammation  IL-4 and IL-13  with dupilumab significantly improved itch and skin lesions in this highly burdensome disease.”The randomized  placebo-controlled PRIME2 trial met primary and all key secondary endpoints with data presented at AAD 2022 showing:Story continues37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline compared to 22% of placebo patients (p=0.0216) at week 12  the primary endpoint.Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at week 24: 58% of Dupixent patients compared to 20% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients achieved clear or almost clear skin at week 24: 45% of Dupixent patients compared to 16% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indications. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events were generally similar between Dupixent and placebo groups (57% Dupixent  51% placebo). Adverse events that were more commonly ( > 5%) observed with Dupixent were herpes viral infections (7% Dupixent  0% placebo). A lower rate of skin infections were observed with Dupixent (5% Dupixent  9% placebo). Additionally  3% of Dupixent patients and 30% of placebo patients discontinued prior to week 24.Results from the confirmatory PRIME trial will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Data from both trials will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis  which are planned to begin in the first half of 2022.The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long term. There are approximately 75 000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with systemic therapy and are most in need of a treatment option.About the TrialPRIME2  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  is a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 160 adults with prurigo nodularis inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or with whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 12 (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 24 and the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at week 24 (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S.  Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis  as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied in more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes  including prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  hand and foot atopic dermatitis (Phase 3)  eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi announced that detailed positive results from the Phase 3 PRIME2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent® (dupilumab) were presented today in a late-breaking session at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2022 Annual Meeting. The companies previously announced topline results from PRIME2 and a second trial  called PRIME  investigating the use of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. In both trials  Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo. In total  21 scientific abstracts evaluating the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in patients with atopic dermatitis in different age groups  as well as investigational indications of prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria will be presented at the congress.""Prurigo nodularis is a relentless and often misunderstood itchy skin disease that leaves many patients with uncontrolled symptoms such as unbearable itch and painful skin lesions  along with a significantly impaired quality of life that should not be underestimated "" said Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.  Professor of Dermatology at the Miller School of Medicine at University of Miami  Director of the Miami Itch Center and principal investigator of the trial. ""These positive results are the first time a Phase 3 trial has demonstrated that targeting key drivers of type 2 inflammation  IL-4 and IL-13  with dupilumab significantly improved itch and skin lesions in this highly burdensome disease.""Story continuesThe randomized  placebo-controlled PRIME2 trial met its primary and all key secondary endpoints  with data presented at AAD 2022 showing:37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline compared to 22% of placebo patients (p=0.0216) at week 12  the primary endpoint.Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at week 24: 58% of Dupixent patients compared to 20% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients achieved clear or almost clear skin at week 24: 45% of Dupixent patients compared to 16% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indications. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events were generally similar between Dupixent and placebo groups (57% Dupixent  51% placebo). Adverse events that were more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent were herpes viral infections (7% Dupixent  0% placebo). A lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (5% Dupixent  9% placebo). Additionally  3% of Dupixent patients and 30% of placebo patients discontinued prior to week 24.Results from the confirmatory PRIME trial will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Data from both trials will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis  which are planned to begin in the first half of 2022.The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long term. There are approximately 75 000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with systemic therapy and are most in need of a treatment option.About the TrialPRIME2  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  is a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 160 adults with prurigo nodularis inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or with whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 12 (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 24 and the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at week 24 (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S.  Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis  as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes  including prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  hand and foot atopic dermatitis (Phase 3)  eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

The platform presentation details new analysis of pooled data from five bimekizumab Phase 3/3b clinical trials  which showed that over 80 percent of patients who achieved complete skin clearance (PASI 100) at week 16 and entered the open-label extension (OLE) studies maintained this response through two years  and no new safety signals were identified.1Among the poster presentations  new data from the OLE period of the Phase 3b BE RADIANT study showed that clinical responses (PASI 100 and absolute PASI  PASI ≤2) achieved at week 48 were maintained through week 96 with continuous treatment with bimekizumab and improved for patients who switched from secukinumab to bimekizumab on entry to the OLE.2 3 Patients who were PASI 90 non-responders with secukinumab at week 48 achieved improved clinical responses (PASI 90 and PASI 100) after switching to bimekizumab in the OLE.3 Among patients who were PASI 90 responders with secukinumab at week 48  PASI 90 response was maintained and PASI 100 response increased following switch to bimekizumab in the OLE.3Bimekizumab is an investigational product and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The safety and efficacy and safety have not been established. In the European Union and Great Britain  bimekizumab is the first selective IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.4 5""Long-term complete skin clearance is an important goal for people with psoriasis  and the new 96-week data from the open-label extension period of the BE RADIANT study offer fresh insights on the sustained response and clinical potential of bimekizumab in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis "" said Bruce Strober  M.D.  Ph.D.  Clinical Professor  Department of Dermatology  Yale University School of Medicine  New Haven  CT  U.S.  and Central Connecticut Dermatology Research  Cromwell  CT  U.S. ""In addition  the improved clinical responses seen in patients who switched to bimekizumab after 48 weeks of treatment with secukinumab offer further new insights that should help to inform future clinical practice.""Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB  said: ""We are pleased to share our latest long-term data on bimekizumab with the dermatology community at the 2022 AAD Annual Meeting. The wealth of new data  insights and progress being presented underlines our commitment to advances in psoriasis care for people living with this challenging  life-long condition.""Phase 3/3b studies: two-year pooled data for bimekizumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis1¥Data were pooled from the BE VIVID  BE READY  and BE SURE Phase 3 trials  the Phase 3b BE RADIANT trial and OLE (48 weeks)  and the first year of the BE BRIGHT OLE study. Analysis evaluated PASI 100 maintenance through two years (OLE 48 weeks) among PASI 100 week 16 responders who entered the respective OLE studies and received continuous bimekizumab maintenance dosing from week 16 (320 mg every four weeks [Q4W/Q4W/Q4W] or Q4W/Q8W/Q8W). At week 16  62.4 percent of bimekizumab-treated patients (n=1 362) achieved PASI 100. Of those who entered the OLEs  85.1 percent (Q4W/Q4W/Q4W; n=316) and 83.8 percent (Q4W/Q8W/Q8W; n=267) maintained PASI 100 at year two (OLE week 48). The exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) of overall and serious treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 192.7 and 5.9. The most common TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (EAIR of 18.4)  oral candidiasis (13.0)  and upper respiratory tract infections (7.8). Almost all cases of oral candidiasis (98.1 percent) were mild or moderate.BE RADIANT open-label extension study in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: efficacy and safety data through 96 weeks2Complete skin clearance (PASI 100) levels observed with bimekizumab in the BE RADIANT study were maintained in the OLE through week 96 (74.8 percent and 70.6 percent at weeks 48 and 96  respectively) and improved for patients who switched from secukinumab to bimekizumab on entry to the OLE period at week 48 (52.8 percent and 76.1 percent at weeks 48 and 96  respectively). The absolute PASI response (PASI ≤ 2) was also maintained through week 96 (94.3 percent and 93.4 percent at weeks 48 and 96  respectively) and improved for patients who switched from secukinumab to bimekizumab on entry to the OLE period (83.9 percent and 94.6 percent at weeks 48 and 96  respectively). During the OLE  the most common adverse events with bimekizumab were nasopharyngitis (11.8/100 patient-years)  oral candidiasis (7.8/100 patient-years)  and urinary tract infection (4.5/100 patient-years). Adverse events were comparable between patients continuing bimekizumab or switching from secukinumab to bimekizumab. The incidence of serious adverse events was low. These analyses included 336 patients treated with bimekizumab  and 318 patients treated with secukinumab who completed the BE RADIANT double-blinded period and switched to bimekizumab upon entering the OLE.BE RADIANT open-label extension study in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: responder analysis in patients switching from secukinumab to bimekizumab3At week 48  53/318 patients (16.7 percent) treated with secukinumab had not achieved PASI 90. After switching to bimekizumab in the OLE  responses improved. At week 96  79.2 percent of this group achieved PASI 90  and 50.9 percent achieved PASI 100. At week 48  256/318 patients (80.5 percent) treated with secukinumab had achieved PASI 90. After switching to bimekizumab in the OLE  95.2 percent of this group maintained this response at week 96  and the PASI 100 response increased from 65.2 percent at week 48 to 79.9 percent at week 96. No clinically relevant differences in safety outcomes for patients who switched from secukinumab to bimekizumab were observed from weeks 48-96.¥ Modified non-responder imputation analysesAbout the BE READY  BE VIVID and BE SURE studies and the BE BRIGHT open-label extension study6 7 8 9The efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were evaluated in three Phase 3 studies  versus placebo and ustekinumab (BE VIVID)  versus placebo (BE READY)  and versus adalimumab (BE SURE). Patients who completed one of these three Phase 3 studies were eligible to enroll in the BE BRIGHT open-label extension study.About the BE RADIANT and BE RADIANT open-label extension study10BE RADIANT was a Phase 3b  randomized  multicenter  double-blind  active-comparator-controlled  parallel-group study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab compared to secukinumab in adults with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Patients who completed the 48-week double-blinded period were able to enroll in the ongoing 96-week open-label extension  where they all received bimekizumab.About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively and directly inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.11Bimekizumab is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults  and its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email [email protected]Corporate CommunicationsAlly FunkT +1.678.365.6321email [email protected]Brand CommunicationsEimear O'BrienT +32.2.559.92.71email [email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release and it does not reflect any potential impact from the evolving COVID-19 pandemic  unless indicated otherwise. UCB is following the worldwide developments diligently to assess the financial significance of this pandemic to UCB. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Additionally  information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities  nor shall there be any offer  solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.ReferencesGordon KB  Armstrong A  Lebwohl M  et al.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi announced that detailed positive results from the Phase 3 PRIME2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent® (dupilumab) were presented today in a late-breaking session at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2022 Annual Meeting. The companies previously announced topline results from PRIME2 and a second trial  called PRIME  investigating the use of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. In both trials  Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo. In total  21 scientific abstracts evaluating the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in patients with atopic dermatitis in different age groups  as well as investigational indications of prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria will be presented at the congress.""Prurigo nodularis is a relentless and often misunderstood itchy skin disease that leaves many patients with uncontrolled symptoms such as unbearable itch and painful skin lesions  along with a significantly impaired quality of life that should not be underestimated "" said Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.  Professor of Dermatology at the Miller School of Medicine at University of Miami  Director of the Miami Itch Center and principal investigator of the trial. ""These positive results are the first time a Phase 3 trial has demonstrated that targeting key drivers of type 2 inflammation  IL-4 and IL-13  with dupilumab significantly improved itch and skin lesions in this highly burdensome disease.""The randomized  placebo-controlled PRIME2 trial met its primary and all key secondary endpoints  with data presented at AAD 2022 showing:37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline compared to 22% of placebo patients (p=0.0216) at week 12  the primary endpoint.Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at week 24: 58% of Dupixent patients compared to 20% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients achieved clear or almost clear skin at week 24: 45% of Dupixent patients compared to 16% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indications. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events were generally similar between Dupixent and placebo groups (57% Dupixent  51% placebo). Adverse events that were more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent were herpes viral infections (7% Dupixent  0% placebo). A lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (5% Dupixent  9% placebo). Additionally  3% of Dupixent patients and 30% of placebo patients discontinued prior to week 24.Results from the confirmatory PRIME trial will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Data from both trials will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis  which are planned to begin in the first half of 2022.The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long term. There are approximately 75 000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with systemic therapy and are most in need of a treatment option.About the TrialPRIME2  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  is a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 160 adults with prurigo nodularis inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or with whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 12 (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 24 and the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at week 24 (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S.  Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis  as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes  including prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  hand and foot atopic dermatitis (Phase 3)  eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

""These positive results are the first time a Phase 3 trial has demonstrated that targeting key drivers of type 2 inflammation  IL-4 and IL-13  with dupilumab significantly improved itch and skin lesions in this highly burdensome disease.""The randomized  placebo-controlled PRIME2 trial met its primary and all key secondary endpoints  with data presented at AAD 2022 showing:37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline compared to 22% of placebo patients (p=0.0216) at week 12  the primary endpoint.Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at week 24: 58% of Dupixent patients compared to 20% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients achieved clear or almost clear skin at week 24: 45% of Dupixent patients compared to 16% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indications. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events were generally similar between Dupixent and placebo groups (57% Dupixent  51% placebo). Adverse events that were more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent were herpes viral infections (7% Dupixent  0% placebo). A lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (5% Dupixent  9% placebo). Additionally  3% of Dupixent patients and 30% of placebo patients discontinued prior to week 24.Results from the confirmatory PRIME trial will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Data from both trials will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis  which are planned to begin in the first half of 2022.The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long term. There are approximately 75 000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with systemic therapy and are most in need of a treatment option.About the TrialPRIME2  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  is a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 160 adults with prurigo nodularis inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or with whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 12 (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 24 and the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at week 24 (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S.  Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis  as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes  including prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  hand and foot atopic dermatitis (Phase 3)  eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 years of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. DUPIXENT is not used to treat sudden breathing problems. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled.

As a practicing physician regularly seeing people living with this uncommon form of cancer  I am encouraged to see the potential Cabometyx may bring for these patients with so few options.”The CHMP positive opinion was based on results from the pivotal COSMIC-311 Phase III trial in which  at a planned interim analysis with a median follow-up of 6.2 months  Cabometyx demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by 78% versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.22; 96% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.36; p<0.0001).1 Another primary endpoint  the objective response rate (ORR)  also favoured Cabometyx with 15% vs. 0% for placebo (p=0.028) at a median follow-up of 8.9 months  but did not meet the criteria for statistical significance. A further analysis  with a median follow-up of 10.1 months  was presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2021  whereby Cabometyx continued to demonstrate superior median progression-free survival of 11.0 versus 1.9 months and a maintained reduction in the risk of disease progression or death of 78% versus placebo (HR: 0.22  96% confidence interval [CI]: 0.15-0.32; p<0.0001).2 The safety profile identified in the COSMIC-311 trial across the two analyses was consistent with that previously observed for Cabometyx  and adverse events were managed with dose modifications.1 2Steven Hildemann  M.D. PhD  Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Head of Global Medical Affairs and Global Patient Safety at Ipsen  said “With the promising interim results from the COSMIC-311 trial further reinforced by the maintained significant progression-free survival benefit demonstrated in the final analysis  we are pleased that the CHMP has concluded that Cabometyx may offer an important treatment option for people affected by this uncommon cancer. Following this positive opinion  we look forward to receiving the final decision from the European Commission  potentially bringing Cabometyx one step closer to reaching a patient population in critical need of new treatment options.”This positive CHMP opinion follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval in September 2021 of Cabometyx for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic DTC that has progressed following prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible.About radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAI-R DTC)In 2020  over 580 000 new cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed worldwide.3 Thyroid cancer is the ninth most commonly occurring cancer globally and incidence is three times higher in women than in men  with the disease representing one in every 20 cancers diagnosed among women.3 While cancerous thyroid tumors include differentiated  medullary and anaplastic forms  differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) makes up about 90 to 95% of cases.5 6 These include papillary  follicular and Hürthle cell cancer.5 6 DTC is typically treated with surgery  followed by ablation of the remaining thyroid tissue with radioactive iodine (RAI)  but approximately 5 to 15% of cases are resistant to RAI treatment.7 Patients who develop RAI-R DTC have a poor prognosis with an average estimated survival of three to five years.8About the COSMIC-311 trialCOSMIC-311 is a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial that enrolled258 patients at 164 sites globally.1 2 Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Cabometyx 60 mg or placebo once-daily.1 The primary endpoints were progression-free survival in the intention-totreat population as well as ORR in the first 100 randomly assigned patients (objective response rate intention-to-treat [OITT] population)  both evaluated by a blinded independent radiology committee. Additional endpoints include safety  overall survival and quality of life.1 Exelixis is the sponsor of COSMIC311  and Ipsen is co-funding the trial. More information about this trial is available at ClinicalTrials.gov.About Cabometyx (cabozantinib)In the U.S.  Cabometyx tablets are approved for the treatment of people living with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC); for the treatment of people living with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have been previously treated with sorafenib; for people living with RAI-R DTC who have been previously treated with VEGFR-targeted therapy; and for patients living with advanced RCC as a first-line treatment in combination with nivolumab.
