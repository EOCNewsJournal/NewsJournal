1586,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4497926-stellantis-creation-automotive-giant,Stellantis Stock: The Creation Of An Automotive Giant (NYSE:STLA),Stellantis laid out long-term strategic roadmap promising growth that goes to 2030. See why I believe STLA stock will retain dominance in automotive industry.,tomeng/iStock Unreleased via Getty ImagesStellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA) completed a successful merger in January 2021  when both Fiat Chrysler Automobiles  an Italian-American conglomerate with several recognized and high-end brands to its name  merged with the French PSA Group. This made the newly-formed corporation the sixth-largest automaker globally and a crucial player in the industry  given the number of brands. The company is also listed on the Italian Borsa Italiana  the Euronext Paris  and the New York Stock Exchange as STLA.tradingview.comGiven the ease of restrictions and slow resolution of the supply chain crisis  Stellantis was expected to have a stellar year  reporting gains  especially in shipments where the company's brands are recognized. A brief overview of the business and the market at large quickly reveals the company's secure financials and its leading place among the car manufacturers.Company ProfileStellantis N.V. is a recently formed car manufacturing corporation that arose from a merger between Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and PSA Group. The May 2021 50-50 cross-border merger made the company the fourth-largest automaker globally by volume. The company now manages approximately 400 000 employees spread across the multiple countries it operates in. While the company's headquarters are in Amsterdam  its operations are global  overseeing the supply of its multiple brands. The brands include Jeep  Chrysler  Peugeot  Alfa Romeo  and 12 other car brands more popular abroad than in the US. To manage such an extensive portfolio  the company has multiple assembly plants across Africa  Asia  Europe  South America  North America  and Australia.A year after the $52 billion merger  Stellantis has had enough time to manage operations  helped with the appointment of Carlos Tavares as CEO  who formerly oversaw PSA. The company will need to figure out the best way to market its different brands to different regions of the world. Different brands have appeal depending on which region of the world you are looking at  and Stellantis has a large enough portfolio to cater to many different markets. As a result  the question that remains is how well the automotive industry is doing in all markets.Automotive Industrystatista.comThe global automotive industry hit all-time highs last year by topping $2.7 trillion in revenue by the end of the year. This represents a $200 billion appreciation from the year before and is expected to rise by at least $100 billion in 2022. Technological advancements in vehicle manufacturing  such as self-driving vehicles and the transition into electric vehicles (EV)  have and will continue to contribute to the growth of the industry. With both the pressure and support to transition into cleaner energy  these will also help ensure that the industry remains unaffected by environmental concerns by providing acceptable solutions. Of course  numerous other factors contributed to growth  including the slow but sure resolution of the global supply chain crisis  among other things.Stellantis is well placed to supply the entire global market with the vehicles they need and is working towards addressing the environmental concerns that surround the automotive industry. The company is seeking to target the North American and European markets with low emission vehicles  or LEVs  manufactured by many of the company's brands. The market is expected to grow much faster in Europe  with the company estimating 14% sales in 2021 and 70% by 2030. The company's expectations for the US are expected to reach 40% LEV sales by 2030. The company's roadmap has a lot ahead of it and offers enough to show faith in the company's ability to manage changes. So how did the company perform in its first year after the merger?Financial AnalysisCar sales shot up in 2021  so it would only be natural to analyze the revenue and income Stellantis reported for that year  as these go hand in hand. The company ended the year with $164 billion in net revenue  which was not only a massive leap from the nearly $60 billion reported in 2020 but still higher than what was seen in 2019. This rapid rise came as a direct result of the merger  which saw an increase in North American shipments  which managed a total of 1.764 million shipment units in 2021. South America was reported to have shipped 811 thousand units in the same period. Still  it was Europe that took the cake  with 2.877 million units shipped  over a million more units than what North America reported. Asia  which is globally the largest market  saw a mere 216 thousand combined shipment units  highlighting the need for the corporation on other markets where it may already have an advantage. How did the company manage this influx of revenue?Research and Development (R&D) expenditure almost doubled year-to-year  growing from $2.73 billion in 2020 to $5 billion in 2021. However  it was in Sales  General  and Admin expenses the bulk of the revenue was invested in  with 2021 seeing an increase from $4.8 billion to over $10 billion in the space of 12 months. All of these chipped into what could have been the company's profit  but where necessary investments as the company ramp up production and shipments for the growing demand  while also looking to the long-term future of the company. Still  net income applicable to common shareholders was reported at over $16 billion in 2021  compared to the mere $2.5 billion the year before.nasdaq.comAll of these figures need to account for the merger  which naturally resulted in a complete shift from previous figures reported. The earnings per share consensus for 2022 is currently at $4.24 and is expected to maintain more or less the same in the following two years. In February  the company also announced a total distribution of approximately $3.7 billion from profits of the year  corresponding to about $1.14 per common share.Recent Developments and RisksStellantis has laid out a long-term strategic roadmap that goes all the way to 2030. The company's primary focus continues to be centered around Europe  with most brands either being native or familiar to that continent and the United States  where some brands are also originally from  and a select few are recognized as high-end import vehicles. For this  the company has set aside approximately $33 billion of investments through 2025. Most of this will go into the transition into smart vehicles and efficient vehicles that boast both advanced software technology and reduced emissions. Semiconductors also presented an issue throughout the past year  with the company seeing dips in sales in the third quarter due to a lack of chips  further highlighting the need to invest in better and more efficient technology. In the event that this continues  Stellantis may suffer due to its capital expenditure in ramping up production  but a bottleneck on actual production capabilities due to a lack of supply in the chip department. However  as the supply of semiconductors continues to ramp up  the issue might soon solve itself - the number of vehicles manufactured and sold will directly benefit from a resolution to this problem.In terms of other risks  Stellantis is particularly prone to economic declines. In an expanding economy  consumers buy far more newer cars than in a recession. Given that there is still significant risk of an economic downturn in the near future  this could lead to a worst-case scenario where not only do sales decline  but the loss in income for Stellantis coupled with burning its existing cash on ramping up production leads to a troubling outcome. This is  however  a risk that exists with all automakers. If anything  Stellantis is less prone than others due to its market dominance and global consumer distribution.Key TakeawaysWhether it's a crisis in Eastern Europe  a global chip shortage  a global supply chain crisis  or even a global pandemic  many issues can negatively impact any car manufacturing company. Stellantis can tackle this by doing what most smart companies have opted to do in past times of difficulty  consolidate to form a stronger group. While the merger was in the works since 2019  it nevertheless could not have come at a better time  helping the company profitably navigate from 2021 to the coming years.

With that  I will now turn the call over to Olivier.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Jeremy. Good morning and good afternoon  everyone. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of operating and financial results for the full year 2021. A special thank you also to the entire Nyxoah team for their tireless dedication and outstanding performance amid ongoing challenges posed by the COVID pandemic.I'm extremely proud of how our team has exceeded expectations in all our geographies. 2021 was an important year for Nyxoah as we accomplished numerous clinical  regulatory  commercial  and financial milestones and positioned ourself for continued execution and sustainable success in 2022 and beyond. On the clinical and regulatory front  our BETTER SLEEP study achieved its primary endpoint of statistically significant absolute reduction in AHI for the entire cohort  as well as for complete concentric collapse or CCC patients. As a result  we received an expanded CE mark indication to treat CCC patients in Europe.And the U.S. FDA granted us breakthrough device designation for CCC patients. Having achieved a 64% response rate across all cohorts at six months post-implantation  including 67 among known CCC patients  these BETTER SLEEP results help de-risk all DREAM U.S. IDE pivotal study and are giving us confidence that we are incorporating the right learnings to this critically important trial.We have a much greater understanding about patients phenotyping as we advance the dream trial  and we look forward to completing implants next quarter. Our patient-centric focus also includes our separate IDE trial for CCC patients in the U.S.  which we anticipate commencing later this year to make this technology available to the 30% of patients who are contraindicated for hypoglossal neurostimulation in the U.S. and we would know -- and who would no longer have to undergo an invasive Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy  also called DISE procedure. We also made MRI compatibility a top priority from the get-go to ensure that patients always feel safe and do not have to worry about explanting their device to undergo an MRI  of which  there are more than 40 million performed in OSA patients alone every year globally.We were therefore thrilled to secure CE mark MRI conditional labeling to ensure that patients implanted with Genio can undergo full-body 1.5T and 3T MRIs. On the commercial side  we were extremely pleased to move from the innovation budget to securing a dedicated DRG code for hypoglossal neurostimulation in Germany. We are also expanding rapidly and have generated strong demand in other European countries as we managed to secure a dedicated DRG code in Switzerland and have obtained hospital reimbursement in Spain. We are also awaiting reimbursement decisions in Belgium and the Netherlands.Our commercial strategy in Europe is based on a deep understanding of the patient journey  engaging with the implanting ENT surgeons and sleep physicians as key stakeholders in guiding OSA patients to the most appropriate therapy. Building strong relations between both referral and implanting physicians  results in the creation of a center of excellence ecosystem associated with faster therapy penetration and high patient satisfaction. On the financial side  we also successfully completed our second IPO in the span of 10 months  raising 97.8 million to our Nasdaq listing in July after raising 84.8 million euros in our Euronext Brussels IPO in September 2020. We are proud to welcome a strong group of high-quality investors to our existing U.S.and European shareholder base  and we look forward to building a roster further. More importantly  these offerings provided us with ample balance sheet liquidity  a cash balance of 135 million euros as of December 31  2021  that enables us to invest in our key clinical  R&D  and commercial priorities at this critical time for our company. I will go into more detail on each of these pillars. Let me first reiterate to you our overarching strategy.Our proprietary patient-centric Genio system is the only hypoglossal neurostimulation device that requires only one incision  which shortens procedure time to around 60 minutes and reduces the risk of infection compared to multiple incisions. It delivers bilateral stimulation  which we believe results in an expanded total addressable market  eliminates the need for patients to have to undergo the Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy procedure to determine if they have CCC or not. And last  it is compatible with both 1.5T and 3T full-body MRI. We are leveraging our strengthened balance sheet to build a growing body of clinical evidence to ensure that this technology is available to as many moderate-to-severe OSA patients as possible.Our population  that number is more than 1 million new patients per year  including more than 500 000 in the U.S. who are eligible to treat [Audio gap] with and without complete concentric collapse of the soft palate. Last June  we announced that BETTER SLEEP had achieved its primary safety and performance endpoint of statistically significant absolute reduction in baseline AHI at six months for the entire patient cohort  as well as for the non-CCC patient subgroup and  importantly  the CCC patient subgroup. This is a critical development for Nyxoah.And these clinical results  which were presented in a post at the World Sleep Congress earlier this month in Rome  represent the first body of evidence to demonstrate that bilateral hypoglossal neurostimulation can be an effective treatment for patients with CCC  who comprise approximately 30% of the moderate-to-severe OSA patient population and who are contraindicated for other hypoglossal neurostimulation options that are approved in the U.S. The study also generated a statistically significant reduction in oxygen desaturation index  or ODI  across all patient cohorts. Per the Sher criteria  as used in our DREAM U.S. pivotal study  BETTER SLEEP achieved a response rate of 64% for the entire population  60% for the CCC cohort  and 67% for the non-CCC cohort.Considering that as the growing body of clinical data and real-world experience suggest that patient response improves meaningfully between month six and month 12  these strong response rates in all patient cohorts already after six months further increase of confidence in positive outcomes for the ongoing DREAM study  whether we need to demonstrate a response rate above 65% after 12 months. We also note that the mean AHI reduction exceeded 70% among responders in both CCC and non-CCC  making them super responders. In other words  when a patient responds  the type of airway obstruction will not influence the outcomes using the Genio system. World Sleep was an outstanding success for us  as we not only present BETTER SLEEP data but also hosted a physician event entitled ""Shifting Paradigm in OSA Therapy in Genio"" that was attended by more than 55 key opinion leaders from the U.S.and Europe. It was invaluable opportunity for us to present our data directly and ask physicians questions  and we are encouraged by the growing interest and enthusiasm for hypoglossal neurostimulation in general and Genio in particular. To this end  in October  the notified body in Europe expanded our CE Mark indication to include CCC patients among those eligible to be treated with Genio. And Genio is now commercially available in Europe  and the first CCC patients have been successfully implanted in Germany.As a reminder  the ability to treat CCC patients means that all moderate-to-severe OSA patients will no longer have to undergo a DISE procedure to determine if they have CCC. In addition  the U.S. FDA in September granted Genio Breakthrough Device Designation for CCC patients  which provides us with priority review. More on -- more on this in a moment.Turning to our clinical program in the U.S.  the DREAM pivotal study. The DREAM pivotal study is our study in the U.S. that aims to  first  confirm safety and efficacy of the Genio system; and second  support marketing authorization of the Genio system in the U.S. The study plans to involve 134 moderate-to-severe OSA patients who failed first-line top treatment with 12-month efficacy and safety primary endpoint.The trial includes 16 U.S. and six international sites currently activated screening  enrolling  and implanting patients. Let me walk through to our progress on patient enrollment and the funnel that leads from initial enrollment to implantation. As of today  we have enrolled 430 patients  of whom 52 have made it through the funnel to implantation.There are additional 104 patients in active screening who underwent an initial polysomnography and are awaiting a confirmatory PSG to determine if their baseline AHI meets the minimum criteria to be implanted. Based on our experience  approximately 70% of these patients in active screening move to implantation  meaning we likely have enough patients in the funnel to complete the necessary 134 implants. And we continue to enroll new patients as we speak to fill the funnel to ensure that we have more than enough to complete the study. Of those enrolled patients who do not [Inaudible] for enrollment  they screen out because a DISE procedure indicates they have CCC  their BMI is too high  or an initial PSG determined that their AHI is not high enough.But to reiterate  we are encouraged by the pace of enrollment and by the number of patients who -- who are moving through active screening. Today  our focus is further secure our slots and making sure that the PSG -- the baseline PSG can be performed as soon as possible. Now  to be perfectly candid  we fully expected to complete implants by the end of Q1 2022  which is next week. Based on the numbers I just shared with you  we will not hit the target in the next six days.While I do not like to make excuses  it's a fact that the omicron variant caused significant disruptions for hospital  particularly with respect to surgery. Many U.S. states placed moratoriums on elective procedures  as did European countries like Germany  as well as Australia. Even as things begin to open up  the backlog of delayed surgeries meant it was increasingly difficult for surgeons to schedule OR time.We  therefore  saw very little implanting activity in December  and things gradually improved as we moved through January and into February. I'm very pleased to see the strong momentum we have built over the last six to eight weeks as more key physicians have been activated and have accelerated this pace of implantation. We are now confident that we will be able to close old implants during the second quarter  which would put us on track to have full 12-month patient follow-up data in the mid of 2023. We will have much more to say on this specific regulatory pathway as we move through this year  but we expect to pursue a model of PMA pathway that we hope will enable us to secure FDA approval of commercial launch in the U.S.in early 2024. Returning to the discussion of CCC  we have been encouraged by our sprint discussions with the FDA regarding the design of a separate IDE trial focused on CCC patients. We will call this trial ""Access with three C's "" as in CCC. And we hope to commence enrollment later this year.We will have much more to say about this trial  including sample size  design  endpoints  and timing once we have the final word from the FDA regarding our IDE submission  which we anticipate occurring before this summer. Turning now to our commercial progress for 2021. As with our other achievements in 2021  I'm extremely proud of the significant progress we made in our commercial operations. We remain committed to our strategy of going deep  as is going wide  as we focus our efforts on creating a center of excellence ecosystem with high level of clinical expertise between implanting ENT surgeons and sleep physicians  providing more treatment options to their large patient pools.We are first focused on experienced hypoglossal neurostimulation samples  with an existing OSA referral partner. Additionally  we have also managed to open new sites  feeding the funnel of new patients with a customized digital marketing strategy and targeted referral programs. Our focus remains on Germany  where we invested in building a Nyxoah dedicated sales and marketing team of 13 people in order to demonstrate our commercial proof of concept. Supported by the strong endorsement of German KOLs and ENT society  we obtained a dedicated DRG coding in 2021.As of December 31st  we were in 12 active implant sites and expect to be active in '25 before summer 2022. Next to Germany  we also made meaningful headway in other key European markets during 2021. We secured DRG code in Switzerland. We obtained hospital reimbursement in Spain.We continue to await reimbursement decisions in the Netherlands and Belgium. We also further invest in wider market access in the Nordic countries. Last  I would like to turn an update on our R&D activities. As mentioned earlier  in January 2021  we received a CE mark for MRI conditional labeling  ensuring that patients implanted with the Genio system can now undergo full-body 1.5T and 3T MRI scans.MRI compatibility is consistent with our patient-centric mission and aids in patients' quality of life  knowing that over 40 million MRI scans were performed in OSA patients globally in 2020. To date  we remain the only company with an MRI compatibility label for the full body and 3T Tesla  which is the most commonly used MRI setup. We also have submitted to the notified body in Europe and to FDA our Genio 2.1 next-generation system  which includes a new patient-centric smartphone app that will empower both the physician and the patient to track progress. This app will also empower the patients  allowing them to adjust the stimulation amplitude at home.The Genio 2.1 activation chip will integrate multiple sensors  including a position sensor to adjust stimulation levels based on sleeping position and patient movement  what would also be making our technology intelligent. We also remain focused on developing our longer-term pipeline to find new and innovative ways to treat a greater number of OSA patients. To this end  in February 2021  we announced our exclusive licensing agreement with the U.S. Vanderbilt University  allowing us access to technologies and capabilities to develop next-generation obstructive sleep apnea solutions.We are pleased that we can partner with Dr. David Kent  who is the director of the sleep surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center  to develop new neurostimulation technologies  starting with one that focused on the Ansa Cervicalis nerve stimulation. The ability to treat OSA patients in a different way will further expand treatment options for physicians  resulting in enlarging the eligible-to-treat OSA patient population. We are building first prototypes at the moment  and we will have further updates on this project later this year.Finally  I'm pleased to welcome new CFO  Loic Moreau  who joined us January 1st. I will now turn the call over to Loic for our financial discussion.Loic Moreau -- Chief Financial OfficerThank you for the warm welcome  Olivier. Good day to everyone  and thank you for joining us today. I'm thrilled to be part of the team  and I'm excited to embark on this journey with the Nyxoah team and with all our stakeholders. I will provide some highlights from our P&L and our balance sheet.For further details  please refer to our earnings press release issued earlier today and our annual report. Revenue was eight 852 000 for the full year ended December 31  2021  compared to 69 000 for the full year ended December 31  2020. The increase in revenue was attributable to the company commercialization of the Genio system  mainly in Germany  and with some contribution from Spain and Belgium. Revenue for the second half of 2021 was 497 000  a 40% increase versus the first half of the year despite headwinds related to the omicron variant during the fourth quarter  which included a moratorium on elective procedures in Germany.Total cost of goods sold for the full year 2021 was 303 000  with gross profit of 549 000  representing a gross margin of 64.4%. While we're not providing any specific guidance on gross margin for 2022 or beyond  we do expect gross margins to improve over time in line with all the neurostimulation companies as we achieve greater commercial scale. General and administrative expenses rose to 11.1 million for the full year ended December 31  2021  from 7.5 million in 2020  due primarily to increased commercial efforts in Germany and other European markets. We have also scaled up our corporate infrastructure and expect to continue adding headcount across the organization going forward.Research and development expenses increased substantially to 2.4 million in 2021  from 473 000 in 2020 after a capitalization of 3.4 million  driven by our efforts to develop the next generation of our Genio system. Clinical expenses increased to 2.7 million in 2021 from 1.1 million in 2020 after capitalization of 6.1 million euro. The increase was mainly due to: number one  the completion of the BETTER SLEEP trial implantations; second  the ongoing recruitment for the EliSA trial; and third  the initiation and ramp-up of the DREAM IDE trial in the United States. This will remain a key investment focus for us in 2022 as we work to complete DREAM implants and manage patient follow-ups.We also anticipate commencing our access IDE trial for CCC later this year. We expect that R&D and clinical expense will represent roughly two-thirds of our operating expenses in 2022. We realized a net loss of 27.6 million for the full year ended December 31  2021  compared to a net loss of 12.2 million for the 12 months ended December 31  2020. At the end of 2021  cash and cash equivalents totaled 135.5 million compared to 92.3 million euro in December 31  2020.The increase in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to net proceeds that we generated from our July 2021 initial public offering in the U.S.  in which we sold 3 260 000 ordinary shares  including Over-allotment  at a price of $30 per share. This resulted in total gross proceeds of $97.8 million before deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The increase in cash from IPO proceeds was offset by net cash flows used from operating expenses of 25.3 million euro. Based on our current cash balance and burn rate expectations  we have ample liquidity to go to U.S.commercialization in 2024. With that  I will turn the call back to Olivier.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you  Loic. In closing  I would like to reiterate my excitement for where we stand today as a company while our dedicated team has built an execution culture that produced a number of significant clinical  regulatory  commercial  and financial accomplishments in 2021. And I hope this gives you confidence in our ability to continue to execute in '22 and beyond. For '22  you can expect our full focus to remain on: first  completing the DREAM trial; next  commercial execution in Germany; and commencing our CCC IDE study in the U.S.We are also excited to begin holding quarterly conference calls in 2022. And we look forward to providing Q1 update in May. This concludes the formal part of our presentation. Operator  I will turn the call over to you to begin our Q&A session.Thank you very much.Questions & Answers:Operator[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.Adam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystGreat. Hi  Olivier. Hi  Loic. Congrats on the progress last year and thanks for taking the questions here.Maybe  just to start  we can talk about the U.S. pivotal trial  the DREAM study. Recognize  you know  some of the challenges that COVID-19 has presented  and you're certainly not the only medical technology company to be impacted here. But maybe just talk about the level of confidence in delivering against the revised expectation being done with implants in Q2.What informs that confidence given  I think  the math implies you need to implant 82 patients in the second quarter. And then maybe just talk a little bit more specifically about the trends you're seeing in the trial in recent weeks. I mean  it sounds like you're pleased with the recent momentum  but was hoping you could put a finer point on that. And then I had a follow-up or two.Thanks.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you for the question  Adam. So  today  as I already pointed it out  we are at the 52 implants. So  the calculation is correct that we need to do a little bit more than 80. What is giving us confidence is the fact that the lot of progress made on the enrollment with more than four -- almost 30 patients enrolled.But I think more important is when we drill down one step further in this funnel  having over 100 patients that  in fact  already passed DISE  that passed the first PSG  and that more are waiting for their baseline PSG. As I mentioned  we calculate roughly 70  but I think it can also be a little bit higher. It's a little bit some specific  but the 70% up to 75% of those that will end up in doing and then getting an implant. So  what we see today  enrollment  what is in the funnel  what already has been done  we should be good to reach 134 implants.Now  the other sites that I would like to point out is that  currently  we really have 16 U.S. sites fully up and running on doing implants. Now  what the team did great is they started also finding and going after solutions in order to secure OR time slots and also to collaborate with specialized speed labs to have an acceleration in getting PSGs done where we have the patients that are waiting in the funnel. So  if you combine all this  the focus on already looking OR time  getting more sleep labs to perform PSGs  and having the patient base already in the funnel  passing the first screen out where we lose them on DISE  on BMI  also are not being monitored.That gives us a lot of confidence that we will be able to close by the end of Q2.Adam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystOK. That's really helpful. And maybe just to clarify  it sounds like  in terms of baseline PSGs and securing OR time  it sounds like you have some visibility as we look ahead  and that kind of informs the confidence and expectation that you'll be able to complete implants in Q2. Am I thinking about that? Or did I hear that right  Olivier?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerWell  that is correct. So  and then -- and when we look at the different samples that we are having  our team is  of course  in close and daily contact with them. And we also are introducing some dashboards when we secure the OR time  what patient will go into this funnel. So  there is a concrete execution focus on getting them implanted.Adam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystOK. OK. Very helpful. Thank you.And then for my next question  wanted to ask just a little bit more  you know  broad strokes on on the back-half commercial performance back-half '21  and then thus far into 2022. Just curious to get more color on how that trajectory has looked. I think it would just be helpful to get some baseline for our models. We think about forecasting here in 2022.So  any color there you could provide  Olivier or Loic  would be very appreciated.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerSo  first  I would like to really point out that our commercial proof of concept  we have a full focus on Germany. So  when we are talking about numbers  about implant  it's really focused on Germany. And that's also how we have defined our future success by becoming market leader in the German market. So  coming back second half of the year  more specifically Q4  we were really impacted by omicron.And I am -- I think I'm not the only one who is making that statement. I hate to use that as an excuse  but sometimes  when it's a fact  it's a fact. You know  what we saw during this time is that the team really did a strong job in continuing  identifying  and positioning of technology in new sites. And that will result that we will have up to 25 sites before summer this year.Today  we have 12 who will be doubling the number of sites in the coming four months. And all those sites are identified and the conversations are ongoing. And we are setting them up to do successful Genio employment. That's the first thing.The second thing is -- and without disclosing  I really  really -- and the implant rate or revenue that we see a very strong traction in Q1. And as I mentioned  we are now aligning  also doing Q1 or quarterly earnings calls  so it may be significant. I will be more than happy to further update you with precise numbers on the Q1 activity. But we are really feeling confident  and we're also seeing that specifically in Germany  again  the COVID days are really are the -- really behind  and things are returning back to normal.So  that's the second thing. The third thing is we significantly invested in the data and digital marketing activities and in really fine-tuning and further filling the funnel of referral patients. So  those are the three things we are doing. And I will be very happy to come back to Q1 and telling you the progress we made with specific numbers.Adam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystOK. Understood. We'll stay tuned there. And it's encouraging to hear.It sounds like Q1 is off to a good start  so appreciate that commentary. And then maybe just one last one for me and I'll jump back in the queue. But I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the accounts that you're in today in Germany. Just any early learnings there  Olivier  you know  how are clinicians utilizing Genio  how are they splitting -- or are they splitting between devices or are they picking one device over the other? You know  I know it's relatively early still  but just curious about how your customers and physicians are utilizing the product at their respective practices.Thanks so much for taking the questions.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerSo  I -- first of all  what we hear back overall is that the physicians are extremely pleased to have an alternative or to have a choice within hypoglossal neurostimulation. So far  there was only one option they could propose to patients. And today  they have two options. And this is really something that we are hearing back as a great win  also to address more patients and some patients that may be in the past would be lost hypoglossal neurostimulation.That's the one thing  having the option to choose. Second  what we also are hearing back is by not having the battery implanted  it gives them also a lot of -- or shall I say  a lot of convincing power with patients who are a little bit afraid of surgery. Yet  we stay with a single incision procedure: 60 minutes  skin-to-skin time. It goes fast.And patients that are afraid of surgery are more open also to accept hypoglossal neurostimulation. And then last  what we are hearing back is the scalable software platform that we are offering with patient application  with the opportunity to interact without seeing the patients physically. So  I think those are the three major learnings. We are broadening the number of patients eligible to treat hypoglossal neurostimulation by giving physicians a choice.We see that by making it less invasive  only one procedure  it helps also convincing patients that are a little bit afraid of surgery. And last  with a scalable technology platform  this is also -- and being able to monitor patients without seeing them physically is really a big win.Adam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystVery helpful. Thanks again for taking the questions.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerWith pleasure.OperatorThank you. Our next call -- question comes from Jon Block with Stifel. Your line is open.Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystGreat. Thanks  guys. Good morning. Olivier  maybe the first one for you.And I'll start on DREAM as well. The 104 in active screening  and then I think you said 70% in active screening usually go to implants. And I just want to focus there for a second. Is there any color -- you know  thinking about like the timing of those in active screening to get the implant where then the 12-month clock starts? Is that a one-month process  a three-month process? Just as many details that you can give.Because it's a big number  the 104. That's a high percentage  the 70%. But maybe if you can talk to the timeline that usually accompanies that process would be very helpful.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerNo  Jon  this is really an excellent question. And to answer this  first  I have to say  this is really site-specific. So  when we talk -- when we look at some sites  it's a question of a couple of weeks to push them through. Where in another site  it's a question of a couple of months to push them through.But on average  we are seeing that in order to do this  we are talking about five to six weeks. So  after doing the baseline PSG to the implant  it's five to six weeks on average. But no  as I mentioned before  of course  the challenge of our team and the focus of our team is to shorten those push-through timelines to a maximum and to also incorporate the learnings from sites after doing this in a couple of weeks. But on average  five to six -- five to six weeks  the fastest one.A couple of weeks  the slowest one  they go all the way up to two months.Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystOK. That's very helpful. So  maybe to your point  it's five to six weeks. It gives you the high conviction that you're across the goal line  so to say  by the end of the second quarter where we extrapolate that back to the 104 -- the 70% of the 104.Got it. And then just to pivot a little bit  you know  I believe -- and I might be mistaken. But I believe your filings calls out for SAEs in DREAM. And  you know  I think  one  is that correct? And two  much more importantly  are any of those device-related or any color that you're able to provide in those SAEs? And I ask because I want to be clear  you know  per Inspire's STAR study  well  you know that SAEs are not uncommon at all.But they're called out a lot for device-related. So  maybe if you could comment on that  you know  the number. And then any color you can provide on those would be helpful.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerNo  it's correct. So  having a phase is not uncommon. And I think it's like -- it's something that also surgeons and companies are learning from. In our study  we see that there is no higher number of SAEs than you would expect with other studies.So  the four that you're referring to  at this moment  there are still  I think -- let me try to be precise. I think there are still two that need to be further determined whether it is device-related or procedure-related. So far  what we saw was not device-related  the two that are still under examination. It will become -- it will become more clear going forward.But I also would like to go back to the BETTER SLEEP study and even do our BLAST OSA study when it comes to SAEs  and pointing out that also there  we saw nothing abnormal to say it like this. We had a low number  most of them resolved after time or related to the procedure. And if you put this into perspective in all the studies  it was completely compatible. So  we expect no difference at all in the DREAM study.Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystOK. I'm sorry. Just to -- for clarity purposes  of the four that we know of  two have been defined as not device-related  and two are so-called TBD  to be determined.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThat is correct.Jon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystOK  great. And last question. Just  you know  to go over to the commercial side of things  maybe just look  you've got  you know  the expanded indication for CCC or the contraindication taken away. And it's a big move.And you can treat a whole other subset of patients. And you can do it without the DISE. Just at a high level  if you can talk to what those active centers -- you know  there's 12 centers are -- or tell you how maybe the feedback has changed since you've been able to treat that whole other subset of patients and  you know  how you think you can build upon that momentum into '22 and beyond. And that's it.Thanks for your time  guys.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerMmm hmm. So  first  it was great to be able to talk and interact with all the 50 implant surgeons during the World Sleep Congress in Rome and also talking about this question. And [Audio gap] We had the first CCC patient implant commercially in Germany. It has simply to do with the effect that we had to wait for the IFU to be adopted and also to give some time to talk and position this with physicians.I think we can go to the next in line. What I thought John was saying  it was his last question.OperatorOK. Our next question comes from Laura Roba with Degroof Petercam. Your line is open.Laura Roba -- Degroof Petercam -- AnalystYes. Good. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking my question.Thank you for the presentation. Um  one question from my side regarding about the opex trend going forward. You mentioned in the press release this morning further investments to be made in the accounts  ahead of the U.S. commercial launch.Could you provide more granularity on that in terms of timing  for example?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerI will -- I will give this one to our CFO.Loic Moreau -- Chief Financial OfficerYes. Absolutely. So  in 2022  this year  we expect to increase headcount mainly in clinical and R&D. We are starting with peak commercialization in U.S.but very lightly this year  as you can imagine. And we would accelerate only when we would have more visibility on the DREAM data and the 12 months which is planned mid-2023. So  you can expect opex increase for the next 12 months. And then based on DREAM data  we will see what level of investment is required to make a successful launch in U.S.in the second half of 2023. That's how we're looking at this.Laura Roba -- Degroof Petercam -- AnalystOK. Thank you. And then another question regarding the number of active sites. So  am I wrong here? Because I think that in H1  you already announced 12 active sites.Does it mean that there were no new active sites in H2?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerSo I think you're referring to Germany.Laura Roba -- Degroof Petercam -- AnalystExactly  yeah.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd that is -- yup. No. And that is correct. That is correct  Laura.So  we opened the first 12 sites. We focused on what we called Tier 1 or high volume sites. In the second half  we identified the service. But the omicron variant came in in Q4.And we really dedicated a focus  in fact  on the ones that were activated. And that's also why you will be seeing -- but  no  you make me say things that I want to save for Q1. But that's why you will also see the acceleration in the first quarter --Laura Roba -- Degroof Petercam -- AnalystOK.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerIn opening more new sites with activity in Germany.Laura Roba -- Degroof Petercam -- AnalystOK. Good to know. Many thanks.OperatorThank you. And we have a question from Ross Osborn with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystHi. Good morning  and congrats on the progress. So  I guess just a couple of questions on cost. I know you have that formal gross margin guidance  but could you walk through some of the headwinds and tailwinds you saw during the second half of 2021 and just how that's progressing year to date  and how you think that's going to shape out for the rest of the year.Loic Moreau -- Chief Financial OfficerYeah. So  we have a gross margin in '22 of 64.4 million -- sorry  64.4%.This was broadly in line with H1 one. We are not providing guidance for 2020 -- we are not providing guidance for 2022. But as we reach greater scale in terms of -- and volumes  basically  we expect the gross margin to increase substantially and be in line with the -- all the neurostimulation companies.So  progressively '23 -- '22  '23  it will increase gradually as our volume increases.Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystOK. And then I guess.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerAnd just maybe --Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystSorry. Go ahead.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerNo  sorry. And I want to maybe just add something to this one as well. If you look at our technology where we do not have an implantable pulse generator  which is the highest cost if you look at the total implant also there  we are really feeling confident that we are aiming and we will be ending up more in second time  let's say 85-plus percent gross margins. So  that's where our aim is in going forward  in line  of course  with -- goes hand-in-hand with the volume increase.Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystOK. Great. That's helpful. And then I guess just on the opex  did you sort through some of maybe the marketing activities that you currently have going on and maybe any new ones that are going to come out in 2022.And then lastly  can we just talk about maybe some rep hires planned for this year?Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerYeah. So  in terms of marketing cost  this is mainly related to our activities in Europe  specifically in Germany. So we have our team of 13 that's in Germany  and we have digital marketing so indirectly visiting customers  and we are digital marketing as well. So  we will be spending slightly in other countries in Europe.But this is the majority of the team we have in headcount and in Europe for the time being. Maybe on addition to this  do we plan to further hire new headcount? This goes hand-in-hand with the market access or the reimbursement in countries. As I mentioned before  we are waiting Belgium  Netherlands  Nordic countries. We saw that we also made our first hospital budget securitization in Spain.So  important for Nyxoah that we have a dedicated salesforce. And the moment we have a good view on obtaining reimbursement in a specific country  of course  we start hiring  and we will further expand. So  concrete  yes  you can expect  let's say  five to six additional headcount in Europe. And what we already touched on also  in the pre-commercialization for the U.S.  that we want to make sure that we are also making the needed investments in headcount  like for example  a market access director in the U.S.  preparing -- and already preparing the landscape for future reimbursement in the U.S.as well.Ross Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystSounds great. Congrats again. And thanks for taking my questions.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerThank you.OperatorThank you. And that's all the questions I have. I would like to turn it back to Olivier Taelman for closing remarks.Olivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerYes  thank you. And the closing remarks will be very short. So  first of all  thank you for joining us again. Thanks for the great questions.Thank you very much and looking forward to update you again in the near future. In the near future will be our Q1 earnings call that we will be hosting on May 10th. So  within six weeks  if I'm not mistaken. Thank you  and enjoy the rest of the day.Operator[Operator signoff]Duration: 53 minutesCall participants:Jeremy Feffer -- Vice President  Investor RelationsOlivier Taelman -- Chief Executive OfficerLoic Moreau -- Chief Financial OfficerAdam Maeder -- Piper Sandler -- AnalystJon Block -- Stifel Financial Corp. -- AnalystLaura Roba -- Degroof Petercam -- AnalystRoss Osborn -- Cantor Fitzgerald -- AnalystMore NYXH analysisAll earnings call transcripts",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.62,0.2,0.18,True,English,"['Q4 2021 Earnings Call Transcript', 'Nyxoah S.A.', 'NYXH', 'DREAM U.S. IDE pivotal study', 'CE mark MRI conditional labeling', 'Nyxoah full year 2021 earnings conference call', 'expanded CE mark indication', 'invasive Drug-Induced Sleep Endoscopy', 'full year financial results', 'BETTER SLEEP study', 'separate IDE trial', 'Nyxoah S.A.', 'U.S. markets', 'U.S. FDA', 'chief executive officer', 'risk factors sections', 'significant absolute reduction', 'complete concentric collapse', 'dedicated DRG code', 'other European countries', 'implanting ENT surgeons', 'Q4 2021 Earnings Call', 'chief financial officer', 'BETTER SLEEP results', 'breakthrough device designation', 'entire Nyxoah team', 'investor relations section', 'investor relations website', 'dream trial', 'important year', 'financial milestones', 'MRI compatibility', 'entire cohort', 'actual results', 'important trial', 'Call Participants', 'events section', 'Prepared Remarks', 'vice president', 'Good morning', 'good afternoon', 'Loic Moreau', 'second half', 'answer session', 'press release', 'market trends', 'various assumptions', 'available information', 'undue reliance', 'Form 20-F', 'Exchange Commission', 'special thank', 'tireless dedication', 'ongoing challenges', 'COVID pandemic', 'continued execution', 'sustainable success', 'regulatory front', 'primary endpoint', '64% response rate', 'six months', 'right learnings', 'greater understanding', 'patient-centric focus', 'hypoglossal neurostimulation', 'full-body 1.5T', '3T MRIs', 'commercial side', 'innovation budget', 'strong demand', 'hospital reimbursement', 'reimbursement decisions', 'commercial strategy', 'deep understanding', 'patient journey', 'key stakeholde', 'Jeremy Feffer', 'Olivier Taelman', 'future events', 'CCC patients', 'OSA patients', 'operating activities', 'looking statements', 'current estimates', 'material risks', 'outstanding performance', 'NYXH', 'Contents', 'Questions', 'Answers', 'Operator', 'speaker', 'Catherine', 'everyone', 'company', 'March', 'expectations', 'predictions', 'forward', 'uncertainties', 'obligation', 'list', 'description', 'business', 'Securities', 'discussion', 'geographies', 'clinical', 'AHI', 'cohorts', 'implantation', 'confidence', 'implants', 'technology', 'Genio', 'Germany', 'Switzerland', 'Spain', 'Belgium', 'Netherlands', 'physicians', '2022', '40']",2022-03-25,2022-03-27,fool.com
1588,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-breaking-phase-3-140000922.html,Press release: Late-breaking Phase 3 data at AAD 2022 show Dupixent® (dupilumab) significantly improved signs and symptoms of prurigo nodularis,Late-breaking Phase 3 data at AAD 2022 show Dupixent® (dupilumab) significantly improved signs and symptoms of prurigo nodularis Dupixent significantly...,Sanofi - Aventis GroupeLate-breaking Phase 3 data at AAD 2022 show Dupixent® (dupilumab) significantly improved signs and symptoms of prurigo nodularisDupixent significantly reduced itch at 12 weeks  and at 24 weeks nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced clinically meaningful reductions in itch and skin lesionsThere are currently no approved systemic treatments for prurigo nodularis; regulatory filings for prurigo nodularis planned in the first half of 2022Paris and Tarrytown  N.Y. March 26  2022. Detailed positive results from the Phase 3 PRIME2 trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Dupixent® (dupilumab) was presented today in a late-breaking session at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2022 Annual Meeting. The companies previously announced topline results from PRIME2 and a second trial called PRIME investigating the use of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. In both trials  Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo. In total  21 scientific abstracts evaluating the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in patients with atopic dermatitis in different age groups  as well as investigational indications – prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria – will be presented at the congress.Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.Professor of Dermatology  Miller School of Medicine  University of Miami  and principal investigator of the PRIME2 trial“Prurigo nodularis is a relentless and often misunderstood itchy skin disease that leaves many patients with uncontrolled symptoms such as unbearable itch and painful skin lesions  along with a significantly impaired quality of life that should not be underestimated. These positive results are the first time a Phase 3 trial has demonstrated that targeting key drivers of type 2 inflammation  IL-4 and IL-13  with dupilumab significantly improved itch and skin lesions in this highly burdensome disease.”The randomized  placebo-controlled PRIME2 trial met primary and all key secondary endpoints with data presented at AAD 2022 showing:Story continues37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline compared to 22% of placebo patients (p=0.0216) at week 12  the primary endpoint.Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at week 24: 58% of Dupixent patients compared to 20% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients achieved clear or almost clear skin at week 24: 45% of Dupixent patients compared to 16% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indications. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events were generally similar between Dupixent and placebo groups (57% Dupixent  51% placebo). Adverse events that were more commonly ( > 5%) observed with Dupixent were herpes viral infections (7% Dupixent  0% placebo). A lower rate of skin infections were observed with Dupixent (5% Dupixent  9% placebo). Additionally  3% of Dupixent patients and 30% of placebo patients discontinued prior to week 24.Results from the confirmatory PRIME trial will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Data from both trials will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis  which are planned to begin in the first half of 2022.The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long term. There are approximately 75 000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with systemic therapy and are most in need of a treatment option.About the TrialPRIME2  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  is a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 160 adults with prurigo nodularis inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or with whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 12 (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 24 and the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at week 24 (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S.  Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis  as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied in more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes  including prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  hand and foot atopic dermatitis (Phase 3)  eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi announced that detailed positive results from the Phase 3 PRIME2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent® (dupilumab) were presented today in a late-breaking session at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2022 Annual Meeting. The companies previously announced topline results from PRIME2 and a second trial  called PRIME  investigating the use of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. In both trials  Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo. In total  21 scientific abstracts evaluating the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in patients with atopic dermatitis in different age groups  as well as investigational indications of prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria will be presented at the congress.""Prurigo nodularis is a relentless and often misunderstood itchy skin disease that leaves many patients with uncontrolled symptoms such as unbearable itch and painful skin lesions  along with a significantly impaired quality of life that should not be underestimated "" said Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.  Professor of Dermatology at the Miller School of Medicine at University of Miami  Director of the Miami Itch Center and principal investigator of the trial. ""These positive results are the first time a Phase 3 trial has demonstrated that targeting key drivers of type 2 inflammation  IL-4 and IL-13  with dupilumab significantly improved itch and skin lesions in this highly burdensome disease.""Story continuesThe randomized  placebo-controlled PRIME2 trial met its primary and all key secondary endpoints  with data presented at AAD 2022 showing:37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline compared to 22% of placebo patients (p=0.0216) at week 12  the primary endpoint.Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at week 24: 58% of Dupixent patients compared to 20% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients achieved clear or almost clear skin at week 24: 45% of Dupixent patients compared to 16% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indications. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events were generally similar between Dupixent and placebo groups (57% Dupixent  51% placebo). Adverse events that were more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent were herpes viral infections (7% Dupixent  0% placebo). A lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (5% Dupixent  9% placebo). Additionally  3% of Dupixent patients and 30% of placebo patients discontinued prior to week 24.Results from the confirmatory PRIME trial will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Data from both trials will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis  which are planned to begin in the first half of 2022.The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long term. There are approximately 75 000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with systemic therapy and are most in need of a treatment option.About the TrialPRIME2  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  is a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 160 adults with prurigo nodularis inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or with whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 12 (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 24 and the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at week 24 (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S.  Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis  as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes  including prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  hand and foot atopic dermatitis (Phase 3)  eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

The platform presentation details new analysis of pooled data from five bimekizumab Phase 3/3b clinical trials  which showed that over 80 percent of patients who achieved complete skin clearance (PASI 100) at week 16 and entered the open-label extension (OLE) studies maintained this response through two years  and no new safety signals were identified.1Among the poster presentations  new data from the OLE period of the Phase 3b BE RADIANT study showed that clinical responses (PASI 100 and absolute PASI  PASI ≤2) achieved at week 48 were maintained through week 96 with continuous treatment with bimekizumab and improved for patients who switched from secukinumab to bimekizumab on entry to the OLE.2 3 Patients who were PASI 90 non-responders with secukinumab at week 48 achieved improved clinical responses (PASI 90 and PASI 100) after switching to bimekizumab in the OLE.3 Among patients who were PASI 90 responders with secukinumab at week 48  PASI 90 response was maintained and PASI 100 response increased following switch to bimekizumab in the OLE.3Bimekizumab is an investigational product and is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The safety and efficacy and safety have not been established. In the European Union and Great Britain  bimekizumab is the first selective IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor to be approved for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.4 5""Long-term complete skin clearance is an important goal for people with psoriasis  and the new 96-week data from the open-label extension period of the BE RADIANT study offer fresh insights on the sustained response and clinical potential of bimekizumab in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis "" said Bruce Strober  M.D.  Ph.D.  Clinical Professor  Department of Dermatology  Yale University School of Medicine  New Haven  CT  U.S.  and Central Connecticut Dermatology Research  Cromwell  CT  U.S. ""In addition  the improved clinical responses seen in patients who switched to bimekizumab after 48 weeks of treatment with secukinumab offer further new insights that should help to inform future clinical practice.""Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S.  UCB  said: ""We are pleased to share our latest long-term data on bimekizumab with the dermatology community at the 2022 AAD Annual Meeting. The wealth of new data  insights and progress being presented underlines our commitment to advances in psoriasis care for people living with this challenging  life-long condition.""Phase 3/3b studies: two-year pooled data for bimekizumab in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis1¥Data were pooled from the BE VIVID  BE READY  and BE SURE Phase 3 trials  the Phase 3b BE RADIANT trial and OLE (48 weeks)  and the first year of the BE BRIGHT OLE study. Analysis evaluated PASI 100 maintenance through two years (OLE 48 weeks) among PASI 100 week 16 responders who entered the respective OLE studies and received continuous bimekizumab maintenance dosing from week 16 (320 mg every four weeks [Q4W/Q4W/Q4W] or Q4W/Q8W/Q8W). At week 16  62.4 percent of bimekizumab-treated patients (n=1 362) achieved PASI 100. Of those who entered the OLEs  85.1 percent (Q4W/Q4W/Q4W; n=316) and 83.8 percent (Q4W/Q8W/Q8W; n=267) maintained PASI 100 at year two (OLE week 48). The exposure-adjusted incidence rates (EAIRs) of overall and serious treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 192.7 and 5.9. The most common TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (EAIR of 18.4)  oral candidiasis (13.0)  and upper respiratory tract infections (7.8). Almost all cases of oral candidiasis (98.1 percent) were mild or moderate.BE RADIANT open-label extension study in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: efficacy and safety data through 96 weeks2Complete skin clearance (PASI 100) levels observed with bimekizumab in the BE RADIANT study were maintained in the OLE through week 96 (74.8 percent and 70.6 percent at weeks 48 and 96  respectively) and improved for patients who switched from secukinumab to bimekizumab on entry to the OLE period at week 48 (52.8 percent and 76.1 percent at weeks 48 and 96  respectively). The absolute PASI response (PASI ≤ 2) was also maintained through week 96 (94.3 percent and 93.4 percent at weeks 48 and 96  respectively) and improved for patients who switched from secukinumab to bimekizumab on entry to the OLE period (83.9 percent and 94.6 percent at weeks 48 and 96  respectively). During the OLE  the most common adverse events with bimekizumab were nasopharyngitis (11.8/100 patient-years)  oral candidiasis (7.8/100 patient-years)  and urinary tract infection (4.5/100 patient-years). Adverse events were comparable between patients continuing bimekizumab or switching from secukinumab to bimekizumab. The incidence of serious adverse events was low. These analyses included 336 patients treated with bimekizumab  and 318 patients treated with secukinumab who completed the BE RADIANT double-blinded period and switched to bimekizumab upon entering the OLE.BE RADIANT open-label extension study in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: responder analysis in patients switching from secukinumab to bimekizumab3At week 48  53/318 patients (16.7 percent) treated with secukinumab had not achieved PASI 90. After switching to bimekizumab in the OLE  responses improved. At week 96  79.2 percent of this group achieved PASI 90  and 50.9 percent achieved PASI 100. At week 48  256/318 patients (80.5 percent) treated with secukinumab had achieved PASI 90. After switching to bimekizumab in the OLE  95.2 percent of this group maintained this response at week 96  and the PASI 100 response increased from 65.2 percent at week 48 to 79.9 percent at week 96. No clinically relevant differences in safety outcomes for patients who switched from secukinumab to bimekizumab were observed from weeks 48-96.¥ Modified non-responder imputation analysesAbout the BE READY  BE VIVID and BE SURE studies and the BE BRIGHT open-label extension study6 7 8 9The efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were evaluated in three Phase 3 studies  versus placebo and ustekinumab (BE VIVID)  versus placebo (BE READY)  and versus adalimumab (BE SURE). Patients who completed one of these three Phase 3 studies were eligible to enroll in the BE BRIGHT open-label extension study.About the BE RADIANT and BE RADIANT open-label extension study10BE RADIANT was a Phase 3b  randomized  multicenter  double-blind  active-comparator-controlled  parallel-group study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab compared to secukinumab in adults with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Patients who completed the 48-week double-blinded period were able to enroll in the ongoing 96-week open-label extension  where they all received bimekizumab.About bimekizumabBimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively and directly inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.11Bimekizumab is currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults  and its efficacy and safety have not been established for any indication in the U.S.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email [email protected]Corporate CommunicationsAlly FunkT +1.678.365.6321email [email protected]Brand CommunicationsEimear O'BrienT +32.2.559.92.71email [email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi announced that detailed positive results from the Phase 3 PRIME2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent® (dupilumab) were presented today in a late-breaking session at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2022 Annual Meeting. The companies previously announced topline results from PRIME2 and a second trial  called PRIME  investigating the use of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. In both trials  Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo. In total  21 scientific abstracts evaluating the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in patients with atopic dermatitis in different age groups  as well as investigational indications of prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria will be presented at the congress.""Prurigo nodularis is a relentless and often misunderstood itchy skin disease that leaves many patients with uncontrolled symptoms such as unbearable itch and painful skin lesions  along with a significantly impaired quality of life that should not be underestimated "" said Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.  Professor of Dermatology at the Miller School of Medicine at University of Miami  Director of the Miami Itch Center and principal investigator of the trial. ""These positive results are the first time a Phase 3 trial has demonstrated that targeting key drivers of type 2 inflammation  IL-4 and IL-13  with dupilumab significantly improved itch and skin lesions in this highly burdensome disease.""The randomized  placebo-controlled PRIME2 trial met its primary and all key secondary endpoints  with data presented at AAD 2022 showing:37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline compared to 22% of placebo patients (p=0.0216) at week 12  the primary endpoint.Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at week 24: 58% of Dupixent patients compared to 20% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients achieved clear or almost clear skin at week 24: 45% of Dupixent patients compared to 16% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indications. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events were generally similar between Dupixent and placebo groups (57% Dupixent  51% placebo). Adverse events that were more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent were herpes viral infections (7% Dupixent  0% placebo). A lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (5% Dupixent  9% placebo). Additionally  3% of Dupixent patients and 30% of placebo patients discontinued prior to week 24.Results from the confirmatory PRIME trial will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Data from both trials will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis  which are planned to begin in the first half of 2022.The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long term. There are approximately 75 000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with systemic therapy and are most in need of a treatment option.About the TrialPRIME2  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  is a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 160 adults with prurigo nodularis inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or with whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 12 (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 24 and the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at week 24 (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S.  Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis  as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb™ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes  including prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  hand and foot atopic dermatitis (Phase 3)  eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 years of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. DUPIXENT is not used to treat sudden breathing problems. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis under 18 years of age.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR U.S. PATIENTSDo not use if you are allergic to dupilumab or to any of the ingredients in DUPIXENT®.Before using DUPIXENT  tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions  including if you:-- have eye problems-- have a parasitic (helminth) infection-- are scheduled to receive any vaccinations.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi announced that detailed positive results from the Phase 3 PRIME2 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent® (dupilumab) were presented today in a late-breaking session at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2022 Annual Meeting. The companies previously announced topline results from PRIME2 and a second trial  called PRIME  investigating the use of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled prurigo nodularis. In both trials  Dupixent significantly reduced itch and skin lesions compared to placebo. In total  21 scientific abstracts evaluating the safety and efficacy of Dupixent in patients with atopic dermatitis in different age groups  as well as investigational indications of prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria will be presented at the congress.""Prurigo nodularis is a relentless and often misunderstood itchy skin disease that leaves many patients with uncontrolled symptoms such as unbearable itch and painful skin lesions  along with a significantly impaired quality of life that should not be underestimated "" said Gil Yosipovitch  M.D.  Professor of Dermatology at the Miller School of Medicine at University of Miami  Director of the Miami Itch Center and principal investigator of the trial. ""These positive results are the first time a Phase 3 trial has demonstrated that targeting key drivers of type 2 inflammation  IL-4 and IL-13  with dupilumab significantly improved itch and skin lesions in this highly burdensome disease.""The randomized  placebo-controlled PRIME2 trial met its primary and all key secondary endpoints  with data presented at AAD 2022 showing:37% of Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline compared to 22% of placebo patients (p=0.0216) at week 12  the primary endpoint.Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients experienced a clinically meaningful reduction in itch from baseline at week 24: 58% of Dupixent patients compared to 20% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).Nearly three times as many Dupixent patients achieved clear or almost clear skin at week 24: 45% of Dupixent patients compared to 16% of placebo patients (p<0.0001).The safety results of the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved dermatology indications. For the 24-week treatment period  overall rates of adverse events were generally similar between Dupixent and placebo groups (57% Dupixent  51% placebo). Adverse events that were more commonly (≥5%) observed with Dupixent were herpes viral infections (7% Dupixent  0% placebo). A lower rate of skin infections was observed with Dupixent (5% Dupixent  9% placebo). Additionally  3% of Dupixent patients and 30% of placebo patients discontinued prior to week 24.Results from the confirmatory PRIME trial will be presented at an upcoming medical congress. Data from both trials will form the basis of regulatory submissions around the world for Dupixent in prurigo nodularis  which are planned to begin in the first half of 2022.The potential use of Dupixent in prurigo nodularis is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Prurigo NodularisPeople with prurigo nodularis experience intense  persistent itch  with thick skin lesions (called nodules) that can cover most of the body. Prurigo nodularis is often described as painful with burning  stinging and tingling of the skin. The impact of uncontrolled prurigo nodularis on quality of life is one of the highest among inflammatory skin diseases due to the extreme itch and is comparable to other debilitating chronic diseases that can negatively affect mental health  activities of daily living and social interactions. High-potency topical steroids are commonly prescribed but are associated with safety risks if used long term. There are approximately 75 000 people in the U.S. who are unable to control their disease with systemic therapy and are most in need of a treatment option.About the TrialPRIME2  part of the LIBERTY-PN PRIME clinical program  is a randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in 160 adults with prurigo nodularis inadequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or with whom those therapies were not advisable. During the 24-week treatment period  patients received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks with or without topical treatments (low- or medium-dose topical corticosteroids or topical calcineurin inhibitors were continued if patients were using these treatments at randomization).The primary endpoint evaluated the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 12 (measured by a ≥4-point reduction in Worst-Itch Numeric Rating Scale [WI-NRS] of 0-10). Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients with clinically meaningful improvement in itch at week 24 and the proportion of patients with clear or almost clear skin at week 24 (measured by a score of 0 or 1 on the Investigator's Global Assessment PN-Stage [IGA PN-S] 0-4 scale).About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).Dupixent is currently approved in the U.S.  Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis  as well as certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies.

Its patented Liquid Natural Clay (LNC) enables sustainable ecosystem management by restoring and protecting soil's ability to preserve water and increase yields for agriculture  forests  and green landscapes. LNC enables sand and degraded soil to retain water and nutrients  thus increasing crop yields and ecosystem resilience while preserving water resources by up to 50%. Agriculture and food production already consume more than 70% of all available freshwater. Desertification and soil degradation further increases water consumption in a negative spiral. Our growing global population will require more food in the next 40 years than was produced over the last 500 years  putting even more pressure on vital resources such as water. This is the problem Desert Control is determined to solve. According to the United Nations   twelve million hectares of fertile land perish to desertification  representing an annual $490 billion loss to the global economy.

The inspectorates’ report allows to conclude that there is no such thing as an organised ""system"" that would result in generalised mistreatment and clearly denies some of the most shocking allegations contained in the book The GravediggersConcerning an alleged rationing of incontinence products   the investigation "" has not identified any major anomaly in the supply of incontinence products "" and states that "" the recent feedback from the French Regional Health Agencies does not show any organised system for rationing of incontinence products "".  the investigation "" "" and states that "" "".

The investigation considers that the percentage of residents with one or more pressure sore dressings (3.42%) "" "". The number of coordinating doctors in Orpea's nursing homes is well above the sector average: they are present in 82% of our facilities versus 67% in the sector as a whole2.3. Some complaints in the report call for ORPEA’s commentsA. Concerning quality and careOrpea disagrees that the staffing ratio within its facilities is lower than the sector average. Between 2017 and 2021  the staffing ratio calculated by Orpea for care  dependency  and accommodation staff has been continually growing  from 0.621 to 0.704. Furthermore  the staffing ratio alone cannot define the quality of care. As a minimum  it should be corrected for factors that are likely to explain the variation between facilities (degree of dependence and pathology of residents  number of beds  age of the real estate  and functional nature of the residences)3.The nutritional policy implemented by Orpea responds to all protein and energy requirements of residents and complies with national standards set out by Anses4”  and by HAS5. The IGAS investigation carried out its nutritional assessment from a tool for orders placed in kg  while it is the protein and energy nutritional contributions that matter6. The meal plan elaborated by the Medical department  the Head of Nutrition and Orpea's catering service  over five-week periods  aims at ensuring a balanced diet. It ensures that all nutritional provision is guaranteed and fully compliant with official recommendations for protein  calories  fats  and carbohydrates.The weekly average energy provision of Orpea's menus is between 2 037 kcal/day and 2 147 kcal/day versus the recommended 1 950 kcal/day to 2 275 kcal/day. The nutrition policy also includes monthly weight monitoring and checks of albumin and BMI when necessary.The Group has integrated an oral-dental protocol within the care plan  with an assessment by the coordinating doctor during the Standardised Geriatric Assessment performed upon entry and then once a year.B. Concerning the use of public fundsOrpea formally denies the existence of a system aimed at optimising the use of public funds:The surpluses recorded at the facilities over the 2017-2020 period  which are concentrated in 2019 and 2020  are explained by the combination of:- The pricing convergence policy  which  by inducing an additional allocation to private facilities  generated budget surpluses that were not forecast by the facilities. Each year  these allocations being only validated around mid-year  the directors don’t use them during the first part of the year.- And the healthcare crisis  which  having led to reductions in both the number of residents admitted in the nursing homes and the number of assistant nurses available during this period  resulted in actual expenses being lower than planned.- The pricing convergence policy  which  by inducing an additional allocation to private facilities  generated budget surpluses that were not forecast by the facilities. Each year  these allocations being only validated around mid-year  the directors don’t use them during the first part of the year. - And the healthcare crisis  which  having led to reductions in both the number of residents admitted in the nursing homes and the number of assistant nurses available during this period  resulted in actual expenses being lower than planned. Faced with this lack of assistant nurses  and in order to continue to provide optimal support for residents  the facilities called upon life auxiliaries to take on the role of assistant nurses  a practice which is common across the sector 7 . We have therefore used the care portion of public funds for the staff costs corresponding to the increased care needs.. We have therefore used the care portion of public funds for the staff costs corresponding to the increased care needs. All of these charges have always been declared in a transparent and clearly identifiable manner to the Regional Health Agencies in charge of controlling the facilities concerned.The €20 million surplus generated mechanically during this period resulted in the recording of an expense aimed at neutralising the positive impact in the Group's financial statements .. Way below the amount suggested by the authors of the inspectorates’ report  €4.6 million could come from non-compliant charges on the public subsidies for care and dependency  equivalent to 0.3% of the allocations received between 2017 and 2020.The inspectorates consider that the services are imprecisely described in the contracts or inherent to the contractual service. In our opinion  this assessment is questionable.That being said  in order to avoid any difficulty in the future  ORPEA has decided to exclude the amount of orders for products in the care and dependency sector from the basis for calculating the fees due for services. No more fees will therefore be calculated and collected on the basis of the amount of products financed by public funds.As per its previous commitment  the company will report on the outcome of the independent external reviews commissioned by the Board of Directors and  in May 2022  on its transformation plan to better serve residents and their families.About ORPEA (www.orpea-corp.com)Founded in 1989  ORPEA is one of the world leaders in Dependency care (nursing homes  assisted living  post-acute and rehabilitation hospitals  mental health hospitals  home care services)ORPEA is listed on Euronext Paris (ISIN code: FR0000184798) and is a member of the SBF 120  STOXX 600 Europe  MSCI Small Cap Europe and CAC Mid 60 indices.1 IGF: Inspection Générale des Finances — French inspectorate general for finance – and IGAS: Inspection Générale des Affaires Sociales French inspectorate general for social affairs2 La prise en charge médicale des personnes âgées en EHPAD – Cour des Comptes (France’s Court of Audit) February 20223 LES DOSSIERS DE LA DREES no. 68 • December 2020 — Le taux d’encadrement dans les Ehpad: ses déterminants et ses alternatives4 Standing for: Agence Nationale de Sécurité Sanitaire Alimentaire  i.e. National Food Safety Agency5 Standing for: Haute Autorité de Santé  i.e. High Authority for Health6 See latest report from the Haut Conseil de la Santé Publique (18 May 2021  updated 24 August 2021)7 La prise en charge médicale des personnes âgées en EHPAD – Cour des Comptes February 2022",negative,0.03,0.39,0.58,mixed,0.2,0.1,0.7,True,English,"['IGAS-IGF Joint Investigation', 'Final Report', 'Orpea', 'Reaction', 'several particularly serious allegations', 'French Regional Health Agencies', 'entire nursing home sector', 'Mrs Brigitte Bourguignon', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'material adverse events', 'trade union organisations', 'chronic staff shortage', 'trade union rights', 'facilities’ medical projects', 'following corrective actions', 'shocking allegations', 'nursing homes', 'following clarifications', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'Regulatory News', 'public prosecutor', 'control mission', 'General Inspectorate', 'Social Affairs', 'judicial system', 'inspection mission', 'supporting documents', 'damning way', 'organised “system', 'widespread abuse', 'Philippe Charrier', 'full measure', 'legitimate emotion', 'support professionals', 'sincere apologies', 'necessary measures', 'facility directors', 'vital force', 'systematic implementation', 'quality processes', 'family mediators', 'ethics committees', 'whistleblowing system', 'turnover rate', 'same level', 'labor relations', 'organised ""system', 'generalised mistreatment', 'incontinence products', 'major anomaly', 'recent feedback', 'organised system', 'pressure sores', 'pressure points', 'critical point', 'The Gravediggers', 'preliminary report', 'final report', 'IGF-IGAS report', 'inspectorates’ report', 'Minister Delegate', 'detailed responses', 'teams’ awareness', 'alleged rationing', 'administrative investigation', 'PUTEAUX', 'France', 'Orpea', 'Paris', 'note', 'announcement', 'Solidarity', 'charge', 'Autonomy', 'decision', 'Finance', 'serenity', 'course', '177 pages', 'stakeholders', 'elements', 'account', 'night', '26 March', 'light', 'dysfunctions', 'book', 'Chairman', 'care', 'residents', 'families', 'undue', 'recommendations', 'reports', 'case', 'justice', 'substance', 'issues', 'stage', 'areas', 'improvement', 'resources', 'Group', 'field', 'operation', 'procedure', 'subject', 'order', 'time', 'appropriation', 'vigour', 'determination', 'problem', 'attractiveness', 'employer', 'retention', 'employees', 'attention', 'exercise', 'agreements', 'company', 'thing', 'supply', 'accusation', 'lack', 'monitoring', 'skin', 'prevention', 'percentage', '25']",2022-03-27,2022-03-27,businesswire.com

The positive scope effect of €1.3 million  or 0.3pp  was attributable to Cegedim’s first-time consolidation of new acquisitions Médimust and Kobus Tech. The positive currency impact of €1.6 million  or 0.3pp  was mainly due to the euro’s appreciation against the pound sterling.Like-for-like(2) revenues climbed 5.0% over the period.Recurring operating income(1) decreased by €1.8 million  or 4.4%  to €39.9 million in 2021 compared with €41.7 million in 2020. It represented 7.6% of consolidated revenue in 2021  compared with 8.4% in 2020. The decline is chiefly attributable to a €4.5 million negative impact from lower R&D capitalization and an increase in R&D amortization. In addition  other net non-recurring operating expenses(1) fell by €23.7 million compared with 2020.Other non-recurring operating income and expenses(1) amounted to income of €3.8 million in 2021 compared with a charge of €19.9 million in 2020. The 2021 performance is partly the result of a €4.7 million payment made by a client as part of the early termination of a services contract that was originally supposed to run through 2027. This payment was partly offset by other expenses  notably fees related to disputes or the winding up of non-recurring operations. In 2020 the amount was mainly attributable to €15.0 million of impairments of certain intangible assets related to software businesses  notably on products for doctors in the UK and Belgium.Depreciation and amortization expenses increased by €2.3 million  or 3.8%  to €64.8 million in 2021 compared to €62.5 million in 2020. Amortization related to lease contracts (IFRS 16) was virtually stable  at €16.5 million in 2021 compared to €15.9 million in 2020. The amortization of capitalized R&D expenses over the period increased by €2.7 million  or 9.0%  to €33.3 million in 2021 compared to €30.6 million in 2020. The increase was due to higher R&D capitalization in previous years. Other depreciation & amortization declined by €0.9 million to €15.0 million in 2021 from €15.9 million in 2020.EBITDA (1) increased by €0.5 million  or 0.5%  to €104.7 million in 2021  compared with €104.2 million in 2020. It represented 20.0% of consolidated revenue in 2021  compared with 21.0% in 2020.Financial result increased by €1.7 million  or 20.0%  to €10.4 million in 2021 compared with €8.6 million in 2020. The main reason for the increase was exchange rate impacts related to the pound sterling. We note that the cost of gross financial debt is stable relative to December 31  2020  because the vast majority of debt is at fixed interest rates.Total tax came to €5.8 million in 2021 compared with €2.0 million in 2020  an increase of €3.9 million or 196.8%. This change was principally the result of a combination of increased income taxes  especially for French companies  and a decrease in deferred tax assets.Net profit attributable to the owners of the parent came to €26.2 million in 2021 compared with €10.8 million in 2020. Recurring earnings per share came to €1.8 in 2021 compared with a profit of €1.2 a year earlier. Earnings per share came to €1.9 in 2021 compared with €0.8 a year earlier.Analysis of business trends by divisionIn millions of euros 2021 2020 Change Revenue 292.0 277.2 +5.4% | Like for like (2): +4.4% Recurring operating income(1) 12.8 23.8 (46.1)% Margin 4.4% 8.6% (420) bp Operating income 12.3 6.9 +78.9% Margin 4.2% 2.5% +174 bpRevenues got a boost from stronger growth in computerization activities for health insurers  bolstered by the resumption of project-based business  which positively affected recurring operating income(1).

It was hurt by a downward adjustment of unit prices  now that the implementation phase is finished  and by less so-called overflow business. However  this was health insurance BPO’s first year in the black in terms of recurring operating income(1) thanks to the automation of certain processes.HR BPO revenues rose  which positively affected recurring operating income(1).———(1) Alternative performance indicator.

Its solution has more than 4 000 users. It is perfectly compatible with Cegedim Santé’s solutions  and their combined offering in France is one of the market’s most comprehensive.Kobus was initially consolidated on June 30  2021.Acquisition of Médimust in FranceOn May 4  2021  Cegedim acquired Médimust  a software publisher serving healthcare professions for 25 years that currently supplies 2 000 independent physicians. The acquisition cements Cegedim Santé’s place as France’s number 1 medical software company(3). Pooling the companies’ know-how and expertise is strengthening Cegedim Santé’s range of solutions and improving its ability to adapt to market developments and healthcare professionals’ changing needs.Médimust generated revenues of €1.3 million in 2020 and earned a profit. It began contributing to the Group’s consolidation scope in May 2021.Cegedim  jointly with IQVIA (formerly IMS Health)  is being sued by Euris for unfair competition. Cegedim has asked the court to dismiss the case against the Group. On December 17  2018  the Paris Commercial Court granted Cegedim’s request  which IQVIA then appealed. On December 8  2021  the Court of Appeals upheld the judgement in favor of CegedimAfter consulting its external legal counsel  the Group had decided not to set aside any provisions.On February 21  2018  Cegedim S.A. received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2015  to December 31  2016. After consultation with its lawyers and based on ample precedent. the Group believes that the adjustment is unwarranted and continues to explore its options to appeal the decision. The maximum tax liability Cegedim faces as a result of the current audit is €20.3 million at December 31  2021. Cegedim still believes that there is not enough risk with respect to this amount or to tax loss carryforwards recorded on its consolidated balance sheet (corresponding to €20 million) to jeopardize their valuation.On October 21  2021  Cegedim SA received official notice that the French tax authorities planned to perform an audit of its financial statements for the period from January 1  2019  to December 31  2020. This audit is currently being conducted.Significant transactions and events post December 31  2021To the best of the company’s knowledge  apart from those listed below  there were no post-closing events or changes that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.The Group has no activities or exposed assets in Russia or Ukraine.Cegedim in exclusive talks with mutual insurance groups Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP regarding acquisition of an equity stake in Cegedim SantéOn March 1  2022  Cegedim Group and Malakoff Humanis  Groupe VYV  and PRO BTP announced that they were in exclusive talks regarding the acquisition of an equity stake in Cegedim Santé  the Group subsidiary specialized in digital solutions for healthcare professionals and patients.

Recurring operating income(1) should remain stable owing to the significant investments planned  especially for Cegedim Santé.These targets may need to be revised if there is a sharp resurgence of the Covid-19 pandemic and/or a significant worsening of geopolitical risks.The Group does not expect to make any significant acquisitions in 2022.—————The Audit Committee met on March 23  2022.
