The board of directors believes that it is in the interest of all shareholders that senior executives  employees  and other key individuals  which are deemed to be important for the development of the company  have a long-term interest in a growth of the company's share price. Through the proposed program  a long-term ownership commitment is created  which is expected to stimulate an increased interest in the business and the company's performance in general.The board's proposal for the introduction of LTI 2022 in accordance with item (a) and (b) below constitutes an overall proposal and shall be made as one decision.The detailed terms and principles of the LTI 2022 are described belowItem 13 (a) - Adoption of LTI 2022The program runs over a period of approximately 3 years and entails that the participants are allocated stock options  free of charge  with the right to acquire shares in Bambuser at a strike price corresponding to 130% of Bambuser's share price at the start of the program.For LTI 2022  the following terms and conditions shall apply:A maximum of 4 200 000 share options may be allotted to participants in LTI 2022. As of the annual general meeting 2022  the allotment of employee stock options may be made within two months. LTI 2022 shall comprise a maximum of 36 employees in Bambuser. The participants are divided into different categories based on their respective roles within the company. The distribution of employee stock options is shown below: Category 1: Management  consisting of 6 persons  may be offered a maximum of 1 470 000 employee stock options in total  whereby each person within the category may be offered a maximum of 245 000 employee stock options. Category 2: Stars  consisting of 15 persons  may be offered a maximum of 1 680 000 employee stock options in total  whereby each person within the category may be offered a maximum of 112 000 employee stock options. Category 2: Rockets  consisting of 15 persons  may be offered a maximum of 1 050 000 employee stock options in total  whereby each person within the category may be offered a maximum of 70 000 employee stock options. Allotment of share rights is in each case conditional upon (i) that the participants' employment or assignment in the company has not been terminated  with certain exceptions  and (ii) that the participant has entered a separate agreement concerning the employee stock options with the company. The board of directors shall ensure that the agreements with the participants contain terms and conditions that prohibit the transfer or pledge of the employee stock options and that stipulates that unvested share rights will  with certain exceptions  be forfeited should the participant's employment or assignment in the company be terminated. The share rights shall be allotted to the participants free of charge. Provided that the share rights have been allotted and vested  each share right grants the holder a right to  during the period from 1st June 2025  up to and including 15th August 2025  as decided by the company  either (a) acquire one (1) share in the company to a price corresponding to the quota value (the current quota value is SEK 0 05 per share) or  (b) free of charge receive a warrant which entitles to subscription of one (1) share in the company at a price corresponding to a strike price of 130% of the volume-weighted share price for the Bambuser share ten trading days after the Annual General Meeting 2022. Participation in LTI 2022 is in each case conditional upon the participation being legally possible as well as possible with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts based on the company's assessment. The board of directors shall be responsible for the agreements with the participants and the administration of LTI 2022. In connection therewith  the board of directors has the right to make adjustments in order to adjust to certain rules or market conditions outside of Sweden. Further  in extraordinary cases  the board of directors is entitled to limit the extent of LTI 2022 or terminate the program in advance  in whole or in part. The number of shares that each employee stock option may entitle to acquire shall be recalculated in the event of a share split  rights issues and similar corporate actions with the aim of keeping the economic value of a share rights unaffected by such actions.Dilution and costs etc.The maximum dilution for existing shareholders as a result of LTI 2022  including warrants that may be issued as a result of hedging measures due to social security contributions that may arise under item (b)  is 2 6 percent of the total number of shares in the company. The dilution has been calculated as the number of additional shares in relation to the existing number and additional shares. Also considered is the incentive program 2020/2023 where 7 504 624 shares may be issued  including the incentive program proposed by the Board of Directors to the annual general meeting 2022  the maximum dilution may be 5 9 percent.The share rights will be regarded as personnel costs during the vesting period  without any impact on the company's cash flow. If the share rights are exercised  LTI 2022 may also entail costs in the form of social security contributions. The total costs for the social security contributions will depend  partially on the participant's employment or assignment form in the company  partially on the number of share rights that will be vested  and partially on the value of the benefit that the participant finally receives  i.e.  on the value of the share rights when exercised in 2025. The costs due to social security contributions will be accrued over the vesting period. The company intends to hedge the entire cost of the social security contributions through an issue of warrants  in accordance with the Board of Directors proposal in item 13 (b) below  which may be exercised by a financial third party in connection with the exercise of the share rights. If the company creates such a hedge structure  the costs for social security contributions will not affect the company's cash flow.Based on the assumption that all options in LTI 2022 are vested  an assumed share price of SEK 13 3 for when the share rights are exercised  and an assumed average social security rate of approximately 31.42 percent  the total costs for the program including social security contributions will amount to approximately SEK 23 6 million   which corresponds to approximately 11% percent of the company's yearly salary costs for employees (including social security contributions) for the 2021 financial year.Preparation of proposalThe Board of Directors has prepared LTI 2022 in consultation with external advisors.Item 13 (b) - Issue of warrants and approval of the transfer of the warrants to the participants and to third partiesIn order to secure the company's delivery of shares pursuant to LTI 2022 and secure related costs (primarily social security contributions) the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants of series 2022/2025 and approval of transfer of warrants of series 2022/2025.Therefore  The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 5 519 640 warrants on the following terms:The right to subscribe shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights  be granted to a wholly owned subsidiary of the company (""The Subsidiary""). The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights is the adoption of LTI 2022. Subscription must be made no later than 30th of June 2022. The Board of Directors have the right to extend the subscription period. The warrants shall be issued free of charge. For the warrants and exercise of the warrant right  the terms and conditions set out in the attached terms and conditions for warrants 2022/2025 (""The Option Terms"") applies. For instance  the Option Terms and Conditions include the following: that each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe to one new share in the company for a cash payment at a subscription price corresponding to 130 percent of the volume-weighted average price paid for the company's share on Nasdaq First North during ten trading days after the Annual General Meeting 2022. The subscription price thus calculated is rounded to the nearest full penny  whereby 0.5 ""öre"" shall be rounded up; that the subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscribe for may be subject to an adjustment in accordance with what is stated in item 8 of the Option Terms; that the warrants may be exercised during the period from 1st June 2025 until 15th September 2025; and that the new shares issued following subscription  through the exercise of the warrants  shall entitle rights to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividend closest after the new shares have been registered by the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) and registered in the register of shareholders maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB With full exercise of the option rights for subscription of new shares  the share capital will increase by SEK 275 982. The Board of Directors  or the person that the Board of Directors may appoint  shall be authorized to make minor adjustments necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or  where applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB.The board of directors further proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer warrants to participants in LTI 2022 free of charge in connection with employee stock options being exercised in accordance with the terms and conditions in accordance with A or otherwise dispose of the warrants to secure the company's commitments and costs in connection with LTI 2022. The Board of Directors shall not have the right to dispose of the warrants for any purpose other than to secure the company's commitments and costs in connection with LTI 2022.Special majority requirementsA resolution in accordance with item 13 require support of shareholders with at least nine tenths (9/10) of the shares represented and votes cast at the annual general meeting.Item 14 - Resolution on authorization for the board of directors to issue shares  warrants and/or convertiblesThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting 2022 resolves on an authorization for the board of directors to  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  on one or more occasions until the next annual general meeting  resolve on new issue of shares  warrants and/or convertibles in the company. The total number of shares covered by such new issues may in total correspond to a maximum of ten (10) percent of the shares in the company at the time the authorization is used.

The service supports both the sell and buy sides of fund distribution  providing automated order routing and related end-to-end Straight-Through Processing.The biggest customer gains of digitalizing the fund order value chain have been to minimize potential manual errors and to reduce email and fax-based processes  resulting in increased cost efficiency  full traceability  and timely handling of orders  providing true end to end client benefit.As had been the case with fund order routing  sub-optimal work-around processes relying on manual intervention and email or fax-based processes dominate the handling of fund transfers in the Swedish market. This leads to extensive time delays in completing the process  driving administrative cost and risk.As with fund orders  the benefits of an automated  digitalized  and standardized management of fund transfers include increased security  lower administrative costs  and greater transparency of flows. By decreasing processing times from weeks to days  the benefits go beyond the distributors  fund managers and the end customer  enjoying shorter market exposure and an improved customer experience.""It is a natural next step in our long partnership to once again work together and combine our services and solutions to bring the benefits of an end-to-end STP and ISO 20022 compliant fund transfer process and continue the transformation of fund processing in the Nordic market""  says Sandra Holmqvist  Chief Business Development Officer at Euroclear Sweden.""It is essential that solution providers such as Tietoevry and financial market infrastructures such as Euroclear Sweden work closely together to be enablers for digitalization and market efficiency.

PROPOSAL ON RESOLUTION REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION OF OPTION PROGRAM 2022/2024The Option Program shall comprise the grant of maximum 820 000 stock options (Sw. personaloptioner). Each option will entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in BioInvent at a subscription price equivalent to 125 per cent of the volume-weighted average price paid for the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm (the ""Stock Exchange"") during ten trading days as from and including 28 April 2022 (i.e. the first trading day after the publication of the company's interim report for January - March 2022) (the ""Subscription Price""). The calculated Subscription Price shall be rounded off to the nearest cent (Sw. öre)  whereby 0.5 öre shall be rounded up. The Subscription Price and the number of shares that each option entitles the holder to subscribe for may be subject to conversion pursuant to a bonus issue  share split  rights issue and similar actions  whereby customary conversion terms shall be applied. The Option Program 2022/2024 will comprise all employees and other key persons in BioInvent. Options will be granted to each participant as follows:CEO: 60 000 optionsOther members of group management: 30 000 optionsOther: 5 500 optionsThe options will be granted as soon as possible after determination of the subscription price. The theoretical market value of the options upon grant (calculated as per below; see Costs for Option Program 2022/2024)  corresponds for the CEO to approximately 0.3 annual base salaries and for other members of management on average to approximately 0.2 annual base salaries. New employees and other key persons may be included in the Option Program 2022/2024 prior to 1 July 2022.Options granted will vest by 1/3 during each of the financial years 2022  2023 and 2024  based on performance and continued employment with  or assignment for  BioInvent. The performance criteria for vesting will be based on the same criteria as for management's annual bonus  which principally are based on fixed technical milestone-criteria in projects  criteria for development of the project portfolio and other pre-determined criteria attributable to the business  which are designed to promote the long-term value creation of the company. Vesting shall be proportional in relation to the period of employment or assignment during the year in question. Annual vesting will be determined by the Board of Directors in connection with the adoption of the year-end report for the financial years 2022  2023 and 2024  respectively. The option holders may exercise vested options as from the day of release of the company's year-end report for the financial year 2024 up to and including 28 February 2026. Upon exercise  each option will entitle the option holder to receive one share in BioInvent  or one warrant immediately exercisable for one share  against payment of the Subscription Price. If the option holder's employment with or assignment for BioInvent is terminated by the participant  or if terminated by BioInvent due to the participant's breach of contract  all options shall immediately expire and cannot be exercised thereafter. If the employment or the assignment is terminated for other reasons  vested options may be exercised  but the right to options not yet vested will expire. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to resolve upon another application in individual cases.B. PROPOSAL ON RESOLUTION REGARDING DIRECTED ISSUE OF WARRANTS AND APPROVAL OF TRANSFER OF WARRANTSA maximum of 951 200 warrants shall be issued. Right to subscribe shall  with deviation from the preferential right for existing shareholders  reside in BioInvent's wholly owned subsidiary BioInvent Finans AB. Subscription of the warrants shall be made on a separate subscription list no later than 30 June 2022. The warrants shall be issued free of charge. Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share. The subscription price per share shall be equivalent to the Subscription Price (as determined above). The subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for may be subject to conversion pursuant to a capitalization issue  share split  rights issue and similar actions  whereby customary conversion terms shall be applied. Subscription of shares by virtue of the warrants shall be made no later than 28 February 2026. Shares issued following exercise of warrants during a certain financial year shall entitle to dividend for the first time on the record day for dividend which occurs following registration of the shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are set out in ""Terms of the BioInvent International AB warrants 2022/2024"".The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is that the issue forms part of the implementation of Option Program 2022/2024. In view of what is set forth under background and motive above  the Board of Directors is of the opinion that it is of benefit to BioInvent and its shareholders that all employees and other key persons are offered to participate in Option Program 2022/2024.The Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that BioInvent Finans AB transfers warrants to participants in Option Program 2022/2024 and otherwise disposes of the warrants in order to secure the company's commitments and costs in connection with Option Program 2022/2024.COSTS FOR OPTION PROGRAM 2022/2024The Option Program 2022/2024 will lead to certain costs. Based on the assumption that 100 per cent of the options in the program will be vested  the salary cost in the accounts pursuant to IFRS 2 is expected to amount to approximately SEK 9.4 million in total during the period 2022-2024 based on the options actual value at the start of the program. The options have no market value as they are non-transferable. However  the Board of Directors has assessed a theoretical value of the options through application of the Black & Scholes valuation model (in relation to the performance criteria). The calculations have been based on an assumed share price of SEK 42.00 and an assumed volatility of 48 per cent. The value of the options of Option Program 2022/2024 pursuant to this valuation is approximately SEK 11.44 per option with the application of the Black & Scholes formula. The transfer restrictions have not been taken into account in the valuation. The actual IFRS 2 cost during the vesting period depends on how many options that are vested.At fulfilment of the vesting conditions and exercise of the options  Option Program 2022/2024 will lead to costs in the form of social security charges. The total costs for social security charges during the vesting period depends on how many options that are vested and the value of the options at exercise. Based on the assumption that 100 per cent of the options in the Option Program 2022/2024 will be vested  an assumed Subscription Price of SEK 52.50 and an assumed share price of SEK 168 at the exercise of the options  the costs for social security charges will amount to approximately SEK 15.2 million. The company's total cost for social security charges is proposed to be hedged through a directed issue of warrants pursuant to item B above.DILUTION AND EFFECTS ON KEY FIGURESOption Program 2022/2024 comprises the issuance of maximum 951 200 warrants  of which 820 000 warrants to secure BioInvent's commitments towards the participants in the program and 131 200 warrants to secure costs for social security charges. At full exercise of all issued warrants under Option Program 2022/2024 for subscription of new shares  BioInvent's share capital will increase by SEK 190 240. This corresponds to approximately 1.60 per cent of the shares and votes in the company after exercise. The warrants of Option Program 2022/2024 would have affected the key figure earnings after tax per share (2021) by SEK -0.13. To further illustrate the potential dilution that Option Program 2022/2024 may be expected to entail  the size of the program has also been calculated based on the assumption of an annual staff turnover of 10 per cent and an assumption that the performance criteria are met to 80 per cent  which would entail a dilution of approximately 0.89 per cent.Following evaluation of the effectiveness of the Option Program 2022/2024  the intention of the Board of Directors is to propose recurring option plans on an annual basis  similar to the Option Program 2022/2024.BioInvent has one ongoing equity incentive program for management referred to as Option Program 2019/2025 (stock options)  which comprises maximum 150 616 new shares in BioInvent  assuming full vesting 2022  at a subscription price of SEK 77.25 per share. If all options are exercised for new shares  the company's share capital will increase by SEK 30 123  which is equivalent to approximately 0.26 per cent of the shares and votes in the company after exercise.MAJORITY REQUIREMENTSThe Board of Directors' proposal for a resolution regarding Option Program 2022/2024 and the necessary security measures connected thereto pursuant to items A and B above form one combined proposal. Therefore  it is proposed that the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting under item A and B are passed as one single resolution  pursuant to the majority provisions of chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that shareholders holding not less than 9/10th of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting must vote for the proposal.Resolution on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve on new shares issue (item 17)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on the issue of new shares on one or several occasions during the period up to the next Annual General Meeting. The number of shares to be issued by virtue of the authorization shall not entail a dilution effect of more than 20 per cent of the registered share capital after completed issue. The issue may take place with or without a deviation from the shareholders' preferential right and with or without provisions on contribution in kind or set-off or any other terms. The purpose of the authorization is to increase the company's financial flexibility and enable acquisitions by payment of shares. If the Board of Directors resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  the reason may be to add new capital and/or new company owners of strategic importance to the company and/or the acquisition of other companies or businesses. At a deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  the subscription price shall be determined in accordance with market conditions. Other terms may be resolved by the Board of Directors.The proposal is subject to support by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.1. RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director shall  if any shareholder so requests  and if the Board of Directors considers that this can be done without significant harm for the company  give information on circumstances that can affect the judgement of an item on the agenda  circumstances that can affect the assessment of the company's or its subsidiaries' financial situation and the company's relation to other companies within the Group and the group accounts.2.

Russia is then due to make a $2 billion-plus redemption payment April 4. International sanctions applied to Russia's central bank mean the country no longer has access to large swathes of its foreign currency reserves.""We see a significant increased risk of default for Russia due to difficulties completing payments "" S&P Global Ratings said in a March 23 report.'Highly vulnerable'An earlier payment to foreign investors holding local currency bonds due March 2 has not been received by bondholders due to technical difficulties related to sanctions. Fitch Ratings said this would constitute a default if payment did not reach bondholders within 30 days.S&P Global Ratings  meanwhile  said debt service payments on Russia's eurobonds due in the next few weeks may face similar difficulties.""At this point  we consider that Russia's debt is highly vulnerable to nonpayment "" said S&P Global Ratings said March 17.Interest payments of $65.63 million on bonds due March 21 were paid  the Russian Ministry of Finance said. It previously said March 17 that it had made debt repayments of $117.2 million on two dollar-denominated bonds due that week. The payment was late but within the 30-day grace period to April 15 allowed under the terms of the bond.Russia's government has just over $39 billion in debt in foreign currency-denominated bonds  about $20 billion of which is owed to foreign investors  according to JPMorgan. Russian corporations owe $98 billion in eurobonds  of which $21.3 billion is owed to foreign investors.A Russian presidential decree March 5 said bondholders in countries that had joined sanctions against Russia could be paid in rubles for foreign currency-denominated bonds. However  rating agencies anticipated problems arising as a result.""If a payment is made in a currency not stipulated in the terms of the obligation  or in the place or manner prescribed by these terms  and we believe that the investor doesn't agree to the alternative payment  we could deem this a default "" S&P Global Ratings said.Fitch also said if bondholders were paid in rubles for foreign currency-denominated bonds  this would indicate a default or a default-like process had begun.Bonds sold by Russia after its annexation of Crimea in 2014 contain a provision for alternative currency payments including U.S. dollars  euros and pounds sterling  while those sold after 2018 list rubles as an alternative currency.International central securities depositaries Clearstream (owned by Deutsche Börse AG) and Euroclear SA/NV  where many bond trades are cleared and settled  have said they will no longer settle ruble-denominated transactions  making it difficult for international investors to sell their ruble-denominated assets.Payment blockedThe U.S. initially blocked all transactions with Russia's central bank and finance ministry before later issuing a temporary exemption for bond payments. It subsequently decided to allow bondholders to collect payment on bonds until May 25  after which date a special license must be obtained from the Treasury.The EU said no such restrictions apply. A spokesperson told S&P Global Market Intelligence that bondholders can continue to collect payment on Russian government bonds. The U.K. Treasury declined to comment.Continuing to allow bond payments and redemptions from Russia weakens the sanctions regime  according to Ousmène Mandeng  visiting fellow in the School of Public Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science.""I find the fact that Russia was able to make the coupon payments utterly perplexing  to say the least  and severely undermining [to] the whole purpose of isolating Russia financially and impairing its ability to wage the war "" he said via email. Mandeng is a former deputy division chief at the IMF who has decades of experience in the field of central bank reserve management.S&P Global Ratings on March 17 lowered its long-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on Russia to CC from CCC-  following a number of ratings actions since the war began. Fitch on March 8 downgraded Russia's long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to C  reflecting Fitch's view that ""a sovereign default is imminent.""Should Russia default  it would be its first major debt default in more than a century — since Lenin repudiated Tsarist debt after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.

Prospective purchasers should be aware that we have the right to redeem the Notes on any Redemption Date  beginning on the first Redemption Date. It is more likely that we will redeem the Notes prior to their stated maturity date to the extent that the interest payable on the Notes is greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments of the issuer of a comparable maturity  terms and credit rating trading in the market. If the Notes are redeemed prior to their stated maturity date  you may have to re-invest the proceeds in a lower interest rate environment. See “—Optional Redemption Feature.”Credit Risk. Our credit ratings and credit spreads may adversely affect the market value of the Notes. Investors are dependent on our ability to pay all amounts due on the Notes on each interest payment date and at maturity  and therefore investors are subject to our credit risk and to changes in the market’s view of our creditworthiness. Any decline in our credit ratings or increase in the credit spreads charged by the market for taking our credit risk is likely to adversely affect the value of the Notes.Fees and Hedging Costs. While the payment at maturity described in this pricing supplement is based on the full principal amount of your Notes  the original offering price of the Notes includes the commission received by BMOCM and other dealers and the cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes. As a result  the price  if any  at which BMOCM may be willing to purchase Notes from you in secondary market transactions will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes  and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.P- 3SUPPLEMENTAL TAX CONSIDERATIONSThe following is a general description of material tax considerations relating to the Notes. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisers as to the consequences under the tax laws of the country of which they are resident for tax purposes and the tax laws of Canada and the U.S. of acquiring  holding and disposing of the Notes and receiving payments under the Notes. This summary is based upon the law as in effect on the date of this pricing supplement and is subject to any change in law that may take effect after such date.Supplemental Canadian Tax ConsiderationsFor a discussion of the Canadian federal income tax considerations relating to an investment in the notes  please see the section of the prospectus supplement  “Certain Income Tax Consequences—Certain Canadian Income Tax Considerations.”The accompanying prospectus notes that a Holder will not be subject to tax under the Tax Act on any capital gain realized on a disposition or deemed disposition of shares  unless the shares are “taxable Canadian property” to the Holder for purposes of the Tax Act and the Holder is not entitled to relief under an applicable income tax convention between Canada and the country in which the Holder is resident.Generally  the shares will not constitute taxable Canadian property to a Holder at a particular time provided that the shares are listed at that time on a designated stock exchange (which includes the Toronto Stock Exchange)  unless at any particular time during the 60-month period that ends at that time (1) the Holder  persons with whom the Holder does not deal with at arm’s length  and partnerships in which the Holder or persons with whom the Holder does not deal at arm’s length holds a membership interest directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships  or the Holder together with all such persons and partnerships  has owned 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of our capital stock and (2) more than 50% of the fair market value of the shares was derived directly or indirectly from one or any combination of: (i) real or immovable properties situated in Canada  (ii) “Canadian resource properties” (as defined in the Tax Act)  (iii) “timber resource properties” (as defined in the Tax Act)  and (iv) options in respect of  or interests in  or for civil law rights in  property in any of the foregoing whether or not the property exists. Notwithstanding the foregoing  in certain circumstances set out in the Tax Act  shares could be deemed to be taxable Canadian property. Holders whose shares may constitute taxable Canadian property should consult their own tax advisors.Supplemental U.S. Tax ConsiderationsThe following section supplements the discussion of U.S. federal income taxation in the accompanying prospectus and prospectus supplement with respect to United States holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus). It applies only to those United States holders who are not excluded from the discussion of U.S. federal income taxation in the accompanying prospectus. It does not apply to holders subject to special rules including holders subject to Section 451(b) of the Code. For purposes of this discussion  any interest with respect to the Notes  as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes  will be treated as from sources outside the United States.You should consult your tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax and other tax consequences of your investment in the Notes in your particular circumstances  including the application of state  local or other tax laws and the possible effects of changes in federal or other tax laws.Backup Withholding and Information ReportingPlease see the discussion under “United States Federal Income Taxation — Backup Withholding and Information Reporting” in the accompanying prospectus for a description of the applicability of the backup withholding and information reporting rules to payments made on your Notes.P- 4Foreign Account Tax Compliance ActThe Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act imposes a 30% U.S. withholding tax on certain U.S. source payments  including interest (and OID)  dividends  other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gain  profits  and income (“Withholdable Payments”)  if paid to a foreign financial institution (including amounts paid to a foreign financial institution on behalf of a holder)  unless such institution enters into an agreement with the Treasury Department to collect and provide to the Treasury Department substantial information regarding U.S. account holders  including certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners  with such institution. A Note may constitute an account for these purposes. The legislation also generally imposes a withholding tax of 30% on Withholdable Payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or a certification identifying the direct and indirect substantial U.S. owners of the entity.The U.S. Treasury Department has proposed regulations that eliminate the requirement of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act withholding on payments of gross proceeds upon the sale or disposition of financial instruments. The U.S. Treasury Department has indicated that taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations pending their finalization  and the discussion above assumes the proposed regulations will be finalized in their proposed form with retroactive effect.If we (or an applicable withholding agent) determine withholding is appropriate with respect to the Notes  we (or such agent) will withhold tax at the applicable statutory rate  and we will not pay any additional amounts in respect of such withholding. Account holders subject to information reporting requirements pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act may include holders of the Notes. Foreign financial institutions and non-financial foreign entities located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act may be subject to different rules. Holders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in the Notes.P- 5EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACTA fiduciary of a pension  profit-sharing or other employee benefit plan subject to the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  as amended (“ERISA”) (each  a “Plan”)  should consider the fiduciary standards of ERISA in the context of the Plan’s particular circumstances before authorizing an investment in the Notes. Among other factors  the fiduciary should consider whether the investment would satisfy the prudence and diversification requirements of ERISA and would be consistent with the documents and instruments governing the Plan  and whether the investment would involve a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Plans  as well as individual retirement accounts  Keogh plans and any other plans that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code (also “Plans”)  from engaging in certain transactions involving “plan assets” with persons who are “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code with respect to the Plan. A violation of these prohibited transaction rules may result in excise tax or other liabilities under ERISA or the Code for those persons  unless exemptive relief is available under an applicable statutory  regulatory or administrative exemption. Employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA)  certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) (“Non-ERISA Arrangements”) are not subject to the requirements of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to similar provisions under applicable federal  state  local  non-U.S. or other laws (“Similar Laws”).The acquisition of Notes by a Plan or any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of any Plan’s investment in the entity (a “Plan Asset Entity”) with respect to which we or certain of our affiliates is or becomes a party in interest or disqualified person may result in a prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code  unless the Notes are acquired pursuant to an applicable exemption. The U.S. Department of Labor has issued five prohibited transaction class exemptions  or “PTCEs”  that may provide exemptive relief if required for direct or indirect prohibited transactions that may arise from the purchase or holding of Notes. These exemptions are PTCE 84-14 (for certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers)  PTCE 90-1 (for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts)  PTCE 91-38 (for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds)  PTCE 95-60 (for transactions involving certain insurance company general accounts)  and PTCE 96-23 (for transactions managed by in-house asset managers). In addition  ERISA Section 408(b)(17) and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide an exemption for the purchase and sale of securities offered hereby  provided that neither the issuer of securities offered hereby nor any of its affiliates have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Plan involved in the transaction  and provided further that the Plan pays no more and receives no less than “adequate consideration” in connection with the transaction (the “service provider exemption”). There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.Any purchaser or holder of Notes or any interest therein will be deemed to have represented by its purchase and holding of Notes offered hereby that it either (1) is not a Plan  a Plan Asset Entity or a Non-ERISA Arrangement and is not purchasing the Notes on behalf of or with the assets of any Plan  a Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement or (2) the purchase and holding of the Notes will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions  it is important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing Notes on behalf of or with the assets of any Plan  a Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement consult with their counsel regarding the availability of exemptive relief under any of the PTCEs listed above  the service provider exemption or the potential consequences of any purchase or holding under Similar Laws  as applicable. Purchasers of Notes have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of Notes do not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or any similar provisions of Similar Laws. The sale of any Notes to a Plan  Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement is in no respect a representation by us or any of our affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any such Plans  Plan Asset Entities or Non-ERISA Arrangements generally or any particular Plan  Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement or that such investment is appropriate for such Plans  Plan Asset Entities or Non-ERISA Arrangements generally or any particular Plan  Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement.P- 6SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)BMOCM will purchase the Notes from us on the settlement date at prices as specified on the cover page of this pricing supplement. BMOCM has informed us that  as part of its distribution of the Notes  it will reoffer the Notes to other dealers who will sell them at the original offering price. Each such dealer  or further dealer engaged by a dealer to whom BMOCM reoffers the Notes  will purchase the Notes at an agreed discount to the initial offering price.We own  directly or indirectly  all of the outstanding equity securities of BMOCM  the agent for this offering. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5121  BMOCM may not make sales in this offering to any of its discretionary accounts without the prior written approval of the customer.We reserve the right to withdraw  cancel or modify the offering of any of the Notes and to reject orders in whole or in part. You may cancel any order for the Notes prior to its acceptance.You should not construe the offering of any of the Notes as a recommendation as to the suitability of an investment in the Notes.BMOCM may  but is not obligated to  make a market in the Notes. BMOCM will determine any secondary market prices that it is prepared to offer in its sole discretion.We may use this pricing supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition  BMOCM or another of our affiliates may use this pricing supplement in market-making transactions in any Notes after their initial sale. Unless BMOCM or we inform you otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this pricing supplement is being used by BMOCM in a market-making transaction.Each of BMOCM and any other broker-dealer offering the Notes have not offered  sold or otherwise made available and will not offer  sell or otherwise make available any of the Notes to  any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes  the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes  and a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (a) a retail client  as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive (EU) 2014/65 (as amended  “MiFID II”); or (b) a customer  within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97  as amended  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (c) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) No 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently  no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended  the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared  and therefore  offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.Each of BMOCM and any other broker-dealer offering the Notes have not offered  sold or otherwise made available and will not offer  sell or otherwise make available any of the Notes to  any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes  a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client  as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the ""FSMA"") and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client  as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the ""UK PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.P-7",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.02,0.25,0.73,True,English,"['Form 424B2 BANK', 'MONTREAL', 'CAN', 'United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation', 'Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act', 'BMO Capital Markets Corp.', 'The Depository Trust Company', 'Redeemable Fixed Coupon Notes', 'Original Public Offering Price', 'Deposit Insurance Fund', 'early redemption right', 'Optional Redemption Feature', 'Optional Redemption Provision', 'other governmental agency', 'Original Issue Date', 'preliminary pricing supplement', 'Senior Medium-Term Notes', 'Interest Payment Period', 'Interest Payment Dates', 'final interest payment', 'state securities commission', 'accompanying prospectus supplement', 'Issue Price', 'federal laws', 'CDIC Act', 'Redemption Date', 'Exchange Commission', 'other entity', 'Registration Statement', 'Specific Terms', 'Principal Amount', 'Specified Currency', 'Minimum Denomination', 'integral multiples', 'credit risk', 'indirect participants', 'Legal Ownership', 'Book-Entry Issuance', 'CUSIP No.', 'registered holders', '30 business days', 'five business', 'common shares', 'SEC website', 'sec.gov', 'Risk Factors', 'criminal offense', 'unsecured obligations', 'savings accounts', 'Trade Date', 'relevant date', 'The Notes', 'Debt Securities', '14th day', 'Bail-inable Notes', 'Series G', 'initial sale', 'market-making transactions', '2022 Settlement Date', 'Stated Maturity', '100% Interest Rate', 'information', 'jurisdiction', 'Rule', 'Completion', 'March', 'May', 'Issuer', 'Bank', 'Montreal', 'Title', 'April', 'excess', 'Annum', 'arrears', 'October', 'year', 'postponement', 'Clearance', 'DTC', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'Description', 'January', 'July', 'unpaid', 'event', 'notice', 'less', 'conversion', 'means', 'steps', 'affiliates', 'subsection', 'variation', 'extinguishment', 'consequence', 'application', 'Province', 'Ontario', 'respect', 'operation', 'documents', 'address', 'filings', 'Archives', 'edgar', 'data', 'risks', 'page', 'payments', 'accuracy', 'representation', 'contrary', 'deposits', 'instrumentality', 'facilities', 'addition', 'BMOCM', 'agent', 'confirmation']",2022-03-28,2022-03-28,streetinsider.com

The board of directors believes that it is in the interest of all shareholders that senior executives  employees  and other key individuals  which are deemed to be important for the development of the company  have a long-term interest in a growth of the company's share price. Through the proposed program  a long-term ownership commitment is created  which is expected to stimulate an increased interest in the business and the company's performance in general.The board's proposal for the introduction of LTI 2022 in accordance with item (a) and (b) below constitutes an overall proposal and shall be made as one decision.The detailed terms and principles of the LTI 2022 are described belowItem 13 (a) - Adoption of LTI 2022The program runs over a period of approximately 3 years and entails that the participants are allocated stock options  free of charge  with the right to acquire shares in Bambuser at a strike price corresponding to 130% of Bambuser's share price at the start of the program.For LTI 2022  the following terms and conditions shall apply:A maximum of 4 200 000 share options may be allotted to participants in LTI 2022. As of the annual general meeting 2022  the allotment of employee stock options may be made within two months. LTI 2022 shall comprise a maximum of 36 employees in Bambuser. The participants are divided into different categories based on their respective roles within the company. The distribution of employee stock options is shown below: Category 1: Management  consisting of 6 persons  may be offered a maximum of 1 470 000 employee stock options in total  whereby each person within the category may be offered a maximum of 245 000 employee stock options. Category 2: Stars  consisting of 15 persons  may be offered a maximum of 1 680 000 employee stock options in total  whereby each person within the category may be offered a maximum of 112 000 employee stock options. Category 2: Rockets  consisting of 15 persons  may be offered a maximum of 1 050 000 employee stock options in total  whereby each person within the category may be offered a maximum of 70 000 employee stock options. Allotment of share rights is in each case conditional upon (i) that the participants' employment or assignment in the company has not been terminated  with certain exceptions  and (ii) that the participant has entered a separate agreement concerning the employee stock options with the company. The board of directors shall ensure that the agreements with the participants contain terms and conditions that prohibit the transfer or pledge of the employee stock options and that stipulates that unvested share rights will  with certain exceptions  be forfeited should the participant's employment or assignment in the company be terminated. The share rights shall be allotted to the participants free of charge. Provided that the share rights have been allotted and vested  each share right grants the holder a right to  during the period from 1st June 2025  up to and including 15th August 2025  as decided by the company  either (a) acquire one (1) share in the company to a price corresponding to the quota value (the current quota value is SEK 0 05 per share) or  (b) free of charge receive a warrant which entitles to subscription of one (1) share in the company at a price corresponding to a strike price of 130% of the volume-weighted share price for the Bambuser share ten trading days after the Annual General Meeting 2022. Participation in LTI 2022 is in each case conditional upon the participation being legally possible as well as possible with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts based on the company's assessment. The board of directors shall be responsible for the agreements with the participants and the administration of LTI 2022. In connection therewith  the board of directors has the right to make adjustments in order to adjust to certain rules or market conditions outside of Sweden. Further  in extraordinary cases  the board of directors is entitled to limit the extent of LTI 2022 or terminate the program in advance  in whole or in part. The number of shares that each employee stock option may entitle to acquire shall be recalculated in the event of a share split  rights issues and similar corporate actions with the aim of keeping the economic value of a share rights unaffected by such actions.Dilution and costs etc.The maximum dilution for existing shareholders as a result of LTI 2022  including warrants that may be issued as a result of hedging measures due to social security contributions that may arise under item (b)  is 2 6 percent of the total number of shares in the company. The dilution has been calculated as the number of additional shares in relation to the existing number and additional shares. Also considered is the incentive program 2020/2023 where 7 504 624 shares may be issued  including the incentive program proposed by the Board of Directors to the annual general meeting 2022  the maximum dilution may be 5 9 percent.The share rights will be regarded as personnel costs during the vesting period  without any impact on the company's cash flow. If the share rights are exercised  LTI 2022 may also entail costs in the form of social security contributions. The total costs for the social security contributions will depend  partially on the participant's employment or assignment form in the company  partially on the number of share rights that will be vested  and partially on the value of the benefit that the participant finally receives  i.e.  on the value of the share rights when exercised in 2025. The costs due to social security contributions will be accrued over the vesting period. The company intends to hedge the entire cost of the social security contributions through an issue of warrants  in accordance with the Board of Directors proposal in item 13 (b) below  which may be exercised by a financial third party in connection with the exercise of the share rights. If the company creates such a hedge structure  the costs for social security contributions will not affect the company's cash flow.Based on the assumption that all options in LTI 2022 are vested  an assumed share price of SEK 13 3 for when the share rights are exercised  and an assumed average social security rate of approximately 31.42 percent  the total costs for the program including social security contributions will amount to approximately SEK 23 6 million   which corresponds to approximately 11% percent of the company's yearly salary costs for employees (including social security contributions) for the 2021 financial year.Preparation of proposalThe Board of Directors has prepared LTI 2022 in consultation with external advisors.Item 13 (b) - Issue of warrants and approval of the transfer of the warrants to the participants and to third partiesIn order to secure the company's delivery of shares pursuant to LTI 2022 and secure related costs (primarily social security contributions) the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants of series 2022/2025 and approval of transfer of warrants of series 2022/2025.Therefore  The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 5 519 640 warrants on the following terms:The right to subscribe shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights  be granted to a wholly owned subsidiary of the company (""The Subsidiary""). The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights is the adoption of LTI 2022. Subscription must be made no later than 30th of June 2022. The Board of Directors have the right to extend the subscription period. The warrants shall be issued free of charge. For the warrants and exercise of the warrant right  the terms and conditions set out in the attached terms and conditions for warrants 2022/2025 (""The Option Terms"") applies. For instance  the Option Terms and Conditions include the following: that each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe to one new share in the company for a cash payment at a subscription price corresponding to 130 percent of the volume-weighted average price paid for the company's share on Nasdaq First North during ten trading days after the Annual General Meeting 2022. The subscription price thus calculated is rounded to the nearest full penny  whereby 0.5 ""öre"" shall be rounded up; that the subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscribe for may be subject to an adjustment in accordance with what is stated in item 8 of the Option Terms; that the warrants may be exercised during the period from 1st June 2025 until 15th September 2025; and that the new shares issued following subscription  through the exercise of the warrants  shall entitle rights to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividend closest after the new shares have been registered by the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) and registered in the register of shareholders maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB With full exercise of the option rights for subscription of new shares  the share capital will increase by SEK 275 982. The Board of Directors  or the person that the Board of Directors may appoint  shall be authorized to make minor adjustments necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or  where applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB.The board of directors further proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer warrants to participants in LTI 2022 free of charge in connection with employee stock options being exercised in accordance with the terms and conditions in accordance with A or otherwise dispose of the warrants to secure the company's commitments and costs in connection with LTI 2022. The Board of Directors shall not have the right to dispose of the warrants for any purpose other than to secure the company's commitments and costs in connection with LTI 2022.Special majority requirementsA resolution in accordance with item 13 require support of shareholders with at least nine tenths (9/10) of the shares represented and votes cast at the annual general meeting.Item 14 - Resolution on authorization for the board of directors to issue shares  warrants and/or convertiblesThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting 2022 resolves on an authorization for the board of directors to  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  on one or more occasions until the next annual general meeting  resolve on new issue of shares  warrants and/or convertibles in the company. The total number of shares covered by such new issues may in total correspond to a maximum of ten (10) percent of the shares in the company at the time the authorization is used. Payment for subscribed shares  warrants or convertibles may be paid in cash  by set-off or in kind or on terms referred to in chapter 2 section 5 of the Companies Act.The purpose of the authorization and the reasons for a possible deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is to enable further financing of the company's operations  to finance company acquisitions or acquisitions of businesses or assets  to be able to issue the said instruments as remuneration in such acquisitions and in the company strategic collaborations  to enable emission to industrial partners and to broaden the shareholder group.The board of directors  the CEO  or who the board of directors appoints  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments in the general meeting's resolution required for the registration at the Swedish Companies Registration Office or du to other formal requirements.Special majority requirementsA resolution in accordance with item 14 require support of shareholders with at least two-thirds (2/3) of the number of votes and shares represented at the meeting to be valid.DocumentsThe annual report and the auditor's report are presented by keeping them available at the company at Malmskillnadsgatan 13 in Stockholm  and on https://ir.bambuser.com/corporate-governance/general-meeting  no later than 7 April 2022.

It will aim to help banks gauge investor appetite for upcoming equity issuances  including in particular IPOs as well as accelerated book buildings and the placement of institutional shares.It said that setting up an equity capital market desk would allow Amundi to decide what role it wants to play in any upcoming IPO or equity issuance operation – cornerstone investor  anchor investor or standard investor – and potentially to increase its chances of success  as associating the name of a renowned investor to the process typically bolsters confidence in the offering.“Because of its scale in the European investment industry  the depth of its expertise and the size of its investment and portfolio management teams  we believe that Amundi is ideally placed to provide this service and thus to contribute to reinforcing Europe’s attractiveness as a key marketplace for IPOs and equity offerings.”Vincent Mortier  chief investment officer at Amundi  said: “In the current market context  it is paramount to be in the position to offer our clients access to Europe’s most dynamic investment opportunities. I am convinced the Amundi ECM desk will act as a partner of choice for European companies in their IPOs process  and will ultimately contribute to reinforcing the attractiveness of Europe as a financial centre.”Primary listings have been on pause since February as a result of the geopolitical situation  but Amundi has said the pipeline remains relatively healthy and that it expects some operations to resume by the second half of the year  with the long-term trend being that European companies are poised to increasingly tap equity markets for their financing needs in the coming years.Deutsche Börse acquires Luxembourg-based fund data managerDeutsche Börse Group is acquiring 100% of Kneip Communication S.A  which manages investor disclosure and data publication for more than 10 000 funds in over 40 countries  including the production of over 200 000 reporting solutions. It currently services over 30 per cent of EU-based fund ISINs.Further terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of March this year.According to Deutsche Börse and Kneip  the acquisition forms the basis for creating a leading fund data hub based in Luxembourg. Kneip will seek to further scale the business and expand its range of services inside Deutsche Börse Group  including data and post-trade services provided by Clearstream.Deutsche Börse  meanwhile  also intends to connect Kneip’s services with its established fund services platforms.

Russia is then due to make a $2 billion-plus redemption payment April 4. International sanctions applied to Russia's central bank mean the country no longer has access to large swathes of its foreign currency reserves.""We see a significant increased risk of default for Russia due to difficulties completing payments "" S&P Global Ratings said in a March 23 report.'Highly vulnerable'An earlier payment to foreign investors holding local currency bonds due March 2 has not been received by bondholders due to technical difficulties related to sanctions. Fitch Ratings said this would constitute a default if payment did not reach bondholders within 30 days.S&P Global Ratings  meanwhile  said debt service payments on Russia's eurobonds due in the next few weeks may face similar difficulties.""At this point  we consider that Russia's debt is highly vulnerable to nonpayment "" said S&P Global Ratings said March 17.Interest payments of $65.63 million on bonds due March 21 were paid  the Russian Ministry of Finance said. It previously said March 17 that it had made debt repayments of $117.2 million on two dollar-denominated bonds due that week. The payment was late but within the 30-day grace period to April 15 allowed under the terms of the bond.Russia's government has just over $39 billion in debt in foreign currency-denominated bonds  about $20 billion of which is owed to foreign investors  according to JPMorgan. Russian corporations owe $98 billion in eurobonds  of which $21.3 billion is owed to foreign investors.A Russian presidential decree March 5 said bondholders in countries that had joined sanctions against Russia could be paid in rubles for foreign currency-denominated bonds. However  rating agencies anticipated problems arising as a result.""If a payment is made in a currency not stipulated in the terms of the obligation  or in the place or manner prescribed by these terms  and we believe that the investor doesn't agree to the alternative payment  we could deem this a default "" S&P Global Ratings said.Fitch also said if bondholders were paid in rubles for foreign currency-denominated bonds  this would indicate a default or a default-like process had begun.Bonds sold by Russia after its annexation of Crimea in 2014 contain a provision for alternative currency payments including U.S. dollars  euros and pounds sterling  while those sold after 2018 list rubles as an alternative currency.International central securities depositaries Clearstream (owned by Deutsche Börse AG) and Euroclear SA/NV  where many bond trades are cleared and settled  have said they will no longer settle ruble-denominated transactions  making it difficult for international investors to sell their ruble-denominated assets.Payment blockedThe U.S. initially blocked all transactions with Russia's central bank and finance ministry before later issuing a temporary exemption for bond payments. It subsequently decided to allow bondholders to collect payment on bonds until May 25  after which date a special license must be obtained from the Treasury.The EU said no such restrictions apply. A spokesperson told S&P Global Market Intelligence that bondholders can continue to collect payment on Russian government bonds. The U.K. Treasury declined to comment.Continuing to allow bond payments and redemptions from Russia weakens the sanctions regime  according to Ousmène Mandeng  visiting fellow in the School of Public Policy at the London School of Economics and Political Science.""I find the fact that Russia was able to make the coupon payments utterly perplexing  to say the least  and severely undermining [to] the whole purpose of isolating Russia financially and impairing its ability to wage the war "" he said via email. Mandeng is a former deputy division chief at the IMF who has decades of experience in the field of central bank reserve management.S&P Global Ratings on March 17 lowered its long-term foreign and local currency sovereign credit ratings on Russia to CC from CCC-  following a number of ratings actions since the war began. Fitch on March 8 downgraded Russia's long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to C  reflecting Fitch's view that ""a sovereign default is imminent.""Should Russia default  it would be its first major debt default in more than a century — since Lenin repudiated Tsarist debt after the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.

Most Read from BloombergLow-Priced Omega Speedmaster Prompts Global Swatch Store ChaosUkraine Update: Negotiators Set for Face-to-Face Talks This WeekWill Smith Smacks Chris Rock ,(Bloomberg) -- Russia is making coupon and principal payments for bonds due next month and in April 2042  according to filings with the National Settlement Depository.Most Read from BloombergThe Finance Ministry filed notifications for an “interest payment” and “principal repayment” on $2 billion of dollar-denominated debt due on April 4  the biggest security maturing since Russia was hit with sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine.In addition  it also filed a notification for a coupon on bonds due in April 2042. Holders of the latter were due to receive an $84 million payment on April 4. The National Settlement Depository  or NSD  in Moscow receives the Russian government’s payments on some of its foreign bonds for distribution.Despite warnings from credit-rating agencies  the government has so far avoided a default since the war started. That said  the process for payments has been uncertain and a $66 million interest payment last week on a $3 billion Eurobond was delayed. Local capital controls and restrictions imposed on Russian assets by the world’s biggest bond settlement systems mean investors are braced for further turbulence.“There are still potential settlement issues and the longer the war lasts  Russia’s economy will suffer some long-term damage ” said Guido Chamorro  co-head of emerging-market hard-currency debt at Pictet Asset Management. “But it is striking that so far  we haven’t seen major defaults in Russia  Ukraine  or the region.”The latest hurdle came at the end of last week when Clearstream  the Luxembourg-based bank that settles payments for some of the nation’s bonds  blocked the NSD’s account. A decision to restart would be based on a review by regulators in Luxembourg  the depository said on March 24.

It will aim to help banks gauge investor appetite for upcoming equity issuances  including in particular IPOs as well as accelerated book buildings and the placement of institutional shares.It said that setting up an equity capital market desk would allow Amundi to decide what role it wants to play in any upcoming IPO or equity issuance operation – cornerstone investor  anchor investor or standard investor – and potentially to increase its chances of success  as associating the name of a renowned investor to the process typically bolsters confidence in the offering.“Because of its scale in the European investment industry  the depth of its expertise and the size of its investment and portfolio management teams  we believe that Amundi is ideally placed to provide this service and thus to contribute to reinforcing Europe’s attractiveness as a key marketplace for IPOs and equity offerings.”Vincent Mortier  chief investment officer at Amundi  said: “In the current market context  it is paramount to be in the position to offer our clients access to Europe’s most dynamic investment opportunities. I am convinced the Amundi ECM desk will act as a partner of choice for European companies in their IPOs process  and will ultimately contribute to reinforcing the attractiveness of Europe as a financial centre.”Primary listings have been on pause since February as a result of the geopolitical situation  but Amundi has said the pipeline remains relatively healthy and that it expects some operations to resume by the second half of the year  with the long-term trend being that European companies are poised to increasingly tap equity markets for their financing needs in the coming years.Deutsche Börse acquires Luxembourg-based fund data managerDeutsche Börse Group is acquiring 100% of Kneip Communication S.A  which manages investor disclosure and data publication for more than 10 000 funds in over 40 countries  including the production of over 200 000 reporting solutions.

Koneti Rao  MD  FRCPA  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  will present positive findings from the Phase III pivotal clinical trial of leniolisib for patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) at the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) 2022 Annual Meeting in Charlotte  North Carolina.Pharming_Group_NV_LogoThe presentation for healthcare practitioners and other experts will take place on April 1  2022  from 11:30 to 11:45 ET/17:30 to 17:45 CET and will be accessible on site and virtually. To attend  please register here:https://cis.clinimmsoc.org/education/meetings/am22/program/amprogramLeniolisib is being developed for the targeted treatment of APDS  a rare primary immunodeficiency caused by genetic variants that currently has no approved therapy. On February 2  2022  Pharming announced that the Phase III trial of leniolisib  sponsored by Novartis  has met both of its co-primary endpoints by demonstrating improvements in lymphoproliferation and immunophenotype correction  and that the treatment was well tolerated by patients.Pharming plans to begin submitting global regulatory filings for leniolisib  a small-molecule PI3Kδ inhibitor  in the first half of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.Nicholas Hartog  MD  FAAAAI  FACAAI  a specialist in allergy and immunology at Spectrum Health Helen Devos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids  Michigan  said:""I'm eager to learn more about the positive results of this Phase III study of leniolisib in patients with APDS. A promising therapy for this rare and challenging disease sparks hope in physicians like me  who are dedicated to improving care for affected patients and reducing their symptoms. I could not be more excited about the opportunity for a personalized and precision-based therapy on the horizon for this patient population.""Story continuesAnurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""Pharming is committed to bringing new therapies to people with rare diseases and will work closely with regulatory authorities across the globe in an effort to make this innovative option available to physicians who care for patients with primary immunodeficiencies. We are excited to be pursuing a development program that aims to bring patients the first targeted therapy option for APDS  as this disease significantly impacts their lives  yet treatment has been limited to supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy.""In his presentation during a plenary session titled ""Precision Medicine for Hyperinflammatory Disorders "" Dr. Rao will explain the study's design  share its primary and secondary findings  and detail patient disposition and safety results. The annual CIS meeting will be dedicated to exploring immune deficiency and dysregulation.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About the Phase II/III leniolisib TrialSponsored by Novartis  the Phase II/III registration-enabling study was composed of two parts  the first being a 12-week open-label dose escalation part that included six patients with APDS and determined the dose of leniolisib to be given in the Phase III part.The Phase III part consisted of a randomized  placebo-controlled  blinded trial of leniolisib that enrolled 31 patients who had APDS and were age 12 or older. The patients were randomly assigned according to a 2:1 ratio to receive either leniolisib 70mg twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks. The co-primary endpoints of the randomized study evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency as shown by an increase in naïve B cells. Following study treatment  patients were permitted to roll over to an open-label extension study evaluating long-term safety  tolerability  and efficacy.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. is a global  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative protein replacement therapies and precision medicines for the treatment of rare diseases and unmet medical needs.The flagship of our portfolio is our recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) franchise.

It is already approved for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) in patients two years of age and older.1 Additionally  the FDA granted FINTEPLA pediatric exclusivity. FINTEPLA for LGS is available through a restricted distribution program  called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. FINTEPLA was developed by Zogenix  Inc.  which was recently acquired by UCB.FINTEPLALGS is a severe childhood-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) characterized by drug-refractory seizures with high morbidity4 as well as serious impairment of neurodevelopmental  cognitive  and motor functions.5 LGS affects an estimated 30 000 – 50 000 patients in the U.S.6 LGS has far-reaching effects beyond seizures  including issues with communication  psychiatric symptoms  sleep  behavioral challenges  and mobility.7 Additionally  sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major concern for people living with LGS.8FINTEPLA has demonstrated efficacy in the most difficult to treat seizure types 1 2 including drop seizures  which cause a person to suddenly lose muscle tone  become limp  and fall to the ground  with a high likelihood of injury.3 FINTEPLA has a mechanism of action different from and complementary to current seizure medications  and it can be used with no disruptions to current antiseizure regimens.9 In the global placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study  there were numerically greater improvements on the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CG-I) in patients living with LGS when taking FINTEPLA.1Story continues""The approval of FINTEPLA for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome highlights our continued commitment to bringing differentiated medicines to patients who may not be well controlled on current therapies  and their caregivers "" said Mike Davis  Head of Global Epilepsy  UCB  Inc. ""We are proud to add FINTEPLA as a treatment for Dravet syndrome  and now Lennox-Gastaut syndrome  to our portfolio of epilepsy medicines to help reduce the impact and burden of seizures  including severe epilepsy syndromes that have high pediatric morbidity and mortality rates.""The FDA approval was supported by safety and efficacy data from a global  randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial in 263 patients with LGS (age 2-35 years)  which demonstrated that FINTEPLA at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day significantly reduced monthly drop seizures frequency by a median of 23.7% from baseline compared to 8.7% placebo (p=0.0037). Nearly a fourth of those patients on FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day experienced a ≥50% reduction in drop seizure frequency per 28 days; 18% with ≥50% to <75% reduction and 6% ≥75% reduction.1 The common adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with FINTEPLA (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea  decreased appetite  fatigue  somnolence  and vomiting. The FINTEPLA safety database includes long-term cardiovascular safety data for patients treated for up to three years in DS and LGS.1""LGS is one of the most challenging epileptic encephalopathies to treat  and the vast majority of patients are not well controlled  despite a regimen of multiple antiepileptic drugs "" said Kelly Knupp  M.D.  MSCS  FAES  Associate Professor  Children's Hospital Colorado. ""As a complementary therapy  FINTEPLA offers a different mechanism of action and demonstrated ability to significantly reduce the number of seizures associated with a drop  a critical measure for managing this severe form of epilepsy.""UCB is committed to supporting patient access to FINTEPLA  and as part of that commitment  Zogenix Central  a comprehensive support program  will provide ongoing product assistance to patients  caregivers  and their medical teams. Further information is available at www.FINTEPLA.com.""LGS is a severe  life-long disease with wide-ranging effects beyond seizures. It impacts every aspect of daily life and puts great strain on the entire family. There is a desperate need for more effective treatment options "" said Dr. Tracy Dixon-Salazar  Executive Director of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Foundation and mother to an adult daughter with LGS. ""The potential for FINTEPLA to make a difference in the daily  horrific seizures we are dealing with in LGS cannot be understated. We are so grateful for the researchers who have worked so hard to help all of us suffering at the hands of LGS.""UCB acquired Zogenix and FINTEPLA on March 7  2022. The acquisition is consistent with UCB's sustainable patient value strategy and continued commitment to providing world-leading patient value to all people living with epilepsy  with an increasing focus on creating value and new solutions that address the unmet needs of people with certain specialized or rare types of epilepsy  where few or no options exist.About FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) C-IVFINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) oral solution is a prescription medication approved by the FDA and EMA  and under regulatory review with PMDA (Japan)  for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older.10 11 A Type II Variation Application for treatment of seizures associated with LGS has also been submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).12In the United States  FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS program. FINTEPLA is available in Europe under a controlled access program requested by the EMA to prevent off-label use for weight management and to confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking FINTEPLA. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at +1 877 964 3649.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.INDICATIONS AND USAGEFINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5–HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSAdministration to patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact Zogenix Inc. at 1-866-964-3649 (1-866-Zogenix) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.9414antje.witte@ucb.comCorporate CommunicationsErica Puntel  U.S. Media RelationsT +404 938 5359Erica.puntel@ucb.comLaurent Schots  Media RelationsT+32.2.559.9264Laurent.schots@ucb.comNick FrancisT +44 7769 307745Nick.francis@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB' efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases – including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure – with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed €3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR® is estimated to be over €5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.The alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.In the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints and a rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life. All patients have been enrolled in the study and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines. Over 900 alfapump systems have been implanted to date.Sequana Medical has combined its proven alfapump and proprietary DSR therapy  and is developing the alfapump DSR  a breakthrough approach to fluid overload due to heart failure. RED DESERT demonstrated that repeated DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients is able to manage their fluid and sodium balance  improve their cardio-renal status and restore their diuretic response for months post-treatment. Interim results from the ongoing SAHARA DESERT study in decompensated heart failure patients indicated that repeated DSR therapy can safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate persistent congestion and restore euvolemia  together with considerable benefit in cardio-renal status and a dramatic improvement in diuretic responsiveness. Reporting of top-line data is planned for H2 2022.Sequana Medical is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The open-label  single-arm Phase 3 study (NCT04769895)  called ‘ARES’  evaluates the safety and efficacy of MaaT013  the company’s high-richness  high-diversity lead Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy (MET) as a third-line  salvage therapy in GI-aGvHD patients2. aGvHD is a severe complication of an allogeneic stem cell transplant and every year  approximately 10 000 patients are diagnosed globally.“Initiating the pivotal Phase 3 trial with our lead candidate MaaT013 is an important milestone for our company and for the microbiome therapeutics field worldwide. If ARES is successful  we believe this study could serve as the basis for MaaT013’s approval in this severe indication with a very high unmet need ” said Hervé Affagard  co-founder and CEO of MaaT Pharma.ARES is a Phase 3 multicenter  international  open-label  single-arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of MaaT013 in 75 patients with Grade II-IV GI-aGvHD who are refractory to steroids and are resistant or are intolerant to ruxolitinib. The clinical trial will be conducted in up to 40 different sites across the European Union. To date  the company has received regulatory approvals from France  Germany and Spain  and the clinical trial may also be expanded to sites in the United States subject to regulatory approval. Eligible patients in the ARES study will be administered a total of 3 doses of MaaT013 as an enema formulation over a period of 10 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the GI-overall response rate (GI-ORR) to MaaT013 treatment at day 28. Secondary endpoints include the safety and tolerability of MaaT013 up to 12 months  as well as overall survival after 12 months. A first data review is expected in Q1 2023 after enrollment of half the patients in the study.Prof. Mohamad Mohty  Professor and Head of the Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department at the Saint-Antoine Hospital and Sorbonne University and past-president of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) added  “The medical need is extremely high for GI-aGvHD patients who are refractory to both steroids and ruxolitinib  as they face an 80% mortality rate within the first few months3. By restoring the gut microbiome ecosystem  MaaT013 opens a brand-new therapeutic modality and provides a strongly differentiated  immuno-restorative approach that may complement standard immunosuppressive drugs and may provide a breakthrough for patients with no other therapeutic options.”The Phase 3 ARES trial builds on previously shared positive results from the company’s Phase 2 HERACLES study of MaaT013 (n= 24) and from data of 52 patients benefiting from an ongoing early access program with MaaT013 in France. Both clinical datasets demonstrated that MaaT013 was generally well tolerated in this heavily immunocompromised patient population and demonstrated promising clinical benefit  which translated into a positive impact on overall survival rates in patients responding to the treatment. To date  more than 100 patients with aGvHD have been safely treated with MaaT013.About steroid resistant  gastro-intestinal acute Graft-vs-host-Disease (SR  GI aGvHD)Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease occurs in patients within 100 days of undergoing a stem cell or bone marrow transplant. The transplanted cells “attack” the recipient  causing inflammation of the skin  liver and/or gastro-intestinal tract. GI-aGvHD results in patients experiencing very high volumes of diarrhea which can be life-threatening. The standard first line therapy for treating aGvHD is the use of systemic steroids. If patients do not respond to steroids  they are considered Steroid Resistant (SR) and other agents can be administered. Currently the only agent approved for treating SR aGvHD after failure of steroid treatment is ruxolitinib  which is currently approved for this indication in USA and has received approval from the European Medical Agency’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) on March 25  2022.About MaaT013MaaT013 is a full-ecosystem  off-the-shelf  standardized  pooled-donor  Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy. It is characterized by a consistently high diversity and richness of microbial species and the presence of ButycoreTM (group of bacterial species known to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites). MaaT013 aims to restore the symbiotic relationship between the patient’s functional gut microbiome and their immune system to correct the responsiveness and tolerance of immune functions and thus reduce steroid-resistant  gastrointestinal-predominant aGvHD. MaaT013 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology. Committed to treating cancer and Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  a serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation  MaaT Pharma has already achieved proof of concept in a Phase II clinical trial in acute GvHD. Its powerful discovery and analysis platform  gutPrint®  supports the development and expansion of its pipeline by determining novel disease targets  evaluating drug candidates  and identifying biomarkers for microbiome-related conditions.The company’s Microbiome Ecosystem Therapies are produced through a standardized cGMP manufacturing and quality control process to safely deliver the full diversity of the microbiome  in liquid and oral formulations. MaaT Pharma benefits from the commitment of world-leading scientists and established relationships with regulators to support the integration of the use of microbiome therapies in clinical practice.MaaT Pharma is listed on Euronext Paris (ticker: MAAT).Forward-looking StatementsAll statements other than statements of historical fact included in this press release about future events are subject to (i) change without notice and (ii) factors beyond the Company’s control.

With a capacity of 260 megawatts  the plant will begin production in the first half of 2023.The SSM3-6 plant is backed by a 14-year power sales contract with Copel  a Brazilian Utiliy and historical partner of Voltalia:Copel has been Voltalia's partner in the SMG wind farm (108 megawatts) since 2015 as a minority shareholder.In 2021  Copel acquired 100% of the VSM2 and VSM4 wind farms (187 megawatts in total)  which will continue to be maintained by Voltalia over the long term.Copel is one of the buyers of electricity from the SSM1&2 solar park (for 270 megawatts)  currently under construction.SSM3-6 is part of the Serra Branca complex. Entirely developed by Voltalia and located in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte  Serra Branca is the largest wind and solar complex in the world with a potential capacity of 2.4 gigawatts.

The site enjoys exceptional levels of wind and sunshine. In addition  the two energy sources are complementary  as the wind blows mainly at night in Serra Branca. The projects in the complex also benefit from common infrastructure (grid connection and access) and operational synergies. Thus  the construction of SSM3-6 (260 megawatts) will extend the ongoing construction of SSM1&2 (320 megawatts). In a second phase  SSM3-6 will be operated and maintained by the Voltalia teams in charge of the rest of this giant complex.Story continues""With the launch of the construction of SSM3-6  Voltalia continues to ramp up its Serra Branca complex  alone or alongside partners such as Copel.

Asthma causes inflammation and narrowing of the bronchial tubes  which leads to limited airflow and difficulty breathingiii. People with severe asthma experience difficulty breathing  coughing  wheezing  and are at risk for life-threatening asthma attacks  which may require visits to the emergency room or hospitalizationiv v. Some people with severe asthma can manage their symptoms with inhaled corticosteroids  while other people require different or additional kinds of medicine to manage their disease.Asthma is the third-most common chronic disease among Canadiansvi vii  and the most common chronic disease in Canadian children: 15% - 25% of Canadian children are diagnosed with asthmaviii.Sheila DeVriesMother of a child with severe asthma""My daughter Payton's severe asthma has definitely affected everyone in our family as we help protect her and keep her healthy  so she doesn't suffer more than she already does. From wheezing and coughing episodes to numerous trips to emergency and overnight hospital stays—we just want her to be able to run and play without constantly being wheezy and struggling to catch her breath.""Vanessa ForanPresident and CEO  Asthma Canada""It's exciting to see innovation in this space and a new medication to help children living with severe asthma  where there are very few treatment options. Anything that makes life easier for a child to run around  play  and go to school—the way kids should be able to—is a tool worth having.""About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant.

1699,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-xenpozyme-olipudase-alfa-070000320.html,Press Release: Xenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) approved in Japan  first and only approved therapy indicated to treat acid sphingomyelinase deficiency,Xenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) approved in Japan  first and only approved therapy indicated to treat acid sphingomyelinase deficiency Xenpozyme represents first...,Sanofi - Aventis GroupeXenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) approved in Japan  first and only approved therapy indicated to treat acid sphingomyelinase deficiencyXenpozyme represents first Sanofi therapy to be approved under the SAKIGAKE ‘fast-track’ designationApproval based on positive results from two separate clinical trials in children and adults demonstrating improvement in lung function (as measured by DLco) and reduction of spleen and liver volumesParis  March 28  2022. The Japanese Ministry of Health  Labor  and Welfare (MHLW) has granted marketing authorization for Xenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with non-central nervous system (non-CNS) manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD)  a rare  progressive  and potentially life-threatening genetic disease. Xenpozyme is currently the only approved treatment for ASMD and represents Sanofi’s first therapy to be approved under the SAKIGAKE (or “pioneer”) designation  which is the Japanese government’s regulatory fast-track pathway to promote research and development of innovative new medical products addressing urgent unmet medical needs.John Reed  M.D.  Ph.DExecutive Vice President  Global Head of Research and Development  Sanofi“Today’s approval of Xenpozyme is a watershed moment for ASMD patients and their families  representing 20 years of research and the shared efforts of advocacy partners  clinicians  and patients. As the world’s first medicine approved for ASMD  Xenpozyme offers a potentially transformative option for this historically neglected community. We are proud of this achievement and grateful that Japan’s PDMA has recognized the significance of the unmet need that Xenpozyme addresses with the Sakigake designation. At Sanofi  we are working with health authorities globally  including the EU where olipudase alfa has PRIME designation and in the USA where this enzyme replacement therapy has Breakthrough designation  to rush this important medicine to ASMD patients around the world.”Story continuesXenpozyme is a recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase enzyme developed to replace deficient or defective acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)  an enzyme that allows for the breakdown of the lipid sphingomyelin. Accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells can cause harm to the lungs  spleen  and liver  as well as other organs  potentially leading to early death.The approval of Xenpozyme in Japan is based on positive results from the ASCEND and ASCEND-Peds clinical trials  showing that Xenpozyme provided improvement in lung function (as measured by diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide  or DLco) and reduction of spleen and liver volumes  with a well-tolerated safety profile in adults and children with ASMD. These data were presented at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2020 Virtual Meeting.Xenpozyme has been evaluated in children and adults to treat non-CNS manifestations of ASMD type A/B and ASMD type B. Xenpozyme has not been studied in patients with ASMD type A.Historically known as Niemann-Pick disease types A  A/B  and B  ASMD is a genetically-based  progressive  and potentially life-threatening disease. ASMD represents a spectrum of disease  with two types that may represent opposite ends of a continuum referred to as ASMD type A and ASMD type B. ASMD type A/B is an intermediate form that includes varying degrees of CNS involvement. Until now  no approved therapies for ASMD have been available anywhere in the world.Outside of Japan  olipudase alfa is being evaluated by regulatory authorities around the world. A Biologics License Application (BLA) for olipudase alfa was accepted for Priority Review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  with a decision expected early Q3 2022. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has awarded olipudase alfa the PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation  and a decision is anticipated in the second half of 2022.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

March 28  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eagle Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (Nasdaq: EGRX) (“Eagle” or the “Company”) today announced it has reached agreement on the terms of a transfer of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Acacia Pharma Group plc (“Acacia Pharma”) (EURONEXT: ACPH) to Eagle by way of a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the United Kingdom’s Companies Act 2006 (the “Scheme”).The terms of the proposed transaction value Acacia Pharma’s existing issued and to be issued share capital at approximately €94 700 000  or the equivalent of €0.90 per share. Each shareholder of Acacia Pharma would receive  as consideration for each share of Acacia Pharma held by such shareholder  €0.68 in cash and 0.0049 shares of common stock of Eagle. The terms of the proposed transaction also provide for Eagle to guarantee approximately €25.0 million of debt within the Acacia Pharma group. In connection with the proposed transaction  (i) the Company and Acacia Pharma entered into a co-operation agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) on March 27  2022 and (ii) certain shareholders and directors owning shares in the capital of Acacia delivered to the Company and Acacia deeds of irrevocable undertaking.The proposed transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close in late Q2 2022  subject to approval by Acacia Pharma’s shareholders and the sanction of the High Court of England and Wales and customary closing conditions for transactions of this type. There is no assurance that the proposed transaction will be consummated on the proposed terms or timing or at all.Story continuesThe proposed transaction is expected to provide Eagle with two currently marketed  acute care  hospital products with the potential to disrupt the marketplace:BARHEMSYS® is the first and only antiemetic approved by the FDA for rescue treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) despite prophylaxis. Eagle currently calls on healthcare providers and institutions representing over 70% of the expected BARHEMSYS addressable market opportunity.BARHEMSYS is also approved for the treatment of PONV in patients who have not received prophylaxis and for the prevention of PONV. The total estimated annual U.S. addressable market for prophylaxis and rescue is $2.7 billion  andBYFAVO® is indicated for the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults undergoing procedures lasting 30 minutes or less  with an estimated total addressable market in procedural sedation of more than $0.4 billion per year in the U.S.2“We are delighted to announce that we have agreed to terms for the proposed acquisition of Acacia Pharma. This will be a very important acquisition for us  both financially and strategically. In recent years  the pharmaceutical industry has witnessed slower uptake of new products and longer ramp periods. In the face of further challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic  many smaller underfunded companies experienced significant hurdles launching products. We therefore believe that Eagle is well suited to drive uptake of these two new products  building from Acacia Pharma’s established foundation since its launch  through our experienced and specialized hospital-based sales organization with minimal additional infrastructure ” stated Scott Tarriff  President and Chief Executive Officer of Eagle Pharmaceuticals.“We have been extremely disciplined in managing our balance sheet over the years  and we believe that the proposed acquisition is a wise use of the cash we have generated. With these two products  together with landiolol  which is on track for an NDA submission to the FDA in May of this year  Eagle will potentially have three NCEs going into their launch phase. We believe these efforts will strengthen our leadership position in the hospital and oncology space and establish a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth and bring value to our shareholders ” concluded Tarriff.“We believe that BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO address unmet clinical needs and are nearing usage inflection points  with strong formulary acceptance  and that with our longstanding relationships in the hospital space  we can accelerate uptake and capture the commercial potential of these assets. In doing so  we strive to impact and improve the care of patients undergoing medical treatments such as surgery and invasive procedures. Additionally  their value to anesthesia providers  who are key users  is important  facilitating precision medicine for patients. We see our sales infrastructure as a strategic asset  and as we add to our commercial product portfolio going forward  we plan to expand the size of our salesforce over the next two years ” stated Michael Moran  Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer of Eagle Pharmaceuticals.Proposed Transaction RationaleOpportunity for Eagle’s highly skilled hospital-based salesforce to integrate and promote BYFAVO and BARHEMSYS and to leverage longstanding relationships to realize the full potential of these assets.Anticipated strong synergistic fit with Eagle’s current and expanding portfolio of hospital products and other expected cost synergies.Attractive opportunity to accelerate Eagle’s existing growth strategy and further its advantage in acute care.Commercial stage  NCE products with long patent duration through 2031 would add complementary and diversified revenue streams to Eagle.Eagle’s strong financial position enables it to invest in this opportunity for potential significant value creation.Compelling commercial opportunity in both FDA-approved products: BARHEMSYS is the first and only antiemetic approved for rescue treatment of PONV despite prophylaxis and offers the potential for savings to hospitals and ambulatory centers. BYFAVO addresses an unmet need in procedural sedation by offering a fast-acting agent with a favorable safety profile versus other current treatments.Expected to be earnings accretive in 2024.Product Descriptions and Potential Commercial OpportunityBARHEMSYS® (amisulpride for injection)3 is the first and only FDA-approved product for PONV rescue after failed prophylaxis4. It is a selective dopamine D 2 /D 3 antagonist with a broad  differentiated label. PONV is a common complication of surgery  occurring in approximately 30% of all surgical patients and 80% of high-risk patients. PONV is associated with the use of anesthetic gases and opioid painkillers and is particularly common following gynecological  abdominal  breast  eye  and ear operations  especially those lasting an hour or more. PONV can delay hospital discharge; result in re-admission after in-patient procedures; and lead to day-case patients being admitted to the hospital  all of which can result in significantly increased healthcare costs.By reducing these risks  BARHEMSYS® offers the potential for significant economic savings to hospitals and ambulatory centers. Approximately 70 million invasive surgical patients receive antiemetic prophylaxis annually in the U.S. Approximately 10 million of these patients per year require PONV rescue treatment. BARHEMSYS is the only drug with an FDA-approved indication to treat patients who have failed PONV prophylaxis. It has an established safety profile and efficacy demonstrated in controlled clinical studies. BARHEMSYS® is nonsedating  a common complaint of standard antiemetic agents. Patients experiencing PONV who were treated in a pivotal clinical trial and failed prophylaxis were treated with BARHEMSYS. These patients were observed to have shorter post-anesthesia care (PACU) and hospital stays then patients who were not. Please see Important Safety Information for BARHEMSYS  below.BYFAVO® (remimazolam for injection)5 is a rapid onset/offset procedural sedative with an established safety and efficacy profile. Additional benefits include predictability and a readily available reversal agent. Please see Important Safety Information  including boxed warning  below.BYFAVO has a compelling commercial opportunity  addressing a clear unmet need. There has been no innovation in the sedation space for over 20 years. Customers seek a fast onset  titratability  and rapid recovery for quick discharge  and shorter procedure times allow for increased procedural volumes. BYFAVO has a broad label and potential health economic benefits and may enable shorter procedure times and greater patient throughput. It is indicated for procedural sedation in adults in procedures lasting 30 minutes or less and has a substantial clinical data package demonstrating efficacy and safety in colonoscopies and bronchoscopies  including the most challenging patients.Terms of the Proposed Transaction and FinancingThe terms of the proposed transaction value Acacia Pharma’s existing issued and to be issued share capital at approximately €94.7 million. The cash consideration payable by Eagle under the terms of the transaction would be approximately €71.6 million. The cash consideration payable by Eagle under the terms of the proposed transaction is expected to be financed by existing cash resources of Eagle. The remaining approximately €23.2 million consideration payable by Eagle is expected to be paid in shares of Eagle common stock. The terms of the proposed transaction also provide for Eagle to guarantee approximately €25.0 million of debt within the Acacia Pharma groupConditions to Closing and Anticipated TimingThe Scheme is expected to become effective between the middle of May 2022 and June 30th  2022  and is subject to closing conditions including  among other things  obtaining the requisite approval of Acacia Pharma’s shareholders and the sanction of the High Court of England and Wales by June 30  2022  which date may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. There is no assurance that the proposed transaction will be consummated on the proposed terms or timing or at all.AdvisorsCooley (UK) LLP is acting as legal advisor and William Blair & Company  L.L.C. is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Eagle Pharmaceuticals in connection with the proposed transaction.

The recommended dosage is 5 mg or 10 mg as a single intravenous (IV) dose infused over 1 to 2 minutes.Avoid BARHEMSYS in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients taking droperidol.Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is recommended in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias/cardiac conduction disorders  electrolyte abnormalities (e.g.  hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia)  congestive heart failure  and in patients taking other medicinal products (e.g.  ondansetron) or with other medical conditions known to prolong the QT interval.Adverse ReactionsCommon adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 5 mg (n=748) and at a higher rate than placebo (n=741) in clinical trials for the prevention of PONV were: chills (4% vs. 3%)  hypokalemia (4% vs. 2%)  procedural hypotension (3% vs. 2%)  and abdominal distention (2% vs. 1%).Serum prolactin concentrations were measured in one prophylaxis study where 5% (9/176) of BARHEMSYS-treated patients had increased blood prolactin reported as an adverse reaction compared with 1% (1/166) of placebo-treated patients.The most common adverse reaction  reported in ≥ 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 10 mg (n=418) and at a higher rate than placebo (n=416)  in clinical trials for the treatment of PONV was infusion site pain (6% vs. 4%).Use in Specific PopulationsLactationAmisulpride is present in human milk. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed child and no information on the effects of amisulpride on milk production.BARHEMSYS may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels  which may lead to a reversible increase in maternal milk production. In a clinical trial  serum prolactin concentrations in females (n=112) increased from a mean of 10 ng/mL at baseline to 32 ng/mL after BARHEMSYS treatment and from 10 ng/mL to 19 ng/mL in males (n=61). No clinical consequences due to elevated prolactin levels were reported.To minimize exposure to a breastfed infant  lactating women may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk for 48 hours after receiving a dose of BARHEMSYS.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.Geriatric UseNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients  and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients  but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.Renal ImpairmentAvoid BARHEMSYS in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). The pharmacokinetics of amisulpride in patients with severe renal impairment have not been adequately studied in clinical trials. Amisulpride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys  and patients with severe renal impairment may have increased systemic exposure and an increased risk of adverse reactions.No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment(eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2).Drug InteractionsBARHEMSYS causes dose- and concentration-dependent QT prolongation. To avoid potential additive effects  avoid use of BARHEMSYS in patients taking droperidol.ECG monitoring is recommended in patients taking other drugs known to prolong the QT interval (e.g.  ondansetron).Reciprocal antagonism of effects occurs between dopamine agonists (e.g.  levodopa) and BARHEMSYS. Avoid using levodopa with BARHEMSYS.Important Safety Information for BYFAVO™ (remimazolam) InjectionIndicationsBYFAVO is a benzodiazepine indicated for the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults undergoing procedures lasting 30 minutes or less.Important Safety InformationWARNING: PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT FOR MONITORING AND RESUSCITATION AND RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOID ANALGESICSPersonnel and Equipment for Monitoring and ResuscitationOnly personnel trained in the administration of procedural sedation  and not involved in the conduct of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure  should administer BYFAVO.Administering personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction  hypoventilation  and apnea  including the maintenance of a patent airway  supportive ventilation  and cardiovascular resuscitation.BYFAVO has been associated with hypoxia  bradycardia  and hypotension. Continuously monitor vital signs during sedation and during the recovery period.Resuscitative drugs  and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag-valve-mask–assisted ventilation must be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO.Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioid Analgesics and Other Sedative-HypnoticsConcomitant use of benzodiazepines  including BYFAVO  and opioid analgesics may result in profound sedation  respiratory depression  coma  and death. The sedative effect of intravenous BYFAVO can be accentuated by concomitantly administered CNS depressant medications  including other benzodiazepines and propofol. Continuously monitor patients for respiratory depression and depth of sedation.ContraindicationBYFAVO is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to dextran 40 or products containing dextran 40.Personnel and Equipment for Monitoring and ResuscitationClinically notable hypoxia  bradycardia  and hypotension were observed in Phase 3 studies of BYFAVO. Continuously monitor vital signs during sedation and through the recovery period. Only personnel trained in the administration of procedural sedation  and not involved in the conduct of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure  should administer BYFAVO. Administering personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction  hypoventilation  and apnea  including the maintenance of a patent airway  supportive ventilation  and cardiovascular resuscitation. Resuscitative drugs  and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag-valve-mask–assisted ventilation must be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO. Consider the potential for worsened cardiorespiratory depression prior to using BYFAVO concomitantly with other drugs that have the same potential (e.g.  opioid analgesics or other sedative-hypnotics). Administer supplemental oxygen to sedated patients through the recovery period. A benzodiazepine reversal agent (flumazenil) should be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO.Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioid Analgesics and Other Sedative-HypnoticsConcomitant use of BYFAVO and opioid analgesics may result in profound sedation  respiratory depression  coma  and death. The sedative effect of IV BYFAVO can be accentuated when administered with other CNS depressant medications (eg  other benzodiazepines and propofol). Titrate the dose of BYFAVO when administered with opioid analgesics and sedative-hypnotics to the desired clinical response. Continuously monitor sedated patients for hypotension  airway obstruction  hypoventilation  apnea  and oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects may be more likely to occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea  the elderly  and ASA-PS class III or IV patients.Hypersensitivity ReactionsBYFAVO contains dextran 40  which can cause hypersensitivity reactions  including rash  urticaria  pruritus  and anaphylaxis. BYFAVO is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to dextran 40 or products containing dextran 40.Neonatal SedationUse of benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression  lethargy  hypotonia) in the neonate. Observe newborns for signs of sedation and manage accordingly.Pediatric NeurotoxicityPublished animal studies demonstrate that anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of this is not clear. However  the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery  other procedures  or tests that cannot be delayed  and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions reported in >10% of patients (N=630) receiving BYFAVO 5-30 mg (total dose) and undergoing colonoscopy (two studies) or bronchoscopy (one study) were: hypotension  hypertension  diastolic hypertension  systolic hypertension  hypoxia  and diastolic hypotension.Use in Specific PopulationsPregnancyThere are no data on the specific effects of BYFAVO on pregnancy. Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to benzodiazepines during pregnancy and labor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression.LactationMonitor infants exposed to BYFAVO through breast milk for sedation  respiratory depression  and feeding problems. A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 5 hours after BYFAVO administration.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. BYFAVO should not be used in patients less than 18 years of age.Geriatric UseNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. However  there is a potential for greater sensitivity (eg  faster onset  oversedation  confusion) in some older individuals. Administer supplemental doses of BYFAVO slowly to achieve the level of sedation required and monitor all patients closely for cardiorespiratory complications.Hepatic ImpairmentIn patients with severe hepatic impairment  the dose of BYFAVO should be carefully titrated to effect. Depending on the overall status of the patient  lower frequency of supplemental doses may be needed to achieve the level of sedation required for the procedure. All patients should be monitored for sedation-related cardiorespiratory complications.Abuse and DependenceBYFAVO is a federally controlled substance (CIV) because it contains remimazolam which has the potential for abuse and physical dependence._____________________________________1 These estimates are the result of market research performed by or for Eagle Pharmaceuticals.2 These estimates are the result of market research performed by or for Eagle Pharmaceuticals.3 https://bynder.acaciapharma.com/m/5d7c2cd0d58865f7/original/Barhemsys-Prescribing-Information.pdf4 FDA labels for other recommended treatments do not include treatment after failed prophylaxis.5 https://bynder.acaciapharma.com/m/403e8c343b2922de/original/Byfavo-PI.pdf,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,mixed,0.39,0.2,0.41,True,English,"['Acacia Pharma Group plc', 'Eagle Pharmaceuticals', 'Terms', 'annual U.S. addressable market', 'specialized hospital-based sales organization', 'many smaller underfunded companies', 'two U.S. Food', 'BARHEMSYS addressable market opportunity', 'Acacia Pharma Group plc', 'specialized hospital-based salesforce', 'investor conference call', 'customary closing conditions', 'total addressable market', 'longer ramp periods', 'minimal additional infrastructure', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'sustainable long-term growth', 'unmet clinical needs', 'usage inflection points', 'new chemical entities', 'strong strategic fit', 'strong formulary acceptance', 'significant financial synergies', 'acute care footprint', 'two new products', 'U.S.2', 'two products', 'significant hurdles', 'Companies Act', 'Acacia deeds', 'strong foundation', 'Drug Administration', 'patent life', 'WOODCLIFF LAKE', 'N.J.', 'GLOBE NEWSWIRE', 'United Kingdom', 'common stock', 'irrevocable undertaking', 'late Q2 2022', 'High Court', 'postoperative nausea', 'healthcare providers', 'procedural sedation', 'pharmaceutical industry', 'COVID-19 pandemic', 'balance sheet', 'wise use', 'NDA submission', 'leadership position', 'oncology space', 'longstanding relationships', 'medical treatments', 'co-operation agreement', 'Cooperation Agreement', 'hospital products', 'hospital space', 'Commercialized assets', 'recent years', 'Scott Tarriff', 'three NCEs', 'launch phase', 'commercial potential', 'important acquisition', 'slower uptake', 'Eagle Pharmaceuticals', 'share capital', 'rescue treatment', 'transaction value', 'transaction Company', 'BARHEMSYS®', 'Expects', 'FDA', 'amisulpride', 'injection', 'BYFAVO', 'remimazolam', 'Thursday', 'March', '8:30am', 'Nasdaq', 'EGRX', 'terms', 'transfer', 'EURONEXT', 'ACPH', 'way', 'scheme', 'arrangement', 'Part', 'equivalent', 'shareholder', 'consideration', 'cash', '0.0049 shares', 'debt', 'connection', 'directors', 'boards', 'approval', 'sanction', 'England', 'Wales', 'transactions', 'type', 'assurance', 'timing', 'Story', 'marketplace', 'antiemetic', 'vomiting', 'PONV', 'prophylaxis', 'institutions', 'expected', 'patients', 'prevention', 'induction', 'maintenance', 'adults', 'procedures', 'face', 'challenges', 'experienced', 'President', 'landiolol', 'track', 'May', 'efforts', 'surgery', 'invasiv']",2022-03-28,2022-03-28,finance.yahoo.com

Driven by the growth in our digital marketing and insurance activities  our net sales climbed 18% to €164.3m. Supported by our robust management  our consolidated net income recorded sustained growth  up 47% to €9.1m.These good results once again reflect our Group’s sound foundations. Our resilience is supported by the recurrence of our portfolio-based activities and our sales of magazine subscriptions and insurance policies. The diversity of our digital marketing activities is further strengthening our growth; these business lines generated 45% of the Group’s net sales in 2021  compared with 37% in 2020.In line with our Ambition 2025 plan to become a European leader for data marketing  we are continuing to further strengthen our positions with complementary areas of expertise  as we were able to do in 2021 with Intelligence Senior and Reech in our marketing engineering business  as well as the acquisition of the assets of QAPE  an InsurTech firm that is enabling us to accelerate our growth in the insurance sector. Alongside this  our outstanding capacity for innovation is enabling us to capitalize more effectively on the Group’s many areas of technological expertise to support data marketing.The DÉKUPLE Group has a robust financial position  enabling it to finance its development. Despite the ongoing health and geopolitical crises  I am very confident that we will be able to adapt and continue building on our growth. Thanks to the dedication shown by our 700 staff  we will be able to make 2022 another year of success”.Story continuesKEY DEVELOPMENTSIn 2021  the DÉKUPLE Group recorded strong growth in business despite the uncertainty relating to the economic and health situation.The portfolio-based activities confirmed the resilience of their business model  generating recurrent revenues. Despite an unfavorable basis for comparison and a contraction in the returns on commercial campaigns  net sales for the Magazine business were stable in 2021  with the development of the partnership-based subscription offers offsetting the impact of the discontinuation of prospecting under the France Abonnements brand since 2020. The Insurance business (+24%) maintained its regular growth by notably diversifying its product mix to include Health insurance and further strengthening its capacity for future growth with the acquisition of strategic assets from the InsurTech firm QAPE  as well as various assets from its supplementary health branch KOVERS.The Digital Marketing business (marketing engineering and consulting)  which represents 45% of consolidated net sales  ramped up its growth (+46%). These activities are benefiting from the robust expansion of Converteo and its Consulting activities against a backdrop of the digitalization and datafication of businesses and their marketing in particular. The Marketing Engineering business  held back by the ongoing health crisis  was further strengthened during the year through two external growth operations: i) in February  the acquisition of an interest in Intelligence Senior (previously Grand Mercredi Group)  specialized in silver economy marketing  and ii) in September  the acquisition of Reech  an influence marketing expert.EARNINGSConsolidated net sales1 came to €164.3m  up 17.9% compared with 2020  while the gross margin2 is up 12.8% to €134.6m.Against a backdrop of sustained investments  with major recruitment efforts  restated EBITDA3 came to €20.3m  up €5.7m versus the previous year  to represent 15.1% of the full-year gross margin.Operating income came to €14.8m  representing 11.0% of the gross margin  compared with 7.8% in 2020. This progress primarily reflects the increase in earnings for ADLPartner SA  driven by the realignment of commercial investments in the Magazine business  the reduction of the accounting loss for the Insurance business  and the stronger results recorded by the Digital Marketing business.After factoring in a higher tax expense (€4.6m)  consolidated net income totaled €9.1m in 2021  up 46.7% from 2020.After deducting minority interests  net income (Group share) represents €8.5m  with a net margin rate of 6.3%  versus 5.4% in 2020.Consolidated data (€m) 2019 2020 2021 Change2021/2020 Net sales 138.64 139.31 164.25 +17.9% Gross margin 122.06 119.33 134.65 +12.8% Restated EBITDA3% of gross margin 12.2510 0% 14.6512.3% 20.3215.1% +38.7% Operating income% of gross margin 7.676.3% 9.317.8% 14.8211.0% +59.2% Consolidated net income% of gross margin 5.234.3% 6.215.2% 9.116.8% +46.7% Net income (Group share)% of gross margin 5.434.5% 6.495.4% 8.496.3% +30.9%FINANCIAL STRUCTUREConsolidated shareholders’ equity represented €30.8m at 31 December 2021  up €7.6m from 31 December 2020  primarily taking into consideration income for the year (+€9.1m) and the ordinary dividend paid out in June 2021 (-€3.2m). This development also factors in the changes in the scope for consolidation (+€0.8m)  as well as the impact of the shares held as treasury stock and the bonus shares awarded (+€0.8m).The Group had €38.8m of cash at 31 December 2021  compared with €42.0m at 31 December 2020. Financial debt represents €20.6m  compared with €13.3m at 31 December 2020  primarily comprising commitments to buy out the minority interests in Converteo  Dékuple Ingénierie Marketing BtoB (previously AWE)  Intelligence Senior and Reech.The bank financing set up during the first half of 2022 based on fixed-rate confirmed lines and loans with maturities of 5 to 7 years will enable the Group to refinance the external growth operations carried out in 2021 and further strengthen its capacity to continue moving forward with its external growth strategy  while benefiting from attractive market conditions.OUTLOOKIn line with Ambition 2025  the DÉKUPLE Group is continuing to roll out its expansion strategy aiming to become a European leader for data marketing. With the Group’s robust financial resources  it is effectively positioned to support aggressive growth in digital marketing with a view to strengthening its positions in this sector  while moving forward with its commercial investments in its portfolio-based activities generating recurrent revenues.DIVIDENDConsidering the results achieved in 2021 and the investments planned for 2022  the Board of Directors will submit a proposal at the General Shareholders’ Meeting on 17 June for a dividend of €0.88 per share for 2021  to be paid out on 24 June 2022.ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONThe corporate and consolidated financial statements for 2021 were approved by the Board of Directors on 25 March 2022.

For acquisition and management commissions linked to sales of insurance policies  net sales comprise current and future commissions issued  acquired by the accounting reporting date  net of cancellations.2 For the digital marketing business  the gross margin represents the total amount of net sales (total invoices issued: fees  commissions and purchases charged back to customers) less the total amount of costs for external purchases made on behalf of customers. It is equal to net sales for the magazine and insurance business lines.3 EBITDA (earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization) is restated for the IFRS 2 impact of bonus share awards and the IFRS 16 impact relating to the restatement of lease charges.Attachment,neutral,0.44,0.5,0.06,mixed,0.68,0.21,0.12,True,English,"['Strong earnings growth', 'Dékuple', '2021', 'supplementary health branch KOVERS', 'DÉKUPLE Group Chairman', 'two external growth operations', 'The DÉKUPLE Group', 'cross-channel data marketing expert', 'The Digital Marketing business', 'The Marketing Engineering business', 'influence marketing expert', 'partnership-based subscription offers', 'France Abonnements brand', 'major recruitment efforts', 'higher tax expense', 'silver economy marketing', 'The Insurance business', 'Grand Mercredi Group', 'robust financial position', 'digital marketing activities', 'net margin rate', 'ongoing health crisis', 'Consolidated net sales1', 'full-year gross margin', 'Consolidated net income', 'STRONG EARNINGS GROWTH', 'Health insurance', 'Consolidated data', 'business lines', 'business model', 'Magazine business', 'health situation', 'robust management', 'robust expansion', 'full-year earnings', 'strong growth', 'Operating income', 'insurance activities', 'insurance policies', 'insurance sector', 'gross margin2', 'European leader', 'Bertrand Laurioz', 'good results', 'sound foundations', 'portfolio-based activities', 'magazine subscriptions', 'complementary areas', 'Intelligence Senior', 'InsurTech firm', 'many areas', 'geopolitical crises', 'KEY DEVELOPMENTS', 'recurrent revenues', 'unfavorable basis', 'commercial campaigns', 'product mix', 'sustained investments', 'ADLPartner SA', 'commercial investments', 'accounting loss', 'stronger results', 'minority interests', 'Group share', 'sustained growth', 'regular growth', 'future growth', 'strategic assets', 'various assets', 'outstanding year', 'Ambition 2025 plan', 'outstanding capacity', 'technological expertise', 'Consulting activities', 'previous year', 'EBITDA', 'dividend', 'Paris', '28 March', '00am', 'CEO', 'constraints', 'transformation', 'resilience', 'recurrence', 'diversity', 'positions', 'Reech', 'acquisition', 'QAPE', 'innovation', 'dedication', '700 staff', 'success', 'Story', 'uncertainty', 'economic', 'contraction', 'returns', 'impact', 'discontinuation', 'prospecting', 'Converteo', 'backdrop', 'digitalization', 'datafication', 'businesses', 'February', 'September', 'progress', 'increase', 'realignment', 'reduction', 'Change', '2021', '2022']",2022-03-28,2022-03-28,finance.yahoo.com

1704,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220327005104/en/EIG-and-Fluxys-Partner-in-Key-LNG-Infrastructure-Supporting-Decarbonization-in-Chile,EIG and Fluxys Partner in Key LNG Infrastructure Supporting Decarbonization in Chile,WASHINGTON & BRUSSELS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EIG  a leading institutional investor to the global energy and infrastructure sectors  and Fluxys  a leading energy infrastructure company  today announced that they jointly will acquire an 80% equity stake in GNL Quint…,WASHINGTON & BRUSSELS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--EIG  a leading institutional investor to the global energy and infrastructure sectors  and Fluxys  a leading energy infrastructure company  today announced that they jointly will acquire an 80% equity stake in GNL Quintero S.A. (“Quintero”)  the largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification terminal in Chile  from Enagas Chile SpA and affiliates of OMERS Infrastructure. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.Quintero is a key energy infrastructure business supporting Chile’s decarbonization strategy with a bridging fuel that allows for the reconciliation of economic growth with the uptake of renewables and the phasing out of coal. Operational since 2009  Quintero is the largest terminal for receiving and unloading LNG in Chile  as well as for its storage and regasification capacities. The terminal benefits from its strategic location in Quintero Bay  supplying a diversified base of customers in central Chile across residential  commercial  industrial  transportation and power generation sectors. The terminal owns 75% of the country´s LNG regasification capacity and in 2021  67% of the total natural gas imports (both LNG and pipeline imports) arrived in Chile through this strategic asset. With a daily regasification capacity of 15 million m3  an LNG storage capacity of 334 000 m3 and 2 500 m3 per day of truck loading capacity  the terminal is a reliable supplier of natural gas that contributes to Chile’s energy diversification and security.Chile has world-class solar and wind resources and a RES capacity equivalent to 4% of total global energy demand. The country is aiming to become one of the world’s three largest green hydrogen producers with plans to install 200 GW of renewable power by 2040 to produce green hydrogen. Chile already has signed several agreements to promote the export of green hydrogen  among others with the Belgian ports of Antwerp/Zeebrugge  Germany  the Port of Rotterdam and South Korea.The acquisition builds on EIG’s presence in the Chilean market  where the firm owns Cerro Dominador  a groundbreaking solar complex that combines a 100MW photovoltaic (PV) plant with a 110MW concentrated solar power (CSP) plant. The PV plant has been operational since 2017 and the CSP plant was successfully synchronized with Chile’s electricity grid in April 2021. EIG also is a partner in AME S.p.A  a Chile-based project developer and independent power producer. AME co-owns Generadora Metropolitana  the fifth largest electricity generation company in Chile  as well as HIF Global  a leader in the hydrogen and e-fuels sector  with a series of commercial-scale projects in development and expected to reach construction over the next several years.For Fluxys  the partnership is a forward-looking investment creating a foothold in another country in Latin America where the energy transition stands high on the government agenda. With its abundant solar and wind resources  Chile aims to produce the world’s cheapest green hydrogen. The Belgian Hydrogen Import Coalition with Fluxys as partner has affirmed the competitiveness and feasibility of a green molecule supply chain from Chile to Europe and Belgium.“We are thrilled by the opportunity to invest in Quintero  a company that aligns perfectly with our focus on strategic  high-quality infrastructure that is critical to the region it serves and yields attractive  contracted cash flows ” said R. Blair Thomas  EIG’s Chairman and CEO. “We are pleased to be partnering again with Fluxys  a world-class operational partner  to help Quintero support Chile’s energy needs and transition goals with reliable energy. Quintero’s strong presence in natural gas infrastructure serves as an attractive launching point to expand its presence in related and adjacent sectors  including storage  truck loading and regasification  as well as to develop production capacity for green hydrogen  where Quintero has significant potential to be a domestic leader in the nascent industry.”“With 3 LNG terminals in Europe  our ambition to invest outside Europe and to become the transporter of new energy carriers  Quintero is a perfect fit with our strategy for growth in view of the low carbon future”  said Pascal De Buck  Fluxys’ Managing Director and CEO. “We want to deploy and expand our industrial expertise worldwide and are excited to partner with EIG as leading global energy infrastructure investor already intensively involved in energy transition projects in Chile. Our partnership in Quintero brings Fluxys closer to hydrogen developments in Chile and supports the import of hydrogen in Belgium. We are looking forward to collaborating and developing new opportunities with Quintero’s management and workforce.”The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2022  subject to customary closing conditions  including any required merger control and related regulatory approvals.Citigroup Global Markets Inc. acted as financial advisor to EIG and Fluxys in connection with the transaction. White & Case LLP served as EIG’s legal advisor and Linklaters LLP served as Fluxys’ legal advisor.About EIGEIG is a leading institutional investor to the global energy and infrastructure sectors with $23.0 billion under management as of December 31  2021.

A year ago  we hosted a Capital Markets Day to present our sustainable growth outlook to 2023. As we close 2021  we are proud to report solid results driven by revenue growth in all three solutions. Growth was supported by strong acquisition of new customers across our SaaS solutions  a firm rebound in mailing equipment sales outpacing competition again and a strong increase of our parcel lockers installed base. In an environment driven by further digitalization and automation of both communication and financial processes  the usage of our cloud-based platforms recorded a sharp 25% increase. Finally  we continue to benefit from the expansion of e-commerce that is generating higher parcel volumes as evidenced by the greater usage of our growing installed base of connected parcel lockers.Story continuesQuadient’s subscription-based business model proved resilient and the transformation to a more recurring and predictable revenue generation continues with a 4.3% year-over-year organic growth in sales and a 6.0% organic growth in current EBIT  surpassing our initial guidance  and such despite challenging supply chain and Covid-related disruptions. Profitability remains high with a stable EBITDA margin of 23.9% thanks to a more efficient organization and active cost management  while we continued to increase investments in R&D and Go-to-market. Free Cash Flow generation  at €104 million  continued to be strong and drives a healthy financial position with a low level of leverage at 0.4x excluding leasing. Quadient will therefore propose  for approval by the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting  a dividend of €0.55per share  above the floor set under the dividend policy outlined in its ""Back to Growth"" strategic plan. On the back of this strong set of results  we are confidently confirming our prospects: our software solutions are generating an increasingly strong base of annual recurring revenue that will soon exceed €250 million  the profitability of our mail solutions remains well under control at close to 45%  and we are well on track to reach more than 25 000 parcel lockers installed by 2023.”ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH ACROSS ALL SOLUTIONS AND ALL REGIONSGroup sales stood at €1 024 million in 2021  supported by a solid organic sales growth of 4.3% driven by positive growth from all solutions and all geographical areas. The acceleration of the company towards a subscription-based model continues to materialize with subscription-related revenues up 2.8% on an organic basis versus 2020 and now accounting for 67% of the total Group sales.On a reported basis  Group sales went down 0.5% compared to 2020  including a negative currency impact of -0.8% and a negative scope effect of -3.9%. In line with the Company’s strategy to reshape its portfolio  changes of scope are related to the divestments of ProShip in February 2020  the acquisition of YayPay in July 2020  the divestment from the Graphics activity in Australia and New Zealand in January 2021  the acquisition of Beanworks in March 2021 and the disposal of Automated Packaging Systems and the Netherland-based folder-inserters production site in July 2021.Consolidated salesIn million euros 2021 2020 Change Change at constant rates Organic change(1) Major Operations 942 919 2.4% 3.4% 3.0% Intelligent Communication Automation(a b) 201 183 9.4% 9.5% 7.3% Mail-Related Solutions(b) 659 653 0.9% 1.8% 1.8% Parcel Locker Solutions 83 83 -0.7% 2.6% 2.6% Additional Operations 82 110 -25.7% -26.1% 23.2% Group total 1 024 1 029 -0.5% 0.2% 4.3%In million euros 2021 2020 Change Change at constant rates Organic change(1) Major Operations 942 919 2.4% 3.4% 3.0% North America 519 501 3.5% 5.5% 4.7% Main European countries(a) 371 367 1.1% 0.4% 0.4% International(b) 52 51 1.8% 4.2% 4.2% Additional Operations 82 110 -25.7% -26.1% 23.2% Group total 1 024 1 029 -0.5% 0.2% 4.3% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Parcel Locker Solutions in Japan and of Intelligent Communication Automation outside of North America and the Main European countries.Major OperationsSales from Major Operations reached €942 million (92% of total sales) in 2021  a 3.0% year-over-year organic growth. All three solutions and all regions contributed to this positive performance.Sales in North America (55% of Major Operations) were up 4.7% organically to €519 million. This was mainly driven by the double-digit increase from cloud-based solutions  Intelligent Communication Automation  with strong customer gains from cross-selling and the deployment of newly-acquired SaaS fintech companies (Beanworks and YayPay). Solid hardware sales from Mail-Related Solutions also contributed to the positive performance  whilst Parcel Locker Solutions suffered from a high comparison basis with Lowe’s contract roll-out last year.Main European countries (39% of Major Operations) recorded an organic sales growth of 0.4% to €371 million. Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions posted solid sales growth in the main European markets  with Parcel Locker Solutions delivering the fastest growth thanks to on-going deployment of existing contracts with retailers and the gain of new ones. Sales from Mail-Related Solutions were stable  proving their resilience.The International segment (6% of Major Operations) delivered a solid organic sales growth (+4.2%)  with Parcel Locker Solutions being the main driver of performance thanks to a steady increase of the installed base in Japan.Intelligent Communication AutomationSales from Intelligent Communication Automation cloud-based solutions (21% of Major Operations) were up 7.3% organically reaching for the first time more than €200 million (€201 million in 2021)  a solid performance helped by strong customer acquisition. The number of Intelligent Communication Automation net new (after churn) customers grew by over 2 800 over the course of 2021  closing the year in excess of 11 800. The recent acquisition of Beanworks as well as the deployment of YayPay helped drive this dynamic customer acquisition trend with around 350 new AP/AR customers  including strong cross-selling opportunities. Cross-selling accounted overall for two thirds of new Intelligent Communication Automation customers.In line with the Company's strategy  the shift in revenue model continues to accelerate  driven by the growing demand for cloud-based solutions. Subscription-related revenue went up 17.1% organically  now representing 67% of Intelligent Communication Automation sales compared to 59% in 2020. Share of SaaS customers reached 76% at the end of 2021 and annual recurring revenue stood at €147 million at the end of 2021  up from €123 million at the end of 2020. Conversely  license sales went down 26.7% organically  despite one large deal booked in the second quarter of 2021  with Q4 license decline reaching -45%. License sales now account for only 14% of the Solution’s total sales.The Solution profit margin6F6F7 for Intelligent Communication Automation was down 3.9 points year-over-year to 14.7%  on an organic basis. Change of business model  recent targeted acquisitions and planned increased investments related to cloud-platform expansion  additional go-to-market and marketing are transitionally weighing on the profitability of the Solution.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales (70% of Major Operations) stood at €659 million in 2021  up 1.8% organically compared to 2020. This solid performance was driven by a dynamic 12.5% organic growth in hardware sales: placements of new hardware recovered strongly in 2021 thanks to product renewal (launch of the new iX-9 in the US) and a clear focus on customer acquisition and retention. 2021 also turned out to be a record year for high-end production mail folder-inserters.Meanwhile  the Company recorded a limited 2.0% organic decrease in subscription-related revenues (71% of Mail-Related Solutions sales). The resilience of both the installed base and subscription-related revenues remains strong  thanks to multi-year contracts.Overall  thanks to customer acquisition and retention  Mail-Related Solutions growth stood c.3 points above the global market performance7F7F8. This outperformance was most noticeable in the North American market.The Solution Profit Margin6 for Mail-Related Solutions was slightly down 1.0 point organically to 44.2% mainly due to the higher freight costs and supply chain disruptions. Overall  higher freight and sourcing costs amounted to an additional €6million in costs.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales (9% of Major Operations) stood at €83 million in 2021  a 2.6% organic increase compared to 2020. Performance was impacted by the demanding comparison base in hardware sales from the Lowe’s contract in 2020. Hardware sales were sharply down but subscription-related revenues were up 19.1% organically thanks to the roll-out of existing contracts with retailers and carriers in Europe and  to a lesser extent  to the increased installed base in Japan. The lockers’ usage rate continues to improve  reaching 61% at the end of 2021 (versus 57% a year ago)  also contributing to the solid performance in subscription-related revenues.Quadient closed the year with over 15 800 lockers installed globally  well on track to deliver the Company’s 2023 target to reach 25 000 lockers. Over 2 800 lockers were installed in 2021 with over 650 being installed in the fourth quarter of 2021 despite supply chain issues.Solution profit margin6 for Parcel Locker Solutions stood at -4.5% in 2021  a 10.1 points year-over-year organic decline. This was mainly due to the sharp increase in freight costs for new installations and to planned increased R&D and go-to-market investments  whilst the profitability of the installed base remained high at 27%.Additional OperationsRevenue from Additional Operations stood at €82 million in 2021  down 25.7% year-over-year. This decline is mainly due to the disposal of Graphics activities in Australia and New Zealand  and the divestment of the Automated Packing Systems. Additional Operations now only account for 8% of total sales. On an organic basis  however  Additional Operations sales were up 23.2% thanks to a good performance in Parcel Locker Solutions in Sweden while Automated Packing Systems also had a positive contribution before the divestment took place at end-July 2021.Q4 2021 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €273 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  down 5.0% on a reported basis and down 3.3% on an organic basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. This organic decline in revenue is essentially due to a high basis of comparison as the fourth quarter of 2020 coincided with the peak of the roll-out of the Lowe’s contract in Parcel Locker Solutions. In the meantime  thanks to its efforts and agility  the Company succeeded to mitigate the impact of increasing supply chain tensions on hardware manufacturing and shipping delays to ultimately deliver its clients in a timely manner.Major Operations sales stood at €253 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  down 4.4% organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Intelligent Communication Automation sales were up 0.6% organically to €54 million impacted by the change in business model with license declining by -45% in Q4. Mail-Related Solutions sales continued to show strong resilience  reaching €178 million  down by 1.1% only on an organic basis. Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €21 million in fourth quarter of 2021  a sharp 32.1% decline on an organic basis due to the very high comparison basis of the Lowe’s contract deployment.Additional Operations sales stood at €20 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  down 40.9% on a reported basis due to the changes in scope  but up 12.9% on an organic basis.REVIEW OF 2021 FULL-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million 2021 2020 Change Sales 1 024 1 029 (0.5)% Gross profit 744 743 +0.1% Gross margin 72.6% 72.2% EBITDA 245 246 (0.4)% EBITDA margin 23.9% 23.9% Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 147 152(a) (3.3)% Current operating income margin (before acquisition related expenses) 14.4% 14.7%(a) Current operating income 135 132 +2.3% Net attributable income 88 40 +117% Earnings per share 2.32 0.92 +152% Diluted earnings per share 2.17 0.92 +136% (a) Including Parcel Pending’s earn-out reversal for an amount of €6.5 million.

Gross margin benefited from higher activity  a more favourable revenue mix effect in Intelligent Communication Automation SaaS solution as well as from a tight control over costs of sales.Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses stood at €147 million in 2021 up 6.0% on an organic basis compared to €145 million in 2020 (€152 million including the one-off Parcel Pending earn-out reversal). This is mainly reflecting the organic growth in revenue  the improved gross margin  the sustained profitability of the installed base and active management of operating expenses  in particular savings in G&A expenses resulting from further simplification and integration of the organization as well as a reduction of the Group’s real estate footprint. In the meantime  as Quadient continues to invest in its three solutions  planned increased spending in go-to-market and R&D weighed on the profitability  so did the dilutive impact of recently acquired and fast-growing businesses dedicated to financial process automation (YayPay and Beanworks). In addition  the continuous shift in revenue model towards SaaS subscription (as opposed to perpetual licenses) is also impacting the mix in operating income.Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 14.4% of sales in 2021 compared to 14.1% in 2020 excluding Parcel Pending earn-out reversal (14.7% including the earn-out reversal).Acquisition-related expenses stood at €12 million in 2021 compared to €20 million in 2020 mainly due to lower M&A activity. Consequently  current operating income stood at €135 million in 2021  compared to €132 million in 2020.Optimization and other operating expenses stood at €19 million in 2021  a lower amount than in 2020  which stood at €36 million. The improvement reflects the progresses already made by the Group in its repositioning and a signal that the phase II of the Back to Growth strategy is well under way. As a result  operating income stood at €116 million in 2021  a significant improvement on the €96 million recorded in 2020.Net attributable income up c.120%Active debt management  including the early repayment of $85 million USPP in September 2020 and the early repayment of €163 million bond in March 2021  has led to a significant reduction in the net cost of debt for the year. 2021 net cost of debt was €25 million compared to €33 million in 2020.With the €20 million increase in the fair value of its investments in the X’ange 2 and Partech Entrepreneurs private equity funds  the Group recorded €17 million in currency gains and other financial items compared to €1 million in 2020.Overall  net financial result was limited to a loss of €9 million in 2021 compared to a loss of €32 million in 2020.Income tax was down to €20 million in 2021 from €24 million in 2020  which had been impacted by exceptional bookings to cover for potential tax risks in the UK. In 2021  the Group benefited from tax loss carry-back measures in the US in the context of Covid-19 pandemic as well as non-taxable VC capital gains. Consequently  the corporate tax rate stood at 18% in 2021 compared to 36% in 2020.Net attributable income therefore amounted to €88 million in 2021 compared to €40 million in 2020  a c.120% increase.Earnings per share stood at €2.32 in 2021 compared to €0.92 in 2020  while fully diluted EPS was €2.17 in 2021 (€0.92 in 2020).Strong cash flow generationEBITDA9F9F10 stood at €245 million in 2021 compared to €246 million in 2020. EBITDA margin remained stable year-over-year at 23.9% in 2021  thanks to a high contribution from the installed base of customers  for each of the 3 solutions  active cost management and a leaner organization  offsetting the ongoing supply chain issues  the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and increased investments.The change in working capital was negative by €8 million in 2021 compared to a net cash inflow of €2 million in 2020. The decrease in receivables could not fully offset the significant inventory increase to mitigate supply chain disruptions.Lease receivables decreased by €39 million in 2021 compared to a decrease of €62 million in 2020  thanks to a slowdown in the decline of the leasing portfolio.The leasing portfolio and other financing services remained stable year-over-year at €595 million as of 31 January 2022 compared to €598 million as of 31 January 2021 which represents an organic decrease of 6.4% versus an organic decline of 8.7% in 2020. At the end of the financial year 2021  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.7%  a level stable versus 2020.Interest and taxes paid increased sharply to €66 million in 2021 from €37 million in 2020. Whilst interests paid were stable year-over-year  income tax paid rose significantly due to a normalization after the exceptional measures the Group benefited from in 2020 during the Covid-19 related crisis.Capital expenditure was down marginally at €88 million in 2021 compared to €90 million in 2020. Development capex was up to €37 million in 2021 (it was €30 million in 2020) focusing on R&D investments for software developments and higher spending linked with the recent acquisitions. Rented equipment capex was stable year-over-year although reflecting a different mix with higher parcel lockers and lower mail equipment. Maintenance capex was also stable. Of note is the lower renewal of real estate lease as further cost optimization are implemented. This drove down IFRS 16 capex.Cash flow after capital expenditure for the year was down to €104 million in 2021 compared to €167 million in 2020.IMPROVED LEVERAGE AND ROBUST LIQUIDITY POSITIONNet debt was down slightly  despite the acquisition of Beanworks  to €504 million as of 31 January 2022 from €512 million as of 31 January 2021 . The issuance of a €270 Schuldschein in November 2021 has allowed the immediate repayment of €130 million of Schuldschein debt maturing in 2022 and 2023. Post closing (in February 2022)  it has allowed the further repayment of €83 million of Schuldschein debt maturing in 2022 and 2023  whilst the remaining will partly contribute to the repayment of the €265 million ODIRNANE11 bonds by June 2022. The Group has no other significant debt maturity before its €325 million 2.25% bond maturing in 2025.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) remained stable at 2.1x10F10F11. The Group’s net debt is entirely backed by future cash flows generated from its rental  leasing and other financing activities. Excluding leasing  the leverage ratio remained low at 0.4x10 as of 31 January 2022  unchanged year-over-year. And taking ODIRNANE11F11F12 into account as debt  the leverage ratio excluding leasing stands at 2.0x10 EBITDA versus 1.9x10 at the end of 2020.Shareholders’ equity stood at €1 359 million as of 31 January 2022 compared to €1 240 million as of 31 January 2021. The gearing ratio12F12F13 went down to 37% from 41% as of 31 January 2021.As of 31 January 2022  the Group had a robust liquidity position of €887 million  split between €487 million in cash and a €400 million undrawn credit line  the latter maturing in 2024.OUTLOOKGood prospects expected in 2022Double-digit organic sales growth is expected in Intelligent Communication Automation. Customer growth is expected to remain strong  supported by cross-selling and the Beanworks and YayPay deployment outside North America. Increase in SaaS subscriptions and in the use of cloud platforms is anticipated to continue driving further growth in annual recurring revenue.Organic sales decline in Mail-Related Solutions is expected to remain contained. At the end of 2021  backlog levels remain high thanks to solid bookings and due to supply chain longer deliveries time.Double-digit organic sales growth is expected in Parcel Locker Solutions supported by the roll-out of existing contracts and by the ongoing positive momentum with carriers in Europe and Japan. New deals have also been signed in the retail and residential sectors  including a good start in the UK. The pipeline of projects is promising with exciting opportunities ahead in a market which is fast developing.2022 GuidanceAt Group level  full-year 2022 organic sales growth is therefore expected over 2% thanks to solid performances expected from new solutions combined with ongoing resilience of Mail-Related Solutions despite the current uncertainties of the geopolitical situation and ongoing supply chain disruptions.Low to mid-single digit current EBIT2 organic growth13F13F14 is anticipated with margins expected to rise as the profitability of the installed base is expected to continue to improve for both the SaaS activity and parcel lockers  whilst Mail-Related profit margin will be maintained. The Group will continue to benefit from a leaner organization with continuous focus on costs optimization.2023 guidance confirmedBoth sales and current EBIT2 organic growth CAGR guidance over 2021-2023 are confirmed i.e.  a minimum 3% organic sales growth CAGR and a minimum mid-single digit organic growth CAGR of current EBIT before acquisition-related expenses.BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSQuadient receives 'AA' MSCI ESG Rating Recognizing Efforts and Achievements Over the Past Years ParisOn January 24  2022  Quadient announced that it has been awarded an AA rating in the MSCI ESG Ratings dated December 2021.

All volumes in this series will be published in Open Access with financial support from the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (MPIWG).This is the first academic series to explore pre-modern agriculture in its foundational role in informing emergent “sciences” globally. Agriculture is treated as a body of knowledge through which humans learned about their environment; the migration of ideas and practices are traced from texts to other epistemological spaces  from one ancient agriculture and culture to another. By studying historical relationships between knowledge practices and environmental change  the series contributes to the study of science  technology  and medicine  as well as debates in global history  which are very much relevant to environmental issues we are obliged to address within scholarship and beyond.Director of MPIWG’s Department III (Artifacts  Action  Knowledge)  Prof. Dagmar Schäfer  comments: “We are very pleased to partner with Brill in providing an interdisciplinary academic platform for the study of pre-modern history of science in extra-European contexts. We believe this transcultural book series will benefit from and be an innovative addition to Brill’s strong presence in Asian Studies.”Dr. Uri Tadmor  Publishing Director at Brill  adds: “Brill highly values the opportunity to partner with the esteemed Max Planck Institute again. Publishing the series in Open Access will ensure the visibility and discoverability of publications  which we are convinced will contribute to the impact of this important series.”For more information about the series  please contact Prof. Dagmar Schäfer at schaeferoffice@mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de or Chunyan Shu  Acquisitions Editor at Brill  via Chunyan.shu@brill.com  or visit the series webpage.About Brill Founded in 1683 in Leiden  the Netherlands  Brill is a leading international academic publisher in the Humanities  Social Sciences  International Law  and Biology.

""We are proud to add FINTEPLA as a treatment for Dravet syndrome  and now Lennox-Gastaut syndrome  to our portfolio of epilepsy medicines to help reduce the impact and burden of seizures  including severe epilepsy syndromes that have high pediatric morbidity and mortality rates.""The FDA approval was supported by safety and efficacy data from a global  randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial in 263 patients with LGS (age 2-35 years)  which demonstrated that FINTEPLA at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day significantly reduced monthly drop seizures frequency by a median of 23.7% from baseline compared to 8.7% placebo (p=0.0037). Nearly a fourth of those patients on FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day experienced a ≥50% reduction in drop seizure frequency per 28 days; 18% with ≥50% to <75% reduction and 6% ≥75% reduction.1 The common adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with FINTEPLA (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea  decreased appetite  fatigue  somnolence  and vomiting. The FINTEPLA safety database includes long-term cardiovascular safety data for patients treated for up to three years in DS and LGS.1""LGS is one of the most challenging epileptic encephalopathies to treat  and the vast majority of patients are not well controlled  despite a regimen of multiple antiepileptic drugs "" said Kelly Knupp  M.D.  MSCS  FAES  Associate Professor  Children's Hospital Colorado. ""As a complementary therapy  FINTEPLA offers a different mechanism of action and demonstrated ability to significantly reduce the number of seizures associated with a drop  a critical measure for managing this severe form of epilepsy.""UCB is committed to supporting patient access to FINTEPLA  and as part of that commitment  Zogenix Central  a comprehensive support program  will provide ongoing product assistance to patients  caregivers  and their medical teams. Further information is available at www.FINTEPLA.com.""LGS is a severe  life-long disease with wide-ranging effects beyond seizures. It impacts every aspect of daily life and puts great strain on the entire family. There is a desperate need for more effective treatment options "" said Dr. Tracy Dixon-Salazar  Executive Director of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Foundation and mother to an adult daughter with LGS. ""The potential for FINTEPLA to make a difference in the daily  horrific seizures we are dealing with in LGS cannot be understated. We are so grateful for the researchers who have worked so hard to help all of us suffering at the hands of LGS.""UCB acquired Zogenix and FINTEPLA on March 7  2022. The acquisition is consistent with UCB's sustainable patient value strategy and continued commitment to providing world-leading patient value to all people living with epilepsy  with an increasing focus on creating value and new solutions that address the unmet needs of people with certain specialized or rare types of epilepsy  where few or no options exist.About FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) C-IVFINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) oral solution is a prescription medication approved by the FDA and EMA  and under regulatory review with PMDA (Japan)  for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older.10 11 A Type II Variation Application for treatment of seizures associated with LGS has also been submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).12In the United States  FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS program. FINTEPLA is available in Europe under a controlled access program requested by the EMA to prevent off-label use for weight management and to confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking FINTEPLA. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at +1 877 964 3649.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.INDICATIONS AND USAGEFINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5–HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSAdministration to patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact Zogenix Inc. at 1-866-964-3649 (1-866-Zogenix) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.9414[email protected]Corporate CommunicationsErica Puntel  U.S. Media RelationsT +404 938 5359[email protected]Laurent Schots  Media RelationsT+32.2.559.9264[email protected]Nick FrancisT +44 7769 307745[email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB' efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

The recruitment of patients was launched in January 2022 at the Clinical Investigation Centers (CIC) at the CHU teaching hospital centers in Poitiers  Bordeaux and Rennes  overseen by Eurofins-Optimed as the Clinical Research Organization (CRO). Various initiatives are underway to add other Clinical Investigation Centers.To optimize the allocation of its resources  and in view of the positive developments within the health context in France and more generally across Europe  NFL Biosciences has decided to not start recruiting patients in Australia and to focus on opening additional centers in France. This decision will enable it to reduce the overall cost of the clinical trial  simplify its management and accelerate patient recruitment.Story continuesThe clinical trial is targeting male or female smokers who are aged 18 to 70  smoke more than 11 cigarettes per day and are genuinely committed to stopping. The trial includes three arms (two dose arms and one placebo arm) and will monitor patients over 12 months. CESTO II’s primary objectives are to select the best dose and assess the efficacy of NFL-101 versus placebo  for both immediate and gradual smoking cessation. The main criteria for assessment are the person’s continued abstinence for four weeks (US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) criterion) and six months (European Medicines Agency (EMA) criterion). The biomarkers used to confirm abstinence are exhaled carbon monoxide and urinary cotinine. A range of secondary criteria will also be assessed  including the number of cigarettes smoked  withdrawal symptoms and level of craving.Organization further strengthenedIn the third quarter of 2021  and aligned with the additional resources from the the capital increase  NFL Biosciences further strengthened its teams with a Medical Operations Director and a Senior Clinical Project Leader  giving it the operational capacity needed to continue moving forward with CESTO II. At the start of 2022  NFL Biosciences also welcomed on board an Investor Relations Director on a part-time basis  while a Financial Director is scheduled to arrive at the end of March.Active ingredient manufacturing partnership set upIn November 2021  NFL Biosciences selected the company Diverchim to manufacture the active ingredient for NFL-101 for its use in additional clinical trials beyond the CESTO II study (Phase II/III). The development plan mapped out will also cover the preclinical development of the active ingredient of NFL-201  NFL Biosciences’ drug candidate for treating cannabis addiction.Thanks to this partnership  NFL Biosciences has secured control over the production of its botanical extracts with a view to anticipating future development requirements all the way through to its potential market release.Intellectual property extended with an NFL Biosciences patent registered in the United StatesOn September 21  2021  the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) issued  with number 11 123 395  the product patent for NFL-101. The addition of cannabis proteins to the extract is covered by one of the claims with a view to a potential future application for cannabis cessation. This patent protects the innovation that NFL-101 is based on through to 2040 in the United States. This patent is also approved in France through to 2040. National registration applications are in the review phase in the following regions and countries: China  Japan  Canada  South Korea  Australia  Brazil  India  Indonesia  Israel  Mexico  Philippines  Eurasia  Saudi Arabia  United Arab Emirates  Nigeria.Co-development agreement for NFL-301  a drug candidate to reduce alcohol consumptionIn February 2022  NFL Biosciences set up a co-development agreement with ATHENA Pharmaceutiques  a market leader for the development and manufacturing of oral delivery drugs  to develop and produce NFL-301  a natural drug candidate from NFL Biosciences aimed at reducing alcohol consumption.2021 full-year earnings (January 1 - December 31  2021)The full-year financial statements for 2021  prepared in accordance with French GAAP  were approved by the Board of Directors during its meeting on March 24  2022. The audit procedures on the annual accounts have been finalized. The auditors' reports will be issued after finalization of the Management Report  prior to the publication of the Annual Financial Report.The initial public offering on Euronext Growth Paris in July 2022 led to an issue premium of €4 960 724.34  with €3 287 481 of shareholders’ equity. The gross amount received came to €5m.EBIT totaled €(978K)  reflecting the costs incurred to set up the CESTO II clinical trial  including the strengthening of the team from the third quarter of 2022  the manufacturing of active ingredient batches  and the payments to the CROs.To optimize these resources  NFL Biosciences is deploying various financing arrangements  which are reflected in the €270.7K of debt and the research tax credit for €141.8K.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM) (NASDAQ: PHAR) announces that Principal Investigator V. Koneti Rao  MD  FRCPA  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  will present positive findings from the Phase III pivotal clinical trial of leniolisib for patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) at the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) 2022 Annual Meeting in Charlotte  North Carolina.The presentation for healthcare practitioners and other experts will take place on April 1  2022  from 11:30 to 11:45 ET/17:30 to 17:45 CET and will be accessible on site and virtually. To attend  please register here:https://cis.clinimmsoc.org/education/meetings/am22/program/amprogramLeniolisib is being developed for the targeted treatment of APDS  a rare primary immunodeficiency caused by genetic variants that currently has no approved therapy. On February 2  2022  Pharming announced that the Phase III trial of leniolisib  sponsored by Novartis  has met both of its co-primary endpoints by demonstrating improvements in lymphoproliferation and immunophenotype correction  and that the treatment was well tolerated by patients.Pharming plans to begin submitting global regulatory filings for leniolisib  a small-molecule PI3Kδ inhibitor  in the first half of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.Nicholas Hartog  MD  FAAAAI  FACAAI  a specialist in allergy and immunology at Spectrum Health Helen Devos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids  Michigan  said:""I'm eager to learn more about the positive results of this Phase III study of leniolisib in patients with APDS. A promising therapy for this rare and challenging disease sparks hope in physicians like me  who are dedicated to improving care for affected patients and reducing their symptoms. I could not be more excited about the opportunity for a personalized and precision-based therapy on the horizon for this patient population.""Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""Pharming is committed to bringing new therapies to people with rare diseases and will work closely with regulatory authorities across the globe in an effort to make this innovative option available to physicians who care for patients with primary immunodeficiencies. We are excited to be pursuing a development program that aims to bring patients the first targeted therapy option for APDS  as this disease significantly impacts their lives  yet treatment has been limited to supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy.""In his presentation during a plenary session titled ""Precision Medicine for Hyperinflammatory Disorders "" Dr. Rao will explain the study's design  share its primary and secondary findings  and detail patient disposition and safety results. The annual CIS meeting will be dedicated to exploring immune deficiency and dysregulation.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About the Phase II/III leniolisib TrialSponsored by Novartis  the Phase II/III registration-enabling study was composed of two parts  the first being a 12-week open-label dose escalation part that included six patients with APDS and determined the dose of leniolisib to be given in the Phase III part.The Phase III part consisted of a randomized  placebo-controlled  blinded trial of leniolisib that enrolled 31 patients who had APDS and were age 12 or older. The patients were randomly assigned according to a 2:1 ratio to receive either leniolisib 70mg twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks. The co-primary endpoints of the randomized study evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency as shown by an increase in naïve B cells. Following study treatment  patients were permitted to roll over to an open-label extension study evaluating long-term safety  tolerability  and efficacy.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. is a global  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative protein replacement therapies and precision medicines for the treatment of rare diseases and unmet medical needs.The flagship of our portfolio is our recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) franchise.

The Australian Patent Office validated the grant of patent AU2020235216 without amending the application filed on August 17th  2021.These two new patents protect QGC606 in the United States and Australia until March 2040  a new chemical series of inhibitors of cerebral aminopeptidase A and more particularly the drug-candidate QGC606  as well as any pharmaceutical composition including any of these inhibitors as an active ingredient  for a therapeutic use in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases.Fabrice Balavoine  Vice-President Research & Development of Quantum Genomics  commented: ""These new patents further demonstrate our know-how and expertise in the design and development of therapeutic innovations. The examination of these applications has been particularly rapid and has not been the subject of any major objection  which makes us extremely confident to obtain patents with similar claims in the rest of the world in the near term  thus guaranteeing solid protection of QGC606 and its therapeutic use.""Jean-Philippe Milon  Chief Executive Officer of Quantum Genomics  added: ""The granting of these new patents is excellent news because these patents further consolidate the intellectual property around our technological platform. As we actively pursue the clinical development of firibastat  our first-in-class product  it was important to develop and protect a second generation of brain aminopeptidase A inhibitors to meet the standards of the pharmaceutical industry as well as the expectations of large laboratories.""About Quantum GenomicsQuantum Genomics is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of a new class of cardiovascular drugs  based on the Brain Aminopeptidase A Inhibition (BAPAI) mechanism.

Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS platform  which uses a novel technology to encapsulate drug substances inside red blood cells  ERYTECH is developing a pipeline of product candidates for patients with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH's primary focus is on the development of product candidates that target the altered metabolism of cancer cells by depriving them of amino acids necessary for their growth and survival.The Company's lead product candidate  eryaspase  which consists of L-asparaginase encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells  targets the cancer cells' altered asparagine and glutamine metabolism. The proof of concept of eryaspase as a cancer metabolism agent was established in different trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and pancreatic cancer. An investigator sponsored Phase 2 trial (IST) evaluating the use of eryaspase in ALL patients who developed hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase recently reported positive results  based on which the Company intends to request approval in the United States and potentially other territories. The Company is also pursuing a Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial in first-line pancreatic cancer.Eryaspase received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who have developed hypersensitivity reactions to E. coli-derived pegylated asparaginase. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency have granted eryaspase orphan drug status for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and ALL.ERYTECH produces its product candidates for treatment of patients in Europe at its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France  and for patients in the United States at its GMP manufacturing site in Princeton  New Jersey  USA.

Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS® platform  which uses a novel technology to encapsulate drug substances inside red blood cells  ERYTECH is developing a pipeline of product candidates for patients with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH’s primary focus is on the development of product candidates that target the altered metabolism of cancer cells by depriving them of amino acids necessary for their growth and survival.The Company’s lead product candidate  eryaspase  which consists of L-asparaginase encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells  targets the cancer cells’ altered asparagine and glutamine metabolism. The proof of concept of eryaspase as a cancer metabolism agent was established in different trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and pancreatic cancer. An investigator sponsored Phase 2 trial (IST) evaluating the use of eryaspase in ALL patients who developed hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase recently reported positive results  based on which the Company intends to request approval in the United States and potentially other territories. The Company is also pursuing a Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial in first-line pancreatic cancer.Story continuesEryaspase received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who have developed hypersensitivity reactions to E. coli-derived pegylated asparaginase. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency have granted eryaspase orphan drug status for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and ALL.ERYTECH produces its product candidates for treatment of patients in Europe at its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France  and for patients in the United States at its GMP manufacturing site in Princeton  New Jersey  USA. Eryaspase is not an approved medicine.ERYTECH is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States (ticker: ERYP) and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0011471135  ticker: ERYP).

As a consequence thereof  according to NORD/LB AöR's prepared and audited annual financial statements (HGB) and in accordance with § 6 para 3 of the agreement on the establishment of a silent partnership entered into by and between the Issuer and NORD/LB and terminated by NORD/LB on 25 November 2020 effective 31 December 2022 (""Participation Agreement"")  the book value of the silent contribution of the Issuer as shown in the balance sheet of NORD/LB AöR as of 31 December 2021 was increased by an amount of EUR 34 734 287.57 to the amount of EUR 165 184 863.07. Further  the Issuer was notified that the payment of a profit participation to the Issuer in respect of the financial year 2021 is excluded pursuant to § 3 para 3 (c) of the Participation Agreement  as the book value of the silent contribution has been reduced due to losses of NORD/LB in previous years and has not yet been fully replenished by the profit accrued in the financial year 2021. Heute  am 28. März 2022  wurde der Fürstenberg Capital II GmbH (""Emittentin"") von der Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale  Hannover (""NORD/LB"") mitgeteilt  dass vorbehaltlich der Feststellung des Jahresabschlusses für die NORD/LB AöR im Geschäftsjahr 2021 gemäß HGB ein Jahresüberschuss nach Steuern sowie vor Gewinnbeteiligung für bestehende stille Einlagen angefallen ist. Dies hat zur Folge  dass gemäß aufgestelltem und geprüftem Jahresabschluss (HGB) für die NORD/LB AöR der Buchwert der stillen Einlage der Emittentin nach Maßgabe des § 6 Abs. 3 des zwischen der Emittentin und der NORD/LB geschlossenen und am 25. November 2020 von der NORD/LB mit Wirkung zum 31. Dezember 2022 gekündigten Vertrages über die Errichtung einer stillen Gesellschaft (""Beteiligungsvertrag"") in der Bilanz der NORD/LB AöR per 31. Dezember 2021 um EUR 34.734.287 57 auf EUR 165.184.863 07 heraufgesetzt worden ist. Zudem wurde der Emittentin mitgeteilt  dass gemäß § 3 Abs. 3 (c) des Beteiligungsvertrags die Zahlung einer Gewinnbeteiligung an die Emittentin für das Geschäftsjahr 2021 ausgeschlossen ist  da der Nennbetrag der Stillen Einlage aufgrund von Verlusten der Bank in den Vorjahren gemindert und durch den Gewinn im Geschäftsjahr 2021 noch nicht vollständig wieder ausgeglichen wurde. The terms and conditions of the Capital Notes (ISIN DE000A0EUBN9  Common Code 021983110  WKN A0EUBN  Dutch Security Code (Fonds Code) 15379  listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange - Official Segment) of the Issuer provide that payments on the Capital Notes are contingent on payments which the Issuer receives from NORD/LB pursuant to the Participation Agreement. To the extent  the Issuer does not receive such payments  the Issuer will not be obliged to make payments under the Capital Notes. Thus  pursuant to § 6 para (1) of the terms and conditions of the Capital Notes  the total exclusion of the profit participation payment under the Participation Agreement in respect of the financial year 2021 will result in a corresponding total exclusion of the interest payment on the Capital Notes scheduled for 30 June 2022. Noteholders of Capital Notes will therefore not receive interest payments on the Capital Notes in the year 2022 for the interest period from (and including) 30 June 2021 to (but excluding) 30 June 2022. There is no obligation to subsequently compensate for such interest payments excluded. Die Emissionsbedingungen der von der Emittentin begebenen Capital Notes (ISIN DE000A0EUBN9  Common Code 021983110  WKN A0EUBN  Dutch Security Code (Fonds Code) 15379  notiert an der Börse Euronext Amsterdam - Official Segment) sehen vor  dass Zahlungen auf die Capital Notes abhängig sind von Zahlungen  die die Emittentin aufgrund des Beteiligungsvertrags von der NORD/LB erhält. Soweit die Emittentin keine Zahlungen aus dem Beteiligungsvertrag erhält  ist die Emittentin nicht verpflichtet  Zahlungen auf die Capital Notes zu leisten. Der vollständige Ausfall der Gewinnbeteiligungszahlung unter dem Beteiligungsvertrag für das Geschäftsjahr 2021 hat daher gemäß § 6 Abs. 1 der Emissionsbedingungen der Capital Notes zur Folge  dass die für Zahlung am 30. Juni 2022 vorgesehene Zinszahlung auf die Capital Notes ebenfalls vollständig entfallen wird. Die Anleihegläubiger der Capital Notes werden somit im Jahr 2022 für die Zinsperiode vom 30. Juni 2021 (einschließlich) bis zum 30. Juni 2022 (ausschließlich) keine Zinszahlungen auf die Capital Notes erhalten. Eine Nachzahlungsverpflichtung in Bezug auf solchermaßen entfallene Zinszahlungen besteht nicht. In addition  the currently still reduced book value of the Issuer's silent contribution could adversely affect future payment claims of the Noteholders under the Capital Notes. In particular due to the termination of the Participation Agreement by NORD/LB with written notice dated 25 November 2020 and an expected repayment of the Capital Notes on 30 June 2023 it should be noted that  as long as the book value as determined in the Bank's balance sheet for the Bank's fiscal year ending on 31 December 2022 is lower than the nominal contribution amount  the repayment amount will correspond to the reduced book value of the Issuer's silent contribution (as determined in the Bank's balance sheet for the Bank's fiscal year ending on 31 December 2022). Therefore  due to the fact that payments on the Capital Notes are contingent on payments which the Issuer receives from NORD/LB pursuant to the Participation Agreement  interest payments on the Capital Notes could also be excluded in the subsequent interest period until and including 30 June 2023. The redemption of the Capital Notes which is expected on 30 June 2023 could be made in an amount below their nominal amount. Der aktuell immer noch herabgesetzte Buchwert der stillen Einlage unter dem Beteiligungsvertrag könnte sich zudem nachteilig auf etwaige künftige Zahlungsansprüche der Anleihegläubiger unter den Capital Notes auswirken. Aufgrund der Kündigung des Beteiligungsvertrags durch die NORD/LB mit Schreiben vom 25. November 2020 und der nach dieser Kündigung erwarteten Rückzahlung am 30. Juni 2023 wird darauf hingewiesen  dass  solange der handelsrechtliche Buchwert der stillen Einlage in der Bilanz der Bank für das zum 31. Dezember 2022 endende Geschäftsjahr niedriger ist als der Einlagenennbetrag  der Rückzahlungsbetrag dem herabgesetzten Buchwert der stillen Einlage der Emittentin (so wie dieser in der Bilanz der Bank für das Geschäftsjahr 2022 der Bank festgestellt wird) entsprechen wird. Da Zahlungen auf die Capital Notes abhängig sind von Zahlungen  die die Emittentin aufgrund des Beteiligungsvertrags von der NORD/LB erhält  könnten Zinszahlungen auf die Capital Notes in der nachfolgenden Zinsperiode bis einschließlich zum 30. Juni 2023 ebenfalls entfallen. Die am 30. Juni 2023 erwartete Rückzahlung der Capital Notes könnte dann zu einem Betrag unter dem Nennbetrag erfolgen.

Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases – including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure – with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed €3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR® is estimated to be over €5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.The alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.In the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints and a rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life. All patients have been enrolled in the study and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines. Over 900 alfapump systems have been implanted to date.Sequana Medical has combined its proven alfapump and proprietary DSR therapy  and is developing the alfapump DSR  a breakthrough approach to fluid overload due to heart failure. RED DESERT demonstrated that repeated DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients is able to manage their fluid and sodium balance  improve their cardio-renal status and restore their diuretic response for months post-treatment. Interim results from the ongoing SAHARA DESERT study in decompensated heart failure patients indicated that repeated DSR therapy can safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate persistent congestion and restore euvolemia  together with considerable benefit in cardio-renal status and a dramatic improvement in diuretic responsiveness. Reporting of top-line data is planned for H2 2022.Sequana Medical is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory Disclaimers:The alfapump® system is not currently approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Study) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to cirrhosis.

If ARES is successful  we believe this study could serve as the basis for MaaT013's approval in this severe indication with a very high unmet need "" said Hervé Affagard  co-founder and CEO of MaaT Pharma.ARES is a Phase 3 multicenter  international  open-label  single-arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of MaaT013 in 75 patients with Grade II-IV GI-aGvHD who are refractory to steroids and are resistant or are intolerant to ruxolitinib. The clinical trial will be conducted in up to 40 different sites across the European Union. To date  the company has received regulatory approvals from France  Germany and Spain  and the clinical trial may also be expanded to sites in the United States subject to regulatory approval. Eligible patients in the ARES study will be administered a total of 3 doses of MaaT013 as an enema formulation over a period of 10 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the GI-overall response rate (GI-ORR) to MaaT013 treatment at day 28. Secondary endpoints include the safety and tolerability of MaaT013 up to 12 months  as well as overall survival after 12 months. A first data review is expected in Q1 2023 after enrollment of half the patients in the study.Prof. Mohamad Mohty  Professor and Head of the Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department at the Saint-Antoine Hospital and Sorbonne University and past-president of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) added  ""The medical need is extremely high for GI-aGvHD patients who are refractory to both steroids and ruxolitinib  as they face an 80% mortality rate within the first few months3. By restoring the gut microbiome ecosystem  MaaT013 opens a brand-new therapeutic modality and provides a strongly differentiated  immuno-restorative approach that may complement standard immunosuppressive drugs and may provide a breakthrough for patients with no other therapeutic options.""The Phase 3 ARES trial builds on previously shared positive results from the company's Phase 2 HERACLES study of MaaT013 (n= 24) and from data of 52 patients benefiting from an ongoing early access program with MaaT013 in France. Both clinical datasets demonstrated that MaaT013 was generally well tolerated in this heavily immunocompromised patient population and demonstrated promising clinical benefit  which translated into a positive impact on overall survival rates in patients responding to the treatment. To date  more than 100 patients with aGvHD have been safely treated with MaaT013.About steroid resistant  gastro-intestinal acute Graft-vs-host-Disease (SR  GI aGvHD)Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease occurs in patients within 100 days of undergoing a stem cell or bone marrow transplant. The transplanted cells ""attack"" the recipient  causing inflammation of the skin  liver and/or gastro-intestinal tract. GI-aGvHD results in patients experiencing very high volumes of diarrhea which can be life-threatening. The standard first line therapy for treating aGvHD is the use of systemic steroids. If patients do not respond to steroids  they are considered Steroid Resistant (SR) and other agents can be administered. Currently the only agent approved for treating SR aGvHD after failure of steroid treatment is ruxolitinib  which is currently approved for this indication in USA and has received approval from the European Medical Agency's Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) on March 25  2022.About MaaT013MaaT013 is a full-ecosystem  off-the-shelf  standardized  pooled-donor  Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy. It is characterized by a consistently high diversity and richness of microbial species and the presence of ButycoreTM (group of bacterial species known to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites). MaaT013 aims to restore the symbiotic relationship between the patient's functional gut microbiome and their immune system to correct the responsiveness and tolerance of immune functions and thus reduce steroid-resistant  gastrointestinal-predominant aGvHD. MaaT013 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology. Committed to treating cancer and Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  a serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation  MaaT Pharma has already achieved proof of concept in a Phase II clinical trial in acute GvHD. Its powerful discovery and analysis platform  gutPrint®  supports the development and expansion of its pipeline by determining novel disease targets  evaluating drug candidates  and identifying biomarkers for microbiome-related conditions.The company's Microbiome Ecosystem Therapies are produced through a standardized cGMP manufacturing and quality control process to safely deliver the full diversity of the microbiome  in liquid and oral formulations.

In the absence of a standard of care after first line of treatment  data from centers benefitting from MaaT Pharma's early access program to MaaT013 in France show that up to 70-80% of patients with GI  SR aGVHD have received ruxolitinib before entering said program.2 Median previous lines of treatment: 3.
