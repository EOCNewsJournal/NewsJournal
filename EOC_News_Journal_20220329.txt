The board of directors believes that it is in the interest of all shareholders that senior executives  employees  and other key individuals  which are deemed to be important for the development of the company  have a long-term interest in a growth of the company's share price. Through the proposed program  a long-term ownership commitment is created  which is expected to stimulate an increased interest in the business and the company's performance in general.The board's proposal for the introduction of LTI 2022 in accordance with item (a) and (b) below constitutes an overall proposal and shall be made as one decision.The detailed terms and principles of the LTI 2022 are described belowItem 13 (a) - Adoption of LTI 2022The program runs over a period of approximately 3 years and entails that the participants are allocated stock options  free of charge  with the right to acquire shares in Bambuser at a strike price corresponding to 130% of Bambuser's share price at the start of the program.For LTI 2022  the following terms and conditions shall apply:A maximum of 4 200 000 share options may be allotted to participants in LTI 2022. As of the annual general meeting 2022  the allotment of employee stock options may be made within two months. LTI 2022 shall comprise a maximum of 36 employees in Bambuser. The participants are divided into different categories based on their respective roles within the company. The distribution of employee stock options is shown below: Category 1: Management  consisting of 6 persons  may be offered a maximum of 1 470 000 employee stock options in total  whereby each person within the category may be offered a maximum of 245 000 employee stock options. Category 2: Stars  consisting of 15 persons  may be offered a maximum of 1 680 000 employee stock options in total  whereby each person within the category may be offered a maximum of 112 000 employee stock options. Category 2: Rockets  consisting of 15 persons  may be offered a maximum of 1 050 000 employee stock options in total  whereby each person within the category may be offered a maximum of 70 000 employee stock options. Allotment of share rights is in each case conditional upon (i) that the participants' employment or assignment in the company has not been terminated  with certain exceptions  and (ii) that the participant has entered a separate agreement concerning the employee stock options with the company. The board of directors shall ensure that the agreements with the participants contain terms and conditions that prohibit the transfer or pledge of the employee stock options and that stipulates that unvested share rights will  with certain exceptions  be forfeited should the participant's employment or assignment in the company be terminated. The share rights shall be allotted to the participants free of charge. Provided that the share rights have been allotted and vested  each share right grants the holder a right to  during the period from 1st June 2025  up to and including 15th August 2025  as decided by the company  either (a) acquire one (1) share in the company to a price corresponding to the quota value (the current quota value is SEK 0 05 per share) or  (b) free of charge receive a warrant which entitles to subscription of one (1) share in the company at a price corresponding to a strike price of 130% of the volume-weighted share price for the Bambuser share ten trading days after the Annual General Meeting 2022. Participation in LTI 2022 is in each case conditional upon the participation being legally possible as well as possible with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts based on the company's assessment. The board of directors shall be responsible for the agreements with the participants and the administration of LTI 2022. In connection therewith  the board of directors has the right to make adjustments in order to adjust to certain rules or market conditions outside of Sweden. Further  in extraordinary cases  the board of directors is entitled to limit the extent of LTI 2022 or terminate the program in advance  in whole or in part. The number of shares that each employee stock option may entitle to acquire shall be recalculated in the event of a share split  rights issues and similar corporate actions with the aim of keeping the economic value of a share rights unaffected by such actions.Dilution and costs etc.The maximum dilution for existing shareholders as a result of LTI 2022  including warrants that may be issued as a result of hedging measures due to social security contributions that may arise under item (b)  is 2 6 percent of the total number of shares in the company. The dilution has been calculated as the number of additional shares in relation to the existing number and additional shares. Also considered is the incentive program 2020/2023 where 7 504 624 shares may be issued  including the incentive program proposed by the Board of Directors to the annual general meeting 2022  the maximum dilution may be 5 9 percent.The share rights will be regarded as personnel costs during the vesting period  without any impact on the company's cash flow. If the share rights are exercised  LTI 2022 may also entail costs in the form of social security contributions. The total costs for the social security contributions will depend  partially on the participant's employment or assignment form in the company  partially on the number of share rights that will be vested  and partially on the value of the benefit that the participant finally receives  i.e.  on the value of the share rights when exercised in 2025. The costs due to social security contributions will be accrued over the vesting period. The company intends to hedge the entire cost of the social security contributions through an issue of warrants  in accordance with the Board of Directors proposal in item 13 (b) below  which may be exercised by a financial third party in connection with the exercise of the share rights. If the company creates such a hedge structure  the costs for social security contributions will not affect the company's cash flow.Based on the assumption that all options in LTI 2022 are vested  an assumed share price of SEK 13 3 for when the share rights are exercised  and an assumed average social security rate of approximately 31.42 percent  the total costs for the program including social security contributions will amount to approximately SEK 23 6 million   which corresponds to approximately 11% percent of the company's yearly salary costs for employees (including social security contributions) for the 2021 financial year.Preparation of proposalThe Board of Directors has prepared LTI 2022 in consultation with external advisors.Item 13 (b) - Issue of warrants and approval of the transfer of the warrants to the participants and to third partiesIn order to secure the company's delivery of shares pursuant to LTI 2022 and secure related costs (primarily social security contributions) the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants of series 2022/2025 and approval of transfer of warrants of series 2022/2025.Therefore  The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 5 519 640 warrants on the following terms:The right to subscribe shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights  be granted to a wholly owned subsidiary of the company (""The Subsidiary""). The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights is the adoption of LTI 2022. Subscription must be made no later than 30th of June 2022. The Board of Directors have the right to extend the subscription period. The warrants shall be issued free of charge. For the warrants and exercise of the warrant right  the terms and conditions set out in the attached terms and conditions for warrants 2022/2025 (""The Option Terms"") applies. For instance  the Option Terms and Conditions include the following: that each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe to one new share in the company for a cash payment at a subscription price corresponding to 130 percent of the volume-weighted average price paid for the company's share on Nasdaq First North during ten trading days after the Annual General Meeting 2022. The subscription price thus calculated is rounded to the nearest full penny  whereby 0.5 ""öre"" shall be rounded up; that the subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscribe for may be subject to an adjustment in accordance with what is stated in item 8 of the Option Terms; that the warrants may be exercised during the period from 1st June 2025 until 15th September 2025; and that the new shares issued following subscription  through the exercise of the warrants  shall entitle rights to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividend closest after the new shares have been registered by the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) and registered in the register of shareholders maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB With full exercise of the option rights for subscription of new shares  the share capital will increase by SEK 275 982. The Board of Directors  or the person that the Board of Directors may appoint  shall be authorized to make minor adjustments necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or  where applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB.The board of directors further proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer warrants to participants in LTI 2022 free of charge in connection with employee stock options being exercised in accordance with the terms and conditions in accordance with A or otherwise dispose of the warrants to secure the company's commitments and costs in connection with LTI 2022. The Board of Directors shall not have the right to dispose of the warrants for any purpose other than to secure the company's commitments and costs in connection with LTI 2022.Special majority requirementsA resolution in accordance with item 13 require support of shareholders with at least nine tenths (9/10) of the shares represented and votes cast at the annual general meeting.Item 14 - Resolution on authorization for the board of directors to issue shares  warrants and/or convertiblesThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting 2022 resolves on an authorization for the board of directors to  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  on one or more occasions until the next annual general meeting  resolve on new issue of shares  warrants and/or convertibles in the company. The total number of shares covered by such new issues may in total correspond to a maximum of ten (10) percent of the shares in the company at the time the authorization is used. Payment for subscribed shares  warrants or convertibles may be paid in cash  by set-off or in kind or on terms referred to in chapter 2 section 5 of the Companies Act.The purpose of the authorization and the reasons for a possible deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is to enable further financing of the company's operations  to finance company acquisitions or acquisitions of businesses or assets  to be able to issue the said instruments as remuneration in such acquisitions and in the company strategic collaborations  to enable emission to industrial partners and to broaden the shareholder group.The board of directors  the CEO  or who the board of directors appoints  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments in the general meeting's resolution required for the registration at the Swedish Companies Registration Office or du to other formal requirements.Special majority requirementsA resolution in accordance with item 14 require support of shareholders with at least two-thirds (2/3) of the number of votes and shares represented at the meeting to be valid.DocumentsThe annual report and the auditor's report are presented by keeping them available at the company at Malmskillnadsgatan 13 in Stockholm  and on https://ir.bambuser.com/corporate-governance/general-meeting  no later than 7 April 2022.

The service supports both the sell and buy sides of fund distribution  providing automated order routing and related end-to-end Straight-Through Processing.The biggest customer gains of digitalizing the fund order value chain have been to minimize potential manual errors and to reduce email and fax-based processes  resulting in increased cost efficiency  full traceability  and timely handling of orders  providing true end to end client benefit.As had been the case with fund order routing  sub-optimal work-around processes relying on manual intervention and email or fax-based processes dominate the handling of fund transfers in the Swedish market. This leads to extensive time delays in completing the process  driving administrative cost and risk.As with fund orders  the benefits of an automated  digitalized  and standardized management of fund transfers include increased security  lower administrative costs  and greater transparency of flows. By decreasing processing times from weeks to days  the benefits go beyond the distributors  fund managers and the end customer  enjoying shorter market exposure and an improved customer experience.""It is a natural next step in our long partnership to once again work together and combine our services and solutions to bring the benefits of an end-to-end STP and ISO 20022 compliant fund transfer process and continue the transformation of fund processing in the Nordic market""  says Sandra Holmqvist  Chief Business Development Officer at Euroclear Sweden.""It is essential that solution providers such as Tietoevry and financial market infrastructures such as Euroclear Sweden work closely together to be enablers for digitalization and market efficiency.

It will aim to help banks gauge investor appetite for upcoming equity issuances  including in particular IPOs as well as accelerated book buildings and the placement of institutional shares.It said that setting up an equity capital market desk would allow Amundi to decide what role it wants to play in any upcoming IPO or equity issuance operation – cornerstone investor  anchor investor or standard investor – and potentially to increase its chances of success  as associating the name of a renowned investor to the process typically bolsters confidence in the offering.“Because of its scale in the European investment industry  the depth of its expertise and the size of its investment and portfolio management teams  we believe that Amundi is ideally placed to provide this service and thus to contribute to reinforcing Europe’s attractiveness as a key marketplace for IPOs and equity offerings.”Vincent Mortier  chief investment officer at Amundi  said: “In the current market context  it is paramount to be in the position to offer our clients access to Europe’s most dynamic investment opportunities. I am convinced the Amundi ECM desk will act as a partner of choice for European companies in their IPOs process  and will ultimately contribute to reinforcing the attractiveness of Europe as a financial centre.”Primary listings have been on pause since February as a result of the geopolitical situation  but Amundi has said the pipeline remains relatively healthy and that it expects some operations to resume by the second half of the year  with the long-term trend being that European companies are poised to increasingly tap equity markets for their financing needs in the coming years.Deutsche Börse acquires Luxembourg-based fund data managerDeutsche Börse Group is acquiring 100% of Kneip Communication S.A  which manages investor disclosure and data publication for more than 10 000 funds in over 40 countries  including the production of over 200 000 reporting solutions. It currently services over 30 per cent of EU-based fund ISINs.Further terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of March this year.According to Deutsche Börse and Kneip  the acquisition forms the basis for creating a leading fund data hub based in Luxembourg. Kneip will seek to further scale the business and expand its range of services inside Deutsche Börse Group  including data and post-trade services provided by Clearstream.Deutsche Börse  meanwhile  also intends to connect Kneip’s services with its established fund services platforms.

It will aim to help banks gauge investor appetite for upcoming equity issuances  including in particular IPOs as well as accelerated book buildings and the placement of institutional shares.It said that setting up an equity capital market desk would allow Amundi to decide what role it wants to play in any upcoming IPO or equity issuance operation – cornerstone investor  anchor investor or standard investor – and potentially to increase its chances of success  as associating the name of a renowned investor to the process typically bolsters confidence in the offering.“Because of its scale in the European investment industry  the depth of its expertise and the size of its investment and portfolio management teams  we believe that Amundi is ideally placed to provide this service and thus to contribute to reinforcing Europe’s attractiveness as a key marketplace for IPOs and equity offerings.”Vincent Mortier  chief investment officer at Amundi  said: “In the current market context  it is paramount to be in the position to offer our clients access to Europe’s most dynamic investment opportunities. I am convinced the Amundi ECM desk will act as a partner of choice for European companies in their IPOs process  and will ultimately contribute to reinforcing the attractiveness of Europe as a financial centre.”Primary listings have been on pause since February as a result of the geopolitical situation  but Amundi has said the pipeline remains relatively healthy and that it expects some operations to resume by the second half of the year  with the long-term trend being that European companies are poised to increasingly tap equity markets for their financing needs in the coming years.Deutsche Börse acquires Luxembourg-based fund data managerDeutsche Börse Group is acquiring 100% of Kneip Communication S.A  which manages investor disclosure and data publication for more than 10 000 funds in over 40 countries  including the production of over 200 000 reporting solutions.

Koneti Rao  MD  FRCPA  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  will present positive findings from the Phase III pivotal clinical trial of leniolisib for patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) at the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) 2022 Annual Meeting in Charlotte  North Carolina.Pharming_Group_NV_LogoThe presentation for healthcare practitioners and other experts will take place on April 1  2022  from 11:30 to 11:45 ET/17:30 to 17:45 CET and will be accessible on site and virtually. To attend  please register here:https://cis.clinimmsoc.org/education/meetings/am22/program/amprogramLeniolisib is being developed for the targeted treatment of APDS  a rare primary immunodeficiency caused by genetic variants that currently has no approved therapy. On February 2  2022  Pharming announced that the Phase III trial of leniolisib  sponsored by Novartis  has met both of its co-primary endpoints by demonstrating improvements in lymphoproliferation and immunophenotype correction  and that the treatment was well tolerated by patients.Pharming plans to begin submitting global regulatory filings for leniolisib  a small-molecule PI3Kδ inhibitor  in the first half of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.Nicholas Hartog  MD  FAAAAI  FACAAI  a specialist in allergy and immunology at Spectrum Health Helen Devos Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids  Michigan  said:""I'm eager to learn more about the positive results of this Phase III study of leniolisib in patients with APDS. A promising therapy for this rare and challenging disease sparks hope in physicians like me  who are dedicated to improving care for affected patients and reducing their symptoms. I could not be more excited about the opportunity for a personalized and precision-based therapy on the horizon for this patient population.""Story continuesAnurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""Pharming is committed to bringing new therapies to people with rare diseases and will work closely with regulatory authorities across the globe in an effort to make this innovative option available to physicians who care for patients with primary immunodeficiencies. We are excited to be pursuing a development program that aims to bring patients the first targeted therapy option for APDS  as this disease significantly impacts their lives  yet treatment has been limited to supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy.""In his presentation during a plenary session titled ""Precision Medicine for Hyperinflammatory Disorders "" Dr. Rao will explain the study's design  share its primary and secondary findings  and detail patient disposition and safety results. The annual CIS meeting will be dedicated to exploring immune deficiency and dysregulation.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About the Phase II/III leniolisib TrialSponsored by Novartis  the Phase II/III registration-enabling study was composed of two parts  the first being a 12-week open-label dose escalation part that included six patients with APDS and determined the dose of leniolisib to be given in the Phase III part.The Phase III part consisted of a randomized  placebo-controlled  blinded trial of leniolisib that enrolled 31 patients who had APDS and were age 12 or older. The patients were randomly assigned according to a 2:1 ratio to receive either leniolisib 70mg twice daily or placebo for 12 weeks. The co-primary endpoints of the randomized study evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency as shown by an increase in naïve B cells. Following study treatment  patients were permitted to roll over to an open-label extension study evaluating long-term safety  tolerability  and efficacy.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. is a global  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative protein replacement therapies and precision medicines for the treatment of rare diseases and unmet medical needs.The flagship of our portfolio is our recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) franchise.

FINTEPLA was developed by Zogenix  Inc.  which was recently acquired by UCB.FINTEPLALGS is a severe childhood-onset developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE) characterized by drug-refractory seizures with high morbidity4 as well as serious impairment of neurodevelopmental  cognitive  and motor functions.5 LGS affects an estimated 30 000 – 50 000 patients in the U.S.6 LGS has far-reaching effects beyond seizures  including issues with communication  psychiatric symptoms  sleep  behavioral challenges  and mobility.7 Additionally  sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major concern for people living with LGS.8FINTEPLA has demonstrated efficacy in the most difficult to treat seizure types 1 2 including drop seizures  which cause a person to suddenly lose muscle tone  become limp  and fall to the ground  with a high likelihood of injury.3 FINTEPLA has a mechanism of action different from and complementary to current seizure medications  and it can be used with no disruptions to current antiseizure regimens.9 In the global placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical study  there were numerically greater improvements on the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CG-I) in patients living with LGS when taking FINTEPLA.1Story continues""The approval of FINTEPLA for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome highlights our continued commitment to bringing differentiated medicines to patients who may not be well controlled on current therapies  and their caregivers "" said Mike Davis  Head of Global Epilepsy  UCB  Inc. ""We are proud to add FINTEPLA as a treatment for Dravet syndrome  and now Lennox-Gastaut syndrome  to our portfolio of epilepsy medicines to help reduce the impact and burden of seizures  including severe epilepsy syndromes that have high pediatric morbidity and mortality rates.""The FDA approval was supported by safety and efficacy data from a global  randomized  placebo-controlled Phase 3 clinical trial in 263 patients with LGS (age 2-35 years)  which demonstrated that FINTEPLA at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg/day significantly reduced monthly drop seizures frequency by a median of 23.7% from baseline compared to 8.7% placebo (p=0.0037). Nearly a fourth of those patients on FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day experienced a ≥50% reduction in drop seizure frequency per 28 days; 18% with ≥50% to <75% reduction and 6% ≥75% reduction.1 The common adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with FINTEPLA (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea  decreased appetite  fatigue  somnolence  and vomiting. The FINTEPLA safety database includes long-term cardiovascular safety data for patients treated for up to three years in DS and LGS.1""LGS is one of the most challenging epileptic encephalopathies to treat  and the vast majority of patients are not well controlled  despite a regimen of multiple antiepileptic drugs "" said Kelly Knupp  M.D.  MSCS  FAES  Associate Professor  Children's Hospital Colorado. ""As a complementary therapy  FINTEPLA offers a different mechanism of action and demonstrated ability to significantly reduce the number of seizures associated with a drop  a critical measure for managing this severe form of epilepsy.""UCB is committed to supporting patient access to FINTEPLA  and as part of that commitment  Zogenix Central  a comprehensive support program  will provide ongoing product assistance to patients  caregivers  and their medical teams. Further information is available at www.FINTEPLA.com.""LGS is a severe  life-long disease with wide-ranging effects beyond seizures. It impacts every aspect of daily life and puts great strain on the entire family. There is a desperate need for more effective treatment options "" said Dr. Tracy Dixon-Salazar  Executive Director of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Foundation and mother to an adult daughter with LGS. ""The potential for FINTEPLA to make a difference in the daily  horrific seizures we are dealing with in LGS cannot be understated. We are so grateful for the researchers who have worked so hard to help all of us suffering at the hands of LGS.""UCB acquired Zogenix and FINTEPLA on March 7  2022. The acquisition is consistent with UCB's sustainable patient value strategy and continued commitment to providing world-leading patient value to all people living with epilepsy  with an increasing focus on creating value and new solutions that address the unmet needs of people with certain specialized or rare types of epilepsy  where few or no options exist.About FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) C-IVFINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) oral solution is a prescription medication approved by the FDA and EMA  and under regulatory review with PMDA (Japan)  for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older.10 11 A Type II Variation Application for treatment of seizures associated with LGS has also been submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).12In the United States  FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS program. FINTEPLA is available in Europe under a controlled access program requested by the EMA to prevent off-label use for weight management and to confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking FINTEPLA. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at +1 877 964 3649.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.INDICATIONS AND USAGEFINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5–HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSAdministration to patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact Zogenix Inc. at 1-866-964-3649 (1-866-Zogenix) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.9414antje.witte@ucb.comCorporate CommunicationsErica Puntel  U.S. Media RelationsT +404 938 5359Erica.puntel@ucb.comLaurent Schots  Media RelationsT+32.2.559.9264Laurent.schots@ucb.comNick FrancisT +44 7769 307745Nick.francis@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB' efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products.

Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases – including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure – with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed €3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR® is estimated to be over €5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.The alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.In the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints and a rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life. All patients have been enrolled in the study and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines. Over 900 alfapump systems have been implanted to date.Sequana Medical has combined its proven alfapump and proprietary DSR therapy  and is developing the alfapump DSR  a breakthrough approach to fluid overload due to heart failure. RED DESERT demonstrated that repeated DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients is able to manage their fluid and sodium balance  improve their cardio-renal status and restore their diuretic response for months post-treatment. Interim results from the ongoing SAHARA DESERT study in decompensated heart failure patients indicated that repeated DSR therapy can safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate persistent congestion and restore euvolemia  together with considerable benefit in cardio-renal status and a dramatic improvement in diuretic responsiveness. Reporting of top-line data is planned for H2 2022.Sequana Medical is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The open-label  single-arm Phase 3 study (NCT04769895)  called ‘ARES’  evaluates the safety and efficacy of MaaT013  the company’s high-richness  high-diversity lead Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy (MET) as a third-line  salvage therapy in GI-aGvHD patients2. aGvHD is a severe complication of an allogeneic stem cell transplant and every year  approximately 10 000 patients are diagnosed globally.“Initiating the pivotal Phase 3 trial with our lead candidate MaaT013 is an important milestone for our company and for the microbiome therapeutics field worldwide. If ARES is successful  we believe this study could serve as the basis for MaaT013’s approval in this severe indication with a very high unmet need ” said Hervé Affagard  co-founder and CEO of MaaT Pharma.ARES is a Phase 3 multicenter  international  open-label  single-arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of MaaT013 in 75 patients with Grade II-IV GI-aGvHD who are refractory to steroids and are resistant or are intolerant to ruxolitinib. The clinical trial will be conducted in up to 40 different sites across the European Union. To date  the company has received regulatory approvals from France  Germany and Spain  and the clinical trial may also be expanded to sites in the United States subject to regulatory approval. Eligible patients in the ARES study will be administered a total of 3 doses of MaaT013 as an enema formulation over a period of 10 days. The primary endpoint of the study is the GI-overall response rate (GI-ORR) to MaaT013 treatment at day 28. Secondary endpoints include the safety and tolerability of MaaT013 up to 12 months  as well as overall survival after 12 months. A first data review is expected in Q1 2023 after enrollment of half the patients in the study.Prof. Mohamad Mohty  Professor and Head of the Hematology and Cellular Therapy Department at the Saint-Antoine Hospital and Sorbonne University and past-president of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) added  “The medical need is extremely high for GI-aGvHD patients who are refractory to both steroids and ruxolitinib  as they face an 80% mortality rate within the first few months3. By restoring the gut microbiome ecosystem  MaaT013 opens a brand-new therapeutic modality and provides a strongly differentiated  immuno-restorative approach that may complement standard immunosuppressive drugs and may provide a breakthrough for patients with no other therapeutic options.”The Phase 3 ARES trial builds on previously shared positive results from the company’s Phase 2 HERACLES study of MaaT013 (n= 24) and from data of 52 patients benefiting from an ongoing early access program with MaaT013 in France. Both clinical datasets demonstrated that MaaT013 was generally well tolerated in this heavily immunocompromised patient population and demonstrated promising clinical benefit  which translated into a positive impact on overall survival rates in patients responding to the treatment. To date  more than 100 patients with aGvHD have been safely treated with MaaT013.About steroid resistant  gastro-intestinal acute Graft-vs-host-Disease (SR  GI aGvHD)Acute Graft-versus-Host Disease occurs in patients within 100 days of undergoing a stem cell or bone marrow transplant. The transplanted cells “attack” the recipient  causing inflammation of the skin  liver and/or gastro-intestinal tract. GI-aGvHD results in patients experiencing very high volumes of diarrhea which can be life-threatening. The standard first line therapy for treating aGvHD is the use of systemic steroids. If patients do not respond to steroids  they are considered Steroid Resistant (SR) and other agents can be administered. Currently the only agent approved for treating SR aGvHD after failure of steroid treatment is ruxolitinib  which is currently approved for this indication in USA and has received approval from the European Medical Agency’s Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) on March 25  2022.About MaaT013MaaT013 is a full-ecosystem  off-the-shelf  standardized  pooled-donor  Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy. It is characterized by a consistently high diversity and richness of microbial species and the presence of ButycoreTM (group of bacterial species known to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites). MaaT013 aims to restore the symbiotic relationship between the patient’s functional gut microbiome and their immune system to correct the responsiveness and tolerance of immune functions and thus reduce steroid-resistant  gastrointestinal-predominant aGvHD. MaaT013 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA).About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology. Committed to treating cancer and Graft-versus-Host Disease (GvHD)  a serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation  MaaT Pharma has already achieved proof of concept in a Phase II clinical trial in acute GvHD. Its powerful discovery and analysis platform  gutPrint®  supports the development and expansion of its pipeline by determining novel disease targets  evaluating drug candidates  and identifying biomarkers for microbiome-related conditions.The company’s Microbiome Ecosystem Therapies are produced through a standardized cGMP manufacturing and quality control process to safely deliver the full diversity of the microbiome  in liquid and oral formulations. MaaT Pharma benefits from the commitment of world-leading scientists and established relationships with regulators to support the integration of the use of microbiome therapies in clinical practice.MaaT Pharma is listed on Euronext Paris (ticker: MAAT).Forward-looking StatementsAll statements other than statements of historical fact included in this press release about future events are subject to (i) change without notice and (ii) factors beyond the Company’s control.

With a capacity of 260 megawatts  the plant will begin production in the first half of 2023.The SSM3-6 plant is backed by a 14-year power sales contract with Copel  a Brazilian Utiliy and historical partner of Voltalia:Copel has been Voltalia's partner in the SMG wind farm (108 megawatts) since 2015 as a minority shareholder.In 2021  Copel acquired 100% of the VSM2 and VSM4 wind farms (187 megawatts in total)  which will continue to be maintained by Voltalia over the long term.Copel is one of the buyers of electricity from the SSM1&2 solar park (for 270 megawatts)  currently under construction.SSM3-6 is part of the Serra Branca complex. Entirely developed by Voltalia and located in the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte  Serra Branca is the largest wind and solar complex in the world with a potential capacity of 2.4 gigawatts. Voltalia is the controlling shareholder of a significant portion of the projects located in the complex  the other projects being sold to partners. In all cases  Voltalia provides all or part of the services associated with the development  construction and maintenance of the sold or retained plants.Ownership Technology Status Capacity (in MW) Developed and owned by Voltalia Wind Operating 624 Developed and sold with services by Voltalia Wind Operating 555 Sub total 1179 Developed and owned by Voltalia Solar Construction 580 Developed and sold with services by Voltalia Wind Construction 206 Sub total 786 Under development by Voltalia Solar and wind Development ~500 Grand Total ~2 400Serra Branca generates one of the most competitive energies in the country. The site enjoys exceptional levels of wind and sunshine. In addition  the two energy sources are complementary  as the wind blows mainly at night in Serra Branca. The projects in the complex also benefit from common infrastructure (grid connection and access) and operational synergies. Thus  the construction of SSM3-6 (260 megawatts) will extend the ongoing construction of SSM1&2 (320 megawatts). In a second phase  SSM3-6 will be operated and maintained by the Voltalia teams in charge of the rest of this giant complex.Story continues""With the launch of the construction of SSM3-6  Voltalia continues to ramp up its Serra Branca complex  alone or alongside partners such as Copel.

(Sanofi Canada) announced the expanded approval of Dupixent® (dupilumab injection) as an add-on maintenance treatment in patients aged six to 11 years with severe asthma with a type 2 / eosinophilic phenotype or oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma. The approval is based on the pivotal VOYAGE phase 3 trial which enrolled 408 children aged six to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate- to severe asthma. The primary endpoint of the trial was the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbationsii.Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc. Logo (CNW Group/Sanofi-Aventis Canada Inc.)Reza Alizadehfar  MD FRCPCTraining Program Director  Associate Professor of Pediatrics  Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology  Montreal Children's Hospital""Dupixent is already an important treatment option for adults and adolescents disabled by severe asthma  and expanding its clinical applicability to include children aged six to 11 creates opportunities to make life better for some of the many Canadian children whose lives are restricted by their severe asthma.""Sixth indication for Dupixent  its second in asthma  and its second indication in children aged six to 11 yearsDupixent was first approved in Canada in 2017 for the treatment of adults with atopic dermatitis. Dupixent has since been approved for the treatment of adolescents and children aged six and older with atopic dermatitis; adults with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP); and adults  adolescents and now children aged six and older with severe asthma. Dupixent is the first medicine approved for the treatment of severe asthma with a type 2 inflammation phenotype. More than 8 500 Canadians have been treated with Dupixent across its various indications.Story continuesEric Trottier  PhDHead of Medical Affairs  Specialty Care at Sanofi Canada""Almost every single day  we at Sanofi hear a new story about Dupixent making a profound impact in someone's life. Now  with this pediatric indication for Dupixent  we're excited at the opportunity to potentially help Canadian children with severe asthma to have fewer attacks  and to help their parents breathe easier  too.""About asthmaAsthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways that causes symptoms like shortness of breath  chest tightness  coughing and wheezing. Asthma causes inflammation and narrowing of the bronchial tubes  which leads to limited airflow and difficulty breathingiii. People with severe asthma experience difficulty breathing  coughing  wheezing  and are at risk for life-threatening asthma attacks  which may require visits to the emergency room or hospitalizationiv v. Some people with severe asthma can manage their symptoms with inhaled corticosteroids  while other people require different or additional kinds of medicine to manage their disease.Asthma is the third-most common chronic disease among Canadiansvi vii  and the most common chronic disease in Canadian children: 15% - 25% of Canadian children are diagnosed with asthmaviii.Sheila DeVriesMother of a child with severe asthma""My daughter Payton's severe asthma has definitely affected everyone in our family as we help protect her and keep her healthy  so she doesn't suffer more than she already does. From wheezing and coughing episodes to numerous trips to emergency and overnight hospital stays—we just want her to be able to run and play without constantly being wheezy and struggling to catch her breath.""Vanessa ForanPresident and CEO  Asthma Canada""It's exciting to see innovation in this space and a new medication to help children living with severe asthma  where there are very few treatment options. Anything that makes life easier for a child to run around  play  and go to school—the way kids should be able to—is a tool worth having.""About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. Data from Dupixent clinical trials have shown that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in severe asthma  atopic dermatitis  and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).Dupixent is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. In Canada  Dupixent is jointly commercialized by Sanofi Canada and Regeneron Canada Company.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people's lives.

1699,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-xenpozyme-olipudase-alfa-070000320.html,Press Release: Xenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) approved in Japan  first and only approved therapy indicated to treat acid sphingomyelinase deficiency,Xenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) approved in Japan  first and only approved therapy indicated to treat acid sphingomyelinase deficiency Xenpozyme represents first...,Sanofi - Aventis GroupeXenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) approved in Japan  first and only approved therapy indicated to treat acid sphingomyelinase deficiencyXenpozyme represents first Sanofi therapy to be approved under the SAKIGAKE ‘fast-track’ designationApproval based on positive results from two separate clinical trials in children and adults demonstrating improvement in lung function (as measured by DLco) and reduction of spleen and liver volumesParis  March 28  2022. The Japanese Ministry of Health  Labor  and Welfare (MHLW) has granted marketing authorization for Xenpozyme® (olipudase alfa) for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with non-central nervous system (non-CNS) manifestations of acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (ASMD)  a rare  progressive  and potentially life-threatening genetic disease. Xenpozyme is currently the only approved treatment for ASMD and represents Sanofi’s first therapy to be approved under the SAKIGAKE (or “pioneer”) designation  which is the Japanese government’s regulatory fast-track pathway to promote research and development of innovative new medical products addressing urgent unmet medical needs.John Reed  M.D.  Ph.DExecutive Vice President  Global Head of Research and Development  Sanofi“Today’s approval of Xenpozyme is a watershed moment for ASMD patients and their families  representing 20 years of research and the shared efforts of advocacy partners  clinicians  and patients. As the world’s first medicine approved for ASMD  Xenpozyme offers a potentially transformative option for this historically neglected community. We are proud of this achievement and grateful that Japan’s PDMA has recognized the significance of the unmet need that Xenpozyme addresses with the Sakigake designation. At Sanofi  we are working with health authorities globally  including the EU where olipudase alfa has PRIME designation and in the USA where this enzyme replacement therapy has Breakthrough designation  to rush this important medicine to ASMD patients around the world.”Story continuesXenpozyme is a recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase enzyme developed to replace deficient or defective acid sphingomyelinase (ASM)  an enzyme that allows for the breakdown of the lipid sphingomyelin. Accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells can cause harm to the lungs  spleen  and liver  as well as other organs  potentially leading to early death.The approval of Xenpozyme in Japan is based on positive results from the ASCEND and ASCEND-Peds clinical trials  showing that Xenpozyme provided improvement in lung function (as measured by diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide  or DLco) and reduction of spleen and liver volumes  with a well-tolerated safety profile in adults and children with ASMD. These data were presented at the American Society of Human Genetics (ASHG) 2020 Virtual Meeting.Xenpozyme has been evaluated in children and adults to treat non-CNS manifestations of ASMD type A/B and ASMD type B. Xenpozyme has not been studied in patients with ASMD type A.Historically known as Niemann-Pick disease types A  A/B  and B  ASMD is a genetically-based  progressive  and potentially life-threatening disease. ASMD represents a spectrum of disease  with two types that may represent opposite ends of a continuum referred to as ASMD type A and ASMD type B. ASMD type A/B is an intermediate form that includes varying degrees of CNS involvement. Until now  no approved therapies for ASMD have been available anywhere in the world.Outside of Japan  olipudase alfa is being evaluated by regulatory authorities around the world. A Biologics License Application (BLA) for olipudase alfa was accepted for Priority Review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  with a decision expected early Q3 2022. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has awarded olipudase alfa the PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) designation  and a decision is anticipated in the second half of 2022.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

March 28  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Eagle Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (Nasdaq: EGRX) (“Eagle” or the “Company”) today announced it has reached agreement on the terms of a transfer of the entire issued and to be issued share capital of Acacia Pharma Group plc (“Acacia Pharma”) (EURONEXT: ACPH) to Eagle by way of a scheme of arrangement under Part 26 of the United Kingdom’s Companies Act 2006 (the “Scheme”).The terms of the proposed transaction value Acacia Pharma’s existing issued and to be issued share capital at approximately €94 700 000  or the equivalent of €0.90 per share. Each shareholder of Acacia Pharma would receive  as consideration for each share of Acacia Pharma held by such shareholder  €0.68 in cash and 0.0049 shares of common stock of Eagle. The terms of the proposed transaction also provide for Eagle to guarantee approximately €25.0 million of debt within the Acacia Pharma group. In connection with the proposed transaction  (i) the Company and Acacia Pharma entered into a co-operation agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) on March 27  2022 and (ii) certain shareholders and directors owning shares in the capital of Acacia delivered to the Company and Acacia deeds of irrevocable undertaking.The proposed transaction has been approved by the boards of directors of both companies and is expected to close in late Q2 2022  subject to approval by Acacia Pharma’s shareholders and the sanction of the High Court of England and Wales and customary closing conditions for transactions of this type. There is no assurance that the proposed transaction will be consummated on the proposed terms or timing or at all.Story continuesThe proposed transaction is expected to provide Eagle with two currently marketed  acute care  hospital products with the potential to disrupt the marketplace:BARHEMSYS® is the first and only antiemetic approved by the FDA for rescue treatment of postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) despite prophylaxis. Eagle currently calls on healthcare providers and institutions representing over 70% of the expected BARHEMSYS addressable market opportunity.BARHEMSYS is also approved for the treatment of PONV in patients who have not received prophylaxis and for the prevention of PONV. The total estimated annual U.S. addressable market for prophylaxis and rescue is $2.7 billion  andBYFAVO® is indicated for the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults undergoing procedures lasting 30 minutes or less  with an estimated total addressable market in procedural sedation of more than $0.4 billion per year in the U.S.2“We are delighted to announce that we have agreed to terms for the proposed acquisition of Acacia Pharma. This will be a very important acquisition for us  both financially and strategically. In recent years  the pharmaceutical industry has witnessed slower uptake of new products and longer ramp periods. In the face of further challenges brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic  many smaller underfunded companies experienced significant hurdles launching products. We therefore believe that Eagle is well suited to drive uptake of these two new products  building from Acacia Pharma’s established foundation since its launch  through our experienced and specialized hospital-based sales organization with minimal additional infrastructure ” stated Scott Tarriff  President and Chief Executive Officer of Eagle Pharmaceuticals.“We have been extremely disciplined in managing our balance sheet over the years  and we believe that the proposed acquisition is a wise use of the cash we have generated. With these two products  together with landiolol  which is on track for an NDA submission to the FDA in May of this year  Eagle will potentially have three NCEs going into their launch phase. We believe these efforts will strengthen our leadership position in the hospital and oncology space and establish a strong foundation for sustainable long-term growth and bring value to our shareholders ” concluded Tarriff.“We believe that BARHEMSYS and BYFAVO address unmet clinical needs and are nearing usage inflection points  with strong formulary acceptance  and that with our longstanding relationships in the hospital space  we can accelerate uptake and capture the commercial potential of these assets. In doing so  we strive to impact and improve the care of patients undergoing medical treatments such as surgery and invasive procedures. Additionally  their value to anesthesia providers  who are key users  is important  facilitating precision medicine for patients. We see our sales infrastructure as a strategic asset  and as we add to our commercial product portfolio going forward  we plan to expand the size of our salesforce over the next two years ” stated Michael Moran  Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer of Eagle Pharmaceuticals.Proposed Transaction RationaleOpportunity for Eagle’s highly skilled hospital-based salesforce to integrate and promote BYFAVO and BARHEMSYS and to leverage longstanding relationships to realize the full potential of these assets.Anticipated strong synergistic fit with Eagle’s current and expanding portfolio of hospital products and other expected cost synergies.Attractive opportunity to accelerate Eagle’s existing growth strategy and further its advantage in acute care.Commercial stage  NCE products with long patent duration through 2031 would add complementary and diversified revenue streams to Eagle.Eagle’s strong financial position enables it to invest in this opportunity for potential significant value creation.Compelling commercial opportunity in both FDA-approved products: BARHEMSYS is the first and only antiemetic approved for rescue treatment of PONV despite prophylaxis and offers the potential for savings to hospitals and ambulatory centers. BYFAVO addresses an unmet need in procedural sedation by offering a fast-acting agent with a favorable safety profile versus other current treatments.Expected to be earnings accretive in 2024.Product Descriptions and Potential Commercial OpportunityBARHEMSYS® (amisulpride for injection)3 is the first and only FDA-approved product for PONV rescue after failed prophylaxis4. It is a selective dopamine D 2 /D 3 antagonist with a broad  differentiated label. PONV is a common complication of surgery  occurring in approximately 30% of all surgical patients and 80% of high-risk patients. PONV is associated with the use of anesthetic gases and opioid painkillers and is particularly common following gynecological  abdominal  breast  eye  and ear operations  especially those lasting an hour or more. PONV can delay hospital discharge; result in re-admission after in-patient procedures; and lead to day-case patients being admitted to the hospital  all of which can result in significantly increased healthcare costs.By reducing these risks  BARHEMSYS® offers the potential for significant economic savings to hospitals and ambulatory centers. Approximately 70 million invasive surgical patients receive antiemetic prophylaxis annually in the U.S. Approximately 10 million of these patients per year require PONV rescue treatment. BARHEMSYS is the only drug with an FDA-approved indication to treat patients who have failed PONV prophylaxis. It has an established safety profile and efficacy demonstrated in controlled clinical studies. BARHEMSYS® is nonsedating  a common complaint of standard antiemetic agents. Patients experiencing PONV who were treated in a pivotal clinical trial and failed prophylaxis were treated with BARHEMSYS. These patients were observed to have shorter post-anesthesia care (PACU) and hospital stays then patients who were not. Please see Important Safety Information for BARHEMSYS  below.BYFAVO® (remimazolam for injection)5 is a rapid onset/offset procedural sedative with an established safety and efficacy profile. Additional benefits include predictability and a readily available reversal agent. Please see Important Safety Information  including boxed warning  below.BYFAVO has a compelling commercial opportunity  addressing a clear unmet need. There has been no innovation in the sedation space for over 20 years. Customers seek a fast onset  titratability  and rapid recovery for quick discharge  and shorter procedure times allow for increased procedural volumes. BYFAVO has a broad label and potential health economic benefits and may enable shorter procedure times and greater patient throughput. It is indicated for procedural sedation in adults in procedures lasting 30 minutes or less and has a substantial clinical data package demonstrating efficacy and safety in colonoscopies and bronchoscopies  including the most challenging patients.Terms of the Proposed Transaction and FinancingThe terms of the proposed transaction value Acacia Pharma’s existing issued and to be issued share capital at approximately €94.7 million. The cash consideration payable by Eagle under the terms of the transaction would be approximately €71.6 million. The cash consideration payable by Eagle under the terms of the proposed transaction is expected to be financed by existing cash resources of Eagle. The remaining approximately €23.2 million consideration payable by Eagle is expected to be paid in shares of Eagle common stock. The terms of the proposed transaction also provide for Eagle to guarantee approximately €25.0 million of debt within the Acacia Pharma groupConditions to Closing and Anticipated TimingThe Scheme is expected to become effective between the middle of May 2022 and June 30th  2022  and is subject to closing conditions including  among other things  obtaining the requisite approval of Acacia Pharma’s shareholders and the sanction of the High Court of England and Wales by June 30  2022  which date may be extended by mutual agreement of the parties. There is no assurance that the proposed transaction will be consummated on the proposed terms or timing or at all.AdvisorsCooley (UK) LLP is acting as legal advisor and William Blair & Company  L.L.C. is acting as exclusive financial advisor to Eagle Pharmaceuticals in connection with the proposed transaction.

WilsonIn-Site Communications  Inc.T: 212-452-2793E: lwilson@insitecony.comImportant Safety Information for BARHEMSYS® (amisulpride) InjectionContraindicationBARHEMSYS is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to amisulpride.QT ProlongationBARHEMSYS causes dose- and concentration-dependent prolongation of the QT interval. The recommended dosage is 5 mg or 10 mg as a single intravenous (IV) dose infused over 1 to 2 minutes.Avoid BARHEMSYS in patients with congenital long QT syndrome and in patients taking droperidol.Electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring is recommended in patients with pre-existing arrhythmias/cardiac conduction disorders  electrolyte abnormalities (e.g.  hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia)  congestive heart failure  and in patients taking other medicinal products (e.g.  ondansetron) or with other medical conditions known to prolong the QT interval.Adverse ReactionsCommon adverse reactions reported in ≥ 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 5 mg (n=748) and at a higher rate than placebo (n=741) in clinical trials for the prevention of PONV were: chills (4% vs. 3%)  hypokalemia (4% vs. 2%)  procedural hypotension (3% vs. 2%)  and abdominal distention (2% vs. 1%).Serum prolactin concentrations were measured in one prophylaxis study where 5% (9/176) of BARHEMSYS-treated patients had increased blood prolactin reported as an adverse reaction compared with 1% (1/166) of placebo-treated patients.The most common adverse reaction  reported in ≥ 2% of adult patients who received BARHEMSYS 10 mg (n=418) and at a higher rate than placebo (n=416)  in clinical trials for the treatment of PONV was infusion site pain (6% vs. 4%).Use in Specific PopulationsLactationAmisulpride is present in human milk. There are no reports of adverse effects on the breastfed child and no information on the effects of amisulpride on milk production.BARHEMSYS may result in an increase in serum prolactin levels  which may lead to a reversible increase in maternal milk production. In a clinical trial  serum prolactin concentrations in females (n=112) increased from a mean of 10 ng/mL at baseline to 32 ng/mL after BARHEMSYS treatment and from 10 ng/mL to 19 ng/mL in males (n=61). No clinical consequences due to elevated prolactin levels were reported.To minimize exposure to a breastfed infant  lactating women may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk for 48 hours after receiving a dose of BARHEMSYS.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established.Geriatric UseNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these patients and younger patients  and other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between the elderly and younger patients  but greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.Renal ImpairmentAvoid BARHEMSYS in patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2). The pharmacokinetics of amisulpride in patients with severe renal impairment have not been adequately studied in clinical trials. Amisulpride is known to be substantially excreted by the kidneys  and patients with severe renal impairment may have increased systemic exposure and an increased risk of adverse reactions.No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment(eGFR ≥ 30 mL/min/1.73 m2).Drug InteractionsBARHEMSYS causes dose- and concentration-dependent QT prolongation. To avoid potential additive effects  avoid use of BARHEMSYS in patients taking droperidol.ECG monitoring is recommended in patients taking other drugs known to prolong the QT interval (e.g.  ondansetron).Reciprocal antagonism of effects occurs between dopamine agonists (e.g.  levodopa) and BARHEMSYS. Avoid using levodopa with BARHEMSYS.Important Safety Information for BYFAVO™ (remimazolam) InjectionIndicationsBYFAVO is a benzodiazepine indicated for the induction and maintenance of procedural sedation in adults undergoing procedures lasting 30 minutes or less.Important Safety InformationWARNING: PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT FOR MONITORING AND RESUSCITATION AND RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOID ANALGESICSPersonnel and Equipment for Monitoring and ResuscitationOnly personnel trained in the administration of procedural sedation  and not involved in the conduct of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure  should administer BYFAVO.Administering personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction  hypoventilation  and apnea  including the maintenance of a patent airway  supportive ventilation  and cardiovascular resuscitation.BYFAVO has been associated with hypoxia  bradycardia  and hypotension. Continuously monitor vital signs during sedation and during the recovery period.Resuscitative drugs  and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag-valve-mask–assisted ventilation must be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO.Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioid Analgesics and Other Sedative-HypnoticsConcomitant use of benzodiazepines  including BYFAVO  and opioid analgesics may result in profound sedation  respiratory depression  coma  and death. The sedative effect of intravenous BYFAVO can be accentuated by concomitantly administered CNS depressant medications  including other benzodiazepines and propofol. Continuously monitor patients for respiratory depression and depth of sedation.ContraindicationBYFAVO is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to dextran 40 or products containing dextran 40.Personnel and Equipment for Monitoring and ResuscitationClinically notable hypoxia  bradycardia  and hypotension were observed in Phase 3 studies of BYFAVO. Continuously monitor vital signs during sedation and through the recovery period. Only personnel trained in the administration of procedural sedation  and not involved in the conduct of the diagnostic or therapeutic procedure  should administer BYFAVO. Administering personnel must be trained in the detection and management of airway obstruction  hypoventilation  and apnea  including the maintenance of a patent airway  supportive ventilation  and cardiovascular resuscitation. Resuscitative drugs  and age- and size-appropriate equipment for bag-valve-mask–assisted ventilation must be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO. Consider the potential for worsened cardiorespiratory depression prior to using BYFAVO concomitantly with other drugs that have the same potential (e.g.  opioid analgesics or other sedative-hypnotics). Administer supplemental oxygen to sedated patients through the recovery period. A benzodiazepine reversal agent (flumazenil) should be immediately available during administration of BYFAVO.Risks From Concomitant Use With Opioid Analgesics and Other Sedative-HypnoticsConcomitant use of BYFAVO and opioid analgesics may result in profound sedation  respiratory depression  coma  and death. The sedative effect of IV BYFAVO can be accentuated when administered with other CNS depressant medications (eg  other benzodiazepines and propofol). Titrate the dose of BYFAVO when administered with opioid analgesics and sedative-hypnotics to the desired clinical response. Continuously monitor sedated patients for hypotension  airway obstruction  hypoventilation  apnea  and oxygen desaturation. These cardiorespiratory effects may be more likely to occur in patients with obstructive sleep apnea  the elderly  and ASA-PS class III or IV patients.Hypersensitivity ReactionsBYFAVO contains dextran 40  which can cause hypersensitivity reactions  including rash  urticaria  pruritus  and anaphylaxis. BYFAVO is contraindicated in patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to dextran 40 or products containing dextran 40.Neonatal SedationUse of benzodiazepines during the later stages of pregnancy can result in sedation (respiratory depression  lethargy  hypotonia) in the neonate. Observe newborns for signs of sedation and manage accordingly.Pediatric NeurotoxicityPublished animal studies demonstrate that anesthetic and sedation drugs that block NMDA receptors and/or potentiate GABA activity increase neuronal apoptosis in the developing brain and result in long-term cognitive deficits when used for longer than 3 hours. The clinical significance of this is not clear. However  the window of vulnerability to these changes is believed to correlate with exposures in the third trimester of gestation through the first several months of life but may extend out to approximately 3 years of age in humans.Anesthetic and sedation drugs are a necessary part of the care of children needing surgery  other procedures  or tests that cannot be delayed  and no specific medications have been shown to be safer than any other. Decisions regarding the timing of any elective procedures requiring anesthesia should take into consideration the benefits of the procedure weighed against the potential risks.Adverse ReactionsThe most common adverse reactions reported in >10% of patients (N=630) receiving BYFAVO 5-30 mg (total dose) and undergoing colonoscopy (two studies) or bronchoscopy (one study) were: hypotension  hypertension  diastolic hypertension  systolic hypertension  hypoxia  and diastolic hypotension.Use in Specific PopulationsPregnancyThere are no data on the specific effects of BYFAVO on pregnancy. Benzodiazepines cross the placenta and may produce respiratory depression and sedation in neonates. Monitor neonates exposed to benzodiazepines during pregnancy and labor for signs of sedation and respiratory depression.LactationMonitor infants exposed to BYFAVO through breast milk for sedation  respiratory depression  and feeding problems. A lactating woman may consider interrupting breastfeeding and pumping and discarding breast milk during treatment and for 5 hours after BYFAVO administration.Pediatric UseSafety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. BYFAVO should not be used in patients less than 18 years of age.Geriatric UseNo overall differences in safety or effectiveness were observed between these subjects and younger subjects. However  there is a potential for greater sensitivity (eg  faster onset  oversedation  confusion) in some older individuals.

Driven by the growth in our digital marketing and insurance activities  our net sales climbed 18% to €164.3m. Supported by our robust management  our consolidated net income recorded sustained growth  up 47% to €9.1m.These good results once again reflect our Group’s sound foundations. Our resilience is supported by the recurrence of our portfolio-based activities and our sales of magazine subscriptions and insurance policies. The diversity of our digital marketing activities is further strengthening our growth; these business lines generated 45% of the Group’s net sales in 2021  compared with 37% in 2020.In line with our Ambition 2025 plan to become a European leader for data marketing  we are continuing to further strengthen our positions with complementary areas of expertise  as we were able to do in 2021 with Intelligence Senior and Reech in our marketing engineering business  as well as the acquisition of the assets of QAPE  an InsurTech firm that is enabling us to accelerate our growth in the insurance sector. Alongside this  our outstanding capacity for innovation is enabling us to capitalize more effectively on the Group’s many areas of technological expertise to support data marketing.The DÉKUPLE Group has a robust financial position  enabling it to finance its development. Despite the ongoing health and geopolitical crises  I am very confident that we will be able to adapt and continue building on our growth. Thanks to the dedication shown by our 700 staff  we will be able to make 2022 another year of success”.Story continuesKEY DEVELOPMENTSIn 2021  the DÉKUPLE Group recorded strong growth in business despite the uncertainty relating to the economic and health situation.The portfolio-based activities confirmed the resilience of their business model  generating recurrent revenues. Despite an unfavorable basis for comparison and a contraction in the returns on commercial campaigns  net sales for the Magazine business were stable in 2021  with the development of the partnership-based subscription offers offsetting the impact of the discontinuation of prospecting under the France Abonnements brand since 2020. The Insurance business (+24%) maintained its regular growth by notably diversifying its product mix to include Health insurance and further strengthening its capacity for future growth with the acquisition of strategic assets from the InsurTech firm QAPE  as well as various assets from its supplementary health branch KOVERS.The Digital Marketing business (marketing engineering and consulting)  which represents 45% of consolidated net sales  ramped up its growth (+46%). These activities are benefiting from the robust expansion of Converteo and its Consulting activities against a backdrop of the digitalization and datafication of businesses and their marketing in particular. The Marketing Engineering business  held back by the ongoing health crisis  was further strengthened during the year through two external growth operations: i) in February  the acquisition of an interest in Intelligence Senior (previously Grand Mercredi Group)  specialized in silver economy marketing  and ii) in September  the acquisition of Reech  an influence marketing expert.EARNINGSConsolidated net sales1 came to €164.3m  up 17.9% compared with 2020  while the gross margin2 is up 12.8% to €134.6m.Against a backdrop of sustained investments  with major recruitment efforts  restated EBITDA3 came to €20.3m  up €5.7m versus the previous year  to represent 15.1% of the full-year gross margin.Operating income came to €14.8m  representing 11.0% of the gross margin  compared with 7.8% in 2020. This progress primarily reflects the increase in earnings for ADLPartner SA  driven by the realignment of commercial investments in the Magazine business  the reduction of the accounting loss for the Insurance business  and the stronger results recorded by the Digital Marketing business.After factoring in a higher tax expense (€4.6m)  consolidated net income totaled €9.1m in 2021  up 46.7% from 2020.After deducting minority interests  net income (Group share) represents €8.5m  with a net margin rate of 6.3%  versus 5.4% in 2020.Consolidated data (€m) 2019 2020 2021 Change2021/2020 Net sales 138.64 139.31 164.25 +17.9% Gross margin 122.06 119.33 134.65 +12.8% Restated EBITDA3% of gross margin 12.2510 0% 14.6512.3% 20.3215.1% +38.7% Operating income% of gross margin 7.676.3% 9.317.8% 14.8211.0% +59.2% Consolidated net income% of gross margin 5.234.3% 6.215.2% 9.116.8% +46.7% Net income (Group share)% of gross margin 5.434.5% 6.495.4% 8.496.3% +30.9%FINANCIAL STRUCTUREConsolidated shareholders’ equity represented €30.8m at 31 December 2021  up €7.6m from 31 December 2020  primarily taking into consideration income for the year (+€9.1m) and the ordinary dividend paid out in June 2021 (-€3.2m). This development also factors in the changes in the scope for consolidation (+€0.8m)  as well as the impact of the shares held as treasury stock and the bonus shares awarded (+€0.8m).The Group had €38.8m of cash at 31 December 2021  compared with €42.0m at 31 December 2020. Financial debt represents €20.6m  compared with €13.3m at 31 December 2020  primarily comprising commitments to buy out the minority interests in Converteo  Dékuple Ingénierie Marketing BtoB (previously AWE)  Intelligence Senior and Reech.The bank financing set up during the first half of 2022 based on fixed-rate confirmed lines and loans with maturities of 5 to 7 years will enable the Group to refinance the external growth operations carried out in 2021 and further strengthen its capacity to continue moving forward with its external growth strategy  while benefiting from attractive market conditions.OUTLOOKIn line with Ambition 2025  the DÉKUPLE Group is continuing to roll out its expansion strategy aiming to become a European leader for data marketing. With the Group’s robust financial resources  it is effectively positioned to support aggressive growth in digital marketing with a view to strengthening its positions in this sector  while moving forward with its commercial investments in its portfolio-based activities generating recurrent revenues.DIVIDENDConsidering the results achieved in 2021 and the investments planned for 2022  the Board of Directors will submit a proposal at the General Shareholders’ Meeting on 17 June for a dividend of €0.88 per share for 2021  to be paid out on 24 June 2022.ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONThe corporate and consolidated financial statements for 2021 were approved by the Board of Directors on 25 March 2022. The statutory auditors have completed the audit procedures on the corporate and consolidated accounts.

For acquisition and management commissions linked to sales of insurance policies  net sales comprise current and future commissions issued  acquired by the accounting reporting date  net of cancellations.2 For the digital marketing business  the gross margin represents the total amount of net sales (total invoices issued: fees  commissions and purchases charged back to customers) less the total amount of costs for external purchases made on behalf of customers. It is equal to net sales for the magazine and insurance business lines.3 EBITDA (earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization) is restated for the IFRS 2 impact of bonus share awards and the IFRS 16 impact relating to the restatement of lease charges.Attachment,neutral,0.44,0.5,0.06,mixed,0.68,0.21,0.12,True,English,"['Strong earnings growth', 'Dékuple', '2021', 'supplementary health branch KOVERS', 'DÉKUPLE Group Chairman', 'two external growth operations', 'The DÉKUPLE Group', 'cross-channel data marketing expert', 'The Digital Marketing business', 'The Marketing Engineering business', 'influence marketing expert', 'partnership-based subscription offers', 'France Abonnements brand', 'major recruitment efforts', 'higher tax expense', 'silver economy marketing', 'The Insurance business', 'Grand Mercredi Group', 'robust financial position', 'digital marketing activities', 'net margin rate', 'ongoing health crisis', 'Consolidated net sales1', 'full-year gross margin', 'Consolidated net income', 'STRONG EARNINGS GROWTH', 'Health insurance', 'Consolidated data', 'business lines', 'business model', 'Magazine business', 'health situation', 'robust management', 'robust expansion', 'full-year earnings', 'strong growth', 'Operating income', 'insurance activities', 'insurance policies', 'insurance sector', 'gross margin2', 'European leader', 'Bertrand Laurioz', 'good results', 'sound foundations', 'portfolio-based activities', 'magazine subscriptions', 'complementary areas', 'Intelligence Senior', 'InsurTech firm', 'many areas', 'geopolitical crises', 'KEY DEVELOPMENTS', 'recurrent revenues', 'unfavorable basis', 'commercial campaigns', 'product mix', 'sustained investments', 'ADLPartner SA', 'commercial investments', 'accounting loss', 'stronger results', 'minority interests', 'Group share', 'sustained growth', 'regular growth', 'future growth', 'strategic assets', 'various assets', 'outstanding year', 'Ambition 2025 plan', 'outstanding capacity', 'technological expertise', 'Consulting activities', 'previous year', 'EBITDA', 'dividend', 'Paris', '28 March', '00am', 'CEO', 'constraints', 'transformation', 'resilience', 'recurrence', 'diversity', 'positions', 'Reech', 'acquisition', 'QAPE', 'innovation', 'dedication', '700 staff', 'success', 'Story', 'uncertainty', 'economic', 'contraction', 'returns', 'impact', 'discontinuation', 'prospecting', 'Converteo', 'backdrop', 'digitalization', 'datafication', 'businesses', 'February', 'September', 'progress', 'increase', 'realignment', 'reduction', 'Change', '2021', '2022']",2022-03-28,2022-03-29,finance.yahoo.com

(“Quintero”)  the largest liquefied natural gas (LNG) regasification terminal in Chile  from Enagas Chile SpA and affiliates of OMERS Infrastructure. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed.Quintero is a key energy infrastructure business supporting Chile’s decarbonization strategy with a bridging fuel that allows for the reconciliation of economic growth with the uptake of renewables and the phasing out of coal. Operational since 2009  Quintero is the largest terminal for receiving and unloading LNG in Chile  as well as for its storage and regasification capacities. The terminal benefits from its strategic location in Quintero Bay  supplying a diversified base of customers in central Chile across residential  commercial  industrial  transportation and power generation sectors. The terminal owns 75% of the country´s LNG regasification capacity and in 2021  67% of the total natural gas imports (both LNG and pipeline imports) arrived in Chile through this strategic asset. With a daily regasification capacity of 15 million m3  an LNG storage capacity of 334 000 m3 and 2 500 m3 per day of truck loading capacity  the terminal is a reliable supplier of natural gas that contributes to Chile’s energy diversification and security.Chile has world-class solar and wind resources and a RES capacity equivalent to 4% of total global energy demand. The country is aiming to become one of the world’s three largest green hydrogen producers with plans to install 200 GW of renewable power by 2040 to produce green hydrogen. Chile already has signed several agreements to promote the export of green hydrogen  among others with the Belgian ports of Antwerp/Zeebrugge  Germany  the Port of Rotterdam and South Korea.The acquisition builds on EIG’s presence in the Chilean market  where the firm owns Cerro Dominador  a groundbreaking solar complex that combines a 100MW photovoltaic (PV) plant with a 110MW concentrated solar power (CSP) plant. The PV plant has been operational since 2017 and the CSP plant was successfully synchronized with Chile’s electricity grid in April 2021. EIG also is a partner in AME S.p.A  a Chile-based project developer and independent power producer. AME co-owns Generadora Metropolitana  the fifth largest electricity generation company in Chile  as well as HIF Global  a leader in the hydrogen and e-fuels sector  with a series of commercial-scale projects in development and expected to reach construction over the next several years.For Fluxys  the partnership is a forward-looking investment creating a foothold in another country in Latin America where the energy transition stands high on the government agenda. With its abundant solar and wind resources  Chile aims to produce the world’s cheapest green hydrogen.

A year ago  we hosted a Capital Markets Day to present our sustainable growth outlook to 2023. As we close 2021  we are proud to report solid results driven by revenue growth in all three solutions. Growth was supported by strong acquisition of new customers across our SaaS solutions  a firm rebound in mailing equipment sales outpacing competition again and a strong increase of our parcel lockers installed base. In an environment driven by further digitalization and automation of both communication and financial processes  the usage of our cloud-based platforms recorded a sharp 25% increase. Finally  we continue to benefit from the expansion of e-commerce that is generating higher parcel volumes as evidenced by the greater usage of our growing installed base of connected parcel lockers.Story continuesQuadient’s subscription-based business model proved resilient and the transformation to a more recurring and predictable revenue generation continues with a 4.3% year-over-year organic growth in sales and a 6.0% organic growth in current EBIT  surpassing our initial guidance  and such despite challenging supply chain and Covid-related disruptions. Profitability remains high with a stable EBITDA margin of 23.9% thanks to a more efficient organization and active cost management  while we continued to increase investments in R&D and Go-to-market. Free Cash Flow generation  at €104 million  continued to be strong and drives a healthy financial position with a low level of leverage at 0.4x excluding leasing. Quadient will therefore propose  for approval by the shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting  a dividend of €0.55per share  above the floor set under the dividend policy outlined in its ""Back to Growth"" strategic plan. On the back of this strong set of results  we are confidently confirming our prospects: our software solutions are generating an increasingly strong base of annual recurring revenue that will soon exceed €250 million  the profitability of our mail solutions remains well under control at close to 45%  and we are well on track to reach more than 25 000 parcel lockers installed by 2023.”ORGANIC REVENUE GROWTH ACROSS ALL SOLUTIONS AND ALL REGIONSGroup sales stood at €1 024 million in 2021  supported by a solid organic sales growth of 4.3% driven by positive growth from all solutions and all geographical areas. The acceleration of the company towards a subscription-based model continues to materialize with subscription-related revenues up 2.8% on an organic basis versus 2020 and now accounting for 67% of the total Group sales.On a reported basis  Group sales went down 0.5% compared to 2020  including a negative currency impact of -0.8% and a negative scope effect of -3.9%. In line with the Company’s strategy to reshape its portfolio  changes of scope are related to the divestments of ProShip in February 2020  the acquisition of YayPay in July 2020  the divestment from the Graphics activity in Australia and New Zealand in January 2021  the acquisition of Beanworks in March 2021 and the disposal of Automated Packaging Systems and the Netherland-based folder-inserters production site in July 2021.Consolidated salesIn million euros 2021 2020 Change Change at constant rates Organic change(1) Major Operations 942 919 2.4% 3.4% 3.0% Intelligent Communication Automation(a b) 201 183 9.4% 9.5% 7.3% Mail-Related Solutions(b) 659 653 0.9% 1.8% 1.8% Parcel Locker Solutions 83 83 -0.7% 2.6% 2.6% Additional Operations 82 110 -25.7% -26.1% 23.2% Group total 1 024 1 029 -0.5% 0.2% 4.3%In million euros 2021 2020 Change Change at constant rates Organic change(1) Major Operations 942 919 2.4% 3.4% 3.0% North America 519 501 3.5% 5.5% 4.7% Main European countries(a) 371 367 1.1% 0.4% 0.4% International(b) 52 51 1.8% 4.2% 4.2% Additional Operations 82 110 -25.7% -26.1% 23.2% Group total 1 024 1 029 -0.5% 0.2% 4.3% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy  Switzerland and the United Kingdom.(b) International includes the activities of Parcel Locker Solutions in Japan and of Intelligent Communication Automation outside of North America and the Main European countries.Major OperationsSales from Major Operations reached €942 million (92% of total sales) in 2021  a 3.0% year-over-year organic growth. All three solutions and all regions contributed to this positive performance.Sales in North America (55% of Major Operations) were up 4.7% organically to €519 million. This was mainly driven by the double-digit increase from cloud-based solutions  Intelligent Communication Automation  with strong customer gains from cross-selling and the deployment of newly-acquired SaaS fintech companies (Beanworks and YayPay). Solid hardware sales from Mail-Related Solutions also contributed to the positive performance  whilst Parcel Locker Solutions suffered from a high comparison basis with Lowe’s contract roll-out last year.Main European countries (39% of Major Operations) recorded an organic sales growth of 0.4% to €371 million. Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions posted solid sales growth in the main European markets  with Parcel Locker Solutions delivering the fastest growth thanks to on-going deployment of existing contracts with retailers and the gain of new ones. Sales from Mail-Related Solutions were stable  proving their resilience.The International segment (6% of Major Operations) delivered a solid organic sales growth (+4.2%)  with Parcel Locker Solutions being the main driver of performance thanks to a steady increase of the installed base in Japan.Intelligent Communication AutomationSales from Intelligent Communication Automation cloud-based solutions (21% of Major Operations) were up 7.3% organically reaching for the first time more than €200 million (€201 million in 2021)  a solid performance helped by strong customer acquisition. The number of Intelligent Communication Automation net new (after churn) customers grew by over 2 800 over the course of 2021  closing the year in excess of 11 800. The recent acquisition of Beanworks as well as the deployment of YayPay helped drive this dynamic customer acquisition trend with around 350 new AP/AR customers  including strong cross-selling opportunities. Cross-selling accounted overall for two thirds of new Intelligent Communication Automation customers.In line with the Company's strategy  the shift in revenue model continues to accelerate  driven by the growing demand for cloud-based solutions. Subscription-related revenue went up 17.1% organically  now representing 67% of Intelligent Communication Automation sales compared to 59% in 2020. Share of SaaS customers reached 76% at the end of 2021 and annual recurring revenue stood at €147 million at the end of 2021  up from €123 million at the end of 2020. Conversely  license sales went down 26.7% organically  despite one large deal booked in the second quarter of 2021  with Q4 license decline reaching -45%. License sales now account for only 14% of the Solution’s total sales.The Solution profit margin6F6F7 for Intelligent Communication Automation was down 3.9 points year-over-year to 14.7%  on an organic basis. Change of business model  recent targeted acquisitions and planned increased investments related to cloud-platform expansion  additional go-to-market and marketing are transitionally weighing on the profitability of the Solution.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales (70% of Major Operations) stood at €659 million in 2021  up 1.8% organically compared to 2020. This solid performance was driven by a dynamic 12.5% organic growth in hardware sales: placements of new hardware recovered strongly in 2021 thanks to product renewal (launch of the new iX-9 in the US) and a clear focus on customer acquisition and retention. 2021 also turned out to be a record year for high-end production mail folder-inserters.Meanwhile  the Company recorded a limited 2.0% organic decrease in subscription-related revenues (71% of Mail-Related Solutions sales). The resilience of both the installed base and subscription-related revenues remains strong  thanks to multi-year contracts.Overall  thanks to customer acquisition and retention  Mail-Related Solutions growth stood c.3 points above the global market performance7F7F8. This outperformance was most noticeable in the North American market.The Solution Profit Margin6 for Mail-Related Solutions was slightly down 1.0 point organically to 44.2% mainly due to the higher freight costs and supply chain disruptions. Overall  higher freight and sourcing costs amounted to an additional €6million in costs.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales (9% of Major Operations) stood at €83 million in 2021  a 2.6% organic increase compared to 2020. Performance was impacted by the demanding comparison base in hardware sales from the Lowe’s contract in 2020. Hardware sales were sharply down but subscription-related revenues were up 19.1% organically thanks to the roll-out of existing contracts with retailers and carriers in Europe and  to a lesser extent  to the increased installed base in Japan. The lockers’ usage rate continues to improve  reaching 61% at the end of 2021 (versus 57% a year ago)  also contributing to the solid performance in subscription-related revenues.Quadient closed the year with over 15 800 lockers installed globally  well on track to deliver the Company’s 2023 target to reach 25 000 lockers. Over 2 800 lockers were installed in 2021 with over 650 being installed in the fourth quarter of 2021 despite supply chain issues.Solution profit margin6 for Parcel Locker Solutions stood at -4.5% in 2021  a 10.1 points year-over-year organic decline. This was mainly due to the sharp increase in freight costs for new installations and to planned increased R&D and go-to-market investments  whilst the profitability of the installed base remained high at 27%.Additional OperationsRevenue from Additional Operations stood at €82 million in 2021  down 25.7% year-over-year. This decline is mainly due to the disposal of Graphics activities in Australia and New Zealand  and the divestment of the Automated Packing Systems. Additional Operations now only account for 8% of total sales. On an organic basis  however  Additional Operations sales were up 23.2% thanks to a good performance in Parcel Locker Solutions in Sweden while Automated Packing Systems also had a positive contribution before the divestment took place at end-July 2021.Q4 2021 SALESConsolidated sales stood at €273 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  down 5.0% on a reported basis and down 3.3% on an organic basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. This organic decline in revenue is essentially due to a high basis of comparison as the fourth quarter of 2020 coincided with the peak of the roll-out of the Lowe’s contract in Parcel Locker Solutions. In the meantime  thanks to its efforts and agility  the Company succeeded to mitigate the impact of increasing supply chain tensions on hardware manufacturing and shipping delays to ultimately deliver its clients in a timely manner.Major Operations sales stood at €253 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  down 4.4% organically compared to the fourth quarter of 2020. Intelligent Communication Automation sales were up 0.6% organically to €54 million impacted by the change in business model with license declining by -45% in Q4. Mail-Related Solutions sales continued to show strong resilience  reaching €178 million  down by 1.1% only on an organic basis. Parcel Locker Solutions sales stood at €21 million in fourth quarter of 2021  a sharp 32.1% decline on an organic basis due to the very high comparison basis of the Lowe’s contract deployment.Additional Operations sales stood at €20 million in the fourth quarter of 2021  down 40.9% on a reported basis due to the changes in scope  but up 12.9% on an organic basis.REVIEW OF 2021 FULL-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million 2021 2020 Change Sales 1 024 1 029 (0.5)% Gross profit 744 743 +0.1% Gross margin 72.6% 72.2% EBITDA 245 246 (0.4)% EBITDA margin 23.9% 23.9% Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 147 152(a) (3.3)% Current operating income margin (before acquisition related expenses) 14.4% 14.7%(a) Current operating income 135 132 +2.3% Net attributable income 88 40 +117% Earnings per share 2.32 0.92 +152% Diluted earnings per share 2.17 0.92 +136% (a) Including Parcel Pending’s earn-out reversal for an amount of €6.5 million.

Excluding this earn-out reversal  the current operating incomes before acquisition-related expenses of Major Operations and of the Group respectively amount to €146 million and €145 millionGross margin improved slightly to 72.6% in 2021 compared to 72.2% in 2020  despite higher freight costs. Gross margin benefited from higher activity  a more favourable revenue mix effect in Intelligent Communication Automation SaaS solution as well as from a tight control over costs of sales.Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses stood at €147 million in 2021 up 6.0% on an organic basis compared to €145 million in 2020 (€152 million including the one-off Parcel Pending earn-out reversal). This is mainly reflecting the organic growth in revenue  the improved gross margin  the sustained profitability of the installed base and active management of operating expenses  in particular savings in G&A expenses resulting from further simplification and integration of the organization as well as a reduction of the Group’s real estate footprint. In the meantime  as Quadient continues to invest in its three solutions  planned increased spending in go-to-market and R&D weighed on the profitability  so did the dilutive impact of recently acquired and fast-growing businesses dedicated to financial process automation (YayPay and Beanworks). In addition  the continuous shift in revenue model towards SaaS subscription (as opposed to perpetual licenses) is also impacting the mix in operating income.Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 14.4% of sales in 2021 compared to 14.1% in 2020 excluding Parcel Pending earn-out reversal (14.7% including the earn-out reversal).Acquisition-related expenses stood at €12 million in 2021 compared to €20 million in 2020 mainly due to lower M&A activity. Consequently  current operating income stood at €135 million in 2021  compared to €132 million in 2020.Optimization and other operating expenses stood at €19 million in 2021  a lower amount than in 2020  which stood at €36 million. The improvement reflects the progresses already made by the Group in its repositioning and a signal that the phase II of the Back to Growth strategy is well under way. As a result  operating income stood at €116 million in 2021  a significant improvement on the €96 million recorded in 2020.Net attributable income up c.120%Active debt management  including the early repayment of $85 million USPP in September 2020 and the early repayment of €163 million bond in March 2021  has led to a significant reduction in the net cost of debt for the year. 2021 net cost of debt was €25 million compared to €33 million in 2020.With the €20 million increase in the fair value of its investments in the X’ange 2 and Partech Entrepreneurs private equity funds  the Group recorded €17 million in currency gains and other financial items compared to €1 million in 2020.Overall  net financial result was limited to a loss of €9 million in 2021 compared to a loss of €32 million in 2020.Income tax was down to €20 million in 2021 from €24 million in 2020  which had been impacted by exceptional bookings to cover for potential tax risks in the UK. In 2021  the Group benefited from tax loss carry-back measures in the US in the context of Covid-19 pandemic as well as non-taxable VC capital gains. Consequently  the corporate tax rate stood at 18% in 2021 compared to 36% in 2020.Net attributable income therefore amounted to €88 million in 2021 compared to €40 million in 2020  a c.120% increase.Earnings per share stood at €2.32 in 2021 compared to €0.92 in 2020  while fully diluted EPS was €2.17 in 2021 (€0.92 in 2020).Strong cash flow generationEBITDA9F9F10 stood at €245 million in 2021 compared to €246 million in 2020. EBITDA margin remained stable year-over-year at 23.9% in 2021  thanks to a high contribution from the installed base of customers  for each of the 3 solutions  active cost management and a leaner organization  offsetting the ongoing supply chain issues  the dilutive impact of recent acquisitions and increased investments.The change in working capital was negative by €8 million in 2021 compared to a net cash inflow of €2 million in 2020. The decrease in receivables could not fully offset the significant inventory increase to mitigate supply chain disruptions.Lease receivables decreased by €39 million in 2021 compared to a decrease of €62 million in 2020  thanks to a slowdown in the decline of the leasing portfolio.The leasing portfolio and other financing services remained stable year-over-year at €595 million as of 31 January 2022 compared to €598 million as of 31 January 2021 which represents an organic decrease of 6.4% versus an organic decline of 8.7% in 2020. At the end of the financial year 2021  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.7%  a level stable versus 2020.Interest and taxes paid increased sharply to €66 million in 2021 from €37 million in 2020. Whilst interests paid were stable year-over-year  income tax paid rose significantly due to a normalization after the exceptional measures the Group benefited from in 2020 during the Covid-19 related crisis.Capital expenditure was down marginally at €88 million in 2021 compared to €90 million in 2020. Development capex was up to €37 million in 2021 (it was €30 million in 2020) focusing on R&D investments for software developments and higher spending linked with the recent acquisitions. Rented equipment capex was stable year-over-year although reflecting a different mix with higher parcel lockers and lower mail equipment. Maintenance capex was also stable. Of note is the lower renewal of real estate lease as further cost optimization are implemented. This drove down IFRS 16 capex.Cash flow after capital expenditure for the year was down to €104 million in 2021 compared to €167 million in 2020.IMPROVED LEVERAGE AND ROBUST LIQUIDITY POSITIONNet debt was down slightly  despite the acquisition of Beanworks  to €504 million as of 31 January 2022 from €512 million as of 31 January 2021 . The issuance of a €270 Schuldschein in November 2021 has allowed the immediate repayment of €130 million of Schuldschein debt maturing in 2022 and 2023. Post closing (in February 2022)  it has allowed the further repayment of €83 million of Schuldschein debt maturing in 2022 and 2023  whilst the remaining will partly contribute to the repayment of the €265 million ODIRNANE11 bonds by June 2022. The Group has no other significant debt maturity before its €325 million 2.25% bond maturing in 2025.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) remained stable at 2.1x10F10F11. The Group’s net debt is entirely backed by future cash flows generated from its rental  leasing and other financing activities. Excluding leasing  the leverage ratio remained low at 0.4x10 as of 31 January 2022  unchanged year-over-year. And taking ODIRNANE11F11F12 into account as debt  the leverage ratio excluding leasing stands at 2.0x10 EBITDA versus 1.9x10 at the end of 2020.Shareholders’ equity stood at €1 359 million as of 31 January 2022 compared to €1 240 million as of 31 January 2021. The gearing ratio12F12F13 went down to 37% from 41% as of 31 January 2021.As of 31 January 2022  the Group had a robust liquidity position of €887 million  split between €487 million in cash and a €400 million undrawn credit line  the latter maturing in 2024.OUTLOOKGood prospects expected in 2022Double-digit organic sales growth is expected in Intelligent Communication Automation. Customer growth is expected to remain strong  supported by cross-selling and the Beanworks and YayPay deployment outside North America. Increase in SaaS subscriptions and in the use of cloud platforms is anticipated to continue driving further growth in annual recurring revenue.Organic sales decline in Mail-Related Solutions is expected to remain contained. At the end of 2021  backlog levels remain high thanks to solid bookings and due to supply chain longer deliveries time.Double-digit organic sales growth is expected in Parcel Locker Solutions supported by the roll-out of existing contracts and by the ongoing positive momentum with carriers in Europe and Japan. New deals have also been signed in the retail and residential sectors  including a good start in the UK. The pipeline of projects is promising with exciting opportunities ahead in a market which is fast developing.2022 GuidanceAt Group level  full-year 2022 organic sales growth is therefore expected over 2% thanks to solid performances expected from new solutions combined with ongoing resilience of Mail-Related Solutions despite the current uncertainties of the geopolitical situation and ongoing supply chain disruptions.Low to mid-single digit current EBIT2 organic growth13F13F14 is anticipated with margins expected to rise as the profitability of the installed base is expected to continue to improve for both the SaaS activity and parcel lockers  whilst Mail-Related profit margin will be maintained. The Group will continue to benefit from a leaner organization with continuous focus on costs optimization.2023 guidance confirmedBoth sales and current EBIT2 organic growth CAGR guidance over 2021-2023 are confirmed i.e.  a minimum 3% organic sales growth CAGR and a minimum mid-single digit organic growth CAGR of current EBIT before acquisition-related expenses.BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSQuadient receives 'AA' MSCI ESG Rating Recognizing Efforts and Achievements Over the Past Years ParisOn January 24  2022  Quadient announced that it has been awarded an AA rating in the MSCI ESG Ratings dated December 2021.

All volumes in this series will be published in Open Access with financial support from the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (MPIWG).This is the first academic series to explore pre-modern agriculture in its foundational role in informing emergent “sciences” globally. Agriculture is treated as a body of knowledge through which humans learned about their environment; the migration of ideas and practices are traced from texts to other epistemological spaces  from one ancient agriculture and culture to another. By studying historical relationships between knowledge practices and environmental change  the series contributes to the study of science  technology  and medicine  as well as debates in global history  which are very much relevant to environmental issues we are obliged to address within scholarship and beyond.Director of MPIWG’s Department III (Artifacts  Action  Knowledge)  Prof. Dagmar Schäfer  comments: “We are very pleased to partner with Brill in providing an interdisciplinary academic platform for the study of pre-modern history of science in extra-European contexts. We believe this transcultural book series will benefit from and be an innovative addition to Brill’s strong presence in Asian Studies.”Dr. Uri Tadmor  Publishing Director at Brill  adds: “Brill highly values the opportunity to partner with the esteemed Max Planck Institute again. Publishing the series in Open Access will ensure the visibility and discoverability of publications  which we are convinced will contribute to the impact of this important series.”For more information about the series  please contact Prof. Dagmar Schäfer at schaeferoffice@mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de or Chunyan Shu  Acquisitions Editor at Brill  via Chunyan.shu@brill.com  or visit the series webpage.About Brill Founded in 1683 in Leiden  the Netherlands  Brill is a leading international academic publisher in the Humanities  Social Sciences  International Law  and Biology.

Nearly a fourth of those patients on FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day experienced a ≥50% reduction in drop seizure frequency per 28 days; 18% with ≥50% to <75% reduction and 6% ≥75% reduction.1 The common adverse reactions that occurred in patients treated with FINTEPLA (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea  decreased appetite  fatigue  somnolence  and vomiting. The FINTEPLA safety database includes long-term cardiovascular safety data for patients treated for up to three years in DS and LGS.1""LGS is one of the most challenging epileptic encephalopathies to treat  and the vast majority of patients are not well controlled  despite a regimen of multiple antiepileptic drugs "" said Kelly Knupp  M.D.  MSCS  FAES  Associate Professor  Children's Hospital Colorado. ""As a complementary therapy  FINTEPLA offers a different mechanism of action and demonstrated ability to significantly reduce the number of seizures associated with a drop  a critical measure for managing this severe form of epilepsy.""UCB is committed to supporting patient access to FINTEPLA  and as part of that commitment  Zogenix Central  a comprehensive support program  will provide ongoing product assistance to patients  caregivers  and their medical teams. Further information is available at www.FINTEPLA.com.""LGS is a severe  life-long disease with wide-ranging effects beyond seizures. It impacts every aspect of daily life and puts great strain on the entire family. There is a desperate need for more effective treatment options "" said Dr. Tracy Dixon-Salazar  Executive Director of the Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome Foundation and mother to an adult daughter with LGS. ""The potential for FINTEPLA to make a difference in the daily  horrific seizures we are dealing with in LGS cannot be understated. We are so grateful for the researchers who have worked so hard to help all of us suffering at the hands of LGS.""UCB acquired Zogenix and FINTEPLA on March 7  2022. The acquisition is consistent with UCB's sustainable patient value strategy and continued commitment to providing world-leading patient value to all people living with epilepsy  with an increasing focus on creating value and new solutions that address the unmet needs of people with certain specialized or rare types of epilepsy  where few or no options exist.About FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) C-IVFINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) oral solution is a prescription medication approved by the FDA and EMA  and under regulatory review with PMDA (Japan)  for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older.10 11 A Type II Variation Application for treatment of seizures associated with LGS has also been submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA).12In the United States  FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS program. FINTEPLA is available in Europe under a controlled access program requested by the EMA to prevent off-label use for weight management and to confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking FINTEPLA. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at +1 877 964 3649.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.INDICATIONS AND USAGEFINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5–HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSAdministration to patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact Zogenix Inc. at 1-866-964-3649 (1-866-Zogenix) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.9414[email protected]Corporate CommunicationsErica Puntel  U.S. Media RelationsT +404 938 5359[email protected]Laurent Schots  Media RelationsT+32.2.559.9264[email protected]Nick FrancisT +44 7769 307745[email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB' efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

Through a share-based incentive programme  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's earnings and value growth and creates long-term incentives for the programme participants. In light of the above  the Board of Directors believes that the implementation of Share Programme 2022/2025 may have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and  consequently  that Share Programme 2022/2025 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Participants in Share Programme 2022/2025 and allocationShare Programme 2022/2025 is proposed to include a maximum of approximately 2 000 senior executives and key employees within the Hexagon Group  who are divided into four groups: the President and CEO and group management (""Group 1"")  division managers (""Group 2"") and other senior executives and key employees (""Group 3"" and ""Group 4""). Invitation to participate in the programme shall be provided by Hexagon no later than 30 June 2022. Participation in Share Programme 2022/2025 requires that the participant has been employed by the Hexagon Group for at least twelve (12) months prior to the date of the offer.Participants are offered to be allocated performance awards that may entitle to Series B shares according to the conditions set out below. The performance awards shall be based on a maximum value for each participant category. The maximum value for the participants in Group 1 will be 50 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022  for participants in Group 2 and Group 3  100 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022  and for participants in Group 4  35 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022. The total sum of the maximum values of the performance awards thus defined for all participants will not exceed EUR 60 million  including social costs.The share price used to calculate the number of shares to which the performance awards entitles will be the volume-weighted average of the market price of Hexagon Series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of five (5) trading days before the day the participants are offered to participate in the programme.Performance conditionAllocated performance awards entitle to the receipt of Series B shares in the company provided that the performance condition related to the development of Hexagon's earnings per share[1] compared to the target level set by the Board of Directors during the measurement period 1 January 2022 until 31 December 2025 are fulfilled  where the last financial year during the measurement period is compared with the financial year preceding the measurement period  with reservation for any reduction in the number of shares in accordance with the terms of Share Programme 2022/2025. The Board of Directors intends to present the fulfillment of the performance-based condition in the annual report for the financial year 2025.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.– Performance awards shall be granted free of charge after the Annual General Meeting.– Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share in the company free of charge approximately four (4) years after allotment of the award (vesting period)  provided that the above performance condition has been met and that the holder  at the time of the release of the interim report for the first quarter 2026 still is employed by the Hexagon Group. Exemptions to the requirement of employment may be granted in specific cases  including a participant's disability or retirement.– The Board of Directors shall have the opportunity to make adjustments as a result of extraordinary events such as bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events.– The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.– The performance awards can be granted by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board of Directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions and administration of Share Programme 2022/2025  in accordance with the above mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments  including for example a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares  if significant changes in the Hexagon Group  or its operational environment  would  as assessed by the Board of Directors  result in a situation where the established terms and conditions for Share Programme 2022/2025 no longer are appropriate or reasonable.In the event that the Board of Directors considers that the delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025 cannot be achieved at a reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make appropriate local adjustments to the programme or instead offer participants a cash settlement.Scope and costs of the programmeProvided that the share price for the company's Series B share at the time of allotment of performance awards under Share Programme 2022/2025 is SEK 133.45  Share Programme 2022/2025 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 4 260 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.2 per cent of the total outstanding shares in the company.Provided that the performance condition is fully met  the total costs for Share Programme 2022/2025  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  is estimated to a maximum of approximately EUR 60 million  allocated over the vesting period. Estimated social costs and administration costs for the programme are included in the amount.In the event that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 would exceed EUR 60 million  the total number of allocated Series B shares in Hexagon will be reduced so that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 will not exceed this amount. Such reduction will be made pro rata in relation to the highest value for each participant category in accordance with the above.Delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under Share Programme 2022/2025  the company intends to enter into an agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  under which the third party shall  in its own name  acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to the participants in accordance with Share Programme 2022/2025.Preparation of the proposalShare Programme 2022/2025 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Hexagon and has been structured in consultation with external advisers. Share Programme 2022/2025 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings with the Board of Directors. Ola Rollén  President and CEO and board member  who may participate in the proposed Share Programme 2022/2025  has not participated in the preparation of the matter.Previous incentive programmes in HexagonFor a description of Hexagon's other incentive programmes  Share Programme 2020/2023 and Share Programme 2021/2024  please see the company's Annual Report 2021  note 30  and the company's website www.hexagon.com. In addition to the programmes described therein  there are no other long term incentive programmes in Hexagon.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors on acquisition and transfer of own shares (item 14)Hexagon has previously  on the basis of authorization by the General Meeting  acquired own Series B shares for the purpose of using repurchased shares to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure  to finance potential company acquisitions  and as a hedge for the company's share-based incentive programmes. As of 1 January 2022  the company held 9 350 000 own Series B shares  corresponding to approximately 0.3 per cent of the total number of shares in the company. The Board of Directors makes the assessment that it remains advantageous for the company to continue to be able to use repurchased shares in order to adjust the company's capital structure  on account of potential company acquisitions and for the company's share-based incentive programmes.In view of the above  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to pass a resolution  on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  on acquisition and transfer of Series B shares in the company. Acquisition of shares may be made at a maximum of so many Series B shares that the company's holding does not exceed ten (10) per cent of all shares in the company at that time. Acquisitions of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer of Series B shares may be made at a maximum of ten (10) per cent of the total number of shares in the company. A transfer may be made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights on Nasdaq Stockholm as well as to third parties in connection with acquisition of a company or a business. Compensation for transferred shares can be paid in cash  through an issue in kind or a set-off. Transfers of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer in connection with acquisitions may be made at a market value assessed by the Board of Directors.The purpose of the authorizations is (i) to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value  (ii) to enable acquisition opportunities by financing acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (iii) to ensure the company's undertakings  due to share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants in incentive programs)  including social security costs.The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors to issue shares  convertibles and/or warrants (item 15)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors during the period up until the next annual general meeting to  on one or more occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  andwith or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions  resolve to issue Series B shares  convertibles and/or warrants (with rights to subscribe for or convert into Series B shares). By resolutions in accordance with the authorization  the number of shares may be increased by a number corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) percent of the number of outstanding shares in the company at the time when the Board of Directors first uses the authorization.The purpose of the authorization and the reasons for a potential deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights as set out above  is to ensure financing of acquisitions of companies  part of companies or businesses or to strengthen the company's capital base and equity/assets ratio. Such issues may not require amendment of the Articles of Association applicable from time to time. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues by virtue of the authorisation shall be made on market conditions. In accordance with the conditions set out above  the Board of Directors shall also be authorized to resolve on other terms as considered necessary by the Board of Directors to carry out the issues.The Board of Directors further proposes that the Managing Director  or anyone appointed by the Managing Director  shall have the right to make any adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw: Bolagsverket).The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.E.

One of …,From its advent  the breakthrough of cryptocurrency that has aided its adoption is the decentralized characteristic. This removes the control of crypto activities from the influence of third parties  unlike what is obtainable in the centralized space.One of the recent measures that enforce decentralization is digital ledger technology. It involves using technological protocols that maintain the security of the decentralized digital database.Though the networks are distributed  there are always simultaneous validation  accessibility  and information updating. Also  besides eliminating cybercrime with this technology  it’s more effective  cheaper  and provides faster transaction processes.Related Reading | PUBG Developer Krafton Joins Forces With Solana For Blockchain And NFT GamesEuroclear  on Monday  has announced its investment into Fnality though the investment amount remains undisclosed.Also  Euroclear aims to develop personal distributed technology (DLT) through collaboration.

Some of its prominent shareholders are CIBC  Barclays  ING  UBS  Credit Suissue  and Mizuho Bank Nasdaq.Concerning the investment from Euroclear  Rhomaios Ram  the CEO of Fnality International  stated that having Euroclear as part of their consortium is a welcoming path for the company’s diversification. Also  he mentioned that it would help the firm’s expansion and its Financial Market Infrastructure.On its part  Euroclear Group CEO  Lieve Mostrey  said that his group is excited about the partnership with Fnality. This move is in synchronization with their clients in creating a pathway for both digital cash and digital securities settlement that will be profitable for the entire industry.Before now  Euroclear had partnered with Banque de France  the apex bank of France  as the leading team. The project was on the experimentation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to settle French government bonds on the Digital Ledger Technology (DLT).Related Reading | Hacker Group Anonymous Leaks 35 000 Files Of Stolen Russian Central Bank DocumentsThe project  which was scheduled for ten months  had about 500 different institutions as participants in the beginning.

PROPOSAL ON RESOLUTION REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION OF OPTION PROGRAM 2022/2024The Option Program shall comprise the grant of maximum 820 000 stock options (Sw. personaloptioner). Each option will entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in BioInvent at a subscription price equivalent to 125 per cent of the volume-weighted average price paid for the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm (the ""Stock Exchange"") during ten trading days as from and including 28 April 2022 (i.e. the first trading day after the publication of the company's interim report for January - March 2022) (the ""Subscription Price""). The calculated Subscription Price shall be rounded off to the nearest cent (Sw. öre)  whereby 0.5 öre shall be rounded up. The Subscription Price and the number of shares that each option entitles the holder to subscribe for may be subject to conversion pursuant to a bonus issue  share split  rights issue and similar actions  whereby customary conversion terms shall be applied. The Option Program 2022/2024 will comprise all employees and other key persons in BioInvent. Options will be granted to each participant as follows:CEO: 60 000 optionsOther members of group management: 30 000 optionsOther: 5 500 optionsThe options will be granted as soon as possible after determination of the subscription price. The theoretical market value of the options upon grant (calculated as per below; see Costs for Option Program 2022/2024)  corresponds for the CEO to approximately 0.3 annual base salaries and for other members of management on average to approximately 0.2 annual base salaries. New employees and other key persons may be included in the Option Program 2022/2024 prior to 1 July 2022.Options granted will vest by 1/3 during each of the financial years 2022  2023 and 2024  based on performance and continued employment with  or assignment for  BioInvent. The performance criteria for vesting will be based on the same criteria as for management's annual bonus  which principally are based on fixed technical milestone-criteria in projects  criteria for development of the project portfolio and other pre-determined criteria attributable to the business  which are designed to promote the long-term value creation of the company. Vesting shall be proportional in relation to the period of employment or assignment during the year in question. Annual vesting will be determined by the Board of Directors in connection with the adoption of the year-end report for the financial years 2022  2023 and 2024  respectively. The option holders may exercise vested options as from the day of release of the company's year-end report for the financial year 2024 up to and including 28 February 2026. Upon exercise  each option will entitle the option holder to receive one share in BioInvent  or one warrant immediately exercisable for one share  against payment of the Subscription Price. If the option holder's employment with or assignment for BioInvent is terminated by the participant  or if terminated by BioInvent due to the participant's breach of contract  all options shall immediately expire and cannot be exercised thereafter. If the employment or the assignment is terminated for other reasons  vested options may be exercised  but the right to options not yet vested will expire. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to resolve upon another application in individual cases.B. PROPOSAL ON RESOLUTION REGARDING DIRECTED ISSUE OF WARRANTS AND APPROVAL OF TRANSFER OF WARRANTSA maximum of 951 200 warrants shall be issued. Right to subscribe shall  with deviation from the preferential right for existing shareholders  reside in BioInvent's wholly owned subsidiary BioInvent Finans AB. Subscription of the warrants shall be made on a separate subscription list no later than 30 June 2022. The warrants shall be issued free of charge. Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share. The subscription price per share shall be equivalent to the Subscription Price (as determined above). The subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for may be subject to conversion pursuant to a capitalization issue  share split  rights issue and similar actions  whereby customary conversion terms shall be applied. Subscription of shares by virtue of the warrants shall be made no later than 28 February 2026. Shares issued following exercise of warrants during a certain financial year shall entitle to dividend for the first time on the record day for dividend which occurs following registration of the shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are set out in ""Terms of the BioInvent International AB warrants 2022/2024"".The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is that the issue forms part of the implementation of Option Program 2022/2024. In view of what is set forth under background and motive above  the Board of Directors is of the opinion that it is of benefit to BioInvent and its shareholders that all employees and other key persons are offered to participate in Option Program 2022/2024.The Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that BioInvent Finans AB transfers warrants to participants in Option Program 2022/2024 and otherwise disposes of the warrants in order to secure the company's commitments and costs in connection with Option Program 2022/2024.COSTS FOR OPTION PROGRAM 2022/2024The Option Program 2022/2024 will lead to certain costs. Based on the assumption that 100 per cent of the options in the program will be vested  the salary cost in the accounts pursuant to IFRS 2 is expected to amount to approximately SEK 9.4 million in total during the period 2022-2024 based on the options actual value at the start of the program. The options have no market value as they are non-transferable. However  the Board of Directors has assessed a theoretical value of the options through application of the Black & Scholes valuation model (in relation to the performance criteria). The calculations have been based on an assumed share price of SEK 42.00 and an assumed volatility of 48 per cent. The value of the options of Option Program 2022/2024 pursuant to this valuation is approximately SEK 11.44 per option with the application of the Black & Scholes formula. The transfer restrictions have not been taken into account in the valuation. The actual IFRS 2 cost during the vesting period depends on how many options that are vested.At fulfilment of the vesting conditions and exercise of the options  Option Program 2022/2024 will lead to costs in the form of social security charges. The total costs for social security charges during the vesting period depends on how many options that are vested and the value of the options at exercise. Based on the assumption that 100 per cent of the options in the Option Program 2022/2024 will be vested  an assumed Subscription Price of SEK 52.50 and an assumed share price of SEK 168 at the exercise of the options  the costs for social security charges will amount to approximately SEK 15.2 million. The company's total cost for social security charges is proposed to be hedged through a directed issue of warrants pursuant to item B above.DILUTION AND EFFECTS ON KEY FIGURESOption Program 2022/2024 comprises the issuance of maximum 951 200 warrants  of which 820 000 warrants to secure BioInvent's commitments towards the participants in the program and 131 200 warrants to secure costs for social security charges. At full exercise of all issued warrants under Option Program 2022/2024 for subscription of new shares  BioInvent's share capital will increase by SEK 190 240. This corresponds to approximately 1.60 per cent of the shares and votes in the company after exercise. The warrants of Option Program 2022/2024 would have affected the key figure earnings after tax per share (2021) by SEK -0.13. To further illustrate the potential dilution that Option Program 2022/2024 may be expected to entail  the size of the program has also been calculated based on the assumption of an annual staff turnover of 10 per cent and an assumption that the performance criteria are met to 80 per cent  which would entail a dilution of approximately 0.89 per cent.Following evaluation of the effectiveness of the Option Program 2022/2024  the intention of the Board of Directors is to propose recurring option plans on an annual basis  similar to the Option Program 2022/2024.BioInvent has one ongoing equity incentive program for management referred to as Option Program 2019/2025 (stock options)  which comprises maximum 150 616 new shares in BioInvent  assuming full vesting 2022  at a subscription price of SEK 77.25 per share. If all options are exercised for new shares  the company's share capital will increase by SEK 30 123  which is equivalent to approximately 0.26 per cent of the shares and votes in the company after exercise.MAJORITY REQUIREMENTSThe Board of Directors' proposal for a resolution regarding Option Program 2022/2024 and the necessary security measures connected thereto pursuant to items A and B above form one combined proposal. Therefore  it is proposed that the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting under item A and B are passed as one single resolution  pursuant to the majority provisions of chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that shareholders holding not less than 9/10th of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting must vote for the proposal.Resolution on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve on new shares issue (item 17)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on the issue of new shares on one or several occasions during the period up to the next Annual General Meeting. The number of shares to be issued by virtue of the authorization shall not entail a dilution effect of more than 20 per cent of the registered share capital after completed issue. The issue may take place with or without a deviation from the shareholders' preferential right and with or without provisions on contribution in kind or set-off or any other terms. The purpose of the authorization is to increase the company's financial flexibility and enable acquisitions by payment of shares. If the Board of Directors resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  the reason may be to add new capital and/or new company owners of strategic importance to the company and/or the acquisition of other companies or businesses. At a deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  the subscription price shall be determined in accordance with market conditions. Other terms may be resolved by the Board of Directors.The proposal is subject to support by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.1. RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director shall  if any shareholder so requests  and if the Board of Directors considers that this can be done without significant harm for the company  give information on circumstances that can affect the judgement of an item on the agenda  circumstances that can affect the assessment of the company's or its subsidiaries' financial situation and the company's relation to other companies within the Group and the group accounts.2. AVAILABLE DOCUMENTS ETCThe proposal and motivated statement of the Nomination Committee and proxy forms are available at the company's website www.bioinvent.se. Accounting documents  the Auditor's Report and other documents to be held available according to the Swedish Companies Act  will be available on the company's website as from Thursday 7 April 2022  at the latest  and be distributed to shareholders who so request and state their postal address.At the time of this notice  the total number of shares and votes in the company amounts to 58 471 096.3.

Through a share-based incentive programme  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's earnings and value growth and creates long-term incentives for the programme participants. In light of the above  the Board of Directors believes that the implementation of Share Programme 2022/2025 may have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and  consequently  that Share Programme 2022/2025 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Participants in Share Programme 2022/2025 and allocationShare Programme 2022/2025 is proposed to include a maximum of approximately 2 000 senior executives and key employees within the Hexagon Group  who are divided into four groups: the President and CEO and group management (""Group 1"")  division managers (""Group 2"") and other senior executives and key employees (""Group 3"" and ""Group 4""). Invitation to participate in the programme shall be provided by Hexagon no later than 30 June 2022. Participation in Share Programme 2022/2025 requires that the participant has been employed by the Hexagon Group for at least twelve (12) months prior to the date of the offer.Participants are offered to be allocated performance awards that may entitle to Series B shares according to the conditions set out below. The performance awards shall be based on a maximum value for each participant category. The maximum value for the participants in Group 1 will be 50 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022  for participants in Group 2 and Group 3  100 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022  and for participants in Group 4  35 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022. The total sum of the maximum values of the performance awards thus defined for all participants will not exceed EUR 60 million  including social costs.The share price used to calculate the number of shares to which the performance awards entitles will be the volume-weighted average of the market price of Hexagon Series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of five (5) trading days before the day the participants are offered to participate in the programme.Performance conditionAllocated performance awards entitle to the receipt of Series B shares in the company provided that the performance condition related to the development of Hexagon's earnings per share[1] compared to the target level set by the Board of Directors during the measurement period 1 January 2022 until 31 December 2025 are fulfilled  where the last financial year during the measurement period is compared with the financial year preceding the measurement period  with reservation for any reduction in the number of shares in accordance with the terms of Share Programme 2022/2025. The Board of Directors intends to present the fulfillment of the performance-based condition in the annual report for the financial year 2025.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.– Performance awards shall be granted free of charge after the Annual General Meeting.– Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share in the company free of charge approximately four (4) years after allotment of the award (vesting period)  provided that the above performance condition has been met and that the holder  at the time of the release of the interim report for the first quarter 2026 still is employed by the Hexagon Group. Exemptions to the requirement of employment may be granted in specific cases  including a participant's disability or retirement.– The Board of Directors shall have the opportunity to make adjustments as a result of extraordinary events such as bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events.– The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.– The performance awards can be granted by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board of Directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions and administration of Share Programme 2022/2025  in accordance with the above mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments  including for example a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares  if significant changes in the Hexagon Group  or its operational environment  would  as assessed by the Board of Directors  result in a situation where the established terms and conditions for Share Programme 2022/2025 no longer are appropriate or reasonable.In the event that the Board of Directors considers that the delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025 cannot be achieved at a reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make appropriate local adjustments to the programme or instead offer participants a cash settlement.Scope and costs of the programmeProvided that the share price for the company's Series B share at the time of allotment of performance awards under Share Programme 2022/2025 is SEK 133.45  Share Programme 2022/2025 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 4 260 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.2 per cent of the total outstanding shares in the company.Provided that the performance condition is fully met  the total costs for Share Programme 2022/2025  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  is estimated to a maximum of approximately EUR 60 million  allocated over the vesting period. Estimated social costs and administration costs for the programme are included in the amount.In the event that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 would exceed EUR 60 million  the total number of allocated Series B shares in Hexagon will be reduced so that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 will not exceed this amount. Such reduction will be made pro rata in relation to the highest value for each participant category in accordance with the above.Delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under Share Programme 2022/2025  the company intends to enter into an agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  under which the third party shall  in its own name  acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to the participants in accordance with Share Programme 2022/2025.Preparation of the proposalShare Programme 2022/2025 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Hexagon and has been structured in consultation with external advisers. Share Programme 2022/2025 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings with the Board of Directors.

In addition to the programmes described therein  there are no other long term incentive programmes in Hexagon.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors on acquisition and transfer of own shares (item 14)Hexagon has previously  on the basis of authorization by the General Meeting  acquired own Series B shares for the purpose of using repurchased shares to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure  to finance potential company acquisitions  and as a hedge for the company's share-based incentive programmes. As of 1 January 2022  the company held 9 350 000 own Series B shares  corresponding to approximately 0.3 per cent of the total number of shares in the company. The Board of Directors makes the assessment that it remains advantageous for the company to continue to be able to use repurchased shares in order to adjust the company's capital structure  on account of potential company acquisitions and for the company's share-based incentive programmes.In view of the above  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to pass a resolution  on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  on acquisition and transfer of Series B shares in the company. Acquisition of shares may be made at a maximum of so many Series B shares that the company's holding does not exceed ten (10) per cent of all shares in the company at that time. Acquisitions of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer of Series B shares may be made at a maximum of ten (10) per cent of the total number of shares in the company. A transfer may be made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights on Nasdaq Stockholm as well as to third parties in connection with acquisition of a company or a business. Compensation for transferred shares can be paid in cash  through an issue in kind or a set-off. Transfers of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer in connection with acquisitions may be made at a market value assessed by the Board of Directors.The purpose of the authorizations is (i) to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value  (ii) to enable acquisition opportunities by financing acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (iii) to ensure the company's undertakings  due to share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants in incentive programs)  including social security costs.The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors to issue shares  convertibles and/or warrants (item 15)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors during the period up until the next annual general meeting to  on one or more occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  andwith or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions  resolve to issue Series B shares  convertibles and/or warrants (with rights to subscribe for or convert into Series B shares). By resolutions in accordance with the authorization  the number of shares may be increased by a number corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) percent of the number of outstanding shares in the company at the time when the Board of Directors first uses the authorization.The purpose of the authorization and the reasons for a potential deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights as set out above  is to ensure financing of acquisitions of companies  part of companies or businesses or to strengthen the company's capital base and equity/assets ratio. Such issues may not require amendment of the Articles of Association applicable from time to time. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues by virtue of the authorisation shall be made on market conditions. In accordance with the conditions set out above  the Board of Directors shall also be authorized to resolve on other terms as considered necessary by the Board of Directors to carry out the issues.The Board of Directors further proposes that the Managing Director  or anyone appointed by the Managing Director  shall have the right to make any adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw: Bolagsverket).The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.E.

The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments  including for example a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares  if significant changes in the Hexagon Group  or its operational environment  would  as assessed by the Board of Directors  result in a situation where the established terms and conditions for Share Programme 2022/2025 no longer are appropriate or reasonable.In the event that the Board of Directors considers that the delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025 cannot be achieved at a reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make appropriate local adjustments to the programme or instead offer participants a cash settlement.Scope and costs of the programmeProvided that the share price for the company's Series B share at the time of allotment of performance awards under Share Programme 2022/2025 is SEK 133.45  Share Programme 2022/2025 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 4 260 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.2 per cent of the total outstanding shares in the company.Provided that the performance condition is fully met  the total costs for Share Programme 2022/2025  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  is estimated to a maximum of approximately EUR 60 million  allocated over the vesting period. Estimated social costs and administration costs for the programme are included in the amount.In the event that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 would exceed EUR 60 million  the total number of allocated Series B shares in Hexagon will be reduced so that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 will not exceed this amount. Such reduction will be made pro rata in relation to the highest value for each participant category in accordance with the above.Delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under Share Programme 2022/2025  the company intends to enter into an agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  under which the third party shall  in its own name  acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to the participants in accordance with Share Programme 2022/2025.Preparation of the proposalShare Programme 2022/2025 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Hexagon and has been structured in consultation with external advisers. Share Programme 2022/2025 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings with the Board of Directors. Ola Rollén  President and CEO and board member  who may participate in the proposed Share Programme 2022/2025  has not participated in the preparation of the matter.Previous incentive programmes in HexagonFor a description of Hexagon's other incentive programmes  Share Programme 2020/2023 and Share Programme 2021/2024  please see the company's Annual Report 2021  note 30  and the company's website www.hexagon.com. In addition to the programmes described therein  there are no other long term incentive programmes in Hexagon.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors on acquisition and transfer of own shares (item 14)Hexagon has previously  on the basis of authorization by the General Meeting  acquired own Series B shares for the purpose of using repurchased shares to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure  to finance potential company acquisitions  and as a hedge for the company's share-based incentive programmes. As of 1 January 2022  the company held 9 350 000 own Series B shares  corresponding to approximately 0.3 per cent of the total number of shares in the company. The Board of Directors makes the assessment that it remains advantageous for the company to continue to be able to use repurchased shares in order to adjust the company's capital structure  on account of potential company acquisitions and for the company's share-based incentive programmes.In view of the above  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to pass a resolution  on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  on acquisition and transfer of Series B shares in the company. Acquisition of shares may be made at a maximum of so many Series B shares that the company's holding does not exceed ten (10) per cent of all shares in the company at that time. Acquisitions of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer of Series B shares may be made at a maximum of ten (10) per cent of the total number of shares in the company. A transfer may be made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights on Nasdaq Stockholm as well as to third parties in connection with acquisition of a company or a business. Compensation for transferred shares can be paid in cash  through an issue in kind or a set-off. Transfers of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer in connection with acquisitions may be made at a market value assessed by the Board of Directors.The purpose of the authorizations is (i) to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value  (ii) to enable acquisition opportunities by financing acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (iii) to ensure the company's undertakings  due to share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants in incentive programs)  including social security costs.The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors to issue shares  convertibles and/or warrants (item 15)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors during the period up until the next annual general meeting to  on one or more occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  andwith or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions  resolve to issue Series B shares  convertibles and/or warrants (with rights to subscribe for or convert into Series B shares). By resolutions in accordance with the authorization  the number of shares may be increased by a number corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) percent of the number of outstanding shares in the company at the time when the Board of Directors first uses the authorization.The purpose of the authorization and the reasons for a potential deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights as set out above  is to ensure financing of acquisitions of companies  part of companies or businesses or to strengthen the company's capital base and equity/assets ratio. Such issues may not require amendment of the Articles of Association applicable from time to time. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues by virtue of the authorisation shall be made on market conditions. In accordance with the conditions set out above  the Board of Directors shall also be authorized to resolve on other terms as considered necessary by the Board of Directors to carry out the issues.The Board of Directors further proposes that the Managing Director  or anyone appointed by the Managing Director  shall have the right to make any adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw: Bolagsverket).The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.E.

This removes the control of crypto activities from the influence of third parties  unlike what is obtainable in the centralized space.One of the recent measures that enforce decentralization is digital ledger technology. It involves using technological protocols that maintain the security of the decentralized digital database.Though the networks are distributed  there are always simultaneous validation  accessibility  and information updating. Also  besides eliminating cybercrime with this technology  it’s more effective  cheaper  and provides faster transaction processes.Related Reading | PUBG Developer Krafton Joins Forces With Solana For Blockchain And NFT GamesEuroclear  on Monday  has announced its investment into Fnality though the investment amount remains undisclosed.Also  Euroclear aims to develop personal distributed technology (DLT) through collaboration. This move will ensure its settlement of digital securities over digital cash. It is worthy to note that the securities clearing company claims that its assets under custody are more than 37.6 trillion euros.The Functionality Of Fnality InternationalFnality is a consortium of financial institutions that tilts towards adopting regulated tokenized assets and their marketplaces. It was established in 2019 and operates by increasing the efficiency and speed of post-trade operations in locations like market issuance  interest payment servicing  and collateral trading.Furthermore  Fnality International stated its aim of improving central banks’ efficiency in payment settlements. Some of its prominent shareholders are CIBC  Barclays  ING  UBS  Credit Suissue  and Mizuho Bank Nasdaq.Concerning the investment from Euroclear  Rhomaios Ram  the CEO of Fnality International  stated that having Euroclear as part of their consortium is a welcoming path for the company’s diversification. Also  he mentioned that it would help the firm’s expansion and its Financial Market Infrastructure.On its part  Euroclear Group CEO  Lieve Mostrey  said that his group is excited about the partnership with Fnality. This move is in synchronization with their clients in creating a pathway for both digital cash and digital securities settlement that will be profitable for the entire industry.Before now  Euroclear had partnered with Banque de France  the apex bank of France  as the leading team. The project was on the experimentation of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) to settle French government bonds on the Digital Ledger Technology (DLT).Related Reading | Hacker Group Anonymous Leaks 35 000 Files Of Stolen Russian Central Bank DocumentsThe project  which was scheduled for ten months  had about 500 different institutions as participants in the beginning. In the course of the projects  the participants  as trial engagement  had to trade the French government security tokens and bonds. Their settlements were through the CBDC from the central bank.In 2021  the Euroclear Group settlement in securities transactions amounted to about 992 trillion euros  equivalent to about $1.09 quadrillion.Featured image from Pexels  chart from TradingView.com,neutral,0.03,0.95,0.03,mixed,0.51,0.26,0.22,True,English,"['Fnality Venture Funds', 'Digital Ledger Technology', 'Strategy', 'Bitcoinist', 'Stolen Russian Central Bank Documents', 'French government security tokens', 'central bank digital currency', 'Mizuho Bank Nasdaq', 'faster transaction processes', 'PUBG Developer Krafton', 'French government bonds', 'personal distributed technology', 'interest payment servicing', 'central banks’ efficiency', 'digital ledger technology', 'decentralized digital database', 'regulated tokenized assets', 'Financial Market Infrastructure', 'Banque de France', 'digital securities settlement', 'securities clearing company', 'Euroclear Group settlement', 'Euroclear Group CEO', 'apex bank', 'digital cash', 'decentralized characteristic', 'financial institutions', 'market issuance', 'securities transactions', 'Hacker Group', 'crypto activities', 'third parties', 'centralized space', 'recent measures', 'technological protocols', 'simultaneous validation', 'information updating', 'Related Reading', 'NFT Games', '37.6 trillion euros', 'post-trade operations', 'collateral trading', 'payment settlements', 'prominent shareholders', 'Credit Suissue', 'Rhomaios Ram', 'welcoming path', 'Lieve Mostrey', 'entire industry', 'leading team', 'ten months', '500 different institutions', 'trial engagement', '992 trillion euros', 'Featured image', 'Fnality International', 'investment amount', 'advent', 'breakthrough', 'cryptocurrency', 'adoption', 'control', 'influence', 'decentralization', 'networks', 'accessibility', 'cybercrime', 'Forces', 'Solana', 'Blockchain', 'Monday', 'DLT', 'collaboration', 'move', 'custody', 'The', 'Functionality', 'consortium', 'marketplaces', 'speed', 'locations', 'aim', 'CIBC', 'Barclays', 'UBS', 'diversification', 'firm', 'expansion', 'partnership', 'synchronization', 'clients', 'pathway', 'project', 'experimentation', 'CBDC', 'Anonymous', '35,000 Files', 'participants', 'beginning', 'course', '$1.09 quadrillion', 'Pexels', 'chart', 'TradingView']",2022-03-29,2022-03-29,bitcoinist.com

Excluding this Monday’s coupon  Russia has another $4.4bn (about R64bn) in external debt redemptions due for the remainder of the year. Some corporate borrowers have also faced payment delays.Russia’s next payment is on March 31 when a $447m (about R6.5bn) payment falls due.

Such issues may be made at a price below the market price of the shares  however not lower than the shares' quota value.Item 16; Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition and transfer of own sharesThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors  for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  to decide on the acquisition and transfer of own shares on or outside Nasdaq Stockholm or in accordance with an offer made to all shareholders. The authorization may be exercised on one or more occasions until the Annual General Meeting 2023.A maximum of so many shares may be acquired that the company's holdings  including shares that have otherwise been acquired and held  will not exceed five (5) percent of all shares in the company. Transfer in accordance with the authorization may be made of all own shares held by the company at the time of the Board's decision.The purpose of the proposal is to give the board increased scope for action and the opportunity to continuously adapt the company's capital structure  thereby contributing to increased shareholder value and to capture attractive business opportunities by fully or partially financing corporate acquisitions with own shares and to secure undertakings and social security contributions under the incentive program.Item 17; Resolution on the adoption of Share programme 2022Item 17 (a); The Board of Director's proposal for a resolution on Share program 2022BackgroundFor TF Bank to be able to successfully implement the bank's business strategy and safeguard the bank's long-term interests  including its sustainability  it is a prerequisite for the bank to be able to recruit and retain qualified members of staff. Remuneration should encourage high performance and at the same time be compatible with and promote sound and effective risk management and counteract excessive risk-taking. Performance is evaluated from a multi-year perspective on the basis of pre-determined financial and non-financial goals.Equity-based remuneration is a means to recruit  motivate and retain staff with key competences in TF Bank. Furthermore  employees' shareholding builds and strengthens long-term commitment in the interests of the shareholders.The evaluation and preparation of the Share program 2022TF Bank's share program 2022 (""Share program 2022"") has been prepared by the Board and the Board's remuneration committee (""RemCo""). The RemCo shall also monitor the participation in the program.The preparation has focused on the allotment criteria  while also considering the effectiveness  attractiveness and competitiveness of the program. Market and societal trends  shareholders' preferences and regulatory requirements have been taken into account.Based on this preparation and discussions with the bank's major shareholders  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2022 resolves on a long-term share-program for senior executives and some other employees of TF Bank (""Participants"").TF Bank's Share program 2022 allows for risk adjustment and the final outcome may therefore be cancelled partly or entirely in accordance with the bank's remuneration policy and applicable regulations. This means  among other things  that the number of Matching Shares (as defined below) that a Participant can retain through TF Bank's Share program 2022 may be reduced or completely canceled in certain cases  for example if the outcome is not defensible with regard to the bank's financial situation.The Board's and RemCo's view is that the proposal strikes an appropriate balance between motivating the employees and achieving a long-term  well-balanced and competitive remuneration.Terms for the Share program 2022TF Banks Share program 2022 is a program directed to senior executives and some other employees of TF Bank  including the CEO and Deputy CEO. The program is not directed to Board members of the Company. The program covers up to 24 persons. The program period is three years and lasts from 30 November 2022 until 30 November 2025.Every Participant is allocated an individually determined number of conditional share rights (""Rights"")  each of which entitles the holder to one matching share in TF Bank (""Matching Shares""). The allocation of Rights will be distributed among the Participants as follows:Category Number of Rights per Participant Senior Executives (3 persons) maximum 3 000 Other directors  key persons and specialists (up to 21 persons) maximum 1 000 Total 26 000The Rights are conditional on the Participant acquiring the corresponding number of shares in TF Bank (""Acquired Shares"") no later than 30 November 2022. The Participant is entitled to receive a Matching Share for each allotted Right that is matched by an Acquired Share. Excess Rights shall lapse without any right for the Participant to receive a Matching Share.The number of Rights allocated to a Participant will be determined based on an assessment of: The Participant's results  the Participant's result unit's results and the bank's total results. In assessing the employee's results  both financial and non-financial criteria will be considered.The Matching Shares will be transferred to the Participants when the Share Program 2022 expires on 30 November 2025. For the ownership of the Matching Shares to be transferred to the Participants  certain conditions must be met as of 30 November 2023  2024 and 2025  respectively. One third of the Matching shares are earned if the conditions are met at each of these times. A Participant who meets the conditions as of 30 November 2023 and 2024  but not 2025  is thus entitled to receive two thirds of the Matching Shares. The conditions that must be met are that the Participant at such time: (i) is employed by the bank; (ii) holds the Acquired Shares; and (ii) that the financial and/or non-financial criteria which the board decides upon allocation of the Rights are fulfilled. The board has the right to adjust the financial and/or non-financial criteria in accordance with (iii) above annually. Such adjustment shall be made no later than 30 November during a year to apply for the forthcoming year.The program comprises an obligation for the bank to deliver approximately 26 000 shares to the Participants.The number of Matching Shares which each Participant may receive may be subject to recalculation under the terms and conditions of the program as a consequence of issues of bonus shares to shareholders  splits  preferential issues and similar measures.AllotmentThe maximum number of shares that can be transferred under the Share program 2022 is 26 000 shares. The maximum number of shares under the program equals approximately 0.12 per cent of the total number of shares in the bank. The delivery of shares is proposed to be effectuated with existing shares. Allotment of Rights under the program shall be made before 31 May 2022.Acquired Shares and Matching shares shall be ordinary shares of TF Bank with the right to a dividend. The Rights are not securities that can be sold  pledged or transferred to others.MiscellaneousBefore the final outcome of TF Bank's Share program 2022 are determined  the Board shall examine whether the outcome inter alia from a risk perspective is reasonable considering TF Bank's results and financial position  the conditions on the stock market  conditions related to the individual Participant and other circumstances such as changes in accounting principles. If this is not deemed to be the case  the Board has the right  within the limit of the total program  to change the outcome to the number the board deems reasonable. The outcome may be set to zero. Any change shall be communicated in connection with TF Bank's first financial report following the decision.The Board is authorized to make changes to TF Bank's Share program 2022 from time to time if so deemed advisable by the Board or RemCo and provided that the program following such changes are within the limits of the maximum number of shares in the program  the maximum number of shares of the total number of shares in the bank and the calculated maximum costs.TaxationThe programs have been designed in such a way that Participants will normally be taxed for the benefit of receiving shares in the income year when the shares are received  i.e.  2025. The taxable value of the benefit will normally be equal to the closing price for the shares on the day when the shares are received. The value of the benefit is taxed as income from employment for the Participant. Thus  social security contributions will in most cases be charged on the benefit amount and be a cost for the employer.CostUnder the assumption that TF Bank hedges its undertakings under Share program 2022 by acquiring its own shares at an average price of SEK 200 per share and that all Participants fulfil the criteria and receive the full number of Matching Shares  the cost for Share program 2022 (including social security contributions) will amount to MSEK 6 8 over a three-year period. If only half of the Matching Shares are transferred to the Participants  the cost for Share program 2022 (including social security contributions) will amount to MSEK 3 4 over a three-year period.Under the assumption that TF Bank hedges its undertakings under Share program 2022 by acquiring its own shares at an average price of SEK 250 per share and that all Participants fulfil the criteria and receive the full number of Matching Shares  the cost for Share program 2022 (including social security contributions) will amount to MSEK 8 5 over a three-year period. If only half of the Matching Shares are transferred to the Participants  the cost for Share program 2022 (including social security contributions) will amount to MSEK 4 3 over a three-year period.Hedging and transfer of sharesThe Share program 2022 lead to certain financial exposure for the bank  due to market price changes for the bank's share. The aim is to hedge this exposure by the acquisition of own shares or by equity swap contracts with third parties. The social security contribution is also hedged.There are different methods for effectuating the transfer of Matching Shares to the Participants under the programs  such as delivery of own shares and an agreement with a third party under which the third-party transfers shares to the Participants under the programs. The Board considers delivery of own shares as the most cost efficient and flexible method. Therefore  this is the main alternative (item 16 on the agenda for the Annual General Meeting).Item 17 (b); The Board of Directors proposal on resolution on the transfer of own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a maximum of 26 000 of the Acquired shares in the bank may be sold/transferred as follows.Participants  in the Share program 2022 who are entitled to receive shares  shall have a preferential right to receive the shares  to a number that follows from the terms and conditions of the Share program 2022. Subsidiaries within the TF Bank Group shall furthermore be entitled to acquire the shares for nil consideration  where such subsidiary shall within the scope of the terms and conditions of the program be obliged immediately to transfer the shares to the Participants; and The right to receive shares may be exercised in the period when the Participants are entitled to receive shares under the Share program 2022.Shares and votesThe share capital of the bank is 107 500 000 SEK consisting of a total of 21 500 000 common shares. Each common share entitles to one (1) vote at the meeting.Majority rulesApproval of the Board of Directors' proposal according to items 15 and 16 requires that the Annual General Meeting's resolution is supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast and shares represented at the Meeting. Approval of the Board of Director's proposal according to item 17(b) requires that the Annual General Meeting's resolution is supported by shareholders representing at least nine tenths of the votes cast and shares represented at the Meeting.DocumentsAnnual accounts  auditor's report and complete proposals and other documents required in accordance with the Swedish Companies act will  no later than April 12  2022  be made available at the company headquarters  and at the company website www.tfbankgroup.com.

PROPOSAL ON RESOLUTION REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION OF OPTION PROGRAM 2022/2024The Option Program shall comprise the grant of maximum 820 000 stock options (Sw. personaloptioner). Each option will entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in BioInvent at a subscription price equivalent to 125 per cent of the volume-weighted average price paid for the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm (the ""Stock Exchange"") during ten trading days as from and including 28 April 2022 (i.e. the first trading day after the publication of the company's interim report for January - March 2022) (the ""Subscription Price""). The calculated Subscription Price shall be rounded off to the nearest cent (Sw. öre)  whereby 0.5 öre shall be rounded up. The Subscription Price and the number of shares that each option entitles the holder to subscribe for may be subject to conversion pursuant to a bonus issue  share split  rights issue and similar actions  whereby customary conversion terms shall be applied.

New employees and other key persons may be included in the Option Program 2022/2024 prior to 1 July 2022.Options granted will vest by 1/3 during each of the financial years 2022  2023 and 2024  based on performance and continued employment with  or assignment for  BioInvent. The performance criteria for vesting will be based on the same criteria as for management's annual bonus  which principally are based on fixed technical milestone-criteria in projects  criteria for development of the project portfolio and other pre-determined criteria attributable to the business  which are designed to promote the long-term value creation of the company. Vesting shall be proportional in relation to the period of employment or assignment during the year in question. Annual vesting will be determined by the Board of Directors in connection with the adoption of the year-end report for the financial years 2022  2023 and 2024  respectively. The option holders may exercise vested options as from the day of release of the company's year-end report for the financial year 2024 up to and including 28 February 2026. Upon exercise  each option will entitle the option holder to receive one share in BioInvent  or one warrant immediately exercisable for one share  against payment of the Subscription Price. If the option holder's employment with or assignment for BioInvent is terminated by the participant  or if terminated by BioInvent due to the participant's breach of contract  all options shall immediately expire and cannot be exercised thereafter. If the employment or the assignment is terminated for other reasons  vested options may be exercised  but the right to options not yet vested will expire. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to resolve upon another application in individual cases.B. PROPOSAL ON RESOLUTION REGARDING DIRECTED ISSUE OF WARRANTS AND APPROVAL OF TRANSFER OF WARRANTSA maximum of 951 200 warrants shall be issued. Right to subscribe shall  with deviation from the preferential right for existing shareholders  reside in BioInvent's wholly owned subsidiary BioInvent Finans AB. Subscription of the warrants shall be made on a separate subscription list no later than 30 June 2022. The warrants shall be issued free of charge. Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share. The subscription price per share shall be equivalent to the Subscription Price (as determined above). The subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for may be subject to conversion pursuant to a capitalization issue  share split  rights issue and similar actions  whereby customary conversion terms shall be applied. Subscription of shares by virtue of the warrants shall be made no later than 28 February 2026. Shares issued following exercise of warrants during a certain financial year shall entitle to dividend for the first time on the record day for dividend which occurs following registration of the shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are set out in ""Terms of the BioInvent International AB warrants 2022/2024"".The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is that the issue forms part of the implementation of Option Program 2022/2024. In view of what is set forth under background and motive above  the Board of Directors is of the opinion that it is of benefit to BioInvent and its shareholders that all employees and other key persons are offered to participate in Option Program 2022/2024.The Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that BioInvent Finans AB transfers warrants to participants in Option Program 2022/2024 and otherwise disposes of the warrants in order to secure the company's commitments and costs in connection with Option Program 2022/2024.COSTS FOR OPTION PROGRAM 2022/2024The Option Program 2022/2024 will lead to certain costs. Based on the assumption that 100 per cent of the options in the program will be vested  the salary cost in the accounts pursuant to IFRS 2 is expected to amount to approximately SEK 9.4 million in total during the period 2022-2024 based on the options actual value at the start of the program. The options have no market value as they are non-transferable. However  the Board of Directors has assessed a theoretical value of the options through application of the Black & Scholes valuation model (in relation to the performance criteria). The calculations have been based on an assumed share price of SEK 42.00 and an assumed volatility of 48 per cent. The value of the options of Option Program 2022/2024 pursuant to this valuation is approximately SEK 11.44 per option with the application of the Black & Scholes formula. The transfer restrictions have not been taken into account in the valuation. The actual IFRS 2 cost during the vesting period depends on how many options that are vested.At fulfilment of the vesting conditions and exercise of the options  Option Program 2022/2024 will lead to costs in the form of social security charges. The total costs for social security charges during the vesting period depends on how many options that are vested and the value of the options at exercise. Based on the assumption that 100 per cent of the options in the Option Program 2022/2024 will be vested  an assumed Subscription Price of SEK 52.50 and an assumed share price of SEK 168 at the exercise of the options  the costs for social security charges will amount to approximately SEK 15.2 million. The company's total cost for social security charges is proposed to be hedged through a directed issue of warrants pursuant to item B above.DILUTION AND EFFECTS ON KEY FIGURESOption Program 2022/2024 comprises the issuance of maximum 951 200 warrants  of which 820 000 warrants to secure BioInvent's commitments towards the participants in the program and 131 200 warrants to secure costs for social security charges. At full exercise of all issued warrants under Option Program 2022/2024 for subscription of new shares  BioInvent's share capital will increase by SEK 190 240. This corresponds to approximately 1.60 per cent of the shares and votes in the company after exercise. The warrants of Option Program 2022/2024 would have affected the key figure earnings after tax per share (2021) by SEK -0.13. To further illustrate the potential dilution that Option Program 2022/2024 may be expected to entail  the size of the program has also been calculated based on the assumption of an annual staff turnover of 10 per cent and an assumption that the performance criteria are met to 80 per cent  which would entail a dilution of approximately 0.89 per cent.Following evaluation of the effectiveness of the Option Program 2022/2024  the intention of the Board of Directors is to propose recurring option plans on an annual basis  similar to the Option Program 2022/2024.BioInvent has one ongoing equity incentive program for management referred to as Option Program 2019/2025 (stock options)  which comprises maximum 150 616 new shares in BioInvent  assuming full vesting 2022  at a subscription price of SEK 77.25 per share. If all options are exercised for new shares  the company's share capital will increase by SEK 30 123  which is equivalent to approximately 0.26 per cent of the shares and votes in the company after exercise.MAJORITY REQUIREMENTSThe Board of Directors' proposal for a resolution regarding Option Program 2022/2024 and the necessary security measures connected thereto pursuant to items A and B above form one combined proposal. Therefore  it is proposed that the resolutions of the Annual General Meeting under item A and B are passed as one single resolution  pursuant to the majority provisions of chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act  meaning that shareholders holding not less than 9/10th of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting must vote for the proposal.Resolution on authorization of the Board of Directors to resolve on new shares issue (item 17)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on the issue of new shares on one or several occasions during the period up to the next Annual General Meeting. The number of shares to be issued by virtue of the authorization shall not entail a dilution effect of more than 20 per cent of the registered share capital after completed issue. The issue may take place with or without a deviation from the shareholders' preferential right and with or without provisions on contribution in kind or set-off or any other terms. The purpose of the authorization is to increase the company's financial flexibility and enable acquisitions by payment of shares. If the Board of Directors resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  the reason may be to add new capital and/or new company owners of strategic importance to the company and/or the acquisition of other companies or businesses. At a deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  the subscription price shall be determined in accordance with market conditions. Other terms may be resolved by the Board of Directors.The proposal is subject to support by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.1. RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors and the Managing Director shall  if any shareholder so requests  and if the Board of Directors considers that this can be done without significant harm for the company  give information on circumstances that can affect the judgement of an item on the agenda  circumstances that can affect the assessment of the company's or its subsidiaries' financial situation and the company's relation to other companies within the Group and the group accounts.2. AVAILABLE DOCUMENTS ETCThe proposal and motivated statement of the Nomination Committee and proxy forms are available at the company's website www.bioinvent.se. Accounting documents  the Auditor's Report and other documents to be held available according to the Swedish Companies Act  will be available on the company's website as from Thursday 7 April 2022  at the latest  and be distributed to shareholders who so request and state their postal address.At the time of this notice  the total number of shares and votes in the company amounts to 58 471 096.3.

EB Participants are strongly encouraged to familiarise themselves with the new arrangements with Euroclear Bank  including the new voting deadlines and procedures. For voting services offered by custodians holding Irish corporate securities directly with Euroclear Bank  please contact your custodian. Further Information for the holders of CDIs (""CDI Holders"") CDI Holders should consult with their stockbroker or other intermediary at the earliest opportunity forfurther information on the processes and timelines for submitting proxy votes for the AGM through the respective systems. Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited (""EUI"")  the operator of CREST  has arranged for voting instructionsrelating to the CDIs held in CREST to be received via a third-party service provider  Broadridge Financial Solutions Limited (""Broadridge""). Further details on this service are set out on the ""All youneed to know about SRD II"" in Euroclear UK & Ireland webpage (see section CREST International Service - Proxy voting). If you are a CDI Holder  you will be required to make use of the EUI proxy voting service facilitated by Broadridge Global Proxy Voting service in order to receive meeting announcements and send back voting instructions  as required. If you hold CDIs and wish to participate in the proxy voting service but have not already registered to avail of this service  you will need to complete the AGM and Voting Client Setup Form (CRT408). Completed application forms should be returned to EUI by an authorised signatory with another relevant authorised signatory copied in for verification purposes using the following email address:eui.srd2@euroclear.com. Fully completed and returned applications forms will be shared with Broadridge by EUI. This will enable Broadridge to contact you and share further detailed information on the service offering and initiate the process for granting your access to the Broadridge platform. Once CDI Holders have access to the Broadridge platform  they can complete and submit proxy appointments (including voting instructions) electronically. Broadridge will process and deliver proxy voting instructions received from CDI Holders by the Broadridge voting deadline date to Euroclear Bank  by their cut-off and to agreed market requirements. Alternatively  a CDI Holder can send a third-party proxy voting instruction through the Broadridge platform in order to appoint a third-party (who may be a corporate representative or the CDI Holder themselves) to attend and vote at the AGM for the number of ordinary shares specified in the proxy instruction (subject to the Broadridge voting deadline). There is no facility to offer a letter of representation/appoint a corporate representative other than through the submission of third-party proxy appointment instructions through Broadridge. Broadridge's voting deadline will be earlier than Euroclear Bank's voting instruction deadline as set out above and is expected to be the close of business (Irish time) on 28 April 2022 (to take into account the public holiday in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 2 May 2022). Voting instructions cannot be changed or cancelled after Broadridge's voting deadline. As the CDI voting deadline is expected to be before the Record Date  CDI holders that want to appoint and instruct the chair of the AGM as their Proxy and vote on their behalf at the AGM may need to make additional arrangements to send a 'Transfer to Escrow instruction' (""TTE Instruction"") to an EUI escrow account. If required  it is envisaged that the securities will be released from escrow  as soon as practicably possible  on the business day following the Record Date for the AGM  unless otherwise specified by Broadridge. TTE Instructions are read in conjunction with the voting instructions formally lodged and on their own do not constitute voting instructions. CDI Holders should pay close attention to any notices specifically relating to this AGM and are strongly encouraged to familiarise themselves with Broadridge's arrangements  including the voting deadlines and procedures and to take any further actions required by Broadridge before they can avail of the Broadridge Global Proxy voting service as soon as possible. Broadridge will use best endeavours to accept late votes  changes and cancellations from a CDI Holder after the voting deadline but there is no guarantee that these will be processed within the requisite timeframes.

Through a share-based incentive programme  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's earnings and value growth and creates long-term incentives for the programme participants. In light of the above  the Board of Directors believes that the implementation of Share Programme 2022/2025 may have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and  consequently  that Share Programme 2022/2025 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Participants in Share Programme 2022/2025 and allocationShare Programme 2022/2025 is proposed to include a maximum of approximately 2 000 senior executives and key employees within the Hexagon Group  who are divided into four groups: the President and CEO and group management ('Group 1')  division managers ('Group 2') and other senior executives and key employees ('Group 3' and 'Group 4'). Invitation to participate in the programme shall be provided by Hexagon no later than 30 June 2022. Participation in Share Programme 2022/2025 requires that the participant has been employed by the Hexagon Group for at least twelve (12) months prior to the date of the offer.Participants are offered to be allocated performance awards that may entitle to Series B shares according to the conditions set out below. The performance awards shall be based on a maximum value for each participant category. The maximum value for the participants in Group 1 will be 50 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022  for participants in Group 2 and Group 3  100 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022  and for participants in Group 4  35 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022. The total sum of the maximum values of the performance awards thus defined for all participants will not exceed EUR 60 million  including social costs.The share price used to calculate the number of shares to which the performance awards entitles will be the volume-weighted average of the market price of Hexagon Series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of five (5) trading days before the day the participants are offered to participate in the programme.Performance conditionAllocated performance awards entitle to the receipt of Series B shares in the company provided that the performance condition related to the development of Hexagon's earnings per share[1] compared to the target level set by the Board of Directors during the measurement period 1 January 2022 until 31 December 2025 are fulfilled  where the last financial year during the measurement period is compared with the financial year preceding the measurement period  with reservation for any reduction in the number of shares in accordance with the terms of Share Programme 2022/2025. The Board of Directors intends to present the fulfillment of the performance-based condition in the annual report for the financial year 2025.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.– Performance awards shall be granted free of charge after the Annual General Meeting.– Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share in the company free of charge approximately four (4) years after allotment of the award (vesting period)  provided that the above performance condition has been met and that the holder  at the time of the release of the interim report for the first quarter 2026 still is employed by the Hexagon Group. Exemptions to the requirement of employment may be granted in specific cases  including a participant's disability or retirement.– The Board of Directors shall have the opportunity to make adjustments as a result of extraordinary events such as bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events.– The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.– The performance awards can be granted by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board of Directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions and administration of Share Programme 2022/2025  in accordance with the above mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments  including for example a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares  if significant changes in the Hexagon Group  or its operational environment  would  as assessed by the Board of Directors  result in a situation where the established terms and conditions for Share Programme 2022/2025 no longer are appropriate or reasonable.In the event that the Board of Directors considers that the delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025 cannot be achieved at a reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make appropriate local adjustments to the programme or instead offer participants a cash settlement.Scope and costs of the programmeProvided that the share price for the company's Series B share at the time of allotment of performance awards under Share Programme 2022/2025 is SEK 133.45  Share Programme 2022/2025 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 4 260 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.2 per cent of the total outstanding shares in the company.Provided that the performance condition is fully met  the total costs for Share Programme 2022/2025  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  is estimated to a maximum of approximately EUR 60 million  allocated over the vesting period. Estimated social costs and administration costs for the programme are included in the amount.In the event that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 would exceed EUR 60 million  the total number of allocated Series B shares in Hexagon will be reduced so that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 will not exceed this amount. Such reduction will be made pro rata in relation to the highest value for each participant category in accordance with the above.Delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under Share Programme 2022/2025  the company intends to enter into an agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  under which the third party shall  in its own name  acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to the participants in accordance with Share Programme 2022/2025.Preparation of the proposalShare Programme 2022/2025 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Hexagon and has been structured in consultation with external advisers. Share Programme 2022/2025 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings with the Board of Directors. Ola Rollén  President and CEO and board member  who may participate in the proposed Share Programme 2022/2025  has not participated in the preparation of the matter.Previous incentive programmes in HexagonFor a description of Hexagon's other incentive programmes  Share Programme 2020/2023 and Share Programme 2021/2024  please see the company's Annual Report 2021  note 30  and the company's website . In addition to the programmes described therein  there are no other long term incentive programmes in Hexagon.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors on acquisition and transfer of own shares (item 14)Hexagon has previously  on the basis of authorization by the General Meeting  acquired own Series B shares for the purpose of using repurchased shares to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure  to finance potential company acquisitions  and as a hedge for the company's share-based incentive programmes. As of 1 January 2022  the company held 9 350 000 own Series B shares  corresponding to approximately 0.3 per cent of the total number of shares in the company. The Board of Directors makes the assessment that it remains advantageous for the company to continue to be able to use repurchased shares in order to adjust the company's capital structure  on account of potential company acquisitions and for the company's share-based incentive programmes.In view of the above  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to pass a resolution  on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  on acquisition and transfer of Series B shares in the company. Acquisition of shares may be made at a maximum of so many Series B shares that the company's holding does not exceed ten (10) per cent of all shares in the company at that time. Acquisitions of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer of Series B shares may be made at a maximum of ten (10) per cent of the total number of shares in the company. A transfer may be made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights on Nasdaq Stockholm as well as to third parties in connection with acquisition of a company or a business. Compensation for transferred shares can be paid in cash  through an issue in kind or a set-off. Transfers of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer in connection with acquisitions may be made at a market value assessed by the Board of Directors.The purpose of the authorizations is (i) to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value  (ii) to enable acquisition opportunities by financing acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (iii) to ensure the company's undertakings  due to share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants in incentive programs)  including social security costs.The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors to issue shares  convertibles and/or warrants (item 15)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors during the period up until the next annual general meeting to  on one or more occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  andwith or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions  resolve to issue Series B shares  convertibles and/or warrants (with rights to subscribe for or convert into Series B shares). By resolutions in accordance with the authorization  the number of shares may be increased by a number corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) percent of the number of outstanding shares in the company at the time when the Board of Directors first uses the authorization.The purpose of the authorization and the reasons for a potential deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights as set out above  is to ensure financing of acquisitions of companies  part of companies or businesses or to strengthen the company's capital base and equity/assets ratio. Such issues may not require amendment of the Articles of Association applicable from time to time. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues by virtue of the authorisation shall be made on market conditions. In accordance with the conditions set out above  the Board of Directors shall also be authorized to resolve on other terms as considered necessary by the Board of Directors to carry out the issues.The Board of Directors further proposes that the Managing Director  or anyone appointed by the Managing Director  shall have the right to make any adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw: Bolagsverket).The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.E.

FILE PHOTO: A Russian rouble banknote is seen in front of a descending and rising stock graph in this illustration taken March 1  2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic 2/2By Karin StroheckerLONDON (Reuters) -Russia retaliated in what it has called an ""economic war"" with the West on Tuesday by offering to buy back its $2 billion Eurobonds maturing next month in roubles rather than dollars.The finance ministry offer on Eurobonds maturing on April 4  Russia's biggest debt payment this year  follows Western moves to tighten sanctions against the country over its invasion of Ukraine and to freeze Moscow out of international finance.Moscow  which calls its actions in Ukraine a ""special military operation""  says Western measures amount to ""economic war"". In response  it has already demanded foreign firms pay for Russian gas in roubles rather than dollars or euros.It was not immediately clear if bondholders would be forced to accept roubles if they rejected the offer  a move that would break the terms of the bond and would again raise the prospect of Russia's first external sovereign default in a century.Creditors said it might be aimed at helping Russian holders who now face restrictions in receiving dollar payments.""This is a tender offer and not a final decision that these bonds will be paid in roubles. Perhaps  Russian authorities want to gauge investors’ willingness to accept payment in roubles?"" said Seaport Global credit analyst Himanshu Porwal.Tim Ash of BlueBay Asset Management  which is not a bondholder  said the move was part of a fight back by Russia's central bank and finance ministry ""to fend off default and stabilise markets and the rouble"".Ash said the United States' Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)  which enforces U.S. sanctions  ""should make clear"" it will not extend a deadline of May 25 for U.S. individuals or entities to receive payments on Russian sovereign bonds.Russia's finance ministry said in its statement on Tuesday that bondholders should submit requests to sell their holdings to the National Settlement Depository between 1300 GMT on March 29 and 1400 GMT on March 30.SECURING PAYMENTThe Eurobonds would be bought at a price equivalent to 100% of their nominal value  it said.A fund manager said the ministry's offer might be designed to help Russian investors secure payment because Euroclear  an international settlement system  had been blocking dollar payments to the Russian clearing system.""Everybody wants dollars right now – in and outside Russia – so I would assume that only local holders and local banks that have issues with sanctions will make use of this operation "" said Kaan Nazli  portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman  which recently reduced its exposure to Russian sovereign debt.Nazli  who said he had not previously seen a buyback that switched the repayment currency  added that foreign investors were unlikely to be interested given the rouble ""is no longer a convertible currency.""The rouble initially crumbled after the West imposed sanctions  plunging as much as 40% in value against the dollar since the start of 2022. It has since recovered and was trading down about 10% in Moscow on Tuesday.The finance ministry did not provide a breakdown of foreign and Russian holders of the Eurobond-2022.

Its not very compact and you may not be able to grab as many channels as you could with more powerful models - but ,The Antennas Direct Clearstream Flex indoor antenna offers rock-solid 50-mile radius reception for local digital channels at a lower price than some of its competitors. Its not very compact and you may not be able to grab as many channels as you could with more powerful models - but  if you’re relatively close to town  the Clearstream Flex should be more than enough for you.The Antennas Direct Clearstream Flex indoor antenna offers rock-solid 50-mile radius reception for local digital channels at a lower price than some of its competitors. Its not very compact and you may not be able to grab as many channels as you could with more powerful models - but  if you’re relatively close to town  the Clearstream Flex should be more than enough for you.30-second reviewAntennas Direct now owns rival OTA antenna retailer Mohu  but that hasn’t stopped the company from putting out some strong HD indoor antennas of its own. For example  you need look no further than the new Antennas Direct Clearstream Flex.Offering up a 50-mile radius of coverage and powered by an in-line power injector  the Flex is able to deliver much of your area’s local channels in clear HD without much of a struggle.For first-time HD antenna owners  Antennas Direct encourages you to download the free Antenna Point app that shows you where cable stations are geographically  and can then help you point your antenna in the right direction for the best possible signal.There are a few sticking points that we don’t love about the antenna including its window-filling size and potential to pull in fewer channels than other stronger models - but overall these are minor points that don’t mar the performance of this above-par antenna.DesignLike the Mohu Leaf Supreme Pro that we've reviewed previously  the Flex is a large  flat digital antenna that has a white side and a black side that can help it blend in with your living room décor. It’s best placed next to or on a window with direct visibility to the outside world  though you can place it up in an attic if you want to split the signal to go to multiple rooms.At 12x16 inches (LxW) it’s not exactly the most inconspicuous antenna we’ve yet to test - which some design-conscious folks may take umbrage with - but its massive footprint does help it pull in more channels when it’s positioned correctly.How will you know if it's in the right position  you ask? Antennas Direct actually offers an app called Antenna Point on iOS and Android that allows you to see where TV broadcasters are in your area and help point your antenna in the right direction. Once you’ve got your antenna placed in the right spot  then you can run a scan on your TV to lock in the stations.Also  like the Mohu Leaf Supreme Pro  the Flex comes with an in-line power injector that can strengthen the reception of your antenna. Depending on your proximity to broadcasters  you may not actually need it  and thankfully Antennas Direct built an on/off switch into the injector to turn it off should you find it unnecessary.Last but not least  to connect the antenna to the injector - or directly to your TV - the Flex comes with a 12-foot detachable coaxial cable. That length of wire should give you plenty of slack to reach the windows from a TV - and it feels like a premium addition compared to cheaper models that only come with a one-to-two foot coaxial cord.(Image credit: Antennas Direct)PerformanceThe overall performance of the Clearstream Flex is middling: with previous HD antennas we were able to pull in around 54 digital channels based on where we live but  by contrast  the Flex could only pull in around 48 of those channels  though we felt many of them came in just as well as with other  more-powerful models.According to Antennas Direct  the Flex has around a 50-mile radius when using the power booster. That’s a real step up compared to the cheaper 30-mile radius antenna that we were using previously - but even that was able to pull in all 54 channels we’ve seen previously.The good news is that in terms of strength and clarity  most of the channels looked great. We counted 42 channels that were good clarity  over half of which were in HD. Eventually  some of those will switch over to 4K when more ATSC 3.0 stations become available.Of course  your miles will vary in the performance department depending on how far away from broadcasters you live. Folks like us who live just a few miles outside of town in the suburbs should have no problems pulling in clear signals. However  if you’re much further out - say in a rural area between two major metropolitan cities - you won’t have as much luck. If you’re in the latter camp you may need something even stronger  like an outdoor amplified antenna instead of this basic indoor unit.Should you buy the Antennas Direct Clearstream Flex?(Image credit: Antennas Direct)Buy it if...You’re not sure where TV broadcasters are in your areaWith the Antenna Point app it’s incredibly easy to see where broadcasters are in your area and how to best place your antenna to get the best reception.You need something in between something cheap and a top-end modelLook  not everyone needs the most powerful antenna - especially if you’re living close to a major metropolitan area. The Flex does a good job balancing price and performance  offering a middle-of-the-road HD antenna for folks who need one.Don't buy it if...You’re living far outside the city in a very rural areaWhile the 50-mile radius should work for suburban and semi-rural folks  anyone who’s really out in the middle of nowhere will need something stronger.You live in a major metropolitan areaThe counter-point there is that you also shouldn’t buy the Flex if you live too close to town  either.

Aside from the selloffs hitting Russian stocks and companies with strong links to Russia  broader contagion hasn't spread across markets.Despite surging commodity prices and volatility  ""comparing markets today with where they were before the invasion  investors might well let out a sigh of relief "" said Danni Hewson  a financial analyst at investment platform AJ Bell.This isn't to say some parts of the global system aren't showing signs of strain or aren't behaving unusually due to the war. A good example is the burgeoning political debate over the use of cryptocurrencies to evade restrictions  and efforts of Western countries  like Estonia  to clamp down.But more broadly  the big threat now facing the financial system is in the form of second-round effects  like eye-watering energy prices  and the economic fallout from the war. Soaring inflation and rising interest rates  in turn  could swiftly change sentiment toward particular markets that have benefited from investors’ search for yield for over a decade.With those risks in mind  the European Systemic Risk Board  the financial system’s watchdog  has warned the war's effect on the EU could be “much larger than currently expected” due to supply-chain disruptions and higher prices for households and firms.Here’s how the war's impacting financial players so far.BanksEU bank shares took a pummelling at the start of the war  especially among lenders with substantial operations or lending portfolios in Russia. But banks and their supervisors have repeatedly described the exposures as manageable — even in cases of a total write-down. For example  UniCredit  Société Générale and Raiffeisen  which all have notable links  have either sought to reassure their investors or signaled a retreat.""In practical terms  carving Russia out of European banking will be far easier than carving it out of European energy "" said Sam Theodore  a senior consultant affiliated with Scope Group.In a presentation to EU capitals earlier in March  the European Banking Authority said exposures to Russia and Ukraine stand at around €90 billion  or 0.3 percent of banks’ books. But it did point to a broader risk: The worsening economic outlook and higher rate of inflation are likely to hit banks by hurting some borrowers' ability to repay their loans.Plus  banks' work is still ongoing as they wade through their books to freeze any accounts or assets linked to sanctioned individuals or companies. The EU’s main banking associations this week sent a letter to the European Commission asking for more clarity on details like what counts as “control” of a company; when to freeze Russian deposits; and how to close repo transactions with the Russian central bank.InsurersInsurers  too  are largely walled off. The European insurance sector has an overall exposure to Russia of less than 0.1 percent of its total holdings  according to quarterly data from the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority. The direct effect of the war in Ukraine and economic sanctions on the health of European Economic Area insurers therefore “does not appear substantial ” the insurance regulator said. But second-round effects are still a risk.Insurers can generally be hit on two sides  either through their large investment portfolios or their underwriting. In the case of the latter  they may be on the hook for indirect losses as well. Lloyd’s of London  the world’s biggest insurance market  pointed to that risk last Thursday  when it said it expects the conflict in Ukraine to be a major claim in the market this year. That’s despite the fact that its underwriting in Russia and Ukraine only represents 1 percent of its global footprint.Insurers also have to brace for potential impact through exposures across aviation  marine  credit risk and political risk business lines. For example  airplane leasing companies are now fearing they may never get their planes back.Fund managersMeanwhile  fund managers with investments in Russia are stuck with “stranded assets.” Pension funds  hedge funds and other asset managers have in many cases marked Russian assets  ranging from stocks to commercial property  down to zero on their books. But due to lack of legal clarity on transacting these assets  they're in most cases refraining from attempting a sale.That move has led to some funds being shuttered to investor withdrawals — with at least 57 EU funds pulling up the drawbridge by the first week of March  according to the EU’s securities regulator.In a presentation to EU capitals in mid-March  the European Securities and Markets Authority said for the most part those closures came down to the difficulties valuing assets rather than investors’ demands for their cash. One suggestion  pitched by U.K. regulators  is that funds could use so-called side pockets to separate out affected assets and keep the rest of the fund running as normal.Russian bonds and equities have also been dropped from some investor indices  such as FTSE Russell and MSCI  due to the market being “uninvestable."" Plus  investors could be exposed to any default by the Russian state itself or its major companies.ClearinghousesThere's been more turmoil in spiralling energy and commodity prices. This spike has a knock-on impact in derivatives markets because banks have to stump up more cash for margin calls if the price moves against their position. This has in the past created a dash for cash in other markets. (Margin calls are when brokers ask investors to deposit more money or securities into their account  in a signal of market volatility.)In its presentation  ESMA described commodity derivatives as “bracing for impact ” including through short positions and margin calls. The London Metal Exchange was also forced to suspend trading in nickel  cancel trades and delay margin payments — due to a short squeeze. Price turmoil returned last Thursday  and LME is reportedly planning to double the size of its default fund starting in April.But this isn't cause for broader panic  according to the Bank of England. It noted last Thursday that while margin calls are at record highs  market participants have been able to meet the demand for additional funds  partly thanks to handsome profits they're making on intensified volatility and high pricing. Regulators continue to monitor trading closely  the Bank said.""The invasion has led to significant stress in a range of commodity markets "" the report said. ""A key uncertainty is whether interconnections within the financial system — for example between energy and other commodity markets  wider financial markets and the real economy — might create feedback loops and amplification mechanisms across the financial system more broadly.""Central securities depositoriesAnother major part of the financial system's plumbing is central securities depositories  which play a vital role ensuring securities trades settle — meaning one side delivers the bonds or stocks and the other pays up the cash. So when Russian restrictions kicked in  the two main EU players  Euroclear and Clearstream  were central in cutting off trades in rubles.As a result of sanctions  central securities depositories are likely to see their balance sheets swell  Fitch Ratings said  describing the fallout as manageable. Blocked coupon payments and redemptions will start accumulating in domestic accounts at Euroclear or Clearstream  or in their frozen accounts at the Russian National Settlement Depository (NSD)  depending on “the willingness or ability of Russian issuers” to credit foreign holders.Clearstream blocked the NSD's account last week  the Russian depository said Friday  while Euroclear isn't processing any payments received into NSD's account until there's more clarity from regulators. That could present another hurdle for Russia to pay its international debts and avoid default  as Moscow is now also demanding payments for gas in rubles.",neutral,0.02,0.6,0.38,negative,0.02,0.11,0.87,True,English,"['global financial markets', 'Russian sanctions', '5 ways', 'Société Générale', 'deputy national security adviser', 'political risk business lines', 'European Systemic Risk Board', 'The Moscow Stock Exchange', 'European Economic Area insurers', 'burgeoning political debate', 'rising interest rates', 'Occupational Pensions Authority', 'worsening economic outlook', 'main banking associations', 'marine, credit risk', 'European Banking Authority', 'other asset managers', 'European insurance sector', 'Russian central bank', 'EU bank shares', 'large investment portfolios', 'extensive Western sanctions', 'eye-watering energy prices', 'airplane leasing companies', 'biggest insurance market', 'global financial system', 'global financial markets', 'European energy', 'economic sanctions', 'The EU', 'global system', 'economic fallout', 'European Commission', 'global footprint', 'Russian sanctions', 'investment platform', 'Western countries', 'lending portfolios', 'broader risk', 'insurance regulator', 'financial analyst', 'financial players', 'commodity prices', 'higher prices', 'Fund managers', 'Russian troops', 'Russian deposits', 'Olga Maltseva/AFP', 'Getty Images', 'a month', 'U.S.', 'sustainable model', 'Daleep Singh', 'Biden administration', 'international economics', 'strong links', 'broader contagion', 'Danni Hewson', 'AJ Bell', 'big threat', 'second-round effects', 'particular markets', 'chain disruptions', 'substantial operations', 'total write-down', 'notable links', 'practical terms', 'Sam Theodore', 'senior consultant', 'Scope Group', 'EU capitals', 'higher rate', ""borrowers' ability"", 'repo transactions', 'overall exposure', 'total holdings', 'quarterly data', 'two sides', 'indirect losses', 'major claim', 'potential impact', 'Pension funds', 'hedge funds', 'commercial property', 'real market', 'Russian stocks', 'foreign investors', 'Soaring inflation', 'investors’ search', 'direct effect', 'many cases', 'Russian assets', 'legal clarity', ""banks' work"", 'good example', 'banks’ books', 'aftermath', 'Ukraine', 'reality', 'war', 'doors', 'restrictions', 'selling', 'charade', 'isolation', 'something', 'selloffs', 'volatility', 'invasion', 'sigh', 'relief', 'parts', 'signs', 'strain', 'use', 'cryptocurrencies', 'efforts', 'Estonia', 'turn', 'sentiment', 'yield', 'decade', 'risks', 'mind', 'watchdog', 'firms', 'pummelling', 'start', 'lenders', 'supervisors', 'exposures', 'UniCredit', 'Raiffeisen', 'retreat', 'presentation', 'March', '0.3 percent', 'loans', 'accounts', 'individuals', 'letter', 'details', 'control', 'company', 'less', '0.1 percent', 'health', 'underwriting', 'hook', 'Lloyd', 'London', 'world', 'conflict', 'fact', 'aviation', 'planes', 'investments', 'lack']",2022-03-28,2022-03-29,politico.eu

The British firm earlier launched ETPs tracking the value of Bitcoin Cash (BCH)  Ethereum (ETH)  Solana (SOL)  Cardano (ADA)  Polkadot (DOT)  and Litecoin (LTC).Following the development  Bradley Duke  founder and co-CEO of ETC Group  commented ADVERTISEMENT“Investors are increasingly interested in adding some of the newer  innovative cryptocurrencies to their portfolios – especially those amassing large market cap. The addition of these ETCs offers investors high quality  physically-backed digital assets  underpinned by our partnerships with liquidity providers to deliver liquidity and tight trading spreads.”ETPs Dominate in EuropeETPs are slowly becoming a very popular way for institutional investors in Europe to gain access to the cryptocurrency industry. Much of the interest has been fueled by the meteoric rise of Bitcoin in the past few years.The continued embrace from establishments such as Ruffer Investment Company or financial institutions like – JPMorgan  Goldman Sachs  UBS – which have purchased these investment vehicles for an increasing number of clients  has also driven the interest in crypto exposure. With growing demand  the types of ETPs being listed have also amplified.Earlier this month  ETC Group and HANetf unveiled Europe’s first metaverse ETF – ETC Group Global Metaverse UCITS ETF – under the ticker “METR.” It was listed on London Stock Exchange.More recently  asset manager Fidelity International announced the launch of two new Bitcoin ETPs on the Zurich-based SIX Swiss exchange. The head of ETFs at Fidelity  Nick King  stated that the products will enable its clients in Europe to obtain access to the cryptocurrency “in a secure and convenient way.”While ETFs have struggled to impress stringent regulatory compliances  ETPs  on the other hand  are dominating in Europe because their structure is often the only option that accommodates the guidelines.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.03,0.28,0.69,True,English,"['British Crypto Investment Firm', 'Polygon ETPs', 'Avalanche', 'Cosmos', 'ETC Group Global Metaverse UCITS ETF', 'ETC Group Physical Avalanche ETP', 'ETC Group Physical Cosmos ETP', 'ETC Group Physical Polygon ETP', 'Zurich-based SIX Swiss exchange', 'three crypto exchange-traded products', 'New Crypto Investment Vehicles', 'two new Bitcoin ETPs', 'first metaverse ETF', 'Crypto ETP issuer', 'three new products', 'white-label ETF issuer', 'London Stock Exchange', 'total expense ratios', 'newer, innovative cryptocurrencies', 'large market cap', 'backed digital assets', 'tight trading spreads', 'Ruffer Investment Company', 'stringent regulatory compliances', 'latest investment vehicles', 'ETF Stream', 'crypto exposure', 'crypto ETPs', 'Bitcoin Cash', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'latest addition', 'British firm', 'Bradley Duke', 'popular way', 'meteoric rise', 'continued embrace', 'financial institutions', 'Goldman Sachs', 'increasing number', 'growing demand', 'asset manager', 'Nick King', 'convenient way', 'other hand', 'liquidity providers', 'cryptocurrency industry', 'Fidelity International', 'institutional investors', 'launch', 'performance', 'report', 'ATME', 'MTCE', 'price', 'AVAX', 'ATOM', 'MATIC', 'HANetf', 'TERs', 'tally', 'value', 'BCH', 'Ethereum', 'Solana', 'Cardano', 'ADA', 'Polkadot', 'Litecoin', 'LTC', 'development', 'founder', 'CEO', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'portfolios', 'ETCs', 'partnerships', 'Europe', 'access', 'interest', 'past', 'years', 'establishments', 'JPMorgan', 'UBS', 'clients', 'types', 'ticker', 'METR', 'head', 'ETFs', 'secure', 'structure', 'option', 'guidelines']",2022-03-28,2022-03-29,cryptopotato.com

This would allow Chinese companies to tap into the Swiss capital market while ensuring the highest standards of investor protection.""Such announcements — [like] the ones of the various Chinese companies last week — are proof of the interest in SIX and [the] setup  and we will officially communicate together with the relevant Chinese exchange once the stock connect is ready "" Schneider said.He was referring to Sany Heavy Industry  Lepu Medical Technology (Beijing) and Gotion High-Tech  whose filings with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges disclosed plans to issue global depositary receipts (GDRs) on the Swiss exchange.These plans put the spotlight on the primary European bourse that sits alongside the London Stock Exchange and Germany's Deutsche Boerse.InternationalizationAmong the reasons for the planned issuance are an accelerated push for internationalization  the leverage of the capital market and improved corporate governance and shareholding structures  according to the filings.Both Sany and Gotion described the plan as a response to the domestic capital market's policy call as part of moves to deepen interconnections between the Chinese and European markets and leverage these to aid the real economy.A flurry of interest in the Swiss exchange  in the wake of an expansion of a stock trading link between local and overseas stock exchanges to include the German and Swiss bourses  indicates that China's capital market has continued to open its doors wider to the outside world and retained its support strategically for local businesses' IPOs beyond their home turf  Yang Delong  a member of the Chief Economist Committee of Securities Association of China  told Global Times.The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) unveiled in mid-February its revised rules stipulating that eligible businesses traded on the Shenzhen bourse would be included in the stock link  which was previously only made up of firms listed on the Shanghai and London exchanges.Exchanges in Switzerland and Germany also became part of that link  pursuant to the revised rules.The US has ramped up its regulatory toughening on Chinese shares in the past few years  but China remains unfazed with a continued open stance on overseas listings by local firms  Yang said.Since the US enacted the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act in 2020  China has maintained communications with US regulatory authorities and sought effective ways to resolve the issue  market observers said  stressing that the expanded stock linkup has increasingly been seen as a conduit for local firms to rev up their global expansion.Overseas listingsIn a fresh pledge of official support  the CSRC crystallized its push for the implementation of the new rules governing overseas listings as the securities regulator championed varied eligible firms' plans for IPOs on overseas exchanges  a commission post on Wednesday read.Nonetheless  such GDRs remain the last in line for domestic firms seeking an overseas listing  Hong Hao  managing director and head of research at Bocom International  told Global Times.Factoring in a scarcity of Chinese shares on European exchanges where investors are largely unfamiliar with Chinese options  local firms tend to put such GDRs on the back burner  Hong said  citing insufficient trading volumes as a frequent issue.So far  only four GDRs have been issued on the London exchange via the stock link between Shanghai and London since its launch in June 2019: that of Huatai Securities in June 2019  China Pacific Insurance in June 2020  China Yangtze Power in September 2020 and SDIC Power Holdings in October 2020.The stock linkup includes both eastbound and westbound trading  with the prior direction consisting of firms listed on foreign exchanges with offerings of Chinese depositary receipts (CDRs) in the mainland market.Mainland-listed firms  for their part  issue GDRs on foreign markets.Initially  GDR issuers are capable of fundraising in overseas markets while CDR issuers can only list these on the mainland and not raise capital.",neutral,0.06,0.83,0.11,negative,0.02,0.34,0.64,True,English,"['Swiss bourse listings',

Despite hindering meteorological conditions Envavis benefitted according to plan  particularly from capacity growth of 435 MW by newly connected wind- and solar parks as well as the strong increase of electricity prices in Q4/2021. The total capacity in the Company's own stock of around 2.0 gigawatts (GW) and the outstanding performance of the Asset Management Business are the foundation of continuously strong growth in revenue and earnings for the current fiscal year 2022.Encavis AG once again surpassed the revenue and operating earnings forecasts in 2021. Main driver of the revenue growth of EUR 40.1 million were again the solar parks with EUR 36.2 million and the Asset Management with EUR 3.4 million. The increased margin of operating earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) by 82% in the solar and 81% in the wind segment are an expression of cost-efficiency and economies of scale of the Group. Earnings growth in EBITDA of EUR 31.6 million to a total of EUR 256.4 million resulted in a growth rate of 14% analogous to the revenue growth at Group level.""The sustainable high availability of our parks as well as the consequent expansion of our portfolio have once again contributed to the accomplishment of our forecasted objectives despite rather subpar meteorological conditions in most parts of Europe in the past year. Due to our portfolio  spread over eleven different countries  we can counterbalance meteorological strengths and weaknesses of various electricity-price-areas and benefit from different market conditions "" Dr Christoph Husmann  CFO of Envcavis AG  underlined the reliability and stability of the several times confirmed guidance of the Group throughout the past year.The earnings from operating activities (EBIT) also grew by 13% to a total of EUR 149.1 million (previous year: EUR 132.2 million). The EBIT margin of around 45% is fully in line with plan and similar to the year before. Resulting in operating earnings per share (EPS) of 48 euro cents (previous year: 43 euro cents) despite an increase in the number of shares by 6.6 million amounting to an average number of shares throughout the year of roughly 144.4 million. Especially pleasant is the tremendous increase of EUR 39.0 million respectively 18% compared to last year to a total of EUR 251.9 million in operating cashflow which is considerably above plan and above guidance.The skyrocketed equity ratio of currently 33.2% compared to 26.6% the year before benefits from the new emission of the hybrid convertible bond with a nominal value of EUR 250 million at the end of November 2021 that has to be balanced as equity.The Management Board and Supervisory Board will propose again an increased dividend of EUR 0.30 per share (previous year EUR 0.28) to the Annual General Meeting. This will also be offered again as scrip dividend in shares or for cash distribution.

As a regulated RIE  ACX aims to offer its market participants and customers efficient trading and a regulated transparent price discovery mechanism.In addition  ACX aims to set up a regulated Recognised Clearing House (RCH) – which will be known as ACX Clearing Corporation - for the purposes of custodising  clearing and settling commodities and commodity derivatives.ACX intends to initially use its distributed ledger technology within a traditional commodity trading construct to create tokenised carbon credits for spot trading. At a later stage  ACX plans to offer carbon credit futures as commodity derivatives for trading. All digital tokens will be custodised by the RCH  settled and cleared using the RCH's blockchain smart contracts providing efficient settlement for all spot transactions.It is intended that the RCH  once established and operating within ADGM  will play a pivotal role in other markets and financial instruments  including virtual asset markets  adding vital market infrastructure to the digital trading ecosystem. ACX intends to extend its trading platform offering to include clean energy products  in addition to carbon credits.His Excellency Ahmed Jasim Al Zaabi  Chairman of ADGM  said : 'This is a significant global milestone and another world's first for Abu Dhabi. This initiative reinforces ADGM's commitment and ongoing efforts to cement its position as a leading international financial centre and world-class global commodities and carbon trading hub. We are excited to be partnering with ACX to enable and facilitate trading of high-quality carbon credits  and in that aspect  encourage more companies to reach their decarbonisation goals. As the first country in the Gulf to commit to net zero by 2050  this new trading platform is a further extension of Abu Dhabi's drive to support sustainability ambitions and underlines ADGM's focus on carbon neutrality as an international financial centre.'William Pazos  Managing Director and Co-Founder of ACX & Kevin Iwanaga  COO MENA Region  said: 'Abu Dhabi and by extension ADGM  are an integral part of ACX's global expansion. Our recent partnership with the Deutsche Börse Group  expansion into Brazil and our already well advanced full exchange and clearing application in ADGM complement each other to deliver a truly global marketplace from the heart of the MENA region. We are excited to work within a dynamic and forward thinking ecosystem such as ADGM.'Last year  ACX was recognised as the Best Carbon Exchange in Environmental Finance's prestigious Voluntary Carbon Market Rankings. In January  ACX partnered with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to promote carbon offsetting via UNFCCC Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) to allow clients representing 30 different countries to purchase and retire CERs for their carbon offsetting purposes. It will be the second exchange in the world  and the first in MENA  to list CERs held in the UNFCCC Clean Development Mechanism registry.ACX aligns with the UAE's goal to accelerate national economic development. Last year  the UAE became the first nation in the Middle East and North Africa to announce a plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Through the Net Zero by 2050 Strategic Initiative  the UAE aims to attract inflows from global capital markets as investors increasingly seek ESG-compliant investments.In January 2022  ADGM announced that it had achieved carbon-neutrality status by offsetting its carbon emissions in 2021  which underpins ADGM's commitment to building a progressive and more sustainable economy. It was the world's first international financial centre to become carbon neutral.About Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM)Abu Dhabi Global Market (ADGM)  an international financial centre (IFC) located in the capital city of the United Arab Emirates  opened for business on 21 October 2015.

Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS® platform  which uses a novel technology to encapsulate drug substances inside red blood cells  ERYTECH is developing a pipeline of product candidates for patients with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH’s primary focus is on the development of product candidates that target the altered metabolism of cancer cells by depriving them of amino acids necessary for their growth and survival.The Company’s lead product candidate  eryaspase  which consists of L-asparaginase encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells  targets the cancer cells’ altered asparagine and glutamine metabolism. The proof of concept of eryaspase as a cancer metabolism agent was established in different trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and pancreatic cancer. An investigator sponsored Phase 2 trial (IST) evaluating the use of eryaspase in ALL patients who developed hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase recently reported positive results  based on which the Company intends to request approval in the United States and potentially other territories. The Company is also pursuing a Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial in first-line pancreatic cancer.Story continuesEryaspase received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who have developed hypersensitivity reactions to E. coli-derived pegylated asparaginase. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency have granted eryaspase orphan drug status for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and ALL.ERYTECH produces its product candidates for treatment of patients in Europe at its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France  and for patients in the United States at its GMP manufacturing site in Princeton  New Jersey  USA. Eryaspase is not an approved medicine.ERYTECH is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States (ticker: ERYP) and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0011471135  ticker: ERYP).

The new Digital Assistant and Sales Advisor modules  already used by Linedata’s clients from London to Toronto  are now available for the Linedata Ekip360 solution and can also be deployed on further Lending & Leasing solutions.Khalid Dbich  Deputy CEO of SOFAC  a Moroccan company specializing in credit solutions  said: “Contrary to common belief  the financing offer with the best chance of success is not necessarily the one with the lowest monthly payment. It was important for us  at SOFAC  to master all the upstream information in order to provide the best advice  suggest the most suitable financing offers and  ultimately  remain competitive. Linedata’s Sales Advisor prescriptive analytics module provided a real answer to our needs. We immediately looked forward to participating in this promising project  which focuses on the concrete and tangible contributions of artificial intelligence to resolving business issues.”Digital Assistant  an AI-powered assistant to benefit from peer expertiseThe artificial intelligence that makes up Linedata’s Digital Assistant suggests actions to a case manager  based on the choices previously made by other users on the same type of case. The assistant thus generates the equivalent of a business workflow without requiring any complex configuration.Linedata’s Digital Assistant is particularly useful as:It avoids navigating across a number of submenus in order to select the appropriate option.It simplifies the takeover of an ongoing case by an employee who is not very familiar with it by immediately indicating its current status and the next actions to be taken.It acts as a virtual mentor to pass the essential know-how of more experienced colleagues to newcomers  who benefit from reliable suggestions for tasks to be performed.Digital Assistant is based on a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) recurrent neural network that takes into account the current screen and the sequence of actions that led to it in order to make the prediction. Digital Assistant exploits all the traceability data provided by the solution  makes them more reliable and enriches them with new concepts relating to accounting or financial processing.Sales Advisor  to guide financing advisorsLinedata’s Sales Advisor module aims to transform the user experience of financing advisors by guiding them towards the offer to be put forward based on the probability of the transaction being validated.In concrete terms  the tool performs analyses based on anonymized data about the buyer  the property to be financed or even the financing organization“In business intelligence  prescriptive analytics helps make decisions by identifying the best choices among the various options available and within known limits. We have chosen this approach and developed two modules to be integrated into our software offering. This will allow our clients to make more informed decisions while maintaining a high level of productivity and efficiency ” explained Alain Mattei  Head of Lending & Leasing at Linedata.Linedata designed Sales Advisor to help its clients optimize their business processes around three main use cases:Improving the close rate of sales proposals by determining the most appropriate funding schedulesHelping sell additional services (insurance  maintenance  etc.)Identifying loyal customers (future renewals) as early as possible in the setup processTo create the Sales Advisor module  Linedata’s experts deployed learning algorithms to calculate a relative probability of close between the different simulations offered to the client while taking into account the evolution of commercial policies over time. To achieve this  Linedata worked with a mixed team of data scientists and business experts who were able to collaborate on a fast-track implementation for SOFAC through a Datalab.ABOUT LINEDATAWith 20 years’ experience and 700+ clients in 50 countries  Linedata’s 1100 employees in 20 offices provide global humanized technology solutions and services for the asset management and credit industries that help its clients to evolve and to operate at the highest levels.Headquartered in France  Linedata achieved revenues of EUR 160.2 million in 2021 and is listed on Euronext Paris compartment B FR0004156297-LIN – Reuters LDSV.PA – Bloomberg LIN:FPlinedata.com,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.62,0.28,0.1,True,English,"['Prescriptive Analytics', 'Clients’ Decisions', 'Linedata', 'AI', 'Solutions', 'Long Short Term Memory) recurrent neural network', 'Sales Advisor prescriptive analytics module', 'three main use cases', 'global humanized technology solutions', 'two artificial intelligence modules', 'Sales Advisor module', 'lowest monthly payment', 'appropriate funding schedules', 'suitable financing offers', 'Euronext Paris compartment', 'new Digital Assistant', 'Linedata Ekip360 solution', 'two modules', 'global provider', 'credit technology', 'sales proposals', 'credit solutions', 'client cases', 'appropriate option', 'business intelligence', 'NEW YORK', 'new concepts', 'financing advisors', 'financing organization', 'Leasing solutions', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'asset management', 'Khalid Dbich', 'Deputy CEO', 'Moroccan company', 'common belief', 'best chance', 'upstream information', 'best advice', 'real answer', 'promising project', 'tangible contributions', 'business issues', 'AI-powered assistant', 'peer expertise', 'other users', 'same type', 'business workflow', 'complex configuration', 'current status', 'virtual mentor', 'essential know-how', 'experienced colleagues', 'reliable suggestions', 'current screen', 'financial processing', 'user experience', 'various options', 'known limits', 'software offering', 'high level', 'Alain Mattei', 'business processes', 'close rate', 'loyal customers', 'future renewals', 'setup process', 'learning algorithms', 'different simulations', 'commercial policies', 'mixed team', 'fast-track implementation', '20 years’ experience', 'credit industries', 'highest levels', 'Reuters LDSV', 'traceability data', 'anonymized data', 'data scientists', 'case manager', 'ongoing case', 'concrete terms', 'best choices', 'informed decisions', 'relative probability', 'business experts', 'next actions', 'additional services', 'Bloomberg LIN', 'ABOUT LINEDATA', '700+ clients', 'TORONTO', 'CASABLANCA', 'decision-making', 'productivity', 'follow-up', 'London', 'Lending', 'SOFAC', 'success', 'order', 'needs', 'equivalent', 'number', 'submenus', 'takeover', 'employee', 'newcomers', 'tasks', 'LSTM', 'account', 'sequence', 'prediction', 'transaction', 'tool', 'analyses', 'buyer', 'property', 'approach', 'efficiency', 'Head', 'insurance', 'maintenance', 'evolution', 'time', 'Datalab', '50 countries', '20 offices', 'France', 'revenues']",2022-03-29,2022-03-29,businesswire.com

During his past three terms in office  Constant has led the drive to build a highly robust capital position at a very low risk profile  and excellent financial results. As an all-round executive  he has also successfully engaged with many of our most important projects and functions outside his financial remit. While this is a good moment to welcome the new generation to succeed him  we will miss his tremendous experience and reliability as a board member.”Constant Korthout added: “Over the past 12 years  Van Lanschot Kempen has made a seminal transition from universal bank to specialist wealth manager. In the process  we’ve rolled out a successful capital strategy  resulting in solid dividends for our shareholders and scope for acquisitions. It has been a real pleasure to help achieve this vision over all these years  and it’s now time for the next phase in my working life. It fills me with pride that my successors come from within our very own organisation  and I wish them every success.”Constant Korthout’s third term as a member of the Management Board and CFRO will end at the close of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 May 2022. To facilitate a smooth transfer of his duties to his successors  the Supervisory Board intends to reappoint Constant Korthout until 1 September 2022.In a parallel track  Van Lanschot Kempen’s Supervisory Board has decided to split the position of CFRO into two separate positions as of 1 September 2022: Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO).Appointing Wendy Winkelhuijzen as CROThe Supervisory Board intends to appoint Wendy Winkelhuijzen as a member of the Management Board and as CRO  effective 1 September 2022. Having first joined Van Lanschot Kempen in 2001 as a corporate finance analyst  Wendy has held a range of positions within the organisation  including as a member of the Private and Business Banking management team  as a member of the team guiding Van Lanschot Kempen’s strategic review in 2013 and as Investor Relations Manager. She currently serves as Managing Director of Strategy & Corporate Development.Story continuesAppointing Jeroen Kroes to CFOThe Supervisory Board intends to appoint Jeroen Kroes as a member of the Management Board and as CFO  effective 1 September 2022. Jeroen has been with Van Lanschot Kempen for well over 25 years and he also joined as a corporate finance analyst. Since then  he has held various positions within the organisation: following a lengthy stretch at Corporate Finance  he was appointed project leader of the 2013 strategic review and then went on to take up his current post as Managing Director of Finance  Reporting & Control.Frans Blom commented: “The Supervisory Board is absolutely delighted with the appointments of Wendy Winkelhuijzen as Van Lanschot Kempen’s new CRO and Jeroen Kroes as its new CFO. Wendy has clear views which she’s able to put across very tactfully; she is analytical  disciplined  meticulous and effective in everything she does. Jeroen has a great sense of what’s going on in our business  is highly approachable and caring  and is a real team player. Having two such excellent candidates from within our own organisation  gives us great confidence in our future.”Wendy Winkelhuijzen said: “Over the past few years  we’ve worked really hard to further enhance our compliance and risk functions  and creating a separate CRO position fits into this really well. I expect to benefit from the experience that our acquisitions of the past few years have helped me to build – and the sheer amount of focus on compliance and risk management this involved. Together with my colleagues in the various departments  I’ll be dedicating myself to ensuring an excellent compliance environment and an optimum risk profile for Van Lanschot Kempen  and doing this very much in close cooperation with our businesses.”Jeroen Kroes said: “In the past decade  I’ve worked very closely with Constant and I’m very happy to step into his CFO shoes. It’s great to see how Van Lanschot Kempen affords us opportunities to do work that energises us  and to be given room to develop. I look forward to continuing our solid financial policies of the recent past  together with my colleagues on the Management Board.”Van Lanschot Kempen’s regulators have approved the appointments of both Wendy Winkelhuijzen and Jeroen Kroes  and the Works Council has likewise issued positive advice.The Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 May 2022 will be notified of these intended appointments and the reappointment.Media Relations: +31 20 354 45 85; mediarelations@vanlanschotkempen.comInvestor Relations: +31 20 354 45 90; investorrelations@vanlanschotkempen.comElements of this press release contain information about Van Lanschot Kempen NV within the meaning of Article 7(1) to (4) of EU Regulation No. 596/2014.About Van Lanschot KempenVan Lanschot Kempen  a wealth manager active in Private Banking  Investment Management and Investment Banking  with the aim of preserving and creating wealth  in a sustainable way  for both its clients and the society of which it is part.

(Nasdaq: IGMS) today announced the signing of an exclusive worldwide collaboration agreement to create  develop  manufacture  and commercialize IgM antibody agonists against three oncology targets and three immunology/inflammation targets. Engineered IgM antibodies represent a new class of potential therapeutics that combine the multi-valency of IgM antibodies possessing 10 binding sites compared to conventional IgG antibodies having only 2 target binding sites.John Reed  M.D.  Ph.D.Global Head of Research and Development  Sanofi“We look forward to this collaboration with IGM Biosciences  a pioneer in a new class of antibody medicines for the treatment of cancer  immunology  and inflammatory diseases. The IGM Biosciences technology platform offers an exciting approach to developing high-avidity IgM antibodies that can efficiently bind and stimulate the activity of cell surface receptors. This unique platform has the potential to overcome historical limitations of conventional IgG antibodies when seeking agonists of some classes of receptors.”Fred SchwarzerChief Executive Officer of IGM Biosciences“Sanofi is a global leader in the development and commercialization of innovative therapies  and we welcome the addition of their extensive expertise and resources in expanding and accelerating the development of our IgM antibody platform across multiple areas of high unmet need. This partnership builds on an existing research collaboration with Sanofi and is a key step towards our goal of unlocking the full breadth of potential for this important new class of therapeutics. We are pleased to share this vision with Sanofi and look forward to working together on these six potentially first- and best-in-class programs.”Story continuesTerms of the CollaborationUnder the terms of the agreement  IGM will receive a $ 150 million upfront payment. Sanofi has also expressed an interest in purchasing up to $100M of IGM non-voting common stock in a public financing.For each oncology target collaboration program  IGM will lead research and development activities  and assume related costs  through approval of the first biologics license application (BLA) for a product directed to that oncology target by the FDA or EMA in exchange for up to $940 million in development and regulatory milestones per oncology target. After receipt of the first marketing approval for a product directed to an oncology target  Sanofi will lead all subsequent development and commercialization activities for that oncology target. For each oncology target  the companies will share profits 50:50 in certain major markets  and IGM will be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales in the rest of world.For each immunology/inflammation target collaboration program  IGM will lead research and development activities  and assume related costs  through the completion of Phase 1 clinical trial for up to two constructs directed to each immunology/inflammation target  after which Sanofi will be responsible for all future development and related costs  in exchange for up to $1 065 million in aggregate development and regulatory and commercial milestones per immunology/inflammation target. Following the completion of Phase 1 clinical trial for each immunology/inflammation target  Sanofi will be responsible for subsequent development activities  commercialization efforts  and related costs. IGM is eligible to receive tiered high single-digit to low-teen royalties on global net sales.Closing of the collaboration is contingent on completion of review under antitrust laws  including the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S.  and customary closing conditions.About IGM Biosciences  Inc.Headquartered in Mountain View  California  IGM Biosciences is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on creating and developing engineered IgM antibodies.

We absolutely had to get those stories out ” said Jean-Guilhem Lamberti  Chief Creative Officer  Accor. “Images of stylish waiters with silver platters  delivering refreshments on bicycles and serving on frozen lakes; treating bear cubs as guests; celebrities in residence.

WisdomTree announced the launch of the three ETPs including WisdomTree Solana  WisdomTree Cardano  and WisdomTree Polkadot. The ETPs are listed on major EU digital exchanges like Deutsche Boerse’s Xetra  the Swiss SIX Exchange as well as the Swiss Stock Exchange. The Euronext exchange is expected to list the ETPs in Paris and Amsterdam as well.The ETPs are designed to offer investors in the EU another option and gain exposure to the price of Solana  Polkadot  and Cardano via regulated exchanges. The three products have a total expense ratio of 0.95% and are available for sale in Belgium  Denmark  Austria  Finland  France  Italy  Germany  Luxembourg  Ireland  Netherlands  Poland  Spain  Norway  Sweden  and Switzerland. The new ETPs follow the growing crypto asset products offered by WisdomTree in Europe and joined products like Wisdomtree Crypto Mega Cap Equal weight which is backed by physical assets like ETH and BTC.ADVERTISEMENTWisdomTree’s head of Europe Alexis Marinof said that the new offerings will meet the growing demand from institutional investors that want to diversify their portfolios:“While bitcoin and Ethereum grab the headlines  altcoins are now viable options for many institutional investors  providing more options to diversify their crypto holdings just like they would with any other asset class.”As previously reported  WisdomTree was launching ETPs in Europe amid the regulatory issues in the US  and in late 2021  the US SEC rejected WisdomTree’s spot BTC ETF after delaying a decision on the product a few times. The company amended the spot BTC ETF filing and named the US Bank as a custodian for the BTC trust.Also  The US SEC extended its window to approve or disapprove spot BTC exchange-traded fund applications from the asset managers One River and WisdomTree. According to the seaprate filings  the SEC extends the windows for decision for allowing shares of WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust and One River Carbon Neutral Bitcoin Trust to be listed on the cBOE BZX Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange Arca.ADVERTISEMENT,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.01,0.06,0.93,True,English,"['ETF Provider', 'Polkadot ETPs', 'WisdomTree', 'Cardano', 'Solana', 'Wisdomtree Crypto Mega Cap Equal weight', 'One River Carbon Neutral Bitcoin Trust', 'spot BTC exchange-traded fund applications', 'New York Stock Exchange Arca', 'three new crypto exchange-traded products', 'The American ETF provider', 'major EU digital exchanges', 'spot BTC ETF filing', 'growing crypto asset products', 'The ETF Provider WisdomTree', 'Swiss Stock Exchange', 'Swiss SIX Exchange', 'cBOE BZX Exchange', 'The Euronext exchange', 'latest cryptocurrency news', 'total expense ratio', 'other asset class', 'WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust', 'multiple crypto ETPs', 'many institutional investors', 'The US SEC', 'BTC trust', 'crypto products', 'three products', 'crypto holdings', 'new offerings', 'new ETPs', 'regulated exchanges', 'growing demand', 'asset managers', 'three ETPs', 'The ETPs', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'physical assets', 'Alexis Marinof', 'regulatory issues', 'seaprate filings', 'US Bank', 'viable options', 'WisdomTree Solana', 'WisdomTree Cardano', 'WisdomTree Polkadot', 'Europe', 'today', 'launch', 'Xetra', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'exposure', 'price', 'sale', 'Belgium', 'Denmark', 'Austria', 'Finland', 'France', 'Italy', 'Germany', 'Luxembourg', 'Ireland', 'Netherlands', 'Poland', 'Spain', 'Norway', 'Sweden', 'Switzerland', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'head', 'portfolios', 'Ethereum', 'altcoins', 'decision', 'company', 'custodian', 'window', 'shares']",2022-03-29,2022-03-29,dcforecasts.com

While altcoin linked ETPs are flourishing in Europe the US securities and exchange commission are still resisting calls for a bitcoin spot investment product.“In Europe  we’ve always been further ahead. The first exchange traded bitcoin product was launched in Sweden in 2015 ” commented Diana Biggs  chief strategy officer at the parent company of Valour  an issuer of exchange traded products in Europe.“We have regulators  institutions  market  and investors who have had a long time to get comfortable with these types of products… I think it’s really surprised everyone that in the US  we still haven’t seen this type of product come out ” she continued.A welcoming regulatory environment in Europe has allowed firms to experiment with ETPS linked to alt coins.“While bitcoin and Ethereum grab the headlines  altcoins are now viable options for many institutional investors  providing more options to diversify their crypto holdings just like they would with any other asset class ” commented Alexis Marinof  the head of Europe at Wisdomtree.Just last week FTX and CoinShares last week announced plans to launch “the first” Solana ETP that returns a portion of staking rewards to investors.Read more: Ether futures set for Chicago Mercantile Exchange launch today,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,negative,0.22,0.35,0.44,True,English,"['Polkadot ETPs', 'Wisdomtree', 'Cardano', 'Solana', 'Europe', 'Chicago Mercantile Exchange launch', 'bitcoin spot investment product', 'chief strategy officer', 'other asset class', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'Swiss stock exchange', 'welcoming regulatory environment', 'European crypto market', 'first” Solana ETP', 'many institutional investors', 'first exchange', 'bitcoin product', 'Investment firm', 'investment vehicles', 'exchange commission', 'crypto currencies', 'crypto holdings', 'total view', 'trading floor', 'Ralph Orlowski', 'Getty Images', 'Borse Xetra', 'Euronext exchanges', 'digital assets', 'key component', 'Jason Guthrie', 'welcoming approach', 'Diana Biggs', 'parent company', 'long time', 'alt coins', 'Alexis Marinof', 'Ether futures', 'Crypto ETPs', 'underlying price', 'viable options', 'traded products', 'US securities', 'Polkadot ETPs', 'Wisdomtree ETPs', 'Wisdomtree Europe', 'Cardano', 'Photo', 'swathe', 'sign', 'ADA', 'SIX', 'plans', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'customers', 'exposure', 'strategies', 'head', 'regulators', 'counterparts', 'altcoin', 'calls', 'Sweden', 'Valour', 'issuer', 'institutions', 'types', 'everyone', 'firms', 'Ethereum', 'FTX', 'CoinShares', 'portion', 'rewards']",2022-03-29,2022-03-29,cityam.com

It was important for us  at SOFAC  to master all the upstream information in order to provide the best advice  suggest the most suitable financing offers and  ultimately  remain competitive. Linedata’s Sales Advisor prescriptive analytics module provided a real answer to our needs. We immediately looked forward to participating in this promising project  which focuses on the concrete and tangible contributions of artificial intelligence to resolving business issues.”Digital Assistant  an AI-powered assistant to benefit from peer expertiseThe artificial intelligence that makes up Linedata’s Digital Assistant suggests actions to a case manager  based on the choices previously made by other users on the same type of case. The assistant thus generates the equivalent of a business workflow without requiring any complex configuration.Linedata’s Digital Assistant is particularly useful as:It avoids navigating across a number of submenus in order to select the appropriate option.It simplifies the takeover of an ongoing case by an employee who is not very familiar with it by immediately indicating its current status and the next actions to be taken.It acts as a virtual mentor to pass the essential know-how of more experienced colleagues to newcomers  who benefit from reliable suggestions for tasks to be performed.Digital Assistant is based on a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) recurrent neural network that takes into account the current screen and the sequence of actions that led to it in order to make the prediction. Digital Assistant exploits all the traceability data provided by the solution  makes them more reliable and enriches them with new concepts relating to accounting or financial processing.Sales Advisor  to guide financing advisorsLinedata’s Sales Advisor module aims to transform the user experience of financing advisors by guiding them towards the offer to be put forward based on the probability of the transaction being validated.In concrete terms  the tool performs analyses based on anonymized data about the buyer  the property to be financed or even the financing organization“In business intelligence  prescriptive analytics helps make decisions by identifying the best choices among the various options available and within known limits. We have chosen this approach and developed two modules to be integrated into our software offering. This will allow our clients to make more informed decisions while maintaining a high level of productivity and efficiency ” explained Alain Mattei  Head of Lending & Leasing at Linedata.Linedata designed Sales Advisor to help its clients optimize their business processes around three main use cases:Improving the close rate of sales proposals by determining the most appropriate funding schedulesHelping sell additional services (insurance  maintenance  etc.)Identifying loyal customers (future renewals) as early as possible in the setup processTo create the Sales Advisor module  Linedata’s experts deployed learning algorithms to calculate a relative probability of close between the different simulations offered to the client while taking into account the evolution of commercial policies over time. To achieve this  Linedata worked with a mixed team of data scientists and business experts who were able to collaborate on a fast-track implementation for SOFAC through a Datalab.ABOUT LINEDATAWith 20 years’ experience and 700+ clients in 50 countries  Linedata’s 1100 employees in 20 offices provide global humanized technology solutions and services for the asset management and credit industries that help its clients to evolve and to operate at the highest levels.Headquartered in France  Linedata achieved revenues of EUR 160.2 million in 2021 and is listed on Euronext Paris compartment B FR0004156297-LIN – Reuters LDSV.PA – Bloomberg LIN:FPlinedata.comView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220328005728/en/Press ContactsLinedataAurélia Szymanski+33 6 63 72 94 14Aurelia.Szymanski@se.linedata.comOPRG France for LinedataInès Marotte: +33 89 84 40 32Florence Devillers: +33 6 29 76 07 62France.Linedata@omnicomprgroup.com© Business Wire  Inc.Disclaimer:This material is not an AFP editorial material  and AFP shall not bear responsibility for the accuracy of its content.

A period of contingency was factored into the audit plan  but  combined with the increased first-year audit work for the acquisitions made during 2021  additional time is required to complete the work.Subsequently  the publication of the annual report will be delayed and will be published on or before Friday 22 April 2022.Quarter 1 trading updateThe trading update for the 3 months ending 31 March 2022 will now be published before market opening on Tuesday 3 May 2022.Annual General MeetingThe Company intends to publish a much more detailed annual report to explain the breadth of the business  including recent acquisitions.
