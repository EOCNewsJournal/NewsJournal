Through a share-based incentive programme  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's earnings and value growth and creates long-term incentives for the programme participants. In light of the above  the Board of Directors believes that the implementation of Share Programme 2022/2025 may have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and  consequently  that Share Programme 2022/2025 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Participants in Share Programme 2022/2025 and allocationShare Programme 2022/2025 is proposed to include a maximum of approximately 2 000 senior executives and key employees within the Hexagon Group  who are divided into four groups: the President and CEO and group management (""Group 1"")  division managers (""Group 2"") and other senior executives and key employees (""Group 3"" and ""Group 4""). Invitation to participate in the programme shall be provided by Hexagon no later than 30 June 2022. Participation in Share Programme 2022/2025 requires that the participant has been employed by the Hexagon Group for at least twelve (12) months prior to the date of the offer.Participants are offered to be allocated performance awards that may entitle to Series B shares according to the conditions set out below. The performance awards shall be based on a maximum value for each participant category. The maximum value for the participants in Group 1 will be 50 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022  for participants in Group 2 and Group 3  100 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022  and for participants in Group 4  35 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022. The total sum of the maximum values of the performance awards thus defined for all participants will not exceed EUR 60 million  including social costs.The share price used to calculate the number of shares to which the performance awards entitles will be the volume-weighted average of the market price of Hexagon Series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of five (5) trading days before the day the participants are offered to participate in the programme.Performance conditionAllocated performance awards entitle to the receipt of Series B shares in the company provided that the performance condition related to the development of Hexagon's earnings per share[1] compared to the target level set by the Board of Directors during the measurement period 1 January 2022 until 31 December 2025 are fulfilled  where the last financial year during the measurement period is compared with the financial year preceding the measurement period  with reservation for any reduction in the number of shares in accordance with the terms of Share Programme 2022/2025. The Board of Directors intends to present the fulfillment of the performance-based condition in the annual report for the financial year 2025.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.– Performance awards shall be granted free of charge after the Annual General Meeting.– Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share in the company free of charge approximately four (4) years after allotment of the award (vesting period)  provided that the above performance condition has been met and that the holder  at the time of the release of the interim report for the first quarter 2026 still is employed by the Hexagon Group. Exemptions to the requirement of employment may be granted in specific cases  including a participant's disability or retirement.– The Board of Directors shall have the opportunity to make adjustments as a result of extraordinary events such as bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events.– The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.– The performance awards can be granted by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board of Directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions and administration of Share Programme 2022/2025  in accordance with the above mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments  including for example a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares  if significant changes in the Hexagon Group  or its operational environment  would  as assessed by the Board of Directors  result in a situation where the established terms and conditions for Share Programme 2022/2025 no longer are appropriate or reasonable.In the event that the Board of Directors considers that the delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025 cannot be achieved at a reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make appropriate local adjustments to the programme or instead offer participants a cash settlement.Scope and costs of the programmeProvided that the share price for the company's Series B share at the time of allotment of performance awards under Share Programme 2022/2025 is SEK 133.45  Share Programme 2022/2025 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 4 260 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.2 per cent of the total outstanding shares in the company.Provided that the performance condition is fully met  the total costs for Share Programme 2022/2025  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  is estimated to a maximum of approximately EUR 60 million  allocated over the vesting period. Estimated social costs and administration costs for the programme are included in the amount.In the event that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 would exceed EUR 60 million  the total number of allocated Series B shares in Hexagon will be reduced so that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 will not exceed this amount. Such reduction will be made pro rata in relation to the highest value for each participant category in accordance with the above.Delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under Share Programme 2022/2025  the company intends to enter into an agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  under which the third party shall  in its own name  acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to the participants in accordance with Share Programme 2022/2025.Preparation of the proposalShare Programme 2022/2025 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Hexagon and has been structured in consultation with external advisers. Share Programme 2022/2025 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings with the Board of Directors. Ola Rollén  President and CEO and board member  who may participate in the proposed Share Programme 2022/2025  has not participated in the preparation of the matter.Previous incentive programmes in HexagonFor a description of Hexagon's other incentive programmes  Share Programme 2020/2023 and Share Programme 2021/2024  please see the company's Annual Report 2021  note 30  and the company's website www.hexagon.com. In addition to the programmes described therein  there are no other long term incentive programmes in Hexagon.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors on acquisition and transfer of own shares (item 14)Hexagon has previously  on the basis of authorization by the General Meeting  acquired own Series B shares for the purpose of using repurchased shares to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure  to finance potential company acquisitions  and as a hedge for the company's share-based incentive programmes. As of 1 January 2022  the company held 9 350 000 own Series B shares  corresponding to approximately 0.3 per cent of the total number of shares in the company. The Board of Directors makes the assessment that it remains advantageous for the company to continue to be able to use repurchased shares in order to adjust the company's capital structure  on account of potential company acquisitions and for the company's share-based incentive programmes.In view of the above  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to pass a resolution  on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  on acquisition and transfer of Series B shares in the company. Acquisition of shares may be made at a maximum of so many Series B shares that the company's holding does not exceed ten (10) per cent of all shares in the company at that time. Acquisitions of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer of Series B shares may be made at a maximum of ten (10) per cent of the total number of shares in the company. A transfer may be made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights on Nasdaq Stockholm as well as to third parties in connection with acquisition of a company or a business. Compensation for transferred shares can be paid in cash  through an issue in kind or a set-off. Transfers of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer in connection with acquisitions may be made at a market value assessed by the Board of Directors.The purpose of the authorizations is (i) to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value  (ii) to enable acquisition opportunities by financing acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (iii) to ensure the company's undertakings  due to share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants in incentive programs)  including social security costs.The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors to issue shares  convertibles and/or warrants (item 15)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors during the period up until the next annual general meeting to  on one or more occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  andwith or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions  resolve to issue Series B shares  convertibles and/or warrants (with rights to subscribe for or convert into Series B shares). By resolutions in accordance with the authorization  the number of shares may be increased by a number corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) percent of the number of outstanding shares in the company at the time when the Board of Directors first uses the authorization.The purpose of the authorization and the reasons for a potential deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights as set out above  is to ensure financing of acquisitions of companies  part of companies or businesses or to strengthen the company's capital base and equity/assets ratio. Such issues may not require amendment of the Articles of Association applicable from time to time. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues by virtue of the authorisation shall be made on market conditions. In accordance with the conditions set out above  the Board of Directors shall also be authorized to resolve on other terms as considered necessary by the Board of Directors to carry out the issues.The Board of Directors further proposes that the Managing Director  or anyone appointed by the Managing Director  shall have the right to make any adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw: Bolagsverket).The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.E.

One of …,From its advent  the breakthrough of cryptocurrency that has aided its adoption is the decentralized characteristic. This removes the control of crypto activities from the influence of third parties  unlike what is obtainable in the centralized space.One of the recent measures that enforce decentralization is digital ledger technology. It involves using technological protocols that maintain the security of the decentralized digital database.Though the networks are distributed  there are always simultaneous validation  accessibility  and information updating. Also  besides eliminating cybercrime with this technology  it’s more effective  cheaper  and provides faster transaction processes.Related Reading | PUBG Developer Krafton Joins Forces With Solana For Blockchain And NFT GamesEuroclear  on Monday  has announced its investment into Fnality though the investment amount remains undisclosed.Also  Euroclear aims to develop personal distributed technology (DLT) through collaboration. This move will ensure its settlement of digital securities over digital cash. It is worthy to note that the securities clearing company claims that its assets under custody are more than 37.6 trillion euros.The Functionality Of Fnality InternationalFnality is a consortium of financial institutions that tilts towards adopting regulated tokenized assets and their marketplaces. It was established in 2019 and operates by increasing the efficiency and speed of post-trade operations in locations like market issuance  interest payment servicing  and collateral trading.Furthermore  Fnality International stated its aim of improving central banks’ efficiency in payment settlements. Some of its prominent shareholders are CIBC  Barclays  ING  UBS  Credit Suissue  and Mizuho Bank Nasdaq.Concerning the investment from Euroclear  Rhomaios Ram  the CEO of Fnality International  stated that having Euroclear as part of their consortium is a welcoming path for the company’s diversification. Also  he mentioned that it would help the firm’s expansion and its Financial Market Infrastructure.On its part  Euroclear Group CEO  Lieve Mostrey  said that his group is excited about the partnership with Fnality. This move is in synchronization with their clients in creating a pathway for both digital cash and digital securities settlement that will be profitable for the entire industry.Before now  Euroclear had partnered with Banque de France  the apex bank of France  as the leading team.

If there are only marginal changes in the number of votes held or if the change occurs later than three months prior to the annual general meeting  no changes shall be made in the composition of the Nomination Committee unless there are special circumstances. If a member resigns from the Nomination Committee before the work is completed and the Nomination Committee finds it suitable  a substitute shall be appointed. Such substitute shall be appointed from the same shareholder or  if that shareholder no longer is among the largest shareholders in terms of voting rights  from the largest shareholder next in line.

Through a share-based incentive programme  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's earnings and value growth and creates long-term incentives for the programme participants. In light of the above  the Board of Directors believes that the implementation of Share Programme 2022/2025 may have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and  consequently  that Share Programme 2022/2025 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Participants in Share Programme 2022/2025 and allocationShare Programme 2022/2025 is proposed to include a maximum of approximately 2 000 senior executives and key employees within the Hexagon Group  who are divided into four groups: the President and CEO and group management (""Group 1"")  division managers (""Group 2"") and other senior executives and key employees (""Group 3"" and ""Group 4""). Invitation to participate in the programme shall be provided by Hexagon no later than 30 June 2022. Participation in Share Programme 2022/2025 requires that the participant has been employed by the Hexagon Group for at least twelve (12) months prior to the date of the offer.Participants are offered to be allocated performance awards that may entitle to Series B shares according to the conditions set out below. The performance awards shall be based on a maximum value for each participant category. The maximum value for the participants in Group 1 will be 50 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022  for participants in Group 2 and Group 3  100 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022  and for participants in Group 4  35 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022. The total sum of the maximum values of the performance awards thus defined for all participants will not exceed EUR 60 million  including social costs.The share price used to calculate the number of shares to which the performance awards entitles will be the volume-weighted average of the market price of Hexagon Series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of five (5) trading days before the day the participants are offered to participate in the programme.Performance conditionAllocated performance awards entitle to the receipt of Series B shares in the company provided that the performance condition related to the development of Hexagon's earnings per share[1] compared to the target level set by the Board of Directors during the measurement period 1 January 2022 until 31 December 2025 are fulfilled  where the last financial year during the measurement period is compared with the financial year preceding the measurement period  with reservation for any reduction in the number of shares in accordance with the terms of Share Programme 2022/2025. The Board of Directors intends to present the fulfillment of the performance-based condition in the annual report for the financial year 2025.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.– Performance awards shall be granted free of charge after the Annual General Meeting.– Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share in the company free of charge approximately four (4) years after allotment of the award (vesting period)  provided that the above performance condition has been met and that the holder  at the time of the release of the interim report for the first quarter 2026 still is employed by the Hexagon Group. Exemptions to the requirement of employment may be granted in specific cases  including a participant's disability or retirement.– The Board of Directors shall have the opportunity to make adjustments as a result of extraordinary events such as bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events.– The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.– The performance awards can be granted by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board of Directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions and administration of Share Programme 2022/2025  in accordance with the above mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments  including for example a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares  if significant changes in the Hexagon Group  or its operational environment  would  as assessed by the Board of Directors  result in a situation where the established terms and conditions for Share Programme 2022/2025 no longer are appropriate or reasonable.In the event that the Board of Directors considers that the delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025 cannot be achieved at a reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make appropriate local adjustments to the programme or instead offer participants a cash settlement.Scope and costs of the programmeProvided that the share price for the company's Series B share at the time of allotment of performance awards under Share Programme 2022/2025 is SEK 133.45  Share Programme 2022/2025 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 4 260 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.2 per cent of the total outstanding shares in the company.Provided that the performance condition is fully met  the total costs for Share Programme 2022/2025  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  is estimated to a maximum of approximately EUR 60 million  allocated over the vesting period. Estimated social costs and administration costs for the programme are included in the amount.In the event that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 would exceed EUR 60 million  the total number of allocated Series B shares in Hexagon will be reduced so that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 will not exceed this amount. Such reduction will be made pro rata in relation to the highest value for each participant category in accordance with the above.Delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under Share Programme 2022/2025  the company intends to enter into an agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  under which the third party shall  in its own name  acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to the participants in accordance with Share Programme 2022/2025.Preparation of the proposalShare Programme 2022/2025 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Hexagon and has been structured in consultation with external advisers. Share Programme 2022/2025 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings with the Board of Directors. Ola Rollén  President and CEO and board member  who may participate in the proposed Share Programme 2022/2025  has not participated in the preparation of the matter.Previous incentive programmes in HexagonFor a description of Hexagon's other incentive programmes  Share Programme 2020/2023 and Share Programme 2021/2024  please see the company's Annual Report 2021  note 30  and the company's website www.hexagon.com. In addition to the programmes described therein  there are no other long term incentive programmes in Hexagon.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors on acquisition and transfer of own shares (item 14)Hexagon has previously  on the basis of authorization by the General Meeting  acquired own Series B shares for the purpose of using repurchased shares to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure  to finance potential company acquisitions  and as a hedge for the company's share-based incentive programmes. As of 1 January 2022  the company held 9 350 000 own Series B shares  corresponding to approximately 0.3 per cent of the total number of shares in the company. The Board of Directors makes the assessment that it remains advantageous for the company to continue to be able to use repurchased shares in order to adjust the company's capital structure  on account of potential company acquisitions and for the company's share-based incentive programmes.In view of the above  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to pass a resolution  on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  on acquisition and transfer of Series B shares in the company. Acquisition of shares may be made at a maximum of so many Series B shares that the company's holding does not exceed ten (10) per cent of all shares in the company at that time. Acquisitions of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer of Series B shares may be made at a maximum of ten (10) per cent of the total number of shares in the company. A transfer may be made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights on Nasdaq Stockholm as well as to third parties in connection with acquisition of a company or a business. Compensation for transferred shares can be paid in cash  through an issue in kind or a set-off. Transfers of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer in connection with acquisitions may be made at a market value assessed by the Board of Directors.The purpose of the authorizations is (i) to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value  (ii) to enable acquisition opportunities by financing acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (iii) to ensure the company's undertakings  due to share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants in incentive programs)  including social security costs.The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors to issue shares  convertibles and/or warrants (item 15)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors during the period up until the next annual general meeting to  on one or more occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  andwith or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions  resolve to issue Series B shares  convertibles and/or warrants (with rights to subscribe for or convert into Series B shares). By resolutions in accordance with the authorization  the number of shares may be increased by a number corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) percent of the number of outstanding shares in the company at the time when the Board of Directors first uses the authorization.The purpose of the authorization and the reasons for a potential deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights as set out above  is to ensure financing of acquisitions of companies  part of companies or businesses or to strengthen the company's capital base and equity/assets ratio. Such issues may not require amendment of the Articles of Association applicable from time to time. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues by virtue of the authorisation shall be made on market conditions. In accordance with the conditions set out above  the Board of Directors shall also be authorized to resolve on other terms as considered necessary by the Board of Directors to carry out the issues.The Board of Directors further proposes that the Managing Director  or anyone appointed by the Managing Director  shall have the right to make any adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw: Bolagsverket).The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.E.

Through a share-based incentive programme  the employees' remuneration is tied to the company's earnings and value growth and creates long-term incentives for the programme participants. In light of the above  the Board of Directors believes that the implementation of Share Programme 2022/2025 may have a positive effect on the long-term value growth of the Group and  consequently  that Share Programme 2022/2025 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Participants in Share Programme 2022/2025 and allocationShare Programme 2022/2025 is proposed to include a maximum of approximately 2 000 senior executives and key employees within the Hexagon Group  who are divided into four groups: the President and CEO and group management (""Group 1"")  division managers (""Group 2"") and other senior executives and key employees (""Group 3"" and ""Group 4""). Invitation to participate in the programme shall be provided by Hexagon no later than 30 June 2022. Participation in Share Programme 2022/2025 requires that the participant has been employed by the Hexagon Group for at least twelve (12) months prior to the date of the offer.Participants are offered to be allocated performance awards that may entitle to Series B shares according to the conditions set out below. The performance awards shall be based on a maximum value for each participant category. The maximum value for the participants in Group 1 will be 50 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022  for participants in Group 2 and Group 3  100 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022  and for participants in Group 4  35 per cent of the participant's annual base salary for 2022. The total sum of the maximum values of the performance awards thus defined for all participants will not exceed EUR 60 million  including social costs.The share price used to calculate the number of shares to which the performance awards entitles will be the volume-weighted average of the market price of Hexagon Series B shares on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of five (5) trading days before the day the participants are offered to participate in the programme.Performance conditionAllocated performance awards entitle to the receipt of Series B shares in the company provided that the performance condition related to the development of Hexagon's earnings per share[1] compared to the target level set by the Board of Directors during the measurement period 1 January 2022 until 31 December 2025 are fulfilled  where the last financial year during the measurement period is compared with the financial year preceding the measurement period  with reservation for any reduction in the number of shares in accordance with the terms of Share Programme 2022/2025. The Board of Directors intends to present the fulfillment of the performance-based condition in the annual report for the financial year 2025.Other conditionsIn addition to the above conditions  the following shall apply for the performance awards.– Performance awards shall be granted free of charge after the Annual General Meeting.– Each performance award entitles the holder to receive one Series B share in the company free of charge approximately four (4) years after allotment of the award (vesting period)  provided that the above performance condition has been met and that the holder  at the time of the release of the interim report for the first quarter 2026 still is employed by the Hexagon Group. Exemptions to the requirement of employment may be granted in specific cases  including a participant's disability or retirement.– The Board of Directors shall have the opportunity to make adjustments as a result of extraordinary events such as bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events.– The performance awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.– The performance awards can be granted by the company or any other company within the Group.Preparation and administrationThe Board of Directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions and administration of Share Programme 2022/2025  in accordance with the above mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments  including for example a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of shares  if significant changes in the Hexagon Group  or its operational environment  would  as assessed by the Board of Directors  result in a situation where the established terms and conditions for Share Programme 2022/2025 no longer are appropriate or reasonable.In the event that the Board of Directors considers that the delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025 cannot be achieved at a reasonable cost  with reasonable administrative efforts or due to specific market conditions  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make appropriate local adjustments to the programme or instead offer participants a cash settlement.Scope and costs of the programmeProvided that the share price for the company's Series B share at the time of allotment of performance awards under Share Programme 2022/2025 is SEK 133.45  Share Programme 2022/2025 will  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  comprise maximum 4 260 000 Series B shares in total  which corresponds to approximately 0.2 per cent of the total outstanding shares in the company.Provided that the performance condition is fully met  the total costs for Share Programme 2022/2025  in accordance with the principles and assumptions set out above  is estimated to a maximum of approximately EUR 60 million  allocated over the vesting period. Estimated social costs and administration costs for the programme are included in the amount.In the event that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 would exceed EUR 60 million  the total number of allocated Series B shares in Hexagon will be reduced so that the total costs of Share Programme 2022/2025 will not exceed this amount. Such reduction will be made pro rata in relation to the highest value for each participant category in accordance with the above.Delivery of shares under Share Programme 2022/2025To ensure the delivery of Series B shares under Share Programme 2022/2025  the company intends to enter into an agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  under which the third party shall  in its own name  acquire and transfer Series B shares in the company to the participants in accordance with Share Programme 2022/2025.Preparation of the proposalShare Programme 2022/2025 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Hexagon and has been structured in consultation with external advisers. Share Programme 2022/2025 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings with the Board of Directors. Ola Rollén  President and CEO and board member  who may participate in the proposed Share Programme 2022/2025  has not participated in the preparation of the matter.Previous incentive programmes in HexagonFor a description of Hexagon's other incentive programmes  Share Programme 2020/2023 and Share Programme 2021/2024  please see the company's Annual Report 2021  note 30  and the company's website www.hexagon.com. In addition to the programmes described therein  there are no other long term incentive programmes in Hexagon.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors on acquisition and transfer of own shares (item 14)Hexagon has previously  on the basis of authorization by the General Meeting  acquired own Series B shares for the purpose of using repurchased shares to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure  to finance potential company acquisitions  and as a hedge for the company's share-based incentive programmes. As of 1 January 2022  the company held 9 350 000 own Series B shares  corresponding to approximately 0.3 per cent of the total number of shares in the company. The Board of Directors makes the assessment that it remains advantageous for the company to continue to be able to use repurchased shares in order to adjust the company's capital structure  on account of potential company acquisitions and for the company's share-based incentive programmes.In view of the above  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to pass a resolution  on one or more occasions for the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  on acquisition and transfer of Series B shares in the company. Acquisition of shares may be made at a maximum of so many Series B shares that the company's holding does not exceed ten (10) per cent of all shares in the company at that time. Acquisitions of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer of Series B shares may be made at a maximum of ten (10) per cent of the total number of shares in the company. A transfer may be made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights on Nasdaq Stockholm as well as to third parties in connection with acquisition of a company or a business. Compensation for transferred shares can be paid in cash  through an issue in kind or a set-off. Transfers of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer in connection with acquisitions may be made at a market value assessed by the Board of Directors.The purpose of the authorizations is (i) to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value  (ii) to enable acquisition opportunities by financing acquisitions with the company's own shares  and (iii) to ensure the company's undertakings  due to share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants in incentive programs)  including social security costs.The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.Resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors to issue shares  convertibles and/or warrants (item 15)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors during the period up until the next annual general meeting to  on one or more occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  andwith or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions  resolve to issue Series B shares  convertibles and/or warrants (with rights to subscribe for or convert into Series B shares). By resolutions in accordance with the authorization  the number of shares may be increased by a number corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) percent of the number of outstanding shares in the company at the time when the Board of Directors first uses the authorization.The purpose of the authorization and the reasons for a potential deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights as set out above  is to ensure financing of acquisitions of companies  part of companies or businesses or to strengthen the company's capital base and equity/assets ratio. Such issues may not require amendment of the Articles of Association applicable from time to time. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  issues by virtue of the authorisation shall be made on market conditions. In accordance with the conditions set out above  the Board of Directors shall also be authorized to resolve on other terms as considered necessary by the Board of Directors to carry out the issues.The Board of Directors further proposes that the Managing Director  or anyone appointed by the Managing Director  shall have the right to make any adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw: Bolagsverket).The resolution according to this item requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.E.

Further Information for Shareholders holding shares in certificated form Shareholders whose names appear on the register of members of the Company (i.e. those shareholders who hold their ordinary shares in certificated form and who therefore do not hold their interests in ordinary shares through the EB System or as CDIs through CREST) will receive a Form of Proxy by post which must be completed and signed in accordance with the instructions printed on the form and returned by post to Computershare Investor Services (Ireland) Limited  P.O.

Certificated shareholders who wish to submit proxies by electronic means may do so up to the same deadline by logging on to www.eproxyappointment.com. To appoint a proxy on this website shareholders need to enter a Control Number  a Shareholder Reference Number (""SRN"") and a PIN andagree to the terms and conditions specified by the Company's Registrar  Computershare Investor Services (Ireland) Limited. The Control Number  SRN and PIN can be found on the top of the Form ofProxy enclosed with the AGM Notice. Further Information for Euroclear Bank Participants Persons who hold their interests in the Company's ordinary shares through a participant account in theEB System (""EB Participants"") can submit proxy appointments (including voting instructions) electronically in the manner described in the document issued by Euroclear Bank in February 2021 andentitled ""Euroclear Bank as issuer CSD for Irish corporate securities"" (the ""Euroclear Bank Service Description""). EB Participants can either send: 1. electronic voting instructions to instruct Euroclear Nominees Limited (i.e. the nominee of Euroclear Bank) (""Euroclear Nominees"") to either itself or by appointing the chair of the AGM as proxy to: 1.1 give a discretionary vote to the chair of the AGM for all or a specific resolution(s); 1.2 vote in favour of all or a specific resolution(s); 1.3 vote against all or a specific resolution(s); or 1.4 abstain for all or a specific resolution(s); or2. a proxy voting instruction to appoint a third party (other than Euroclear Nominees or the chairof the AGM) (who may be a corporate representative or the EB Participant themselves) to attendthe AGM  subject to any restrictions in place in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic  and vote for the number of ordinary shares specified in the proxy voting instruction by providing Euroclear Bank with the proxy details as requested in its notification (e.g. proxy first name  proxy last name  proxy address  nationality code). There is no facility to offer a letter of representation/appoint a corporate representative other than through the submission of third- party proxy appointment instructions. EB Participants may cast a split vote for the same resolution. To do so  the EB Participant will need tosend a separate instruction for each chosen vote direction (in favour  against or abstain) for the given resolution. EB Participants will also be able to cast split votes across the different resolutions (i.e. votein favour of some resolutions or against other resolutions) Euroclear Bank will  wherever practical  aim to have a voting instruction deadline of one (1) hour priorto the Company's proxy appointment deadline  which  in the case of the AGM  would be a deadline of10.00 a.m. (Irish time) on 3 May 2022. Voting instructions cannot be changed or cancelled after Euroclear Bank's voting instruction deadline. EB Participants are strongly encouraged to familiarise themselves with the new arrangements with Euroclear Bank  including the new voting deadlines and procedures. For voting services offered by custodians holding Irish corporate securities directly with Euroclear Bank  please contact your custodian. Further Information for the holders of CDIs (""CDI Holders"") CDI Holders should consult with their stockbroker or other intermediary at the earliest opportunity forfurther information on the processes and timelines for submitting proxy votes for the AGM through the respective systems. Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited (""EUI"")  the operator of CREST  has arranged for voting instructionsrelating to the CDIs held in CREST to be received via a third-party service provider  Broadridge Financial Solutions Limited (""Broadridge""). Further details on this service are set out on the ""All youneed to know about SRD II"" in Euroclear UK & Ireland webpage (see section CREST International Service - Proxy voting). If you are a CDI Holder  you will be required to make use of the EUI proxy voting service facilitated by Broadridge Global Proxy Voting service in order to receive meeting announcements and send back voting instructions  as required. If you hold CDIs and wish to participate in the proxy voting service but have not already registered to avail of this service  you will need to complete the AGM and Voting Client Setup Form (CRT408). Completed application forms should be returned to EUI by an authorised signatory with another relevant authorised signatory copied in for verification purposes using the following email address:eui.srd2@euroclear.com. Fully completed and returned applications forms will be shared with Broadridge by EUI. This will enable Broadridge to contact you and share further detailed information on the service offering and initiate the process for granting your access to the Broadridge platform. Once CDI Holders have access to the Broadridge platform  they can complete and submit proxy appointments (including voting instructions) electronically. Broadridge will process and deliver proxy voting instructions received from CDI Holders by the Broadridge voting deadline date to Euroclear Bank  by their cut-off and to agreed market requirements. Alternatively  a CDI Holder can send a third-party proxy voting instruction through the Broadridge platform in order to appoint a third-party (who may be a corporate representative or the CDI Holder themselves) to attend and vote at the AGM for the number of ordinary shares specified in the proxy instruction (subject to the Broadridge voting deadline). There is no facility to offer a letter of representation/appoint a corporate representative other than through the submission of third-party proxy appointment instructions through Broadridge. Broadridge's voting deadline will be earlier than Euroclear Bank's voting instruction deadline as set out above and is expected to be the close of business (Irish time) on 28 April 2022 (to take into account the public holiday in the United Kingdom and Ireland on 2 May 2022). Voting instructions cannot be changed or cancelled after Broadridge's voting deadline. As the CDI voting deadline is expected to be before the Record Date  CDI holders that want to appoint and instruct the chair of the AGM as their Proxy and vote on their behalf at the AGM may need to make additional arrangements to send a 'Transfer to Escrow instruction' (""TTE Instruction"") to an EUI escrow account. If required  it is envisaged that the securities will be released from escrow  as soon as practicably possible  on the business day following the Record Date for the AGM  unless otherwise specified by Broadridge. TTE Instructions are read in conjunction with the voting instructions formally lodged and on their own do not constitute voting instructions. CDI Holders should pay close attention to any notices specifically relating to this AGM and are strongly encouraged to familiarise themselves with Broadridge's arrangements  including the voting deadlines and procedures and to take any further actions required by Broadridge before they can avail of the Broadridge Global Proxy voting service as soon as possible. Broadridge will use best endeavours to accept late votes  changes and cancellations from a CDI Holder after the voting deadline but there is no guarantee that these will be processed within the requisite timeframes.

Capital controls and restrictions on the NSD’s accounts with the world’s biggest settlement systems have complicated and delayed the arrival of funds on previous payments.Despite warnings from credit-rating agencies  the government has so far sidestepped a default since the war started and the sanctions were imposed. By transferring the cash  the Finance Ministry has performed its obligations under the bond terms “in full ” it said in a statement Tuesday.On Monday the Ministry filed notifications for an “interest payment” and “principal repayment” on $2 billion of dollar-denominated debt due on April 4  the biggest security maturing since Russia was hit with sanctions following its invasion of Ukraine. It also filed a notification for a coupon on bonds due in April 2042.The National Settlement Depository  or NSD  in Moscow receives the Russian government’s payments on some of its foreign bonds for distribution.Clearstream HurdleWhile Russia has continued to meet its debt obligations  several hurdles await. The latest came at the end of last week when Clearstream  the Luxembourg-based bank that settles payments for some of the nation’s bonds  blocked the NSD’s account.A decision to restart would be based on a review by regulators in Luxembourg  the depository said on March 24. A Clearstream spokeswoman declined to comment at the time of the announcement.Story continuesAmong Russian companies  steelmaker Severstal PJSC last week became the first Russian company to run out of time to pay interest on foreign-currency debt since the war in Ukraine began after Citigroup Inc. blocked the transaction.(Updates throughout.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.03,0.77,0.2,mixed,0.08,0.15,0.77,True,English,"['$102 Million Coupon', 'Russia', 'Step', 'Default', 'The National Settlement Depository', 'biggest settlement systems', 'biggest energy exporter', 'biggest security maturing', 'steelmaker Severstal PJSC', 'first Russian company', 'The Finance Ministry', 'A Clearstream spokeswoman', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', '$102 million interest payment', 'Russian companies', 'financial isolation', 'Capital controls', 'credit-rating agencies', 'bond terms', 'principal repayment', 'dollar-denominated debt', 'Clearstream Hurdle', 'several hurdles', 'last week', 'Luxembourg-based bank', 'foreign-currency debt', 'Citigroup Inc.', 'coupon payment', 'Russian government', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'debt obligations', 'foreign bonds', 'previous payments', 'world', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'funds', 'investors', 'restrictions', 'NSD', 'accounts', 'arrival', 'warnings', 'default', 'sanctions', 'cash', 'statement', 'Monday', 'notifications', 'April', 'Moscow', 'distribution', 'end', 'decision', 'review', 'regulators', 'March', 'time', 'announcement', 'Story', 'transaction', 'Updates']",2022-03-30,2022-03-30,ca.finance.yahoo.com

1787,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.manilatimes.net/2022/03/30/business/foreign-business/chinese-firms-eye-swiss-bourse-listings/1838073,Chinese firms eye Swiss bourse listings,1 day ago,"A HANDFUL of Chinese companies have revealed plans to be listed on the Swiss Stock Exchange as the country pushes for more initial public offerings (IPOs) overseas.China has been encouraging its businesses to raise funds abroad despite the US government's regulatory toughening that targeted Chinese companies for a time  market watchers said  although views remain split on the viability of European listings.Jürg Schneider  spokesman for Swiss exchange operator SIX  told Beijing-run Global Times last Monday that the bourse was working with appropriate authorities and partner exchanges to advance on the journey that started in 2019  when it signed memoranda of understanding with the Shanghai and Shenzhen bourses to establish a stock connect system with Chinese exchanges. This would allow Chinese companies to tap into the Swiss capital market while ensuring the highest standards of investor protection.""Such announcements — [like] the ones of the various Chinese companies last week — are proof of the interest in SIX and [the] setup  and we will officially communicate together with the relevant Chinese exchange once the stock connect is ready "" Schneider said.He was referring to Sany Heavy Industry  Lepu Medical Technology (Beijing) and Gotion High-Tech  whose filings with the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges disclosed plans to issue global depositary receipts (GDRs) on the Swiss exchange.These plans put the spotlight on the primary European bourse that sits alongside the London Stock Exchange and Germany's Deutsche Boerse.InternationalizationAmong the reasons for the planned issuance are an accelerated push for internationalization  the leverage of the capital market and improved corporate governance and shareholding structures  according to the filings.Both Sany and Gotion described the plan as a response to the domestic capital market's policy call as part of moves to deepen interconnections between the Chinese and European markets and leverage these to aid the real economy.A flurry of interest in the Swiss exchange  in the wake of an expansion of a stock trading link between local and overseas stock exchanges to include the German and Swiss bourses  indicates that China's capital market has continued to open its doors wider to the outside world and retained its support strategically for local businesses' IPOs beyond their home turf  Yang Delong  a member of the Chief Economist Committee of Securities Association of China  told Global Times.The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) unveiled in mid-February its revised rules stipulating that eligible businesses traded on the Shenzhen bourse would be included in the stock link  which was previously only made up of firms listed on the Shanghai and London exchanges.Exchanges in Switzerland and Germany also became part of that link  pursuant to the revised rules.The US has ramped up its regulatory toughening on Chinese shares in the past few years  but China remains unfazed with a continued open stance on overseas listings by local firms  Yang said.Since the US enacted the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act in 2020  China has maintained communications with US regulatory authorities and sought effective ways to resolve the issue  market observers said  stressing that the expanded stock linkup has increasingly been seen as a conduit for local firms to rev up their global expansion.Overseas listingsIn a fresh pledge of official support  the CSRC crystallized its push for the implementation of the new rules governing overseas listings as the securities regulator championed varied eligible firms' plans for IPOs on overseas exchanges  a commission post on Wednesday read.Nonetheless  such GDRs remain the last in line for domestic firms seeking an overseas listing  Hong Hao  managing director and head of research at Bocom International  told Global Times.Factoring in a scarcity of Chinese shares on European exchanges where investors are largely unfamiliar with Chinese options  local firms tend to put such GDRs on the back burner  Hong said  citing insufficient trading volumes as a frequent issue.So far  only four GDRs have been issued on the London exchange via the stock link between Shanghai and London since its launch in June 2019: that of Huatai Securities in June 2019  China Pacific Insurance in June 2020  China Yangtze Power in September 2020 and SDIC Power Holdings in October 2020.The stock linkup includes both eastbound and westbound trading  with the prior direction consisting of firms listed on foreign exchanges with offerings of Chinese depositary receipts (CDRs) in the mainland market.Mainland-listed firms  for their part  issue GDRs on foreign markets.Initially  GDR issuers are capable of fundraising in overseas markets while CDR issuers can only list these on the mainland and not raise capital.",neutral,0.06,0.83,0.11,negative,0.02,0.34,0.64,True,English,"['Swiss bourse listings',

The new Digital Assistant and Sales Advisor modules  already used by Linedata’s clients from London to Toronto  are now available for the Linedata Ekip360 solution and can also be deployed on further Lending & Leasing solutions.Khalid Dbich  Deputy CEO of SOFAC  a Moroccan company specializing in credit solutions  said: “Contrary to common belief  the financing offer with the best chance of success is not necessarily the one with the lowest monthly payment. It was important for us  at SOFAC  to master all the upstream information in order to provide the best advice  suggest the most suitable financing offers and  ultimately  remain competitive. Linedata’s Sales Advisor prescriptive analytics module provided a real answer to our needs. We immediately looked forward to participating in this promising project  which focuses on the concrete and tangible contributions of artificial intelligence to resolving business issues.”Digital Assistant  an AI-powered assistant to benefit from peer expertiseThe artificial intelligence that makes up Linedata’s Digital Assistant suggests actions to a case manager  based on the choices previously made by other users on the same type of case. The assistant thus generates the equivalent of a business workflow without requiring any complex configuration.Linedata’s Digital Assistant is particularly useful as:It avoids navigating across a number of submenus in order to select the appropriate option.It simplifies the takeover of an ongoing case by an employee who is not very familiar with it by immediately indicating its current status and the next actions to be taken.It acts as a virtual mentor to pass the essential know-how of more experienced colleagues to newcomers  who benefit from reliable suggestions for tasks to be performed.Digital Assistant is based on a LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) recurrent neural network that takes into account the current screen and the sequence of actions that led to it in order to make the prediction. Digital Assistant exploits all the traceability data provided by the solution  makes them more reliable and enriches them with new concepts relating to accounting or financial processing.Sales Advisor  to guide financing advisorsLinedata’s Sales Advisor module aims to transform the user experience of financing advisors by guiding them towards the offer to be put forward based on the probability of the transaction being validated.In concrete terms  the tool performs analyses based on anonymized data about the buyer  the property to be financed or even the financing organization“In business intelligence  prescriptive analytics helps make decisions by identifying the best choices among the various options available and within known limits. We have chosen this approach and developed two modules to be integrated into our software offering. This will allow our clients to make more informed decisions while maintaining a high level of productivity and efficiency ” explained Alain Mattei  Head of Lending & Leasing at Linedata.Linedata designed Sales Advisor to help its clients optimize their business processes around three main use cases:Improving the close rate of sales proposals by determining the most appropriate funding schedulesHelping sell additional services (insurance  maintenance  etc.)Identifying loyal customers (future renewals) as early as possible in the setup processTo create the Sales Advisor module  Linedata’s experts deployed learning algorithms to calculate a relative probability of close between the different simulations offered to the client while taking into account the evolution of commercial policies over time. To achieve this  Linedata worked with a mixed team of data scientists and business experts who were able to collaborate on a fast-track implementation for SOFAC through a Datalab.ABOUT LINEDATAWith 20 years’ experience and 700+ clients in 50 countries  Linedata’s 1100 employees in 20 offices provide global humanized technology solutions and services for the asset management and credit industries that help its clients to evolve and to operate at the highest levels.Headquartered in France  Linedata achieved revenues of EUR 160.2 million in 2021 and is listed on Euronext Paris compartment B FR0004156297-LIN – Reuters LDSV.PA – Bloomberg LIN:FPlinedata.com,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.62,0.28,0.1,True,English,"['Prescriptive Analytics', 'Clients’ Decisions', 'Linedata', 'AI', 'Solutions', 'Long Short Term Memory) recurrent neural network', 'Sales Advisor prescriptive analytics module', 'three main use cases', 'global humanized technology solutions', 'two artificial intelligence modules', 'Sales Advisor module', 'lowest monthly payment', 'appropriate funding schedules', 'suitable financing offers', 'Euronext Paris compartment', 'new Digital Assistant', 'Linedata Ekip360 solution', 'two modules', 'global provider', 'credit technology', 'sales proposals', 'credit solutions', 'client cases', 'appropriate option', 'business intelligence', 'NEW YORK', 'new concepts', 'financing advisors', 'financing organization', 'Leasing solutions', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'asset management', 'Khalid Dbich', 'Deputy CEO', 'Moroccan company', 'common belief', 'best chance', 'upstream information', 'best advice', 'real answer', 'promising project', 'tangible contributions', 'business issues', 'AI-powered assistant', 'peer expertise', 'other users', 'same type', 'business workflow', 'complex configuration', 'current status', 'virtual mentor', 'essential know-how', 'experienced colleagues', 'reliable suggestions', 'current screen', 'financial processing', 'user experience', 'various options', 'known limits', 'software offering', 'high level', 'Alain Mattei', 'business processes', 'close rate', 'loyal customers', 'future renewals', 'setup process', 'learning algorithms', 'different simulations', 'commercial policies', 'mixed team', 'fast-track implementation', '20 years’ experience', 'credit industries', 'highest levels', 'Reuters LDSV', 'traceability data', 'anonymized data', 'data scientists', 'case manager', 'ongoing case', 'concrete terms', 'best choices', 'informed decisions', 'relative probability', 'business experts', 'next actions', 'additional services', 'Bloomberg LIN', 'ABOUT LINEDATA', '700+ clients', 'TORONTO', 'CASABLANCA', 'decision-making', 'productivity', 'follow-up', 'London', 'Lending', 'SOFAC', 'success', 'order', 'needs', 'equivalent', 'number', 'submenus', 'takeover', 'employee', 'newcomers', 'tasks', 'LSTM', 'account', 'sequence', 'prediction', 'transaction', 'tool', 'analyses', 'buyer', 'property', 'approach', 'efficiency', 'Head', 'insurance', 'maintenance', 'evolution', 'time', 'Datalab', '50 countries', '20 offices', 'France', 'revenues']",2022-03-29,2022-03-30,businesswire.com

During his past three terms in office  Constant has led the drive to build a highly robust capital position at a very low risk profile  and excellent financial results. As an all-round executive  he has also successfully engaged with many of our most important projects and functions outside his financial remit. While this is a good moment to welcome the new generation to succeed him  we will miss his tremendous experience and reliability as a board member.”Constant Korthout added: “Over the past 12 years  Van Lanschot Kempen has made a seminal transition from universal bank to specialist wealth manager. In the process  we’ve rolled out a successful capital strategy  resulting in solid dividends for our shareholders and scope for acquisitions. It has been a real pleasure to help achieve this vision over all these years  and it’s now time for the next phase in my working life. It fills me with pride that my successors come from within our very own organisation  and I wish them every success.”Constant Korthout’s third term as a member of the Management Board and CFRO will end at the close of the Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 May 2022. To facilitate a smooth transfer of his duties to his successors  the Supervisory Board intends to reappoint Constant Korthout until 1 September 2022.In a parallel track  Van Lanschot Kempen’s Supervisory Board has decided to split the position of CFRO into two separate positions as of 1 September 2022: Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO).Appointing Wendy Winkelhuijzen as CROThe Supervisory Board intends to appoint Wendy Winkelhuijzen as a member of the Management Board and as CRO  effective 1 September 2022. Having first joined Van Lanschot Kempen in 2001 as a corporate finance analyst  Wendy has held a range of positions within the organisation  including as a member of the Private and Business Banking management team  as a member of the team guiding Van Lanschot Kempen’s strategic review in 2013 and as Investor Relations Manager. She currently serves as Managing Director of Strategy & Corporate Development.Story continuesAppointing Jeroen Kroes to CFOThe Supervisory Board intends to appoint Jeroen Kroes as a member of the Management Board and as CFO  effective 1 September 2022. Jeroen has been with Van Lanschot Kempen for well over 25 years and he also joined as a corporate finance analyst. Since then  he has held various positions within the organisation: following a lengthy stretch at Corporate Finance  he was appointed project leader of the 2013 strategic review and then went on to take up his current post as Managing Director of Finance  Reporting & Control.Frans Blom commented: “The Supervisory Board is absolutely delighted with the appointments of Wendy Winkelhuijzen as Van Lanschot Kempen’s new CRO and Jeroen Kroes as its new CFO. Wendy has clear views which she’s able to put across very tactfully; she is analytical  disciplined  meticulous and effective in everything she does. Jeroen has a great sense of what’s going on in our business  is highly approachable and caring  and is a real team player. Having two such excellent candidates from within our own organisation  gives us great confidence in our future.”Wendy Winkelhuijzen said: “Over the past few years  we’ve worked really hard to further enhance our compliance and risk functions  and creating a separate CRO position fits into this really well. I expect to benefit from the experience that our acquisitions of the past few years have helped me to build – and the sheer amount of focus on compliance and risk management this involved. Together with my colleagues in the various departments  I’ll be dedicating myself to ensuring an excellent compliance environment and an optimum risk profile for Van Lanschot Kempen  and doing this very much in close cooperation with our businesses.”Jeroen Kroes said: “In the past decade  I’ve worked very closely with Constant and I’m very happy to step into his CFO shoes. It’s great to see how Van Lanschot Kempen affords us opportunities to do work that energises us  and to be given room to develop. I look forward to continuing our solid financial policies of the recent past  together with my colleagues on the Management Board.”Van Lanschot Kempen’s regulators have approved the appointments of both Wendy Winkelhuijzen and Jeroen Kroes  and the Works Council has likewise issued positive advice.The Annual General Meeting to be held on 25 May 2022 will be notified of these intended appointments and the reappointment.Media Relations: +31 20 354 45 85; mediarelations@vanlanschotkempen.comInvestor Relations: +31 20 354 45 90; investorrelations@vanlanschotkempen.comElements of this press release contain information about Van Lanschot Kempen NV within the meaning of Article 7(1) to (4) of EU Regulation No. 596/2014.About Van Lanschot KempenVan Lanschot Kempen  a wealth manager active in Private Banking  Investment Management and Investment Banking  with the aim of preserving and creating wealth  in a sustainable way  for both its clients and the society of which it is part.

(Nasdaq: IGMS) today announced the signing of an exclusive worldwide collaboration agreement to create  develop  manufacture  and commercialize IgM antibody agonists against three oncology targets and three immunology/inflammation targets. Engineered IgM antibodies represent a new class of potential therapeutics that combine the multi-valency of IgM antibodies possessing 10 binding sites compared to conventional IgG antibodies having only 2 target binding sites.John Reed  M.D.  Ph.D.Global Head of Research and Development  Sanofi“We look forward to this collaboration with IGM Biosciences  a pioneer in a new class of antibody medicines for the treatment of cancer  immunology  and inflammatory diseases. The IGM Biosciences technology platform offers an exciting approach to developing high-avidity IgM antibodies that can efficiently bind and stimulate the activity of cell surface receptors. This unique platform has the potential to overcome historical limitations of conventional IgG antibodies when seeking agonists of some classes of receptors.”Fred SchwarzerChief Executive Officer of IGM Biosciences“Sanofi is a global leader in the development and commercialization of innovative therapies  and we welcome the addition of their extensive expertise and resources in expanding and accelerating the development of our IgM antibody platform across multiple areas of high unmet need. This partnership builds on an existing research collaboration with Sanofi and is a key step towards our goal of unlocking the full breadth of potential for this important new class of therapeutics. We are pleased to share this vision with Sanofi and look forward to working together on these six potentially first- and best-in-class programs.”Story continuesTerms of the CollaborationUnder the terms of the agreement  IGM will receive a $ 150 million upfront payment. Sanofi has also expressed an interest in purchasing up to $100M of IGM non-voting common stock in a public financing.For each oncology target collaboration program  IGM will lead research and development activities  and assume related costs  through approval of the first biologics license application (BLA) for a product directed to that oncology target by the FDA or EMA in exchange for up to $940 million in development and regulatory milestones per oncology target. After receipt of the first marketing approval for a product directed to an oncology target  Sanofi will lead all subsequent development and commercialization activities for that oncology target. For each oncology target  the companies will share profits 50:50 in certain major markets  and IGM will be eligible to receive tiered royalties on net sales in the rest of world.For each immunology/inflammation target collaboration program  IGM will lead research and development activities  and assume related costs  through the completion of Phase 1 clinical trial for up to two constructs directed to each immunology/inflammation target  after which Sanofi will be responsible for all future development and related costs  in exchange for up to $1 065 million in aggregate development and regulatory and commercial milestones per immunology/inflammation target. Following the completion of Phase 1 clinical trial for each immunology/inflammation target  Sanofi will be responsible for subsequent development activities  commercialization efforts  and related costs. IGM is eligible to receive tiered high single-digit to low-teen royalties on global net sales.Closing of the collaboration is contingent on completion of review under antitrust laws  including the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the U.S.  and customary closing conditions.About IGM Biosciences  Inc.Headquartered in Mountain View  California  IGM Biosciences is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on creating and developing engineered IgM antibodies.

We absolutely had to get those stories out ” said Jean-Guilhem Lamberti  Chief Creative Officer  Accor. “Images of stylish waiters with silver platters  delivering refreshments on bicycles and serving on frozen lakes; treating bear cubs as guests; celebrities in residence.

WisdomTree announced the launch of the three ETPs including WisdomTree Solana  WisdomTree Cardano  and WisdomTree Polkadot. The ETPs are listed on major EU digital exchanges like Deutsche Boerse’s Xetra  the Swiss SIX Exchange as well as the Swiss Stock Exchange. The Euronext exchange is expected to list the ETPs in Paris and Amsterdam as well.The ETPs are designed to offer investors in the EU another option and gain exposure to the price of Solana  Polkadot  and Cardano via regulated exchanges. The three products have a total expense ratio of 0.95% and are available for sale in Belgium  Denmark  Austria  Finland  France  Italy  Germany  Luxembourg  Ireland  Netherlands  Poland  Spain  Norway  Sweden  and Switzerland. The new ETPs follow the growing crypto asset products offered by WisdomTree in Europe and joined products like Wisdomtree Crypto Mega Cap Equal weight which is backed by physical assets like ETH and BTC.ADVERTISEMENTWisdomTree’s head of Europe Alexis Marinof said that the new offerings will meet the growing demand from institutional investors that want to diversify their portfolios:“While bitcoin and Ethereum grab the headlines  altcoins are now viable options for many institutional investors  providing more options to diversify their crypto holdings just like they would with any other asset class.”As previously reported  WisdomTree was launching ETPs in Europe amid the regulatory issues in the US  and in late 2021  the US SEC rejected WisdomTree’s spot BTC ETF after delaying a decision on the product a few times. The company amended the spot BTC ETF filing and named the US Bank as a custodian for the BTC trust.Also  The US SEC extended its window to approve or disapprove spot BTC exchange-traded fund applications from the asset managers One River and WisdomTree. According to the seaprate filings  the SEC extends the windows for decision for allowing shares of WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust and One River Carbon Neutral Bitcoin Trust to be listed on the cBOE BZX Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange Arca.ADVERTISEMENT,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.01,0.06,0.93,True,English,"['ETF Provider', 'Polkadot ETPs', 'WisdomTree', 'Cardano', 'Solana', 'Wisdomtree Crypto Mega Cap Equal weight', 'One River Carbon Neutral Bitcoin Trust', 'spot BTC exchange-traded fund applications', 'New York Stock Exchange Arca', 'three new crypto exchange-traded products', 'The American ETF provider', 'major EU digital exchanges', 'spot BTC ETF filing', 'growing crypto asset products', 'The ETF Provider WisdomTree', 'Swiss Stock Exchange', 'Swiss SIX Exchange', 'cBOE BZX Exchange', 'The Euronext exchange', 'latest cryptocurrency news', 'total expense ratio', 'other asset class', 'WisdomTree Bitcoin Trust', 'multiple crypto ETPs', 'many institutional investors', 'The US SEC', 'BTC trust', 'crypto products', 'three products', 'crypto holdings', 'new offerings', 'new ETPs', 'regulated exchanges', 'growing demand', 'asset managers', 'three ETPs', 'The ETPs', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'physical assets', 'Alexis Marinof', 'regulatory issues', 'seaprate filings', 'US Bank', 'viable options', 'WisdomTree Solana', 'WisdomTree Cardano', 'WisdomTree Polkadot', 'Europe', 'today', 'launch', 'Xetra', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'exposure', 'price', 'sale', 'Belgium', 'Denmark', 'Austria', 'Finland', 'France', 'Italy', 'Germany', 'Luxembourg', 'Ireland', 'Netherlands', 'Poland', 'Spain', 'Norway', 'Sweden', 'Switzerland', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'head', 'portfolios', 'Ethereum', 'altcoins', 'decision', 'company', 'custodian', 'window', 'shares']",2022-03-29,2022-03-30,dcforecasts.com

While altcoin linked ETPs are flourishing in Europe the US securities and exchange commission are still resisting calls for a bitcoin spot investment product.“In Europe  we’ve always been further ahead. The first exchange traded bitcoin product was launched in Sweden in 2015 ” commented Diana Biggs  chief strategy officer at the parent company of Valour  an issuer of exchange traded products in Europe.“We have regulators  institutions  market  and investors who have had a long time to get comfortable with these types of products… I think it’s really surprised everyone that in the US  we still haven’t seen this type of product come out ” she continued.A welcoming regulatory environment in Europe has allowed firms to experiment with ETPS linked to alt coins.“While bitcoin and Ethereum grab the headlines  altcoins are now viable options for many institutional investors  providing more options to diversify their crypto holdings just like they would with any other asset class ” commented Alexis Marinof  the head of Europe at Wisdomtree.Just last week FTX and CoinShares last week announced plans to launch “the first” Solana ETP that returns a portion of staking rewards to investors.Read more: Ether futures set for Chicago Mercantile Exchange launch today,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,negative,0.22,0.35,0.44,True,English,"['Polkadot ETPs', 'Wisdomtree', 'Cardano', 'Solana', 'Europe', 'Chicago Mercantile Exchange launch', 'bitcoin spot investment product', 'chief strategy officer', 'other asset class', 'Frankfurt Stock Exchange', 'Swiss stock exchange', 'welcoming regulatory environment', 'European crypto market', 'first” Solana ETP', 'many institutional investors', 'first exchange', 'bitcoin product', 'Investment firm', 'investment vehicles', 'exchange commission', 'crypto currencies', 'crypto holdings', 'total view', 'trading floor', 'Ralph Orlowski', 'Getty Images', 'Borse Xetra', 'Euronext exchanges', 'digital assets', 'key component', 'Jason Guthrie', 'welcoming approach', 'Diana Biggs', 'parent company', 'long time', 'alt coins', 'Alexis Marinof', 'Ether futures', 'Crypto ETPs', 'underlying price', 'viable options', 'traded products', 'US securities', 'Polkadot ETPs', 'Wisdomtree ETPs', 'Wisdomtree Europe', 'Cardano', 'Photo', 'swathe', 'sign', 'ADA', 'SIX', 'plans', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'customers', 'exposure', 'strategies', 'head', 'regulators', 'counterparts', 'altcoin', 'calls', 'Sweden', 'Valour', 'issuer', 'institutions', 'types', 'everyone', 'firms', 'Ethereum', 'FTX', 'CoinShares', 'portion', 'rewards']",2022-03-29,2022-03-30,cityam.com

While Terra’s gro…,Terra total value locked (TVL) is on the rise. The network had quickly grown to become one of the top decentralized finance (DeFi’0 contenders in the space  surpassing well-established and popular networks like the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). While Terra’s growth has come from its unique staking offerings to users  it has also received a significant boost from its decision to add Bitcoin to its treasury.Terra Buys BitcoinTerra had announced that it planned to purchase Bitcoin to serve as the reserve currency for the network and by the admission of founder Do Kwon  the network had already begun purchasing bitcoin before the announcement. Terra’s move to make the digital asset the default reserve up to the tune of more than $1 billion had drawn more attention to the network and with the buying spree  the network has seen even more interest.Related Reading | Fnality Venture Funds Euroclear To Embrace Strategy For Digital Ledger TechnologyOne of the ways these have been apparent has been how fast the TVL has been growing. The decision to purchase bitcoin was announced last week and in this time  the network’s TVL has grown to more than $2 billion.When the announcement was made  the total TVL on the Terra network was around $26 billion. Less than two weeks later  this number has grown as high as $28.7 billion  reaching a new all-time high.With this value  Terra sits in front of big players in the space like BSC  Avalanche  Solana  and Fantom. The total value locked of $28.7 billion puts it in second place  behind Ethereum  which remains the biggest DeFi platform to date.LUNA trading at $104 | Source: LUNAUSD on TradingView.comThis comes after it was confirmed that the Luna Foundation Guard’s bitcoin wallet now holds a whopping 24 954.95 BTC  which was valued at $1.1 billion. On-chain data showed that the foundation’s wallet had made large purchases in the days following the founder’s announcement. A decision that Kwon explained was because “Bitcoin is the only hard reserve asset that’s been proven out of the digital currencies.”Related Reading | Wasabi’s Side Of The Story: Reasons For Blacklisting Certain BTC From CoinJoinFollowing the purchases  the price of LUNA  Terra’s native token  had also rallied  touching as high as $106. The Terra network continues to grow as more DeFi users move to leverage the opportunities provided by it.Anchor remains the most dominant protocol on the Terra network  accounting for 52.38% of all TVL as of the time of this writing. In total  there is $15.04 billion in TVL on the Anchor protocol alone which is available on both the Terra and Avalanche networks.Featured image from The Game Locus  chart from TradingView.com,neutral,0.03,0.89,0.08,negative,0.02,0.38,0.6,True,English,"['Bitcoin Buying Spree', 'Terra TVL', 'top decentralized finance', 'unique staking offerings', 'Fnality Venture Funds', 'The Game Locus', 'Binance Smart Chain', 'Digital Ledger Technology', 'biggest DeFi platform', 'hard reserve asset', 'founder Do Kwon', 'Luna Foundation Guard', 'The Terra network', 'Terra total value', 'digital asset', 'reserve currency', 'chain data', 'digital currencies', 'popular networks', 'significant boost', 'buying spree', 'Related Reading', 'big players', 'second place', 'LUNA trading', 'whopping 24,954.95 BTC', 'Certain BTC', 'native token', 'dominant protocol', 'Featured image', 'Terra Buys', 'large purchases', 'DeFi users', 'Anchor protocol', 'Avalanche networks', 'total TVL', 'bitcoin wallet', 'rise', '0 contenders', 'space', 'BSC', 'growth', 'decision', 'treasury', 'admission', 'announcement', 'move', 'tune', 'attention', 'interest', 'Strategy', 'ways', 'time', 'number', 'front', 'Solana', 'Fantom', 'Ethereum', 'date', 'Source', 'LUNAUSD', 'TradingView', 'days', 'Wasabi', 'Side', 'Story', 'Reasons', 'CoinJoin', 'price', 'opportunities', 'writing', 'chart']",2022-03-29,2022-03-30,bitcoinist.com

By providing valuation estimates  they synthesize the current state of supply…,"thierry Ehrmann  CEO and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department: "" By preparing a sale  publishing a catalog several weeks in advance and by giving a range of estimates and guaranteeing the information long after adjudication  the auction house actually 'moderates' the NFT market. This does not prevent prices from soaring if demand is stronger than expected"" .Despite the transparency of blockchain technology  there are plenty of anomalies on major NFT marketplaces. Whether it's fake accounts (like those that appeared around Takashi Murakami) or arbitrage opportunities (offered to those who manage to integrate the whitelists of the most coveted projects)  NFT sales platforms have seen a large number of highly aggressive strategies contributing to price volatility and a degree of instability.Takashi Murakami's 'overly' anticipated NFTsSince the announcement of his Flowers NFT project  Japanese artist Takashi Murakami (ranked 105th in our global ranking of artists by 2021 auction turnover  all periods of creation combined) has been the subject of numerous fraud attempts using Instagram and Twitter accounts with deliberately similar names  such as murekemi.flower2022. By inciting you to mint NFTs as quickly as possible (as most NFT drops do)  these fake projects try to make you buy instantly  without checking the legitimacy of the creator.It is clear that Murakami's NFT project is attracting interest from both traditional collectors and from the crypto community. However  it is looking increasingly likely that his Flowers NFTs will not be launched until around the time of his solo show at the Gagosian in New York  scheduled for May 2022. We will therefore have to wait a little longer than was initially expected to buy into Murakami's digital Flowers.https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2022/takashi-murakami/Unfortunately  the lack of clarity that currently exists on NFT marketplaces as well as on social media is generating a large number of scams. Almost all of today's most famous NFT projects have replicas circulating in large numbers on Opensea. This situation could be improved by a more active presence of stabilizing agents such as auction houses in the NFT ecosystem.At last… a genuine reference priceOf the 10 000 items in the World of Women collection  only one copy went to public auction. Estimated between $400 000 and $665 000 by Christie's  Woman #5672 was sold on 1 March 2022 in London for $600 000 (to which a 26% buyer's fees was added  bringing the total purchase price to $755 000).The value of this work fitted perfectly with the estimate provided by the auction house Christie's. However  the price of this NFT has been very volatile: barely six months ago  Woman #5672 was acquired for $117 000 (37.95 eth) on the OpenSea platform  and the best offer for this NFT is today $70 000 (20 eth).https://opensea.io/assets/0xe785e82358879f061bc3dcac6f0444462d4b5330/5672Because it was outside the blockchain  data relating to Christie's sale does not appear in the work's activity log on OpenSea. On the other hand  the identity (or rather the pseudonym) of the buyer of Woman #5672 has been revealed by Opensea: it is the moonpay.eth account. In this way  the OpenSea platform and Christie's auction house both provide two complementary bits of information.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/03/image1-Abdoulaye-Barry-Globule-Blanc-2022.jpg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The registration of shareholders starts at 10.30 CEST. Right to attendance and voting • To be entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting (and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the number of votes they may cast)  shareholders must be entered on the Company's register of members maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB by Monday 25 April 2022.• Shareholders whose shares are registered in the name of a nominee should note that they may be required by their respective nominee/s to temporarily re-register their shares in their own name in the register of members maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB in order to be entitled to attend and vote (in person or by proxy) at the Meeting. Any such re-registration would need to be effected by Monday 25 April 2022. Shareholders should therefore liaise with and instruct their nominees well in advance thereof.• To be entitled to attend and vote in person at the Meeting  shareholders must notify Euroclear Sweden AB of their intention to attend the Meeting by Monday 25 April 2022 and can do so by (i) e-mail to GeneralMeetingService@euroclear.com or (ii) mail to: Kambi Group plc  c/o Euroclear Sweden AB  Box 191  SE-101 23 Stockholm  Sweden or (iii) by phone on +46 8 402 9092 during the office hours of Euroclear Sweden AB.

Shareholders' right to appoint a proxy • A shareholder who is entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting  is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and vote on his or her behalf. A proxy need not also be a shareholder. If the shareholder is an individual  the proxy form must be signed by the appointer (or his authorised attorney) or comply with Article 126 of the Articles. If the shareholder is a corporation  the proxy form must be signed on its behalf by an authorised attorney or a duly authorised officer of the corporation or comply with Article 126 of the Articles.• Proxy forms must clearly indicate whether the proxy is to vote in their discretion or in accordance with the voting instructions sheet attached to the proxy form. Your proxy shall vote as you have directed in respect of the resolutions set out in this notice or on any other resolution that is properly put to the meeting. If the proxy form is returned to the Company without any indication as to how the proxy shall vote  generally or in respect of a particular resolution  the proxy shall exercise their discretion as to how to vote or whether to abstain from voting  generally or in respect of that particular resolution (as applicable).• Where the shareholder is a corporation  a document evidencing the signatory right of the officer signing the proxy form  must be submitted with the proxy form. Where the proxy form is signed on behalf of the shareholder by an attorney (rather than by an authorised representative  in the case of a corporation)  the original power of attorney or a copy thereof certified or notarised in a manner acceptable to the Board of Directors must be submitted to the Company  failing which the appointment of the proxy may be treated as invalid.• The original signed proxy form and  if applicable  other supporting documents (required pursuant to the above instructions)  must be received by Euroclear Sweden AB no later than Monday 25 April 2022 by (i) e-mail to GeneralMeetingService@euroclear.com or (ii) mail to: Kambi Group plc  c/o Euroclear Sweden AB  Box 191  SE-101 23 Stockholm  Sweden. Shareholders are therefore encouraged to submit their proxy forms (and other supporting documents  if any) as soon as possible.• Proxy forms are available on the Company website www.kambi.com under the General Meetings section. • Aggregated attendance notifications and proxy data processed by Euroclear Sweden AB must be transmitted to and received by the Company by email at Mia.Nordlander@kambi.com not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the Meeting and in default shall not be treated as valid.

(Resolution n) 23. Closing of the Annual General Meeting Information about proposals related to Agenda items Agenda item 2 The Nomination Committee proposes that Lars Stugemo be elected Chair of the Meeting. Agenda item 10 The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM approves the remuneration report on page 55 of the Company's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2021. Agenda item 11 The Nomination Committee proposes that the Board of Directors should consist of five Directors. Agenda item 12 The Nomination Committee appointed by the Directors of the Company pursuant to Article 90 of the Articles  proposes that the aggregate amount per annum of the ordinary remuneration of Directors shall not exceed €360 000 (previously €360 000). The Directors have determined in terms of Articles 68 and 69 of the Articles that the annual amount of the ordinary remuneration of a Director shall be €52 500 (previously €52 500) and of the Chair of the Board shall be €105 000 (previously €105 000). The annual extra remuneration payable to each member of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee shall be €7 000 (previously €7 000). Additionally  the directors have determined that an extra remuneration of €2 000 (previously €1 100) is payable to each director per licence application handled in the US  and a fee  at the rate of €2 100 (previously €2 100) per day spent in the US in conjunction with handling of the applications  is paid to any director as required. Agenda item 18 The Nomination Committee proposes that Lars Stugemo is appointed as the Chair of the Board. Agenda item 19 The Nomination Committee proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that  until the general meeting of the shareholders decides otherwise  the Nomination Committee shall consist of not less than four and not more than five members  of which one shall be the Chair of the Board of Directors. The members of the Nomination Committee shall represent all shareholders and be appointed by the three or four largest shareholders as at 30 September each year  having expressed their willingness to participate in the Nomination Committee. Agenda item 20 Following a formal tender process and in accordance with the recommendation by the Audit Committee  the Nomination Committee proposes that Mazars Malta be re-appointed auditor for the period from the end of the Annual General Meeting 2022 until the end of the Annual General Meeting 2023. The Nomination Committee proposes that the auditor's fees be paid based on approved invoices. Agenda item 21 The objectives of the authorisation are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a directed set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares on each issue date will be used in determining the price at which shares will be issued. For the purposes of Article 88(7) of the Companies Act  through this resolution the members of the Company are also authorising the Board of Directors to restrict or withdraw the members' right of pre-emption that would normally entitle members to be offered the newly issued shares in the Company in proportion to their shareholding before such new shares are offered to third parties. Agenda item 22 The Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition by the Company of its own shares shall take place on First North Growth Market at Nasdaq Stockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares to all members of the Company. Such acquisitions of own shares may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on market terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to First North Growth Market at Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company's annual report and accounts. Any resolution to repurchase own shares will be publicly disclosed. The objective of the buyback and transfer right is to ensure added value for the Company's shareholders and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company's capital structure. Following such buybacks  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or transfer to employees under a company share incentive plan. Once repurchased  further shareholder and Bondholder approval would be required before those shares could be cancelled. If used as consideration for an acquisition the intention would be that they would be issued as shares and not sold first.

If a member resigns from the Nomination Committee before the work is completed and the Nomination Committee finds it suitable  a substitute shall be appointed. Such substitute shall be appointed from the same shareholder or  if that shareholder no longer is among the largest shareholders in terms of voting rights  from the largest shareholder next in line.

Resolution to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve to issue new shares  warrants or convertible loansProposals for resolutionsItem 1 - Election of a Chairman for the Annual General MeetingThe Nomination Committee proposes lawyer Magnus Lindstedt to be  or in the vent of his absence  the one the nomination committee appoints  elected as Chairman of the Annual General Meeting.Item 2 - Election of one or more persons to approve the minutesThe Board of Directors proposes Per Colleen and Mats J Andersson  or in the vent of their absence  those the Board instead appoints  to certify the minutes. The assignment for the persons to certify the minutes  together with the Chairman  includes verifying the voting list and confirming that advance votes received are correctly reflected in the minutes of the meeting.Item 3 - Preparation and approval of the voting listThe voting list proposed for approval is the voting list prepared by Euroclear Sweden AB on behalf of the company  based on the shareholders' register  received notices of postal votes as well as shareholders  and verified by the persons elected to approve the minutes.Item 7b - Resolution regarding allocation of the company's loss according to the adopted balance sheetThe Board of Directors proposes that no dividend be paid for the financial year 2021.Item 8 - Establishment of the number of Directors of the Board and auditorsThe Nomination Committee has proposed that the number of Directors of the Board shall be five.Item 9 - Determination of the fees to be paid to the Directors of the Board and the company's auditorThe Nomination Committee proposes that remuneration to Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting who are not employees of the Group (none of the nominated Board members are employed by the Company) will be paid in the following amounts: SEK 750 000 to each of the Chairman of the Board and the deputy Chairman of the Board (unchanged)  SEK 400 000 to each of the additional three Board members. No specific remuneration is proposed for the work in the additional Committees.The Nomination Committee's proposal entails an increase in the Board's total fee of SEK 500 000 which means that the fee is at the same level as in 2020. The cost for the Company increases because a previous employed Director is proposed to be replaced by a non-employed Director. As the company's CEO is relatively new and a new CFO will soon take office  the Deputy Chairman of the Board is important for continuity  which justifies that his fee is in line with the fee to the Chairman of the Board. The Nomination Committee considers it justified that the three other members receive a fee of the same amount  as they each contribute with solid competence in their respective areas. The proposal also means that the special remuneration for work in the Audit Committee will cease. The increase in therenumeration to the Board would have been only SEK 100 000 if the resigning Board member had been paid as an external Board member.The Nomination Committee proposes that fees will be paid to the company's auditor according to approved account.Additional information on the Nomination Committee's proposals regarding remuneration is included in the Nomination Committee's statement  see below section ""Documentation"".Item 10 - Election of the Board of Directors  Chairman of the Board  Deputy Chairman of the Board and company auditorThe Nomination Committee proposes re-election of Christian Kinch  Thomas von Koch  Anna Martling and Jan Ståhlberg. The Nomination Committee proposes new election of Magdalena Persson. The Nomination Committee further proposes Thomas von Koch to be re-elected as Chairman of the Board and Christian Kinch be re-elected as Deputy Chairman of the Board.A report of the Nomination Committee's proposals and statement as well as information regarding all the proposed Directors are available on Bactiguard's website at www.bactiguard.com.The Nomination Committee further proposes  as recommended by the Audit Committee  the re-election of the registered accounting firm Deloitte AB as the Company's auditor for the period until the close of the next Annual General Meeting. Deloitte AB has provided notice that Therese Kjellberg will continue as auditor in charge.More information on the Nomination Committee's proposals regarding the Board of Directors and auditor is included in the Nomination Committee's statement  see below section ""Documentation"".Cecilia Edström has declined re-election. The Board fully agrees with the Nomination Committee's thanks to Cecilia Edström for her great long term efforts for Bactiguard (see the Nomination Committee's motivated opinion).Item 11 - Presentation and resolution of the remuneration reportThe Board of Directors has compiled a remuneration report and proposes to the AGM to approve the report. The remuneration report is included in the supporting resolution documentation which are held available ahead of the AGM according to the information below.Item 12 - Resolution to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve to issue new shares  warrants or convertible loansThe Board of Director proposes that the AGM resolves to authorize the Board of Director to  within the limits of the articles of association  until the next AGM  on one or more occasions  resolve to make an issue of shares  warrants and/or convertible loans according to following principles.The issue may take place with or without deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights.

The network had quickly grown to become one of the top decentralized finance (DeFi’0 contenders in the space  surpassing well-established and popular networks like the Binance Smart Chain (BSC). While Terra’s growth has come from its unique staking offerings to users  it has also received a significant boost from its decision to add Bitcoin to its treasury.Terra Buys BitcoinTerra had announced that it planned to purchase Bitcoin to serve as the reserve currency for the network and by the admission of founder Do Kwon  the network had already begun purchasing bitcoin before the announcement. Terra’s move to make the digital asset the default reserve up to the tune of more than $1 billion had drawn more attention to the network and with the buying spree  the network has seen even more interest.Related Reading | Fnality Venture Funds Euroclear To Embrace Strategy For Digital Ledger TechnologyOne of the ways these have been apparent has been how fast the TVL has been growing. The decision to purchase bitcoin was announced last week and in this time  the network’s TVL has grown to more than $2 billion.When the announcement was made  the total TVL on the Terra network was around $26 billion. Less than two weeks later  this number has grown as high as $28.7 billion  reaching a new all-time high.With this value  Terra sits in front of big players in the space like BSC  Avalanche  Solana  and Fantom. The total value locked of $28.7 billion puts it in second place  behind Ethereum  which remains the biggest DeFi platform to date.LUNA trading at $104 | Source: LUNAUSD on TradingView.comThis comes after it was confirmed that the Luna Foundation Guard’s bitcoin wallet now holds a whopping 24 954.95 BTC  which was valued at $1.1 billion. On-chain data showed that the foundation’s wallet had made large purchases in the days following the founder’s announcement. A decision that Kwon explained was because “Bitcoin is the only hard reserve asset that’s been proven out of the digital currencies.”Related Reading | Wasabi’s Side Of The Story: Reasons For Blacklisting Certain BTC From CoinJoinFollowing the purchases  the price of LUNA  Terra’s native token  had also rallied  touching as high as $106. The Terra network continues to grow as more DeFi users move to leverage the opportunities provided by it.Anchor remains the most dominant protocol on the Terra network  accounting for 52.38% of all TVL as of the time of this writing.

By providing valuation estimates  they synthesize the current state of supply and demand;,"PARIS  March 30  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Traditional auction houses have been playing a launchpad role in NFT trading  but they could provide greater stability for this growing market. By providing valuation estimates  they synthesize the current state of supply and demand; by selling an NFT  they provide a reference price that is independent of the prices practiced on peer-to-peer platforms (like Opensea  Nifty Gateway  SuperRare  etc.). In other words  with their expertise and their temporization of the market  the auction houses may well have a stabilizing effect on the effervescent NFT market.thierry Ehrmann  CEO and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department: ""By preparing a sale  publishing a catalog several weeks in advance and by giving a range of estimates and guaranteeing the information long after adjudication  the auction house actually 'moderates' the NFT market. This does not prevent prices from soaring if demand is stronger than expected"".Despite the transparency of blockchain technology  there are plenty of anomalies on major NFT marketplaces. Whether it's fake accounts (like those that appeared around Takashi Murakami) or arbitrage opportunities (offered to those who manage to integrate the whitelists of the most coveted projects)  NFT sales platforms have seen a large number of highly aggressive strategies contributing to price volatility and a degree of instability.Takashi Murakami's 'overly' anticipated NFTsSince the announcement of his Flowers NFT project  Japanese artist Takashi Murakami (ranked 105th in our global ranking of artists by 2021 auction turnover  all periods of creation combined) has been the subject of numerous fraud attempts using Instagram and Twitter accounts with deliberately similar names  such as murekemi.flower2022. By inciting you to mint NFTs as quickly as possible (as most NFT drops do)  these fake projects try to make you buy instantly  without checking the legitimacy of the creator.It is clear that Murakami's NFT project is attracting interest from both traditional collectors and from the crypto community. However  it is looking increasingly likely that his Flowers NFTs will not be launched until around the time of his solo show at the Gagosian in New York  scheduled for May 2022. We will therefore have to wait a little longer than was initially expected to buy into Murakami's digital Flowers.https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2022/takashi-murakami/Unfortunately  the lack of clarity that currently exists on NFT marketplaces as well as on social media is generating a large number of scams. Almost all of today's most famous NFT projects have replicas circulating in large numbers on Opensea. This situation could be improved by a more active presence of stabilizing agents such as auction houses in the NFT ecosystem.At lastâ¦ a genuine reference priceOf the 10 000 items in the World of Women collection  only one copy went to public auction. Estimated between $400 000 and $665 000 by Christie's  Woman #5672 was sold on 1 March 2022 in London for $600 000 (to which a 26% buyer's fees was added  bringing the total purchase price to $755 000).The value of this work fitted perfectly with the estimate provided by the auction house Christie's. However  the price of this NFT has been very volatile: barely six months ago  Woman #5672 was acquired for $117 000 (37.95 eth) on the OpenSea platform  and the best offer for this NFT is today $70 000 (20 eth).https://opensea.io/assets/0xe785e82358879f061bc3dcac6f0444462d4b5330/5672Because it was outside the blockchain  data relating to Christie's sale does not appear in the work's activity log on OpenSea. On the other hand  the identity (or rather the pseudonym) of the buyer of Woman #5672 has been revealed by Opensea: it is the moonpay.eth account. In this way  the OpenSea platform and Christie's auction house both provide two complementary bits of information.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/03/image1-Abdoulaye-Barry-Globule-Blanc-2022.jpg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comfor your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.com Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

1873,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.metro.us/russia-launches-eurobond-rouble/,Russia launches Eurobond rouble buyback offer on looming $2 billion bond payment – Metro US,Russia has offered to buy back dollar bonds maturing next week in roubles in a move seen by analysts as helping local holders of the $2 billion sovereign issue receive payment  while also easing the country’s hard-currency repayment burden.,LONDON (Reuters) -Russia has offered to buy back dollar bonds maturing next week in roubles in a move seen by analysts as helping local holders of the $2 billion sovereign issue receive payment  while also easing the country’s hard-currency repayment burden.The finance ministry offer on Eurobonds maturing on April 4  Russia’s biggest debt payment this year  follows Western moves to tighten sanctions against the country over its invasion of Ukraine and to freeze Moscow out of international finance.Moscow  which calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation”  says Western measures amount to “economic war”. In response  it has introduced countermeasures and has demanded foreign firms pay for Russian gas in roubles rather than dollars or euros.The bonds – issued in 2012 – would be bought at a price equivalent to 100% of their nominal value  the ministry said its statement. Buying back bonds will reduce the overall size of the outstanding bond when it matures on April 4.However  it was not immediately clear if the amount the government would buy back was limited or what would happen to holdings of creditors that would not tender their bonds.The terms of the bond prescribe that repayment has to occur in dollars. Repaying at maturity in roubles might again raise the prospect of Russia’s first external sovereign default in a century.Analysts and investors said the move was likely designed to help Russian holders who now face restrictions in receiving dollar payments.“This is a tender offer and not a final decision that these bonds will be paid in roubles. Perhaps  Russian authorities want to gauge investors’ willingness to accept payment in roubles?” said Seaport Global credit analyst Himanshu Porwal.Tim Ash of BlueBay Asset Management  which is not a bondholder  said the move was part of a fight back by Russia’s central bank and finance ministry “to fend off default and stabilise markets and the rouble”.Ash said the United States’ Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)  which enforces U.S. sanctions  “should make clear” it will not extend a deadline of May 25 for U.S. individuals or entities to receive payments on Russian sovereign bonds.Russia’s finance ministry said in its statement on Tuesday that bondholders should submit requests to sell their holdings to the National Settlement Depository between 1300 GMT on March 29 and 1400 GMT on March 30.SECURING PAYMENTA fund manager said the ministry’s offer might be designed to help Russian investors secure payment because Euroclear  an international settlement system  had been blocking dollar payments to the Russian clearing system.“Everybody wants dollars right now – in and outside Russia – so I would assume that only local holders and local banks that have issues with sanctions will make use of this operation ” said Kaan Nazli  portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman  which recently reduced its exposure to Russian sovereign debt.Nazli  who said he had not previously seen a buyback that switched the repayment currency  added that foreign investors were unlikely to be interested given the rouble “is no longer a convertible currency.”The rouble initially crumbled after the West imposed sanctions  plunging as much as 40% in value against the dollar since the start of 2022. It has since recovered and was trading down about 10% in Moscow on Tuesday.The finance ministry did not provide a breakdown of foreign and Russian holders of the Eurobond-2022.

We apologize  but this video has failed to load.tap here to see other videos from our team. Try refreshing your browser  or Russia launches Eurobond rouble buyback offer on looming $2 bln bond payment Back to video The finance ministry offer on Eurobonds maturing on April 4  Russia’s biggest debt payment this year  follows Western moves to tighten sanctions against the country over its invasion of Ukraine and to freeze Moscow out of international finance.Advertisement 2 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet  but your article continues below.Article content Moscow  which calls its actions in Ukraine a “special military operation ” says Western measures amount to “economic war.” In response  it has introduced countermeasures and has demanded foreign firms pay for Russian gas in roubles rather than dollars or euros. The bonds – issued in 2012 – would be bought at a price equivalent to 100% of their nominal value  the ministry said its statement. Buying back bonds will reduce the overall size of the outstanding bond when it matures on April 4. However  it was not immediately clear if the amount the government would buy back was limited or what would happen to holdings of creditors that would not tender their bonds. The terms of the bond prescribe that repayment has to occur in dollars. Repaying at maturity in roubles might again raise the prospect of Russia’s first external sovereign default in a century.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet  but your article continues below.Article content Analysts and investors said the move was likely designed to help Russian holders who now face restrictions in receiving dollar payments. “This is a tender offer and not a final decision that these bonds will be paid in roubles. Perhaps  Russian authorities want to gauge investors’ willingness to accept payment in roubles?” said Seaport Global credit analyst Himanshu Porwal. Tim Ash of BlueBay Asset Management  which is not a bondholder  said the move was part of a fight back by Russia’s central bank and finance ministry “to fend off default and stabilize markets and the rouble.” Ash said the United States’ Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC)  which enforces U.S. sanctions  “should make clear” it will not extend a deadline of May 25 for U.S. individuals or entities to receive payments on Russian sovereign bonds.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet  but your article continues below.Article content Russia’s finance ministry said in its statement on Tuesday that bondholders should submit requests to sell their holdings to the National Settlement Depository between 1300 GMT on March 29 and 1400 GMT on March 30. SECURING PAYMENT A fund manager said the ministry’s offer might be designed to help Russian investors secure payment because Euroclear  an international settlement system  had been blocking dollar payments to the Russian clearing system. “Everybody wants dollars right now – in and outside Russia – so I would assume that only local holders and local banks that have issues with sanctions will make use of this operation ” said Kaan Nazli  portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman  which recently reduced its exposure to Russian sovereign debt.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet  but your article continues below.Article content Nazli  who said he had not previously seen a buyback that switched the repayment currency  added that foreign investors were unlikely to be interested given the rouble “is no longer a convertible currency.” The rouble initially crumbled after the West imposed sanctions  plunging as much as 40% in value against the dollar since the start of 2022. It has since recovered and was trading down about 10% in Moscow on Tuesday. The finance ministry did not provide a breakdown of foreign and Russian holders of the Eurobond-2022. It did not respond to a request about how much of the outstanding $2 billion it wanted to buy back or what would happen if investors refused the offer. The bond has a 30-day grace period and no provisions for payments in alternative currencies  JPMorgan said.Advertisement 6 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet  but your article continues below.Article content According to Refinitiv database eMAXX  which analyzes public filings  major asset managers such as Brandywine  Axa  Morgan Stanley Investment Management  BlackRock were recently among the holders of the bond coming due on April 4.

Its not very compact and you may not be able to grab as many channels as you could with more powerful models - but  if you’re relatively close to town  the Clearstream Flex should be more than enough for you.The Antennas Direct Clearstream Flex indoor antenna offers rock-solid 50-mile radius reception for local digital channels at a lower price than some of its competitors. Its not very compact and you may not be able to grab as many channels as you could with more powerful models - but  if you’re relatively close to town  the Clearstream Flex should be more than enough for you.30-second reviewAntennas Direct now owns rival OTA antenna retailer Mohu  but that hasn’t stopped the company from putting out some strong HD indoor antennas of its own. For example  you need look no further than the new Antennas Direct Clearstream Flex.Offering up a 50-mile radius of coverage and powered by an in-line power injector  the Flex is able to deliver much of your area’s local channels in clear HD without much of a struggle.For first-time HD antenna owners  Antennas Direct encourages you to download the free Antenna Point app that shows you where cable stations are geographically  and can then help you point your antenna in the right direction for the best possible signal.There are a few sticking points that we don’t love about the antenna including its window-filling size and potential to pull in fewer channels than other stronger models - but overall these are minor points that don’t mar the performance of this above-par antenna.DesignLike the Mohu Leaf Supreme Pro that we've reviewed previously  the Flex is a large  flat digital antenna that has a white side and a black side that can help it blend in with your living room décor. It’s best placed next to or on a window with direct visibility to the outside world  though you can place it up in an attic if you want to split the signal to go to multiple rooms.At 12x16 inches (LxW) it’s not exactly the most inconspicuous antenna we’ve yet to test - which some design-conscious folks may take umbrage with - but its massive footprint does help it pull in more channels when it’s positioned correctly.How will you know if it's in the right position  you ask? Antennas Direct actually offers an app called Antenna Point on iOS and Android that allows you to see where TV broadcasters are in your area and help point your antenna in the right direction. Once you’ve got your antenna placed in the right spot  then you can run a scan on your TV to lock in the stations.Also  like the Mohu Leaf Supreme Pro  the Flex comes with an in-line power injector that can strengthen the reception of your antenna. Depending on your proximity to broadcasters  you may not actually need it  and thankfully Antennas Direct built an on/off switch into the injector to turn it off should you find it unnecessary.Last but not least  to connect the antenna to the injector - or directly to your TV - the Flex comes with a 12-foot detachable coaxial cable. That length of wire should give you plenty of slack to reach the windows from a TV - and it feels like a premium addition compared to cheaper models that only come with a one-to-two foot coaxial cord.(Image credit: Antennas Direct)PerformanceThe overall performance of the Clearstream Flex is middling: with previous HD antennas we were able to pull in around 54 digital channels based on where we live but  by contrast  the Flex could only pull in around 48 of those channels  though we felt many of them came in just as well as with other  more-powerful models.According to Antennas Direct  the Flex has around a 50-mile radius when using the power booster. That’s a real step up compared to the cheaper 30-mile radius antenna that we were using previously - but even that was able to pull in all 54 channels we’ve seen previously.The good news is that in terms of strength and clarity  most of the channels looked great. We counted 42 channels that were good clarity  over half of which were in HD. Eventually  some of those will switch over to 4K when more ATSC 3.0 stations become available.Of course  your miles will vary in the performance department depending on how far away from broadcasters you live. Folks like us who live just a few miles outside of town in the suburbs should have no problems pulling in clear signals. However  if you’re much further out - say in a rural area between two major metropolitan cities - you won’t have as much luck. If you’re in the latter camp you may need something even stronger  like an outdoor amplified antenna instead of this basic indoor unit.Should you buy the Antennas Direct Clearstream Flex?(Image credit: Antennas Direct)Buy it if...You’re not sure where TV broadcasters are in your areaWith the Antenna Point app it’s incredibly easy to see where broadcasters are in your area and how to best place your antenna to get the best reception.You need something in between something cheap and a top-end modelLook  not everyone needs the most powerful antenna - especially if you’re living close to a major metropolitan area.

In particular  the LuxSE operates:the main regulated market – an EU-regulated market named Bourse de Luxembourg (BdL); andthe exchange regulated market  called the Euro MTF market.Currently  no OTF has been established in Luxembourg.Post-trading activities are cleared via LCH.Clearnet SA  which acts as central counterparty within the meaning of the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (648/2012) (EMIR)  and are settled through Euroclear Bank and Clearstream Banking SA. The settlement process is carried out by securities settlement systems (SSSs)  which enable the securities to be transferred and settled by book entry. An SSS is operated by a central securities depository (CSD) pursuant to the EU CSD Regulation (909/2014). CSDs may provide securities accounts  central safekeeping services and asset services. There are two CSDs established in Luxembourg:LuxCSD SA; andClearstream Banking SA  which also acts as international CSD.2.2 What are the main exchanges and other trading venues in your jurisdiction? What are the key differences between those various trading venues?The LuxSE operates the BdL market and the Euro MTF market. The main difference between these two markets is that far less stringent disclosure requirements apply to issuers whose securities are admitted to trading on the Euro MTF market. In particular  the Euro MTF market is outside the scope of the EU Prospectus Regulation and the EU Transparency Directive. As a consequence  a prospectus prepared in connection with a securities admission to trading on the Euro MTF market is not eligible for the European passport for the prospectus documentation  which is very useful when an issuer intends to offer securities in more than one EU member state. In addition  the LuxSE is responsible for the review and approval of a prospectus for an admission to the Euro MTF market pursuant to its Rules and Regulations; whereas for an admission to the BdL market  the competent authority responsible for the approval of a prospectus based on the EU Prospectus Regulation is the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF).In addition to the BdL market and the Euro MTF market  the LuxSE offers issuers the possibility to register their securities in the LuxSE Securities Official List (SOL)  without admission to trading in order to provide for enhanced visibility for investors. The SOL is not subject to regulation related to admission to trading and also gives access to the Luxembourg Green Exchange (LGX)  a platform dedicated exclusively to the exchange of green securities.2.3 What kinds of securities does your jurisdiction provide for (eg  electronic securities)?Under Luxembourg law  securities may be issued in bearer  dematerialised or registered form.2.4 Is it mandatory to deposit securities with a (local) CSD (eg  for listing)?According to the EU CSD Regulation  where a transaction in transferable securities takes place on a trading venue  the relevant securities must be recorded in book-entry form in a CSD in order to ensure that all such securities can be settled in an SSS.An issuer can arrange for its securities admitted to trading on regulated markets or MTFs or traded on trading venues to be recorded in any CSD established in any EU member state  subject to compliance by that CSD with conditions referred to in Article 23 of the EU CSD Regulation.2.5 Are there rules in place governing crypto-assets and crypto-infrastructure (eg  crypto-exchanges  local crypto-money)?There is currently no legal framework in Luxembourg that specifically applies to crypto-currencies. However  the CSSF has acknowledged that the raising of funds from the public in the form of an initial coin offering may fall within the ambit of certain rules and regulations  such as the EU Prospectus Regulation  depending on the nature of the tokens issued. In addition  the services provided by crypto-exchanges – that is  platforms which allow the conversion of crypto-currencies to fiat money or to other digital currencies and vice versa – are considered by the CSSF as financial services and as such are subject to ministerial authorisation in order to conduct their business in Luxembourg. Currently  there are two crypto-currency exchanges licensed in Luxembourg and which are therefore subject to the supervision of the CSSF: Bitstamp  a bitcoin exchange  and bitFlyer.In general  Luxembourg law is continually modernised in order to keep up with technological innovations such as distributed ledger technology (DLT) as the underlying technology for crypto-currencies. For instance  the Luxembourg legislature recently introduced the laws of 1 March 2019 and 22 January 2021  which  among other things  allow dematerialised securities to be issued  held and maintained with secured electronic registration systems such as a DLT or in databases managed by settlement organisations or central account keepers.2.6 Are special rules in place for crowdfunding products?Currently  there are no specific crowdfunding rules in Luxembourg. However  the EU Crowdfunding Regulation (2020/1503) and EU Directive 2020/1504 amending Directive 2014/65/EU linked to the EU Crowdfunding Regulation were published in the Official Journal of the European Union in October 2020. The EU Crowdfunding Regulation  which applies as of 10 November 2021  sets out detailed rules on:financial products marketed on crowdfunding platforms;crowdfunding services; andthe authorisation and supervision of crowdfunding service providers for the purpose of creating an EU passport that would facilitate and foster cross-border funding of businesses.2.7 What kinds of databases are available on instruments issued and traded in your jurisdiction  and how can they be accessed?The LuxSE affords the public free access to a centralised database in which various documents relevant to issued securities are available  such as prospectuses  financial statements and other information relating to issuers. In addition  the LuxSE recently launched the LGX DataHub  which is a centralised database on green securities which can be accessed only upon payment.The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter.

See “Supplemental Plan of Distribution” in this pricing supplement.BMO CAPITAL MARKETSSPECIFIC TERMS OF THE NOTESThe Notes are part of a series of our senior debt securities called Senior Medium-Term Notes  Series G  and therefore  this pricing supplement (the “pricing supplement”)  should be read together with the accompanying prospectus supplement  dated May 27  2021 and the accompanying prospectus  dated April 20  2020. Terms used but not defined in this pricing supplement have the meanings given them in the accompanying prospectus or accompanying prospectus supplement  unless the context requires otherwise.In this section  references to “holders” mean those who own the Notes registered in their own names  on the books that we or the trustee maintain for this purpose  and not those who own beneficial interests in the Notes registered in street name or in the Notes issued in book-entry form through The Depository Trust Company or another depositary. Owners of beneficial interests in the Notes should read the section entitled “Description of the Notes We May Offer — Legal Ownership” in the accompanying prospectus supplement and “Description of Debt Securities We May Offer — Legal Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance” in the accompanying prospectus.The Notes are part of a series of senior debt securities entitled “Senior Medium-Term Notes  Series G” (the “medium-term notes”) that we may issue from time to time under the senior indenture  dated January 25  2010  as amended and supplemented to date  between Bank of Montreal and The Bank of New York Mellon  as trustee. This pricing supplement summarizes specific financial and other terms that apply to the Notes. Terms that apply generally to our medium-term notes are described in “Description of the Notes We May Offer” in the accompanying prospectus supplement. The terms described herein supplement those described in the accompanying prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement  and  if the terms described here are inconsistent with those described in those documents  the terms described herein are controlling.The Notes are bail-inable notes (as defined in the accompanying prospectus supplement) and subject to conversion in whole or in part – by means of a transaction or series of transactions and in one or more steps – into common shares of Bank of Montreal or any of its affiliates under subsection 39.2(2.3) of the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act (the “CDIC Act”) and to variation or extinguishment in consequence  and subject to the application of the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein in respect of the operation of the CDIC Act with respect to the Notes.Please note that the information about the price to the public and the net proceeds to Bank of Montreal on the front cover of this pricing supplement relates only to the initial sale of the Notes. If you have purchased the Notes in a market-making transaction after the initial sale  information about the price and date of sale to you will be provided in a separate confirmation of sale.We describe particular terms of the Notes in more detail below.InterestThe Notes will bear interest at the rate set forth on the cover page.Interest will be paid on the Interest Payment Dates set forth on the cover page of this pricing supplement. Interest payments will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year  consisting of twelve 30-day months. Interest will be payable to holders of record on the 3rd business day before each Interest Payment Date. Interest will accrue from and including each Interest Payment Date to but excluding the next Interest Payment Date. In the event that an Interest Payment Date  Redemption Date or the Stated Maturity falls on a day other than a business day  principal and/or interest will be paid on the next succeeding business day and no interest on such payment shall accrue for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date  Redemption Date or Stated Maturity  as the case may be  to such next succeeding business day.P- 2Optional Redemption FeatureWe may  at our option  elect to redeem the Notes in whole or in part on each Redemption Date (as defined above)  at 100% of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to but excluding the date on which the Notes are redeemed. In the event we elect to redeem the Notes  notice will be given to registered holders not more than 30 nor less than five business days prior to the Redemption Date.Agreement with Respect to the Exercise of Canadian Bail-in PowersBy its acquisition of an interest in any Note  each holder or beneficial owner of that Note is deemed to (i) agree to be bound  in respect of that Note  by the CDIC Act  including the conversion of that Note  in whole or in part – by means of a transaction or series of transactions and in one or more steps – into common shares of Bank of Montreal or any of its affiliates under subsection 39.2(2.3) of the CDIC Act and the variation or extinguishment of that Note in consequence  and by the application of the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein in respect of the operation of the CDIC Act with respect to that Note; (ii) attorn and submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in the Province of Ontario with respect to the CDIC Act and those laws; and (iii) acknowledge and agree that the terms referred to in paragraphs (i) and (ii)  above  are binding on that holder or beneficial owner despite any provisions in the indenture or that Note  any other law that governs that Note and any other agreement  arrangement or understanding between that holder or beneficial owner and Bank of Montreal with respect to that Note.Holders and beneficial owners of any Note will have no further rights in respect of that Note to the extent that Note is converted in a bail-in conversion  other than those provided under the bail-in regime  and by its acquisition of an interest in any Note  each holder or beneficial owner of that Note is deemed to irrevocably consent to the converted portion of the principal amount of that Note and any accrued and unpaid interest thereon being deemed paid in full by Bank of Montreal by the issuance of common shares of Bank of Montreal (or  if applicable  any of its affiliates) upon the occurrence of a bail-in conversion  which bail-in conversion will occur without any further action on the part of that holder or beneficial owner or the trustee; provided that  for the avoidance of doubt  this consent will not limit or otherwise affect any rights that holders or beneficial owners may have under the bail-in regime.See “Description of the Notes We May Offer — Special Provisions Related to Bail-inable Notes” in the accompanying prospectus supplement for a description of provisions applicable to the Notes as a result of Canadian bail-in powers.Certain Investment ConsiderationsOptional Redemption. Prospective purchasers should be aware that we have the right to redeem the Notes on any Redemption Date  beginning on the first Redemption Date. It is more likely that we will redeem the Notes prior to their stated maturity date to the extent that the interest payable on the Notes is greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments of the issuer of a comparable maturity  terms and credit rating trading in the market. If the Notes are redeemed prior to their stated maturity date  you may have to re-invest the proceeds in a lower interest rate environment. See “—Optional Redemption Feature.”Credit Risk. Our credit ratings and credit spreads may adversely affect the market value of the Notes. Investors are dependent on our ability to pay all amounts due on the Notes on each interest payment date and at maturity  and therefore investors are subject to our credit risk and to changes in the market’s view of our creditworthiness. Any decline in our credit ratings or increase in the credit spreads charged by the market for taking our credit risk is likely to adversely affect the value of the Notes.Fees and Hedging Costs. While the payment at maturity described in this pricing supplement is based on the full principal amount of your Notes  the original offering price of the Notes includes the commission received by BMOCM and other dealers and the cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes. As a result  the price  if any  at which BMOCM may be willing to purchase Notes from you in secondary market transactions will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes  and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.P- 3SUPPLEMENTAL TAX CONSIDERATIONSThe following is a general description of material tax considerations relating to the Notes. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisers as to the consequences under the tax laws of the country of which they are resident for tax purposes and the tax laws of Canada and the U.S. of acquiring  holding and disposing of the Notes and receiving payments under the Notes. This summary is based upon the law as in effect on the date of this pricing supplement and is subject to any change in law that may take effect after such date.Supplemental Canadian Tax ConsiderationsFor a discussion of the Canadian federal income tax considerations relating to an investment in the notes  please see the section of the prospectus supplement  “Certain Income Tax Consequences—Certain Canadian Income Tax Considerations.”The accompanying prospectus notes that a Holder will not be subject to tax under the Tax Act on any capital gain realized on a disposition or deemed disposition of shares  unless the shares are “taxable Canadian property” to the Holder for purposes of the Tax Act and the Holder is not entitled to relief under an applicable income tax convention between Canada and the country in which the Holder is resident.Generally  the shares will not constitute taxable Canadian property to a Holder at a particular time provided that the shares are listed at that time on a designated stock exchange (which includes the Toronto Stock Exchange)  unless at any particular time during the 60-month period that ends at that time (1) the Holder  persons with whom the Holder does not deal with at arm’s length  and partnerships in which the Holder or persons with whom the Holder does not deal at arm’s length holds a membership interest directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships  or the Holder together with all such persons and partnerships  has owned 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of our capital stock and (2) more than 50% of the fair market value of the shares was derived directly or indirectly from one or any combination of: (i) real or immovable properties situated in Canada  (ii) “Canadian resource properties” (as defined in the Tax Act)  (iii) “timber resource properties” (as defined in the Tax Act)  and (iv) options in respect of  or interests in  or for civil law rights in  property in any of the foregoing whether or not the property exists. Notwithstanding the foregoing  in certain circumstances set out in the Tax Act  shares could be deemed to be taxable Canadian property. Holders whose shares may constitute taxable Canadian property should consult their own tax advisors.Supplemental U.S. Tax ConsiderationsThe following section supplements the discussion of U.S. federal income taxation in the accompanying prospectus and prospectus supplement with respect to United States holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus). It applies only to those United States holders who are not excluded from the discussion of U.S. federal income taxation in the accompanying prospectus. It does not apply to holders subject to special rules including holders subject to Section 451(b) of the Code. For purposes of this discussion  any interest with respect to the Notes  as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes  will be treated as from sources outside the United States.You should consult your tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax and other tax consequences of your investment in the Notes in your particular circumstances  including the application of state  local or other tax laws and the possible effects of changes in federal or other tax laws.Backup Withholding and Information ReportingPlease see the discussion under “United States Federal Income Taxation — Backup Withholding and Information Reporting” in the accompanying prospectus for a description of the applicability of the backup withholding and information reporting rules to payments made on your Notes.P- 4Foreign Account Tax Compliance ActThe Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act imposes a 30% U.S. withholding tax on certain U.S. source payments  including interest (and OID)  dividends  other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gain  profits  and income (“Withholdable Payments”)  if paid to a foreign financial institution (including amounts paid to a foreign financial institution on behalf of a holder)  unless such institution enters into an agreement with the Treasury Department to collect and provide to the Treasury Department substantial information regarding U.S. account holders  including certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners  with such institution. A Note may constitute an account for these purposes. The legislation also generally imposes a withholding tax of 30% on Withholdable Payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or a certification identifying the direct and indirect substantial U.S. owners of the entity.The U.S. Treasury Department has proposed regulations that eliminate the requirement of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act withholding on payments of gross proceeds upon the sale or disposition of financial instruments. The U.S. Treasury Department has indicated that taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations pending their finalization  and the discussion above assumes the proposed regulations will be finalized in their proposed form with retroactive effect.If we (or an applicable withholding agent) determine withholding is appropriate with respect to the Notes  we (or such agent) will withhold tax at the applicable statutory rate  and we will not pay any additional amounts in respect of such withholding. Account holders subject to information reporting requirements pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act may include holders of the Notes. Foreign financial institutions and non-financial foreign entities located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act may be subject to different rules. Holders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in the Notes.P- 5EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACTA fiduciary of a pension  profit-sharing or other employee benefit plan subject to the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  as amended (“ERISA”) (each  a “Plan”)  should consider the fiduciary standards of ERISA in the context of the Plan’s particular circumstances before authorizing an investment in the Notes. Among other factors  the fiduciary should consider whether the investment would satisfy the prudence and diversification requirements of ERISA and would be consistent with the documents and instruments governing the Plan  and whether the investment would involve a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Plans  as well as individual retirement accounts  Keogh plans and any other plans that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code (also “Plans”)  from engaging in certain transactions involving “plan assets” with persons who are “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code with respect to the Plan. A violation of these prohibited transaction rules may result in excise tax or other liabilities under ERISA or the Code for those persons  unless exemptive relief is available under an applicable statutory  regulatory or administrative exemption. Employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA)  certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) (“Non-ERISA Arrangements”) are not subject to the requirements of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to similar provisions under applicable federal  state  local  non-U.S. or other laws (“Similar Laws”).The acquisition of Notes by a Plan or any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of any Plan’s investment in the entity (a “Plan Asset Entity”) with respect to which we or certain of our affiliates is or becomes a party in interest or disqualified person may result in a prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code  unless the Notes are acquired pursuant to an applicable exemption. The U.S. Department of Labor has issued five prohibited transaction class exemptions  or “PTCEs”  that may provide exemptive relief if required for direct or indirect prohibited transactions that may arise from the purchase or holding of Notes. These exemptions are PTCE 84-14 (for certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers)  PTCE 90-1 (for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts)  PTCE 91-38 (for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds)  PTCE 95-60 (for transactions involving certain insurance company general accounts)  and PTCE 96-23 (for transactions managed by in-house asset managers). In addition  ERISA Section 408(b)(17) and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide an exemption for the purchase and sale of securities offered hereby  provided that neither the issuer of securities offered hereby nor any of its affiliates have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Plan involved in the transaction  and provided further that the Plan pays no more and receives no less than “adequate consideration” in connection with the transaction (the “service provider exemption”). There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.Any purchaser or holder of Notes or any interest therein will be deemed to have represented by its purchase and holding of Notes offered hereby that it either (1) is not a Plan  a Plan Asset Entity or a Non-ERISA Arrangement and is not purchasing the Notes on behalf of or with the assets of any Plan  a Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement or (2) the purchase and holding of the Notes will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions  it is important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing Notes on behalf of or with the assets of any Plan  a Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement consult with their counsel regarding the availability of exemptive relief under any of the PTCEs listed above  the service provider exemption or the potential consequences of any purchase or holding under Similar Laws  as applicable. Purchasers of Notes have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of Notes do not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or any similar provisions of Similar Laws. The sale of any Notes to a Plan  Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement is in no respect a representation by us or any of our affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any such Plans  Plan Asset Entities or Non-ERISA Arrangements generally or any particular Plan  Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement or that such investment is appropriate for such Plans  Plan Asset Entities or Non-ERISA Arrangements generally or any particular Plan  Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement.P- 6SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)BMOCM will purchase the Notes from us on the settlement date at prices as specified on the cover page of this pricing supplement. BMOCM has informed us that  as part of its distribution of the Notes  it will reoffer the Notes to other dealers who will sell them at the original offering price. Each such dealer  or further dealer engaged by a dealer to whom BMOCM reoffers the Notes  will purchase the Notes at an agreed discount to the initial offering price.We own  directly or indirectly  all of the outstanding equity securities of BMOCM  the agent for this offering. In accordance with FINRA Rule 5121  BMOCM may not make sales in this offering to any of its discretionary accounts without the prior written approval of the customer.We reserve the right to withdraw  cancel or modify the offering of any of the Notes and to reject orders in whole or in part. You may cancel any order for the Notes prior to its acceptance.You should not construe the offering of any of the Notes as a recommendation as to the suitability of an investment in the Notes.BMOCM may  but is not obligated to  make a market in the Notes. BMOCM will determine any secondary market prices that it is prepared to offer in its sole discretion.We may use this pricing supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition  BMOCM or another of our affiliates may use this pricing supplement in market-making transactions in any Notes after their initial sale. Unless BMOCM or we inform you otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this pricing supplement is being used by BMOCM in a market-making transaction.Each of BMOCM and any other broker-dealer offering the Notes have not offered  sold or otherwise made available and will not offer  sell or otherwise make available any of the Notes to  any retail investor in the European Economic Area (“EEA”). For these purposes  the expression “offer” includes the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Notes to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe the Notes  and a “retail investor” means a person who is one (or more) of: (a) a retail client  as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive (EU) 2014/65 (as amended  “MiFID II”); or (b) a customer  within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97  as amended  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (c) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) No 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently  no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended  the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared  and therefore  offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.Each of BMOCM and any other broker-dealer offering the Notes have not offered  sold or otherwise made available and will not offer  sell or otherwise make available any of the Notes to  any retail investor in the United Kingdom. For these purposes  a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client  as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the ""FSMA"") and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client  as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the ""UK PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation.P-7",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.02,0.25,0.73,True,English,"['Form 424B2 BANK', 'MONTREAL', 'CAN', 'United States Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation', 'Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act', 'BMO Capital Markets Corp.', 'The Depository Trust Company', 'Redeemable Fixed Coupon Notes', 'Original Public Offering Price', 'Deposit Insurance Fund', 'early redemption right', '06368GNV5 Optional Redemption', 'Optional Redemption Feature', 'other governmental agency', 'Original Issue Date', 'preliminary pricing supplement', 'Senior Medium-Term Notes', 'Interest Payment Period', 'Interest Payment Dates', 'final interest payment', 'state securities commission', 'accompanying prospectus supplement', 'Issue Price', 'federal laws', 'CDIC Act', 'Exchange Commission', 'other entity', 'Redemption Date', 'Registration Statement', 'Specific Terms', 'Principal Amount', 'Specified Currency', 'Minimum Denomination', 'integral multiples', 'credit risk', 'indirect participants', 'Legal Ownership', 'Book-Entry Issuance', 'CUSIP No.', 'registered holders', '30 business days', 'five business', 'common shares', 'SEC website', 'sec.gov', 'Risk Factors', 'criminal offense', 'unsecured obligations', 'savings accounts', 'unpaid interest', 'Trade Date', 'relevant date', 'The Notes', 'Debt Securities', 'Bail-inable Notes', 'Series G', 'initial sale', 'market-making transactions', '100% Interest Rate', '2022 Settlement Date', 'information', 'jurisdiction', 'Rule', 'Completion', 'March', 'May', 'Issuer', 'Bank', 'Montreal', 'Title', 'Maturity', 'excess', 'Annum', 'arrears', 'September', 'year', 'postponement', 'Clearance', 'DTC', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'Description', 'Provision', 'June', 'December', 'event', 'notice', 'less', 'conversion', 'means', 'steps', 'affiliates', 'subsection', 'variation', 'extinguishment', 'consequence', 'application', 'Province', 'Ontario', 'respect', 'operation', 'documents', 'address', 'filings', 'Archives', 'edgar', 'data', 'April', 'risks', 'page', 'payments', 'accuracy', 'representation', 'contrary', 'deposits', 'instrumentality', 'facilities', 'addition', 'BMOCM', 'agent', 'confirmation']",2022-03-30,2022-03-30,streetinsider.com

1893,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/junkiest-loan-issuers-to-feel-pain-as-libor-blows-through-1-1.1744784,Junkiest Loan Issuers to Feel Pain as Libor Blows Through 1%,1 day ago,(Bloomberg) -- High-risk companies that tapped the $1.4 trillion U.S. leveraged loan market have been largely insulated from rising short-term rates. Now they’re about to feel the pain.A key lending benchmark  the three-month U.S. dollar London interbank offered rate  topped 1% on Tuesday  the highest since April 2020. That’s above the minimum level many junk-rated borrowers agreed to pay when calculating interest payments on their loans. So until recently  an increase in rates might not have had much real impact on these corporations  but now this expense will likely rise over time for most borrowers.Increases in these costs could push the weakest loan borrowers to the point where their businesses aren’t generating enough cash to cover all their expenses  known as negative free cash flow  said Steve Hasnain  who invests in leveraged loans at Pinebridge Investments. Many of these companies are already facing pressure from surging commodity and labor costs  he said.“It seems like the perfect storm ” Hasnain said. “The borrowers that were not generating a lot of free cash flow to begin with may actually go free cash flow negative in the near term.”These companies usually have credit ratings in the CCC tier  the lowest typically seen in loans. That ratings level  plus the levels below it  account for a little more than 5% of the roughly $1.4 trillion market  or about $72 billion worth  according to S&P Leveraged Commentary & Data based on the S&P/LSTA Leveraged Loan Index.These CCC rated companies have been generating just enough earnings to cover their interest expense  said Neha Khoda  head of loan strategy at Bank of America Corp. A growing economy may translate to higher earnings for these companies  covering some extra costs from rising interest rates  according to Khoda.“But in a stagflationary environment  the CCC issuers will be most at risk  and maybe to an extent B3 rated issuers as well ” Khoda said.Switching LiborsCompanies have a trick to avoid bearing the full brunt of rising rates: switching from three-month Libor to one-month  which was 0.46% on Tuesday.But even so  many companies will probably still have to pay higher rates in the coming months. About 24% of outstanding leveraged loans tied to Libor have contractual minimum rates of 0.5% for the benchmark. Another 18% of loans have floors of 0.75%  according to Barclays Plc. And around 12% have floors of 1%  while about 45% have floors of 0%. Corporations pay additional interest on top of the benchmark  known as a margin.For most companies in the leveraged loan market  rising rates won’t be catastrophic. Overall  companies in the space that are publicly listed are generating about four times as much earnings as their interest expense  based on a measure known as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  BofA’s Khoda said. If the Fed increases short-term rates by another 2.75 percentage points  after starting hiking rates earlier this month  that ratio will still be about three times on average  still a reasonable level  she said.The Federal Reserve has signaled six more hikes this year and that could mean a rapid increase in short term rates including Libor and the newer Secured Overnight Financing Rate. Most leveraged loan payments are structured as a margin above those rates.The market is in the middle of a transition away from Libor. The discredited benchmark could no longer be used in new deals starting in 2022  and most new loans have been issued with SOFR so far this year. About 85% of loans tied to the new benchmark have floors of 0.5 percentage points  with three-month term SOFR now at 0.65%  and one-month term SOFR standing at about 0.31%. But the bulk of existing loans still use Libor  which is due to be officially retired mid-2023.Tail RiskMany businesses have used the extra-easy money environment of the last two years to refinance debt at lower rates and push out maturities  said Jeff Darfus  a credit research analyst at Barclays Plc. Plus  the most stressed borrowers defaulted in 2020  and the stronger companies survived  leaving the market on relatively good footing.“Generally  these companies will be able to handle the beginning of these increases in interest expense and then that obviously just comes down to what’s happening with growth ” he said.But the overall improvement in corporate credit fundamentals is not mirrored in lower-rated leveraged loans  according to a recent report by UBS Group AG strategists led by Matthew Mish. “The key risk is rising funding costs and slowing growth could reinvigorate CCC downgrade fears ” they wrote.The Fed’s efforts to clamp down on inflation mean that rates are rising faster than in previous cycles. By the end of 2022  JPMorgan Chase & Co forecasts that three-month Libor will be around 2.25%  and one-month trailing average SOFR will stand at roughly 1.65%.Elsewhere in credit markets:AmericasFour companies  including HP Inc.  are borrowing in the U.S. investment-grade corporate bond market on Tuesday.Morgan Stanley’s Head of U.S. and European Credit Strategy Srikanth Sankaran said a rally in equity and credit markets on optimism about progress in cease-fire talks between Russia and Ukraine is just a temporary blipU.S. bankruptcy courts saw three large filings last week  making March by far the busiest month so far this year for big insolvenciesFor deal updates  click here for the New Issue MonitorFor more  click here for the Credit Daybook AmericasEMEADeutsche Boerse AG and Caixabank SA are among the issuers that sold bonds on Tuesday.

1894,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.bollyinside.com/news/banks-demand-more-protection-against-new-risk-amid-volatility,Banks demand more protection against new risk amid volatility,23 hours ago,Buyout activity is getting pace in Europe  however various banks are adopting a wary approach to new risk  searching for higher valuing  more flex protection and in certain instances fuller fees on junk-rated debt endorses against a backdrop of heightened volatility  inflation and increasing rates. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine felled a positive beginning to the year by everything except closing Europe’s high-yield bond and leveraged-loan market  leaving banks sitting on $37 billion of existing endorses they have up to this point been unable to sell down.Some M&A situations are drawing to a conclusion including KKR & Co. nearing a deal for Spanish fertility clinic chain Ivirma Global and Carlyle Group Inc. and PAI Partners’ acquisition of women’s health business Theramex. Other processes are still in progress for the U.K’s drugstore chain Boots and Telecom Italia.The assumption is that banks will attempt to sell a lot of that following the Easter holiday weekend in mid-April  but an increase in potential M&A deals means many have also been asked to commit to new debt financings.To win a bid  a buyer has to have committed debt financing in place. In an unusual scenario  but one that will become increasingly common  KKR has committed debt financing from both private credit and banks for Ivirma.Sponsors are increasingly conducting dual-track financing between direct lenders and banks  with private credit stepping in to fill a void as banks err on the side of caution amid this year’s volatility.Dual-Track FinancingA decision is expected in the next couple of weeks on which financing route KKR opts for  but a lot of it will come down to price.Pricing is around 50-100 basis points wider than at the start of the year in Europe’s leveraged loan market. Whereas a B2-rated loan could expect to pay 375 basis points over Euribor in January  it has widened out now to anywhere between 425-475. The original issue discount  or OID  has also widened from 99.5 to anywhere from 98 upwards.Banks will also be expecting more flex protection on new underwrites  at around 150 basis points  instead of a typical 125. Banks could also want fuller fees than a typical 1.75% on a leveraged loan underwrite. Yields on single B euro bonds have also increased to 5.8% compared with 3.7% in January  according to Bloomberg Data.Bank Underwriting Banks may also want to reduce the proportion of an underwrite they take. Whereas at the start of the year they may have been willing to underwrite 100% of the risk  that could reduce to 50% or less  with bank groups expected to increase as a result.“In the past  given the competitiveness of the European market  banks would take on a decent proportion of the risk ” said Michael Curtis head of private credit strategies at Fidelity International. “Now banks could be less willing to take on as much risk and want more built-in protection on flex.” Private credit on the other hand will seek returns of a minimum 500 basis points  making it an attractive proposition for sponsors.EMEA Deutsche Boerse AG and Caixabank SA are among seven issuers offering new deals in the region’s primary market on Tuesday.

""Our clinical program evaluating first-in-class radioenhancer  NBTXR3  yielded compelling new data suggesting that our lead therapeutic candidate may improve treatment outcomes for patients both as a single-agent activated by radiotherapy for local diseases and as a combination therapy with anti-PD-1 for systemic disease. We also achieved the launch of our pivotal phase III study  NANORAY-312-a critical milestone as we advance toward global registration in head and neck cancer. 2022 has already seen the enrollment of our first European patients in NANORAY-312  and we expect the first patients in the U.S. and Asia this year. In parallel  we continue to make consistent progress in our Company-led immunotherapy pathway  along with the additional studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor indications and therapeutic combinations led by strategic collaborators. We are steadfast in our commitment to bring the potential benefits of NBTXR3 to millions of patients around the world  and in 2022 we will focus on executing our ongoing studies  defining our registration strategy in immunotherapy  and generating more evidence to support the broad applicability of our technology.""1 Financial data taken from the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31  2021  which were approved by its executive board and reviewed by its supervisory board on March 30  2022. The statutory auditors of the Company have completed their audit work on the 2021 financial statements  but have not issued their audit report yet. Such reports should be publicly available in the Company’s 2021 universal registration document and 2021 annual report on Form 20-F.2021 Operational Highlights  Pipeline Status and Upcoming MilestonesPriority Pathway in Head & Neck Cancer  Local Control as Single Agent Activated by RadiotherapyData from Expansion Study 102  a phase I study evaluating NBTXR3 as a single agent activated by radiotherapy (RT) in high-risk  elderly locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LAHNSCC) patients ineligible for cetuximab and intolerant to cisplatin  was presented at the 2021 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO 21) continued to support NBTXR3 administration as feasible and well-tolerated. At a median follow up of 9.5 months  evaluable patients (n=41) demonstrated a best observed target lesion objective response rate (ORR) of 85.4% and a best observed target lesion complete response rate (CRR) of 63.4%.A recent review of data from Expansion Study 102 shows  as of February 22  2022  an on-going median overall survival (mOS) of 17.9 months in the all treated population (n=56) and 23.0 months in evaluable patients (n=44) demonstrating continued improvement relative to the analysis presented at ASTRO 21 and consistent with data reported from the dose escalation phase of Study 102.Expansion Study 102 is now fully enrolled with 44 evaluable patients. The last treatment visit for the final patient is expected in Q2 2022 and data reflecting one year of follow-up are expected in mid-2023NANORAY-312  a pivotal phase III global registration study evaluating NBTXR3 as a single-agent activated by RT for elderly patients with LA-HNSCC intolerant to cisplatin initiated in Q1 2022 and actively enrolling patients across multiple European sites with U.S. site activation anticipated in mid-2022.Priority Pathway in Immunotherapy for Advanced Cancers  Priming Immune Response in Combination with Anti-PD-1 Treatment:Preclinical data was presented at the 2021 Annual Meeting of the Society for the Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) showing RT-activated NBTXR3 increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and modulated the T cell receptor repertoire  suggesting stronger immune priming triggered by the therapy compared to radiotherapy alone.Updated data from Study 1100  a phase I basket study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by RT in combination with nivolumab or pembrolizumab in locoregional recurrent or recurrent metastatic HNSCC (LRR or R/RM HNSCC)  lung and/or liver metastasis from any primary tumor presented at ASTRO 21 demonstrated a disease control rate of 81% (n=16) in the evaluable patient population  including 73% in patients with prior primary or secondary resistance to anti-PD-1. In the evaluable population  3 complete responses and 5 partial responses were reported. Some delayed tumor responses and/or abscopal effects were reported  suggesting NBTXR3 may potentially prime an immune response.Reporting of recommended Phase II dose for each cohort is expected in 2022 along with the initiation of a new expansion Phase of Study 1100 evaluating NBTXR3 in combination with nivolumab or pembrolizumab in a cohort of patients LRR or R/M HNSCC resistant to prior anti-PD-(L)-1 therapy  a cohort of LRR or R/M HNSCC patients naïve to anti-PD-(L)-1 therapy  and cohort of patients resistant to prior anti-PD-(L)-1 therapy with lung  liver or soft tissue metastasis from select solid tumors.Expect to provide updated Study 1100 data at a medical conference during the fourth quarter of 2022Expanding NBTXR3 Opportunity  Collaborating with World-Class Partners to Validate Tumor-Agnostic  Combination-Agnostic Therapeutic Profile:Formed strategic partnership with LianBio to develop and commercialize NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations in China and other Asian markets. LianBio is expected to begin enrolling patients in NANORAY-312 in China in H2 2022 as the first of up to five registrational studies covered by the collaboration.Presented preclinical data  developed in collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson)  at SITC 21 suggesting the combination of RT-activated NBTXR3  antiPD-1  anti-LAG3  and anti-TIGIT significantly elevated the activities of anti-tumor immune response in both irradiated and unirradiated tumors  improving local and distant tumor control and increasing survival rate.Published data from a preclinical study conducted in collaboration between MD Anderson in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology  Biology  Physics (Red Journal) supportive of the hypothesis that RT-activated NBTXR3 in combination with anti-PD-1 could effectively control primary and metastatic tumors  evoke abscopal effect  and reduce the possibility of developing distant lung metastases.Initiated fifth collaborator-led clinical study at MD Anderson Cancer Center.Published peer-reviewed clinical case study reported preliminary data on the first-in-human administration of NBTXR3 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer not eligible for surgery  demonstrating feasibility with no treatment-related toxicity.Determination of recommended phase II dose for NBTXR3 in pancreatic cancer expected in 2022.Full Year 2021 Financial ResultsCash and Cash Equivalents: As of December 31  2021  Nanobiotix had €83.9 million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to €119.2 million as of December 31  2020. This net decrease of €35.3 million primarily reflects €51.8 million of net cash flows used in operating  investing and financing activities of Nanobiotix which was partially offset by the €16.5 million ($20.0 million) upfront payment associated with the LianBio collaboration announced in May 2021. As previously announced  PharmaEngine was eligible for and received a €2.1 million ($2.5 million) payment following the announcement of the LianBio collaboration and has received €3.4 million ($4.0 million) in conjunction with the completion of various administrative steps in connection with the winding-up of the collaboration. PharmaEngine will be eligible and is expected to receive in 2022 an additional $1.0 million in administrative fees and  upon a second regulatory approval of an NBTXR3-containing product  a final payment of $5.0 million.Based on the current operating plan and financial projections  Nanobiotix anticipates that the cash and cash equivalents of €83.9 million as of December 31  2021  will fund its operations into the second quarter of 2023.Revenue: Full year 2021 revenue totaled €9.7k compared to €50.0k for the year ended December 31  2020. The revenue generated in 2021 was primarily related to the Company’s now concluded collaboration with PharmaEngine  Inc. Other income includes research tax credits which increased from €1.9 million in 2020 to €2.5 million in 2021 due mainly to an increase of research and development expenses.Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses: R&D expenses consist primarily of preclinical  clinical  and manufacturing expenses related to the development of NBTXR3 and totaled €30.4 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31  2021  as compared to €24.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2020. The increase in net R&D expenses was primarily due to increases in development costs related to the Company’s priority pathways  including preparation and initiation of its pivotal Phase III registration study  NANORAY-312  continuation of Expansion Study 102 and its ongoing immunotherapy combination Study 1100 as well as increases in personnel related expenses  including share-based compensation.Selling  General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses: SG&A expenses consist primarily of administrative employee-related expenses  legal and other professional fees  patent filing and maintenance fees  and insurance. These expenses were €19.4 million year-ended December 31  2021  as compared to €14.6 million for twelve-months ended December 31  2020. The increase in G&A expenses year-over-year was due to increased headcount  consulting fees  legal & compliance expenses resulting from the Nasdaq listing and recruitment expenses.Net loss: Net loss attributable to shareholders was €47.0 million  or €1.35 per share  for the twelve-month period ended December 31  2021. This compares to a net loss of €33.6 million  or €1.38 per share for the year ended December 31  2020.Conference Call and WebcastNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday  March 31  2022  at 8:00 AM EDT / 2:00 PM CET  prior to the open of the U.S. market.

The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy; and a phase III global registrational study initiated patient enrollment in 2022. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the planned phase III study.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/ metastatic HNSCC and lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Our top 50 retailers in Europe6 have increased their GLA and MGR with us since 2019  while in many cases streamlining their store portfolios elsewhere. This dynamic will support a full recovery of our European retail NRI and Group EBITDA on a stabilised basis to pre-COVID levels.Our platform of shopping and lifestyle destinations in Europe presents a powerful opportunity to grow media advertising and brand experience revenues by converting our European footfall of 550 million visits in 2021 into qualified audiences. We are building the capabilities to market URW’s pan-European platform to advertisers by creating a dedicated business division  powered by new data intelligence. These strong foundations will generate €75 million in annual net revenues by 2024  with significant upside potential.We will deliver €2 billion in projects from our committed pipeline by 2024  generating €125 million of stabilised NRI  and will add €1 billion in densification development opportunities to our controlled pipeline.This is the beginning of an exciting journey for URW that will reshape the business to focus on our core strengths in Europe  create a new media platform and unlock value from our asset portfolio to generate sustainable growth by 2024 and beyond.”The company’s plan will be presented by URW’s Management Board at an investor event today starting at 10:30 CET.

The Group is positioned to execute the radical reduction in financial exposure to the US over the course of 2022 and 2023  supported by the quality of its US assets  of which 95% are in the A-category9  as well as the strength of the recovery which is driving occupancy and rental growth for long term leases.In Europe  URW will secure the remaining €1.5 Bn of its €4 Bn disposal programme by the end of 2022. This process combines the full sale of non-core assets as well as the disposal of stakes to institutional investors  where URW will receive asset and property management fees going forward.Once completed  URW’s LTV  is expected to be below or around 40% including the Group’s hybrid bonds.RETURN OF RETAIL NRI & GROUP EBITDAFollowing completion of the deleveraging process  URW will be a European pure play with a €41 Bn portfolio10 of high-quality and well-located assets. 95% of the Group’s European retail assets are in the A-category9.These assets generate higher sales intensity for retailers  as well as increased value given the role of the physical store as part of their omnichannel and drive-to-store strategy.Key retailers are increasing their footprint with URW. Between 2019 and 2021  the Group’s top 50 retailers in Europe  who account for 29% of total MGR  increased their GLA by an average of 7% for an average MGR increase of 6%.URW expects tenant sales to return to pre-COVID levels in 2022  occupancy and variable income in the course of 2023  and retail NRI on a run rate basis in 2023  with full effect in 2024. In 2024  the Group forecasts Retail NRI of €1.56 Bn and EBITDA of circa €1.9 Bn for its streamlined European portfolio.The Group’s Convention and Exhibition business is expected to further recover in 2022 and return to normalised levels in 2023  ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics. URW’s Offices business will benefit from the full letting of recently completed projects as well as new deliveries.GROWTH OF NEW REVENUESURW has created a dedicated division to generate increased revenues from advertising  brand experience and data services.The new division will generate €75 Mn in annual net revenues by 2024 with €23 Mn in additional CAPEX11 to support this growth. This investment will be split between upgrading and increasing the Group’s 1 700 in-mall advertising screens  and the roll out of fully GDPR-compliant technology to qualify footfall at URW’s Westfield-branded malls.UNLOCKING VALUE THROUGH MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTURW will continue to maximise the value of its assets through targeted mixed-use development  capitalising on its established position in the most valuable European real estate markets with high barriers to entry.By 2024  URW will deliver €2 Bn of its committed pipeline which will generate €125 Mn in stabilized NRI. In addition  URW will unlock further development opportunities embedded in its assets during the plan horizon  with a potential €1 Bn in projects to add to its controlled pipeline  with limited predevelopment expenses.Underpinned by the Group’s disciplined capital allocation approach  URW will focus on densifying its flagships with office  hotels and residential  as well as repurposing retail space and  where appropriate  extending to add high-growth alternative uses.BUILDING ON ESG LEADERSHIPURW launched its ambitious  industry leading Better Places 2030 ESG strategy in 2016 and has consistently ranked in the top-quartile on ESG performance. URW’s comprehensive approach addresses all stakeholders and the Group’s carbon reduction targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and are consistent with levels required to meet the Paris agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C.URW is on track to meet all Better Places 2030 commitments  including cutting carbon emissions across its value chain by 50% between 2015 and 2030. The Group has also made good progress in energy efficiency and green energy usage. 90% of URW assets in Europe have received Outstanding or Excellent ratings from the BREEAM IN-USE certification  the world’s leading sustainability assessment method  compared to 30% for the European Retail Real Estate sector as a whole.URW is committed to contributing to global carbon neutrality and will present a step-change update to its plan in 2023 with a view to establishing new commitments.CAPITAL ALLOCATION & DIVIDENDURW outlined its disciplined capital allocation framework that balances continued investment in future growth with maintaining a strong balance sheet.URW will continue to sell mature assets that do not meet its return criteria or that do not fit its destination strategy. URW will continue to invest in projects and acquisitions on an opportunistic basis  looking at the expected Internal Rate of Return  the level of risk and any balance sheet constraints. URW will resume the payment of sustainable dividend from fiscal year 2023.For further information  please contact :Investor RelationsMaarten Otte+33 7 63 86 88 78Maarten.Otte@urw.comMedia RelationsCornelia Schnepf – Finelk+44 7387 108 998Cornelia.Schnepf@finelk.euAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is the premier global developer and operator of Flagship Destinations  with a portfolio valued at €54.5 Bn as at December 31  2021  of which 86% in retail  6% in offices  5% in convention & exhibition venues and 2% in services.

That makes choosing the right mattress no easy matter. And a lot of people don’t know whether they actually prefer a hard or soft mattress or something in between. Beter Bed aims to help! By screening customers and letting them feel for themselves what a good night’s sleep means  the ‘Beter Slapen ID’ system takes just a few minutes to provide an independent mattress recommendation based on the customer's personal needs. Introduction of the new system is in line with the company’s strategy presented last year for modernising its current stores.Beter Bed intends switching to three different types of stores. The first are experience stores such as the one recently opened at the Sontplein retail area in Groningen; these stores have a strategic function within a region. They will be joined by city stores  with the first (200 m2) opening at the Mall of the Netherlands in June. Beter Bed also aims to introduce this concept in inner-city shopping streets. Over the next few years  the company's current shopping-centre stores will also be modernised.Beter Slapen ID: personal  data-driven sleep adviceIn line with its “Sleep Better  Live Better” mission  Beter Bed is supporting these shopping concepts with a new service: Beter Slapen ID. This system uses sensors to measure the customer's body and matches the results with data about our entire mattress range. Using the results of this test combined with the knowledge of our sleep consultants  we can offer customised  independent mattress advice. The device has been successfully tested in two stores over the past few months.""During tests with this new technology  it became clear that many people have very different preferences than they initially thought. In the near future  Beter Bed wants to make it possible for people to take measurements themselves at home so as to discover their ideal sleep solution. Customers can already be measured in 12 stores in the Netherlands (Groningen Sontplein  Den Bosch  Zoeterwoude  Amsterdam Arena  Rotterdam Alexandrium  Heerlen  Veenendaal  Breda  Leeuwarden  Apeldoorn  and The Hague) and in the Belgian city of Genk. A whole series of measurements and thousands of calculations provide an objective overview of the five most suitable mattresses within just five minutes. And that’s only the beginning  many more will follow""  says a proud Perijn Hoefsloot  responsible for Strategic Business Development at Beter Bed.Story continuesFollowing the success of the Peter de Beter Bed-weter campaign  the introduction of the Beter Slapen ID will be supported by an extensive marketing campaign on TV  radio and online.About Beter Bed HoldingBeter Bed Holding (BBH) is the Netherlands’ leading sleep specialist in retail  wholesale and B2B.Our mission is simple.

1924,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.whitecase.com/publications/insight/global-ipos-blockbuster-year/european-ipo-activity,European IPO activity proved strong  led by e-commerce and tech listings - White & Case LLP,SubscribeStay current on your favorite topics253%The year-on-year percentage increase in value of the European IPO market in 2021,"253% The year-on-year percentage increase in value of the European IPO market in 2021It was a blockbuster year for IPOs of European firms  following the global trend. In total  476 European firms listed last year  excluding SPACs. Collectively  they raised US$90 billion. That represented increases of 156 percent and 253 percent  respectively  compared to 2020.This was  by some margin  the busiest year for IPOs of European companies on record  even without counting SPACs  which likewise had a banner year—64 European SPACs listed in 2021  raising a total of US$13.8 billion. This represented an annual growth of 392 percent and 339 percent  respectively (see ""A rollercoaster year for SPACs"" on p. 6 for more on SPACs).The range of businesses coming to market last year was remarkably wide. Indeed  each of the five largest IPOs of the year featured a different sector. From transport to telecoms and from technology to machinery  businesses in every area of the market were able to raise money.InPost leads the wayThe largest 2021 deal involving a European company saw Polish logistics operator InPost list on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange in an IPO raising US$3.9 billion  underlining the huge demand for businesses offering exposure to the booming e-commerce market and the supply chains that support it.The second-biggest IPO of a European company also played into an important structural shift. Volvo Cars raised US$2.7 billion in a listing on Nasdaq Stockholm that will support the Swedish auto manufacturer's move into electric cars  as the industry transitions to cleaner technologies in the face of climate change.Similarly  Vantage Towers benefited from another market development. The business  created by the telecoms giant Vodafone  builds and operates the infrastructure that enables mobile networks  which carry increasing data traffic  to operate across Europe. Its IPO  with a listing in Frankfurt  raised US$2.6 billion last year.Technology IPOs race ahead—followed by finance and life sciencesOverall  technology was the single busiest sector for IPO activity last year  with 162 new issues that raised US$27.5 billion. As in other markets  those figures include a number of businesses that are better described as technology-enabled  rather than pure technology plays. For example  the year's biggest IPO in the sector was for Allfunds  which operates an online marketplace for the investment industry  connecting asset managers with customers such as retail banks and wealth managers. Allfunds  which is based in Spain  raised US$2.6 billion.In second place  life sciences businesses were also market favorites; the sector completed 65 IPOs that raised US$8.9 billion. Deals such as the US$974 million listing of animal health group Vimian and the US$932 million IPO of Swiss drug maker PolyPeptide underscored investors' demand for exposure to the life sciences sector.Finance was the third-biggest sectoral contributor to last year's IPO figures  with 33 new issues raising US$7.8 billion in the aggregate. The sector continues to see consolidation and innovation  particularly in the fintech arena  but there is also growing interest in IPOs from businesses that have previously preferred to stay private. In particular  last year's US$1.2 billion IPO of UK private equity firm Bridgepoint turned heads. Following the strong stock market performance of Sweden's EQT AB since its 2019 listing  the Bridgepoint deal was another success for the private equity sector.Sweden was second only to the UK in IPO volumes last year  amid increasing demand for businesses across the Nordics.Nordics flourish while the UK bucks BrexitThe Vimian deal was among Sweden's largest IPOs of 2021 in a boom year for new issues in the country  which also included the listings of Volvo Cars and oat milk producer Oatly. Sweden was second only to the UK in IPO volumes last year  amid increasing demand for businesses across the Nordics.That represented a continuation of the flourishing IPO market seen in the Nordic region for several years now  with a strong startup community  supportive regulation and a healthy domestic institutional investment industry all contributing to this performance. The very strong performance of Sweden's stock market in particular last year—up 23.5 percent—also encouraged IPO activity  and issuers in the region won praise for their speedy adaptation to the pandemic; they were early adopters of tools such as virtual roadshows  for example.In the UK  meanwhile  the uncertainties of Brexit do not appear to have dampened the IPO market. Last year saw 133 IPOs of UK companies—almost a quarter of Europe's total volume—which raised US$25.3 billion. That was a 209 percent increase in volume on the previous year and a 204 percent increase by value.Although a couple of IPOs performed poorly in the aftermarket—food delivery business Deliveroo  for example  saw its share price trade at approximately 33 percent below listing price one month after listing  and e-commerce group The Hut Group (THG) has similarly been trading below its IPO price since its January 2021 listing—the London Stock Exchange continued to attract a number of technology and high-growth issuers including Oxford Nanopore  Wise  Darktrace and Trustpilot.In addition to tech IPOs  the LSE is still attracting listings from other sectors  plus listings from foreign issuers. Singaporean food firm Olam International  for instance  announced last year its intention to seek a dual listing in London and Singapore in the second half of 2022.Events in Ukraine send markets into turmoilEven under normal circumstances  European IPO activity would have struggled to match the same heights as the blockbuster 2021  but events in Ukraine only further depressed the potential for listing activity in the region. Equity markets in Europe will likely remain volatile as long as the situation lasts  especially given Europe's dependence on Russia for energy. Soaring oil and gas prices and potential shortages could have knock-on effects on the rest of the economy  and further destabilize stock markets. As such  new listings activity is likely to be muted until later in the year.In time  however  listings should come trickling back. Although central banks are poised to raise interest rates this year  any hike will be modest  and alternative options will be limited for investors. Broad secular trends such as digitalization and the energy transition will provide further impetus for new listings. As long as volatility eases  listings should return to European markets.Click here to read the full magazineGlobal IPOs: A blockbuster yearThis publication is provided for your convenience and does not constitute legal advice.

The Egide Group's consolidated revenue for 2021 was €32.50 million  up 8.5% compared to 2020.The revenue had been impacted in H1-2021 by delays in the reconstruction of the Cambridge plating shop due to supply of materials for the plating equipment. Before the end of the year  the plating shop was 100% operational  and had been audited by a number of key customers in the US Aerospace and Defense markets. The overall growth would have been greater if not for the labor shortages experienced in the US due to the pandemic. Both technical professionals and direct labor demand have not been fulfilled in H2. This will require new strategies in 2022 to as the labor market continues to be tight in the US. The revenue of the American entities represents 56% of the total revenue of the group.For information  the average euro/dollar exchange rate in 2021 was 1.18 compared to 1.14 in 2020.RESULTS AS OF 12/31/2021EBITDA (restated of rents) amounted to €1.5m  compared with €3.8m in 2020.Non recurrent items (fire insurance and expenses  PPP  impairment) represent a positive impact of 1.09m€ in 2021 vs 4.53m€ in 2020  which decrease is mainly due to plating subcontracting (shown in External costs) of 2.84m€ in 2021.Considering all these elements  the Egide Group generated a net profit of €0.05m on December 31  2021 (compared to €0.98 in 2020).CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 31  2021ASSETS * LIABILITIES * 2021 2020 2021 2020 Fixed assets 9.5 6.5 Equity 11.4 10.6 Usage rights of leased assets 2.0 2.3 Other financial fixed assets 0.5 0.5 Accruals 0.9 0.8 Differed tax assets 0.7 0.8 Financial debt 7.8 6.6 Inventory  AR and other assets 13.8 16.3 Rent debts 2.2 2.5 Cash 1.6 1.4 AP & other 5.8 7.3 TOTAL 28.1 27.8 TOTAL 28.1 27.8* In €M – UnauditedFixed assets include depreciation of 0.3M€ because of Impairment of Santier and 2.6M€ Capex financed by the insurance in Cambridge + 0.4M€ in Egide SA + 0.5 M€ release of impairment depreciation from 2018 in Egide SA.The financial debts include the reclass of 1.8M€ from long to short term due to covenants in Egide USA and Santier not respected. The current financial institution has given the company until June 30th to find another partner. Investment grant waiting for depreciation and lease to be recognized as profit.The working capital represents 90 days of revenue.SIGNIFICANT SUBSEQUENT EVENTS AFTER DECEMBER 31ST  2021 : LEASE BACK PROCESS FOR EGIDE USA IN CAMBRIDGEEgide USA (Cambridge) would sell its building to strengthen its cash position and finance future investments. A Lease arrangement for the facility is being negotiated with the potential owner for 15 years  with option for an additional 10 years. Negotiations and due diligence audits are in progress with a contract expected to be signed before end H1 2022 for $6M.This operation would allow Egide Group to reduce its American debt to almost zero  and make a capital gain of nearly $3M.2022 OUTLOOKThe good rhythm of our order book build-up over the end of 2021  driven largely by the Defense sector  provides a solid foundation for growth in 2022.Geopolitical situation in Europe should have a positive effect although a concrete sign regarding order intake has yet to be seen. Defense contractors in both the EU and US have indicated  without clear purchase orders  that they expect their respective businesses to be strong in H2.In addition  the sale-leaseback of the Cambridge facility (underway in H1-2022) will strengthen the Group’s cash position.Egide SA expects an acceleration of its revenues through new customer acquisition in the thermal imaging market  by multiple new engagements for next generation high speed communication transceivers. Multiple new important projects acquired in 2021 will ramp in 2022 boosting Israel and China regions revenue.Egide USA’s HTCC ceramics order book has recovered with close to $ 1 million backlog  including two new customers. A multi-year multi-million $ agreement with its largest power customer has been confirmed with new orders. And significant increase is expected for the thermal battery market. A new sales team in the US is working to develop new opportunities for Santier’s capabilities – thermal management materials and machining capabilities. Order intake in Q1 appears to reflect that the team is successful.Jim Collins  Chairman and CEO  comments: ""While many businesses have been hampered significantly by the pandemic  Egide Group continues to be resilient and defy the challenges brought by the pandemic and our industrial fire in Cambridge. Our loyal customers continue to support our business units  and it has resulted in very strong order intake in Q4-2021 and Q1-2022. We expect 2022 to be a year of improved revenue and margins for the Group. ”FINANCIAL CALENDARGeneral Meeting : June 16  20222022 H1 revenue: July 21  2022CONTACTSEGIDE – Finance Department - Luc Ardon - +33 4 90 30 35 94 – luc.ardon@fr.egide-group.comFIN’EXTENSO – Press Relations - Isabelle Aprile - +33 6 17 38 61 78 – i.aprile@finextenso.frAbout Egide - www.egide-group.comEgide is a group with an international dimension. specialized in the manufacture of hermetic packages and heat dissipation solutions for sensitive electronic components.

Accor is the largest hotel operator in Queensland  with 101 hotels across the state and ...,"An uplift in occupancy levels on the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast is driving a resurgence in Queensland hotel performances for Australia’s largest hotel group.Accor is the largest hotel operator in Queensland  with 101 hotels across the state and over 4 000 team members.For the period between January – March 2022  Accor’s Queensland hotels recorded an average occupancy of 70% compared to 67% in the same period in 2019  prior to Covid-19.The figures for 2022 exclude nearly all international travel to the state and take into account the impact of the Omicron variant.The two leading destinations for Accor in Q1 2022 were the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast.The Gold Coast  which suffered significantly from losses of international travel due to closed borders until mid-February  saw domestic markets recover strongly  with the drive market fueling growth in booking demand at higher levels than 2019.The Sunshine Coast saw holiday season occupancies on par with 2019 figures  as the region attracted consistently high levels of interstate and intrastate business.Far North Queensland  based on Cairns and Port Douglas  are facing a slower recovery due to the absence of international travellers and caution around long-haul domestic flights. Occupancies remained subdued during the quarter  but began to show signs of revival towards the end of February.The lack of corporate and conference travel – with ‘work from home’ recommendations still in place for much of the quarter – saw Brisbane city hotels record occupancies up to 25% lower than the similar pre-pandemic period.Accor Pacific Chief Executive Officer  Sarah Derry  said that while the continuing prevalence of COVID-19 variants  uncertainty about borders  and the ban on international tourists until last month had all suppressed demand  Accor’s Queensland hotels had been successful in pivoting to largely domestic leisure business.“Queensland is set to lead the Australian recovery in travel. The state’s natural attractions  climate and environment  combined with its popularity for conferences and events  provide us with considerable optimism for the rest of 2022 ” said Ms Derry  who was appointed CEO of Accor Pacific in January 2022.“We saw two of Australia’s most popular leisure destinations – the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast – regain most of the ground lost over the past two years by successfully targeting the drive markets within Queensland and interstate.""“The results reveal that Australians love to travel to Queensland. A combination of greater certainty regarding borders  an increase in flights  State and Federal stimulus measures  and a range of targeted marketing programs have significantly elevated holiday travel to Queensland in 2022.""“It is particularly encouraging that all restrictions impacting travel between Australia and New Zealand will be lifted from 12 April – that will provide a massive shot in the arm for Queensland  as the trans-Tasman market is a strong source market for the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast  particularly during the winter season. New Zealand travellers generally stay longer than any other market.""“Other international markets will take considerably longer to return to pre-pandemic levels. Airlines are beginning to ramp up schedules  with Queensland attracting increased services from Asia  the Pacific and North America. Australia’s reputation for managing the pandemic  attractions such as our beautiful coastlines  national parks and lifestyle will be positive drivers of international inbound.""“Conferences and events are beginning to show encouraging signs of recovery. Conferences are vital for filling destinations mid-week  while events maximise occupancies over weekends.""“We are still some way from seeing a return to normal levels of corporate travel. With companies still often working remotely  and with caution about the pandemic  it could take until the second half of 2022 to see a sustained recovery in business travel. There were small indications of Brisbane rebuilding corporate travel in the latter period of the first quarter  but the floods in February and early March brought challenges.""“Last week’s announcement by the Federal Government to provide AU$5 million in additional funding to support Tourism Australia’s capacity to bid for major events is encouraging  as was the overall AU$60 million package to revive international travel  but this support will need to be ongoing if we are to re-build business  conference and events travel to pre-Covid levels. I urge Government to consider how they might provide further support to enable our great cities return to prosperity through arts  sports and cultural events.""“We are fortunate to work with partners who see the long-term potential of Queensland for growth in travel. We are working with them to maximise the guest experience through refurbishments and upgrades. We are also working closely with state and regional tourism organisations to generate new travel demand in their destinations through promotions and innovative marketing.""“As we recover  we will create more career opportunities for people  and our teams across the state have been recruiting strongly over the past quarter  with the advantage of Accor being able to offer unprecedented opportunities for career growth locally and internationally.""“Accor will be introducing a range of new hotels and new brands to the Queensland market over the next few years including Mövenpick Brisbane Spring Hill  Fairmont Port Douglas and Mondrian Gold Coast.”About AccorAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of more than 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

Adjusted net income of €72.6m represented an 85.1% increase.The distributor also saw its channel base widen  signing up more than 1 250 new resellers (representing growth of 7%)  servicing 110 000 end-customers  up 4 000  as well as expanding with vendors into 21 fresh countries. The firm added 22 vendors to its roster  including Diamanti  Hashicorp  Salt Security and Sonatype.The year also saw the business use its financial muscle to acquire additional expertise  with buys of emerging vendor support specialist Ignition Technology and Networks Unlimited.Investors that backed the IPO will be pleased to see that the strategy the firm outlined back in the build-up to going public is delivering the returns the distie’s management expected. The business is focused in some of the large growth areas  particularly security  with the market supporting growth and leading to the business upgrading its 2022 outlook.Jesper Trolle  chief executive officer at Exclusive  said the results showed not only that it was following the right strategy  but that the business had the resilience to navigate what had been challenging times  with the pandemic and shortages  in 2021.“We are pleased to present strong results for 2021 and deliver on the strategy we presented at the time of our IPO ” said Trolle. “We successfully delivered on growth and profitability targets and demonstrated our operational excellence  successfully navigating market challenges. Our unique positioning at the centre of the ecosystem and the compelling demand for cyber security solutions drove this strong performance in 2021 and reinforces our confidence in our strategy and outlook for the future.“2021 was a milestone year for the group as it transitioned from a private into a listed company after its successful IPO on Euronext Paris in September 2021. We have many exciting growth opportunities and continue to take advantage of our strong market position and cybersecurity demand globally.""""The cyber security market is now more prominent than ever as the environment becomes more complex.

1935,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-auction-market-as-builder-and-buffer-for-the-nft-market-301513738.html,Artmarket.com: auction market as builder and buffer for the NFT Market,PARIS  March 30  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Traditional auction houses have been playing a launchpad role in NFT trading  but they could provide greater stability for this growing market. By providing valuation estimates  they synthesize the current state of supply…,"thierry Ehrmann  CEO and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department: "" By preparing a sale  publishing a catalog several weeks in advance and by giving a range of estimates and guaranteeing the information long after adjudication  the auction house actually 'moderates' the NFT market. This does not prevent prices from soaring if demand is stronger than expected"" .Despite the transparency of blockchain technology  there are plenty of anomalies on major NFT marketplaces. Whether it's fake accounts (like those that appeared around Takashi Murakami) or arbitrage opportunities (offered to those who manage to integrate the whitelists of the most coveted projects)  NFT sales platforms have seen a large number of highly aggressive strategies contributing to price volatility and a degree of instability.Takashi Murakami's 'overly' anticipated NFTsSince the announcement of his Flowers NFT project  Japanese artist Takashi Murakami (ranked 105th in our global ranking of artists by 2021 auction turnover  all periods of creation combined) has been the subject of numerous fraud attempts using Instagram and Twitter accounts with deliberately similar names  such as murekemi.flower2022. By inciting you to mint NFTs as quickly as possible (as most NFT drops do)  these fake projects try to make you buy instantly  without checking the legitimacy of the creator.It is clear that Murakami's NFT project is attracting interest from both traditional collectors and from the crypto community. However  it is looking increasingly likely that his Flowers NFTs will not be launched until around the time of his solo show at the Gagosian in New York  scheduled for May 2022. We will therefore have to wait a little longer than was initially expected to buy into Murakami's digital Flowers.https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2022/takashi-murakami/Unfortunately  the lack of clarity that currently exists on NFT marketplaces as well as on social media is generating a large number of scams. Almost all of today's most famous NFT projects have replicas circulating in large numbers on Opensea. This situation could be improved by a more active presence of stabilizing agents such as auction houses in the NFT ecosystem.At last… a genuine reference priceOf the 10 000 items in the World of Women collection  only one copy went to public auction. Estimated between $400 000 and $665 000 by Christie's  Woman #5672 was sold on 1 March 2022 in London for $600 000 (to which a 26% buyer's fees was added  bringing the total purchase price to $755 000).The value of this work fitted perfectly with the estimate provided by the auction house Christie's. However  the price of this NFT has been very volatile: barely six months ago  Woman #5672 was acquired for $117 000 (37.95 eth) on the OpenSea platform  and the best offer for this NFT is today $70 000 (20 eth).https://opensea.io/assets/0xe785e82358879f061bc3dcac6f0444462d4b5330/5672Because it was outside the blockchain  data relating to Christie's sale does not appear in the work's activity log on OpenSea. On the other hand  the identity (or rather the pseudonym) of the buyer of Woman #5672 has been revealed by Opensea: it is the moonpay.eth account.

The full-year financial report will be included in a registration document due to be published on 27 April 2022.Gilles Avenard  Chief Executive Officer and founder of Acticor Biotech  comments: “To carry out our clinical trials in treating cardiovascular emergencies  which remains a key public health concern  we have strengthened our financial capacity thanks in particular to our successful IPO on the Euronext Growth market in Paris in October 2021. As a result of this fundraising round supported by our existing shareholders as well as a number of new shareholders  we will continue with the clinical development of our first-in-class drug glenzocimab in stroke treatment. We recently obtained very promising results for our ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial in this indication  and which confirm the clinical interest of GPVI inhibition. In keeping with the roadmap set out at the time of our IPO  we have made a calm and enthusiastic start to 2022  with major clinical milestones to come such as recruiting the first patients in the United States for the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 clinical trial  as well as the start of the GREEN phase 2/3 trial  both in stroke treatment.”Main financial information (audited – in accordance with IFRS)Given the Company’s stage of clinical development  it does not generate any revenue.Research and development costs1 amounted to €7 766 thousand in 2021 compared with €5 770 thousand in 2020. This increase is mainly due to the conduct of the ACTIMIS and GARDEN clinical trials  recruitment for which ended in 2021  as well as the start of the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 clinical trial in Europe and the rise in staff costs.Operating and administrative expenses amounted to €3 749 thousand in 2021 compared with €1 483 thousand in 2020. This increase relates primarily to fees and charges incurred within the framework of the IPO on Euronext Growth Paris.The Company therefore sustained a net loss of €12 608 thousand in 2021 compared with €7 651 thousand in 2020.Cash and cash equivalents totalled €11.3 million at 31 December 2021  thanks in particular to the capital increase within the framework of Acticor Biotech’s IPO  which raised €15.5 million.Highlights since the IPOOctober 2021 - Successful IPO on Euronext Growth® in ParisThe IPO enabled the Company to carry out a €15.5 million capital increase by issuing 2 178 176 new ordinary shares.November 2021 - FDA approval of the IND application for glenzocimab in acute ischemic strokeThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the launch in the United States of the clinical development of glenzocimab  a new humanised monoclonal antibody fragment to be used on acute ischemic stroke patients. This active Investigational New Drug (IND) application represents a major step forward and marks the start in the United States of America of the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 clinical trial  evaluating the efficacy of glenzocimab in treating ischemic stroke  in combination with the reference treatment in this indication.February 2022 - Results of the GARDEN phase 2 clinical trial in Covid-19-related respiratory distress syndromeThe results of the GARDEN clinical trial evaluating the use of glenzocimab on Covid-19 patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) confirmed glenzocimab’s high level of tolerance administered in a 1000 mg dose for three consecutive days. It was not possible to demonstrate any difference in the main criterion of efficacy  i.e.  progression to clinical aggravation  between glenzocimab and the placebo  both combined with standard treatments. An imbalance in inclusion was observed with regard to the risk factors recognised within this population not in favour of glenzocimab involving patients who usually have high blood pressure  are diabetic or older.February 2022 - Positive results of the ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial on patients presenting with Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS)The positive results of the ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial evaluating glenzocimab in combination with the reference treatment (thrombolysis with or without thrombectomy) in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) demonstrated glenzocimab’s very favourable safety profile by meeting the main criterion of the trial as well as a significant reduction in the number of intracerebral haemorrhages and mortality in the group treated with glenzocimab.March 2022 - Appointment of Corinne Le Goff to the Board of Directors as independent board memberCorinne Le Goff has agreed to join Acticor Biotech’s Board of Directors as an independent board member. Her appointment will be submitted to the shareholder vote at the combined general meeting of 12 May 2022.Outlook for 2022Acticor Biotech’s clinical strategy consists of developing its drug  glenzocimab  across several major indications in the treatment of cardiovascular emergencies. Two phase 2/3 trials are planned in stroke treatment  including ACTISAVE  which began in Europe in 2021. The company is also extending its clinical development programme to other indications such as pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction  for which phase 2 trials are planned to be launched this year.Recruitment of the first US patient in the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 trial with glenzocimab in ischemic stroke  in combination with the reference treatment in this indication - 2nd quarter of 2022Presentation of final results of the ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial on patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) – 2nd quarter of 2022Recruitment of the first patient in the GREEN phase 2/3 trial in stroke  funded by Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) – 2nd half of 2022Launch of two phase 2 clinical trials in pulmonary embolism (BREATH trial) and myocardial infarction (LIBERATE trial) – end of 2nd half of 2022Next financial publication: Results for the 1st half of 2022  on September 29  2022 (after market closing)About ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  a spin-off from INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)  which is aiming to develop an innovative treatment for cardiovascular emergencies  including ischemic stroke.Acticor Biotech is developing glenzocimab (ACT017)  a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) fragment directed against a novel target of major interest  platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Glenzocimab inhibits platelet binding to the thrombus without affecting physiological hemostasis  thereby limiting the bleeding risk  particularly in the brain.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Mirae Asset Capital  Anaxago  Primer Capital  Mediolanum farmaceutici and the Armesa foundation).

Pyrum is now listed in the stock exchange’s “Scale” segment  which offers small and midsized companies access to investors and equity financing. Today’s German listing follows Pyrum’s listing in the Euronext Growth segment of the Oslo Stock Exchange in September 2021.The dual listing was accompanied by ICF Bank.Founded in 2007  Pyrum quickly developed into a pioneering company in the GreenTech sector. It is based in Dillingen  Saarland  Germany and sustainably recycles old tires with its innovative pyrolysis technology. The company develops  builds  and operates plants that recover high-quality raw materials such as oil  gas and coke from used tires  rubber and plastic waste  which are then fed back into the materials cycle. The process is energy-autonomous and saves a large proportion of the CO2 emissions normally produced during the disposal of used tires. In addition  the GreenTech company is researching on new input materials as well as on new raw materials to be produced. BASF has held a stake in Pyrum Innovations AG since September 2020 and guarantees the purchase of the thermolysis oil produced by Pyrum and its contractors.“We are proud to have had the opportunity to accompany Pyrum in this important step in its growth strategy. Following its private placement on Euronext Growth in Oslo last year  its listing on the Deutsche Börse will expand the company’s access to the international capital markets. Pyrum’s business model exemplifies innovation in ESG  and the company is a pioneer in forming partnerships with leading manufacturers in the automotive industry ” commented Robert Michels  lead partner.A Dentons team from Frankfurt provided full legal advice to Pyrum on the dual listing and accompanying stock corporation law issues.

The last treatment visit for the final patient is expected in Q2 2022 and data reflecting one year of follow-up are expected in mid-2023NANORAY-312  a pivotal phase III global registration study evaluating NBTXR3 as a single-agent activated by RT for elderly patients with LA-HNSCC intolerant to cisplatin initiated in Q1 2022 and actively enrolling patients across multiple European sites with U.S. site activation anticipated in mid-2022.Priority Pathway in Immunotherapy for Advanced Cancers  Priming Immune Response in Combination with Anti-PD-1 Treatment:Preclinical data was presented at the 2021 Annual Meeting of the Society for the Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) showing RT-activated NBTXR3 increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and modulated the T cell receptor repertoire  suggesting stronger immune priming triggered by the therapy compared to radiotherapy alone.Updated data from Study 1100  a phase I basket study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by RT in combination with nivolumab or pembrolizumab in locoregional recurrent or recurrent metastatic HNSCC (LRR or R/RM HNSCC)  lung and/or liver metastasis from any primary tumor presented at ASTRO 21 demonstrated a disease control rate of 81% (n=16) in the evaluable patient population  including 73% in patients with prior primary or secondary resistance to anti-PD-1. In the evaluable population  3 complete responses and 5 partial responses were reported. Some delayed tumor responses and/or abscopal effects were reported  suggesting NBTXR3 may potentially prime an immune response.Reporting of recommended Phase II dose for each cohort is expected in 2022 along with the initiation of a new expansion Phase of Study 1100 evaluating NBTXR3 in combination with nivolumab or pembrolizumab in a cohort of patients LRR or R/M HNSCC resistant to prior anti-PD-(L)-1 therapy  a cohort of LRR or R/M HNSCC patients naïve to anti-PD-(L)-1 therapy  and cohort of patients resistant to prior anti-PD-(L)-1 therapy with lung  liver or soft tissue metastasis from select solid tumors.Expect to provide updated Study 1100 data at a medical conference during the fourth quarter of 2022Expanding NBTXR3 Opportunity  Collaborating with World-Class Partners to Validate Tumor-Agnostic  Combination-Agnostic Therapeutic Profile:Formed strategic partnership with LianBio to develop and commercialize NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations in China and other Asian markets. LianBio is expected to begin enrolling patients in NANORAY-312 in China in H2 2022 as the first of up to five registrational studies covered by the collaboration.Presented preclinical data  developed in collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson)  at SITC 21 suggesting the combination of RT-activated NBTXR3  antiPD-1  anti-LAG3  and anti-TIGIT significantly elevated the activities of anti-tumor immune response in both irradiated and unirradiated tumors  improving local and distant tumor control and increasing survival rate.Published data from a preclinical study conducted in collaboration between MD Anderson in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology  Biology  Physics (Red Journal) supportive of the hypothesis that RT-activated NBTXR3 in combination with anti-PD-1 could effectively control primary and metastatic tumors  evoke abscopal effect  and reduce the possibility of developing distant lung metastases.Initiated fifth collaborator-led clinical study at MD Anderson Cancer Center.Published peer-reviewed clinical case study reported preliminary data on the first-in-human administration of NBTXR3 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer not eligible for surgery  demonstrating feasibility with no treatment-related toxicity.Determination of recommended phase II dose for NBTXR3 in pancreatic cancer expected in 2022.Full Year 2021 Financial ResultsCash and Cash Equivalents: As of December 31  2021  Nanobiotix had €83.9 million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to €119.2 million as of December 31  2020. This net decrease of €35.3 million primarily reflects €51.8 million of net cash flows used in operating  investing and financing activities of Nanobiotix which was partially offset by the €16.5 million ($20.0 million) upfront payment associated with the LianBio collaboration announced in May 2021. As previously announced  PharmaEngine was eligible for and received a €2.1 million ($2.5 million) payment following the announcement of the LianBio collaboration and has received €3.4 million ($4.0 million) in conjunction with the completion of various administrative steps in connection with the winding-up of the collaboration. PharmaEngine will be eligible and is expected to receive in 2022 an additional $1.0 million in administrative fees and  upon a second regulatory approval of an NBTXR3-containing product  a final payment of $5.0 million.Based on the current operating plan and financial projections  Nanobiotix anticipates that the cash and cash equivalents of €83.9 million as of December 31  2021  will fund its operations into the second quarter of 2023.Revenue: Full year 2021 revenue totaled €9.7k compared to €50.0k for the year ended December 31  2020. The revenue generated in 2021 was primarily related to the Company’s now concluded collaboration with PharmaEngine  Inc. Other income includes research tax credits which increased from €1.9 million in 2020 to €2.5 million in 2021 due mainly to an increase of research and development expenses.Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses: R&D expenses consist primarily of preclinical  clinical  and manufacturing expenses related to the development of NBTXR3 and totaled €30.4 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31  2021  as compared to €24.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2020. The increase in net R&D expenses was primarily due to increases in development costs related to the Company’s priority pathways  including preparation and initiation of its pivotal Phase III registration study  NANORAY-312  continuation of Expansion Study 102 and its ongoing immunotherapy combination Study 1100 as well as increases in personnel related expenses  including share-based compensation.Selling  General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses: SG&A expenses consist primarily of administrative employee-related expenses  legal and other professional fees  patent filing and maintenance fees  and insurance. These expenses were €19.4 million year-ended December 31  2021  as compared to €14.6 million for twelve-months ended December 31  2020. The increase in G&A expenses year-over-year was due to increased headcount  consulting fees  legal & compliance expenses resulting from the Nasdaq listing and recruitment expenses.Net loss: Net loss attributable to shareholders was €47.0 million  or €1.35 per share  for the twelve-month period ended December 31  2021. This compares to a net loss of €33.6 million  or €1.38 per share for the year ended December 31  2020.Conference Call and WebcastNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday  March 31  2022  at 8:00 AM EDT / 2:00 PM CET  prior to the open of the U.S. market.

The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy; and a phase III global registrational study initiated patient enrollment in 2022. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the planned phase III study.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/ metastatic HNSCC and lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

The full-year financial report will be included in a registration document due to be published on 27 April 2022.Gilles Avenard  Chief Executive Officer and founder of Acticor Biotech  comments: ""To carry out our clinical trials in treating cardiovascular emergencies  which remains a key public health concern  we have strengthened our financial capacity thanks in particular to our successful IPO on the Euronext Growth market in Paris in October 2021. As a result of this fundraising round supported by our existing shareholders as well as a number of new shareholders  we will continue with the clinical development of our first-in-class drug glenzocimab in stroke treatment. We recently obtained very promising results for our ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial in this indication  and which confirm the clinical interest of GPVI inhibition. In keeping with the roadmap set out at the time of our IPO  we have made a calm and enthusiastic start to 2022  with major clinical milestones to come such as recruiting the first patients in the United States for the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 clinical trial  as well as the start of the GREEN phase 2/3 trial  both in stroke treatment.Main financial information (audited in accordance with IFRS)Given the Company's stage of clinical development  it does not generate any revenue.Research and development costs1 amounted to €7 766 thousand in 2021 compared with €5 770 thousand in 2020. This increase is mainly due to the conduct of the ACTIMIS and GARDEN clinical trials  recruitment for which ended in 2021  as well as the start of the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 clinical trial in Europe and the rise in staff costs.Operating and administrative expenses amounted to €3 749 thousand in 2021 compared with €1 483 thousand in 2020. This increase relates primarily to fees and charges incurred within the framework of the IPO on Euronext Growth Paris.The Company therefore sustained a net loss of €12 608 thousand in 2021 compared with €7 651 thousand in 2020.Cash and cash equivalents totalled €11.3 million at 31 December 2021  thanks in particular to the capital increase within the framework of Acticor Biotech's IPO  which raised €15.5 million.Highlights since the IPOOctober 2021 -Successful IPO on Euronext Growth in ParisThe IPO enabled the Company to carry out a €15.5 million capital increase by issuing 2 178 176 new ordinary shares.November 2021 FDA approval of the IND application for glenzocimab in acute ischemic strokeThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the launch in the United States of the clinical development of glenzocimab  a new humanised monoclonal antibody fragment to be used on acute ischemic stroke patients. This active Investigational New Drug (IND) application represents a major step forward and marks the start in the United States of America of the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 clinical trial  evaluating the efficacy of glenzocimab in treating ischemic stroke  in combination with the reference treatment in this indication.February 2022 Results of the GARDEN phase 2 clinical trial in Covid-19-related respiratory distress syndromeThe results of the GARDEN clinical trial evaluating the use of glenzocimab on Covid-19 patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) confirmed glenzocimab's high level of tolerance administered in a 1000 mg dose for three consecutive days. It was not possible to demonstrate any difference in the main criterion of efficacy  i.e.  progression to clinical aggravation  between glenzocimab and the placebo  both combined with standard treatments. An imbalance in inclusion was observed with regard to the risk factors recognised within this population not in favour of glenzocimab involving patients who usually have high blood pressure  are diabetic or older.February 2022 Positive results of the ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial on patients presenting with Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS)The positive results of the ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial evaluating glenzocimab in combination with the reference treatment (thrombolysis with or without thrombectomy) in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) demonstrated glenzocimab's very favourable safety profile by meeting the main criterion of the trial as well as a significant reduction in the number of intracerebral haemorrhages and mortality in the group treated with glenzocimab.March 2022 Appointment of Corinne Le Goff to the Board of Directors as independent board memberCorinne Le Goff has agreed to join Acticor Biotech's Board of Directors as an independent board member.

The full-year financial report will be included in a registration document due to be published on 27 April 2022.Gilles Avenard  Chief Executive Officer and founder of Acticor Biotech  comments: ""To carry out our clinical trials in treating cardiovascular emergencies  which remains a key public health concern  we have strengthened our financial capacity thanks in particular to our successful IPO on the Euronext Growth market in Paris in October 2021. As a result of this fundraising round supported by our existing shareholders as well as a number of new shareholders  we will continue with the clinical development of our first-in-class drug glenzocimab in stroke treatment. We recently obtained very promising results for our ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial in this indication  and which confirm the clinical interest of GPVI inhibition. In keeping with the roadmap set out at the time of our IPO  we have made a calm and enthusiastic start to 2022  with major clinical milestones to come such as recruiting the first patients in the United States for the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 clinical trial  as well as the start of the GREEN phase 2/3 trial  both in stroke treatment.""Main financial information (audited – in accordance with IFRS)Given the Company’s stage of clinical development  it does not generate any revenue.Research and development costs1 amounted to €7 766 thousand in 2021 compared with €5 770 thousand in 2020. This increase is mainly due to the conduct of the ACTIMIS and GARDEN clinical trials  recruitment for which ended in 2021  as well as the start of the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 clinical trial in Europe and the rise in staff costs.Story continuesOperating and administrative expenses amounted to €3 749 thousand in 2021 compared with €1 483 thousand in 2020. This increase relates primarily to fees and charges incurred within the framework of the IPO on Euronext Growth Paris.The Company therefore sustained a net loss of €12 608 thousand in 2021 compared with €7 651 thousand in 2020.Cash and cash equivalents totalled €11.3 million at 31 December 2021  thanks in particular to the capital increase within the framework of Acticor Biotech’s IPO  which raised €15.5 million.Highlights since the IPOOctober 2021 - Successful IPO on Euronext Growth® in ParisThe IPO enabled the Company to carry out a €15.5 million capital increase by issuing 2 178 176 new ordinary shares.November 2021 - FDA approval of the IND application for glenzocimab in acute ischemic strokeThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the launch in the United States of the clinical development of glenzocimab  a new humanised monoclonal antibody fragment to be used on acute ischemic stroke patients. This active Investigational New Drug (IND) application represents a major step forward and marks the start in the United States of America of the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 clinical trial  evaluating the efficacy of glenzocimab in treating ischemic stroke  in combination with the reference treatment in this indication.February 2022 - Results of the GARDEN phase 2 clinical trial in Covid-19-related respiratory distress syndromeThe results of the GARDEN clinical trial evaluating the use of glenzocimab on Covid-19 patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) confirmed glenzocimab’s high level of tolerance administered in a 1000 mg dose for three consecutive days. It was not possible to demonstrate any difference in the main criterion of efficacy  i.e.  progression to clinical aggravation  between glenzocimab and the placebo  both combined with standard treatments. An imbalance in inclusion was observed with regard to the risk factors recognised within this population not in favour of glenzocimab involving patients who usually have high blood pressure  are diabetic or older.February 2022 - Positive results of the ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial on patients presenting with Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS)The positive results of the ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial evaluating glenzocimab in combination with the reference treatment (thrombolysis with or without thrombectomy) in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) demonstrated glenzocimab’s very favourable safety profile by meeting the main criterion of the trial as well as a significant reduction in the number of intracerebral haemorrhages and mortality in the group treated with glenzocimab.March 2022 - Appointment of Corinne Le Goff to the Board of Directors as independent board memberCorinne Le Goff has agreed to join Acticor Biotech’s Board of Directors as an independent board member. Her appointment will be submitted to the shareholder vote at the combined general meeting of 12 May 2022.Outlook for 2022Acticor Biotech’s clinical strategy consists of developing its drug  glenzocimab  across several major indications in the treatment of cardiovascular emergencies.
