1861,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-auction-market-as-builder-and-buffer-for-the-nft-market-301513738.html,Artmarket.com: auction market as builder and buffer for the NFT Market,PARIS  March 30  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Traditional auction houses have been playing a launchpad role in NFT trading  but they could provide greater stability for this growing market. By providing valuation estimates  they synthesize the current state of supply…,"thierry Ehrmann  CEO and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department: "" By preparing a sale  publishing a catalog several weeks in advance and by giving a range of estimates and guaranteeing the information long after adjudication  the auction house actually 'moderates' the NFT market. This does not prevent prices from soaring if demand is stronger than expected"" .Despite the transparency of blockchain technology  there are plenty of anomalies on major NFT marketplaces. Whether it's fake accounts (like those that appeared around Takashi Murakami) or arbitrage opportunities (offered to those who manage to integrate the whitelists of the most coveted projects)  NFT sales platforms have seen a large number of highly aggressive strategies contributing to price volatility and a degree of instability.Takashi Murakami's 'overly' anticipated NFTsSince the announcement of his Flowers NFT project  Japanese artist Takashi Murakami (ranked 105th in our global ranking of artists by 2021 auction turnover  all periods of creation combined) has been the subject of numerous fraud attempts using Instagram and Twitter accounts with deliberately similar names  such as murekemi.flower2022. By inciting you to mint NFTs as quickly as possible (as most NFT drops do)  these fake projects try to make you buy instantly  without checking the legitimacy of the creator.It is clear that Murakami's NFT project is attracting interest from both traditional collectors and from the crypto community. However  it is looking increasingly likely that his Flowers NFTs will not be launched until around the time of his solo show at the Gagosian in New York  scheduled for May 2022. We will therefore have to wait a little longer than was initially expected to buy into Murakami's digital Flowers.https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2022/takashi-murakami/Unfortunately  the lack of clarity that currently exists on NFT marketplaces as well as on social media is generating a large number of scams. Almost all of today's most famous NFT projects have replicas circulating in large numbers on Opensea. This situation could be improved by a more active presence of stabilizing agents such as auction houses in the NFT ecosystem.At last… a genuine reference priceOf the 10 000 items in the World of Women collection  only one copy went to public auction. Estimated between $400 000 and $665 000 by Christie's  Woman #5672 was sold on 1 March 2022 in London for $600 000 (to which a 26% buyer's fees was added  bringing the total purchase price to $755 000).The value of this work fitted perfectly with the estimate provided by the auction house Christie's. However  the price of this NFT has been very volatile: barely six months ago  Woman #5672 was acquired for $117 000 (37.95 eth) on the OpenSea platform  and the best offer for this NFT is today $70 000 (20 eth).https://opensea.io/assets/0xe785e82358879f061bc3dcac6f0444462d4b5330/5672Because it was outside the blockchain  data relating to Christie's sale does not appear in the work's activity log on OpenSea. On the other hand  the identity (or rather the pseudonym) of the buyer of Woman #5672 has been revealed by Opensea: it is the moonpay.eth account. In this way  the OpenSea platform and Christie's auction house both provide two complementary bits of information.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/03/image1-Abdoulaye-Barry-Globule-Blanc-2022.jpg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

Any such re-registration would need to be effected by Monday 25 April 2022. Shareholders should therefore liaise with and instruct their nominees well in advance thereof.• To be entitled to attend and vote in person at the Meeting  shareholders must notify Euroclear Sweden AB of their intention to attend the Meeting by Monday 25 April 2022 and can do so by (i) e-mail to GeneralMeetingService@euroclear.com or (ii) mail to: Kambi Group plc  c/o Euroclear Sweden AB  Box 191  SE-101 23 Stockholm  Sweden or (iii) by phone on +46 8 402 9092 during the office hours of Euroclear Sweden AB.

Shareholders' right to appoint a proxy • A shareholder who is entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting  is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and vote on his or her behalf. A proxy need not also be a shareholder. If the shareholder is an individual  the proxy form must be signed by the appointer (or his authorised attorney) or comply with Article 126 of the Articles.

If the proxy form is returned to the Company without any indication as to how the proxy shall vote  generally or in respect of a particular resolution  the proxy shall exercise their discretion as to how to vote or whether to abstain from voting  generally or in respect of that particular resolution (as applicable).• Where the shareholder is a corporation  a document evidencing the signatory right of the officer signing the proxy form  must be submitted with the proxy form. Where the proxy form is signed on behalf of the shareholder by an attorney (rather than by an authorised representative  in the case of a corporation)  the original power of attorney or a copy thereof certified or notarised in a manner acceptable to the Board of Directors must be submitted to the Company  failing which the appointment of the proxy may be treated as invalid.• The original signed proxy form and  if applicable  other supporting documents (required pursuant to the above instructions)  must be received by Euroclear Sweden AB no later than Monday 25 April 2022 by (i) e-mail to GeneralMeetingService@euroclear.com or (ii) mail to: Kambi Group plc  c/o Euroclear Sweden AB  Box 191  SE-101 23 Stockholm  Sweden.

(Resolution n) 23. Closing of the Annual General Meeting Information about proposals related to Agenda items Agenda item 2 The Nomination Committee proposes that Lars Stugemo be elected Chair of the Meeting. Agenda item 10 The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM approves the remuneration report on page 55 of the Company's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2021. Agenda item 11 The Nomination Committee proposes that the Board of Directors should consist of five Directors. Agenda item 12 The Nomination Committee appointed by the Directors of the Company pursuant to Article 90 of the Articles  proposes that the aggregate amount per annum of the ordinary remuneration of Directors shall not exceed €360 000 (previously €360 000). The Directors have determined in terms of Articles 68 and 69 of the Articles that the annual amount of the ordinary remuneration of a Director shall be €52 500 (previously €52 500) and of the Chair of the Board shall be €105 000 (previously €105 000). The annual extra remuneration payable to each member of the Audit Committee and the Remuneration Committee shall be €7 000 (previously €7 000). Additionally  the directors have determined that an extra remuneration of €2 000 (previously €1 100) is payable to each director per licence application handled in the US  and a fee  at the rate of €2 100 (previously €2 100) per day spent in the US in conjunction with handling of the applications  is paid to any director as required. Agenda item 18 The Nomination Committee proposes that Lars Stugemo is appointed as the Chair of the Board. Agenda item 19 The Nomination Committee proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that  until the general meeting of the shareholders decides otherwise  the Nomination Committee shall consist of not less than four and not more than five members  of which one shall be the Chair of the Board of Directors. The members of the Nomination Committee shall represent all shareholders and be appointed by the three or four largest shareholders as at 30 September each year  having expressed their willingness to participate in the Nomination Committee. Agenda item 20 Following a formal tender process and in accordance with the recommendation by the Audit Committee  the Nomination Committee proposes that Mazars Malta be re-appointed auditor for the period from the end of the Annual General Meeting 2022 until the end of the Annual General Meeting 2023. The Nomination Committee proposes that the auditor's fees be paid based on approved invoices. Agenda item 21 The objectives of the authorisation are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a directed set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares on each issue date will be used in determining the price at which shares will be issued. For the purposes of Article 88(7) of the Companies Act  through this resolution the members of the Company are also authorising the Board of Directors to restrict or withdraw the members' right of pre-emption that would normally entitle members to be offered the newly issued shares in the Company in proportion to their shareholding before such new shares are offered to third parties. Agenda item 22 The Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition by the Company of its own shares shall take place on First North Growth Market at Nasdaq Stockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares to all members of the Company. Such acquisitions of own shares may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on market terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to First North Growth Market at Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company's annual report and accounts. Any resolution to repurchase own shares will be publicly disclosed. The objective of the buyback and transfer right is to ensure added value for the Company's shareholders and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company's capital structure. Following such buybacks  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or transfer to employees under a company share incentive plan. Once repurchased  further shareholder and Bondholder approval would be required before those shares could be cancelled. If used as consideration for an acquisition the intention would be that they would be issued as shares and not sold first.

Prospective purchasers should be aware that we have the right to redeem the Notes on any Redemption Date  beginning on the first Redemption Date. It is more likely that we will redeem the Notes prior to their stated maturity date to the extent that the interest payable on the Notes is greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments of the issuer of a comparable maturity  terms and credit rating trading in the market. If the Notes are redeemed prior to their stated maturity date  you may have to re-invest the proceeds in a lower interest rate environment. See “—Optional Redemption Feature.”Credit Risk. Our credit ratings and credit spreads may adversely affect the market value of the Notes. Investors are dependent on our ability to pay all amounts due on the Notes on each interest payment date and at maturity  and therefore investors are subject to our credit risk and to changes in the market’s view of our creditworthiness. Any decline in our credit ratings or increase in the credit spreads charged by the market for taking our credit risk is likely to adversely affect the value of the Notes.Fees and Hedging Costs. While the payment at maturity described in this pricing supplement is based on the full principal amount of your Notes  the original offering price of the Notes includes the commission received by BMOCM and other dealers and the cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes. As a result  the price  if any  at which BMOCM may be willing to purchase Notes from you in secondary market transactions will likely be lower than the price you paid for your Notes  and any sale prior to the maturity date could result in a substantial loss to you.P- 3SUPPLEMENTAL TAX CONSIDERATIONSThe following is a general description of material tax considerations relating to the Notes. It does not purport to be a complete analysis of all tax considerations relating to the Notes. Prospective purchasers of the Notes should consult their tax advisers as to the consequences under the tax laws of the country of which they are resident for tax purposes and the tax laws of Canada and the U.S. of acquiring  holding and disposing of the Notes and receiving payments under the Notes. This summary is based upon the law as in effect on the date of this pricing supplement and is subject to any change in law that may take effect after such date.Supplemental Canadian Tax ConsiderationsFor a discussion of the Canadian federal income tax considerations relating to an investment in the notes  please see the section of the prospectus supplement  “Certain Income Tax Consequences—Certain Canadian Income Tax Considerations.”The accompanying prospectus notes that a Holder will not be subject to tax under the Tax Act on any capital gain realized on a disposition or deemed disposition of shares  unless the shares are “taxable Canadian property” to the Holder for purposes of the Tax Act and the Holder is not entitled to relief under an applicable income tax convention between Canada and the country in which the Holder is resident.Generally  the shares will not constitute taxable Canadian property to a Holder at a particular time provided that the shares are listed at that time on a designated stock exchange (which includes the Toronto Stock Exchange)  unless at any particular time during the 60-month period that ends at that time (1) the Holder  persons with whom the Holder does not deal with at arm’s length  and partnerships in which the Holder or persons with whom the Holder does not deal at arm’s length holds a membership interest directly or indirectly through one or more partnerships  or the Holder together with all such persons and partnerships  has owned 25% or more of the issued shares of any class or series of our capital stock and (2) more than 50% of the fair market value of the shares was derived directly or indirectly from one or any combination of: (i) real or immovable properties situated in Canada  (ii) “Canadian resource properties” (as defined in the Tax Act)  (iii) “timber resource properties” (as defined in the Tax Act)  and (iv) options in respect of  or interests in  or for civil law rights in  property in any of the foregoing whether or not the property exists. Notwithstanding the foregoing  in certain circumstances set out in the Tax Act  shares could be deemed to be taxable Canadian property. Holders whose shares may constitute taxable Canadian property should consult their own tax advisors.Supplemental U.S. Tax ConsiderationsThe following section supplements the discussion of U.S. federal income taxation in the accompanying prospectus and prospectus supplement with respect to United States holders (as defined in the accompanying prospectus). It applies only to those United States holders who are not excluded from the discussion of U.S. federal income taxation in the accompanying prospectus. It does not apply to holders subject to special rules including holders subject to Section 451(b) of the Code. For purposes of this discussion  any interest with respect to the Notes  as determined for U.S. federal income tax purposes  will be treated as from sources outside the United States.You should consult your tax advisor concerning the U.S. federal income tax and other tax consequences of your investment in the Notes in your particular circumstances  including the application of state  local or other tax laws and the possible effects of changes in federal or other tax laws.Backup Withholding and Information ReportingPlease see the discussion under “United States Federal Income Taxation — Backup Withholding and Information Reporting” in the accompanying prospectus for a description of the applicability of the backup withholding and information reporting rules to payments made on your Notes.P- 4Foreign Account Tax Compliance ActThe Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act imposes a 30% U.S. withholding tax on certain U.S. source payments  including interest (and OID)  dividends  other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gain  profits  and income (“Withholdable Payments”)  if paid to a foreign financial institution (including amounts paid to a foreign financial institution on behalf of a holder)  unless such institution enters into an agreement with the Treasury Department to collect and provide to the Treasury Department substantial information regarding U.S. account holders  including certain account holders that are foreign entities with U.S. owners  with such institution. A Note may constitute an account for these purposes. The legislation also generally imposes a withholding tax of 30% on Withholdable Payments made to a non-financial foreign entity unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification that it does not have any substantial U.S. owners or a certification identifying the direct and indirect substantial U.S. owners of the entity.The U.S. Treasury Department has proposed regulations that eliminate the requirement of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act withholding on payments of gross proceeds upon the sale or disposition of financial instruments. The U.S. Treasury Department has indicated that taxpayers may rely on these proposed regulations pending their finalization  and the discussion above assumes the proposed regulations will be finalized in their proposed form with retroactive effect.If we (or an applicable withholding agent) determine withholding is appropriate with respect to the Notes  we (or such agent) will withhold tax at the applicable statutory rate  and we will not pay any additional amounts in respect of such withholding. Account holders subject to information reporting requirements pursuant to the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act may include holders of the Notes. Foreign financial institutions and non-financial foreign entities located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the United States governing the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act may be subject to different rules. Holders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this legislation on their investment in the Notes.P- 5EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACTA fiduciary of a pension  profit-sharing or other employee benefit plan subject to the U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  as amended (“ERISA”) (each  a “Plan”)  should consider the fiduciary standards of ERISA in the context of the Plan’s particular circumstances before authorizing an investment in the Notes. Among other factors  the fiduciary should consider whether the investment would satisfy the prudence and diversification requirements of ERISA and would be consistent with the documents and instruments governing the Plan  and whether the investment would involve a prohibited transaction under ERISA or the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).Section 406 of ERISA and Section 4975 of the Code prohibit Plans  as well as individual retirement accounts  Keogh plans and any other plans that are subject to Section 4975 of the Code (also “Plans”)  from engaging in certain transactions involving “plan assets” with persons who are “parties in interest” under ERISA or “disqualified persons” under the Code with respect to the Plan. A violation of these prohibited transaction rules may result in excise tax or other liabilities under ERISA or the Code for those persons  unless exemptive relief is available under an applicable statutory  regulatory or administrative exemption. Employee benefit plans that are governmental plans (as defined in Section 3(32) of ERISA)  certain church plans (as defined in Section 3(33) of ERISA) and non-U.S. plans (as described in Section 4(b)(4) of ERISA) (“Non-ERISA Arrangements”) are not subject to the requirements of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code but may be subject to similar provisions under applicable federal  state  local  non-U.S. or other laws (“Similar Laws”).The acquisition of Notes by a Plan or any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by reason of any Plan’s investment in the entity (a “Plan Asset Entity”) with respect to which we or certain of our affiliates is or becomes a party in interest or disqualified person may result in a prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code  unless the Notes are acquired pursuant to an applicable exemption. The U.S. Department of Labor has issued five prohibited transaction class exemptions  or “PTCEs”  that may provide exemptive relief if required for direct or indirect prohibited transactions that may arise from the purchase or holding of Notes. These exemptions are PTCE 84-14 (for certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers)  PTCE 90-1 (for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts)  PTCE 91-38 (for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds)  PTCE 95-60 (for transactions involving certain insurance company general accounts)  and PTCE 96-23 (for transactions managed by in-house asset managers). In addition  ERISA Section 408(b)(17) and Section 4975(d)(20) of the Code provide an exemption for the purchase and sale of securities offered hereby  provided that neither the issuer of securities offered hereby nor any of its affiliates have or exercise any discretionary authority or control or render any investment advice with respect to the assets of any Plan involved in the transaction  and provided further that the Plan pays no more and receives no less than “adequate consideration” in connection with the transaction (the “service provider exemption”). There can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied.Any purchaser or holder of Notes or any interest therein will be deemed to have represented by its purchase and holding of Notes offered hereby that it either (1) is not a Plan  a Plan Asset Entity or a Non-ERISA Arrangement and is not purchasing the Notes on behalf of or with the assets of any Plan  a Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement or (2) the purchase and holding of the Notes will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or a similar violation under any applicable Similar Laws.Due to the complexity of these rules and the penalties that may be imposed upon persons involved in non-exempt prohibited transactions  it is important that fiduciaries or other persons considering purchasing Notes on behalf of or with the assets of any Plan  a Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement consult with their counsel regarding the availability of exemptive relief under any of the PTCEs listed above  the service provider exemption or the potential consequences of any purchase or holding under Similar Laws  as applicable. Purchasers of Notes have exclusive responsibility for ensuring that their purchase and holding of Notes do not violate the fiduciary or prohibited transaction rules of ERISA or the Code or any similar provisions of Similar Laws. The sale of any Notes to a Plan  Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement is in no respect a representation by us or any of our affiliates or representatives that such an investment meets all relevant legal requirements with respect to investments by any such Plans  Plan Asset Entities or Non-ERISA Arrangements generally or any particular Plan  Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement or that such investment is appropriate for such Plans  Plan Asset Entities or Non-ERISA Arrangements generally or any particular Plan  Plan Asset Entity or Non-ERISA Arrangement.P- 6SUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)BMOCM will purchase the Notes from us on the settlement date at prices as specified on the cover page of this pricing supplement.

""Our clinical program evaluating first-in-class radioenhancer  NBTXR3  yielded compelling new data suggesting that our lead therapeutic candidate may improve treatment outcomes for patients both as a single-agent activated by radiotherapy for local diseases and as a combination therapy with anti-PD-1 for systemic disease. We also achieved the launch of our pivotal phase III study  NANORAY-312-a critical milestone as we advance toward global registration in head and neck cancer. 2022 has already seen the enrollment of our first European patients in NANORAY-312  and we expect the first patients in the U.S. and Asia this year. In parallel  we continue to make consistent progress in our Company-led immunotherapy pathway  along with the additional studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor indications and therapeutic combinations led by strategic collaborators. We are steadfast in our commitment to bring the potential benefits of NBTXR3 to millions of patients around the world  and in 2022 we will focus on executing our ongoing studies  defining our registration strategy in immunotherapy  and generating more evidence to support the broad applicability of our technology.""1 Financial data taken from the Company’s consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ending December 31  2021  which were approved by its executive board and reviewed by its supervisory board on March 30  2022. The statutory auditors of the Company have completed their audit work on the 2021 financial statements  but have not issued their audit report yet. Such reports should be publicly available in the Company’s 2021 universal registration document and 2021 annual report on Form 20-F.2021 Operational Highlights  Pipeline Status and Upcoming MilestonesPriority Pathway in Head & Neck Cancer  Local Control as Single Agent Activated by RadiotherapyData from Expansion Study 102  a phase I study evaluating NBTXR3 as a single agent activated by radiotherapy (RT) in high-risk  elderly locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (LAHNSCC) patients ineligible for cetuximab and intolerant to cisplatin  was presented at the 2021 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO 21) continued to support NBTXR3 administration as feasible and well-tolerated. At a median follow up of 9.5 months  evaluable patients (n=41) demonstrated a best observed target lesion objective response rate (ORR) of 85.4% and a best observed target lesion complete response rate (CRR) of 63.4%.A recent review of data from Expansion Study 102 shows  as of February 22  2022  an on-going median overall survival (mOS) of 17.9 months in the all treated population (n=56) and 23.0 months in evaluable patients (n=44) demonstrating continued improvement relative to the analysis presented at ASTRO 21 and consistent with data reported from the dose escalation phase of Study 102.Expansion Study 102 is now fully enrolled with 44 evaluable patients. The last treatment visit for the final patient is expected in Q2 2022 and data reflecting one year of follow-up are expected in mid-2023NANORAY-312  a pivotal phase III global registration study evaluating NBTXR3 as a single-agent activated by RT for elderly patients with LA-HNSCC intolerant to cisplatin initiated in Q1 2022 and actively enrolling patients across multiple European sites with U.S. site activation anticipated in mid-2022.Priority Pathway in Immunotherapy for Advanced Cancers  Priming Immune Response in Combination with Anti-PD-1 Treatment:Preclinical data was presented at the 2021 Annual Meeting of the Society for the Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) showing RT-activated NBTXR3 increased CD8+ T cell infiltration and modulated the T cell receptor repertoire  suggesting stronger immune priming triggered by the therapy compared to radiotherapy alone.Updated data from Study 1100  a phase I basket study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by RT in combination with nivolumab or pembrolizumab in locoregional recurrent or recurrent metastatic HNSCC (LRR or R/RM HNSCC)  lung and/or liver metastasis from any primary tumor presented at ASTRO 21 demonstrated a disease control rate of 81% (n=16) in the evaluable patient population  including 73% in patients with prior primary or secondary resistance to anti-PD-1. In the evaluable population  3 complete responses and 5 partial responses were reported. Some delayed tumor responses and/or abscopal effects were reported  suggesting NBTXR3 may potentially prime an immune response.Reporting of recommended Phase II dose for each cohort is expected in 2022 along with the initiation of a new expansion Phase of Study 1100 evaluating NBTXR3 in combination with nivolumab or pembrolizumab in a cohort of patients LRR or R/M HNSCC resistant to prior anti-PD-(L)-1 therapy  a cohort of LRR or R/M HNSCC patients naïve to anti-PD-(L)-1 therapy  and cohort of patients resistant to prior anti-PD-(L)-1 therapy with lung  liver or soft tissue metastasis from select solid tumors.Expect to provide updated Study 1100 data at a medical conference during the fourth quarter of 2022Expanding NBTXR3 Opportunity  Collaborating with World-Class Partners to Validate Tumor-Agnostic  Combination-Agnostic Therapeutic Profile:Formed strategic partnership with LianBio to develop and commercialize NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations in China and other Asian markets. LianBio is expected to begin enrolling patients in NANORAY-312 in China in H2 2022 as the first of up to five registrational studies covered by the collaboration.Presented preclinical data  developed in collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson)  at SITC 21 suggesting the combination of RT-activated NBTXR3  antiPD-1  anti-LAG3  and anti-TIGIT significantly elevated the activities of anti-tumor immune response in both irradiated and unirradiated tumors  improving local and distant tumor control and increasing survival rate.Published data from a preclinical study conducted in collaboration between MD Anderson in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology  Biology  Physics (Red Journal) supportive of the hypothesis that RT-activated NBTXR3 in combination with anti-PD-1 could effectively control primary and metastatic tumors  evoke abscopal effect  and reduce the possibility of developing distant lung metastases.Initiated fifth collaborator-led clinical study at MD Anderson Cancer Center.Published peer-reviewed clinical case study reported preliminary data on the first-in-human administration of NBTXR3 for the treatment of pancreatic cancer not eligible for surgery  demonstrating feasibility with no treatment-related toxicity.Determination of recommended phase II dose for NBTXR3 in pancreatic cancer expected in 2022.Full Year 2021 Financial ResultsCash and Cash Equivalents: As of December 31  2021  Nanobiotix had €83.9 million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to €119.2 million as of December 31  2020. This net decrease of €35.3 million primarily reflects €51.8 million of net cash flows used in operating  investing and financing activities of Nanobiotix which was partially offset by the €16.5 million ($20.0 million) upfront payment associated with the LianBio collaboration announced in May 2021. As previously announced  PharmaEngine was eligible for and received a €2.1 million ($2.5 million) payment following the announcement of the LianBio collaboration and has received €3.4 million ($4.0 million) in conjunction with the completion of various administrative steps in connection with the winding-up of the collaboration. PharmaEngine will be eligible and is expected to receive in 2022 an additional $1.0 million in administrative fees and  upon a second regulatory approval of an NBTXR3-containing product  a final payment of $5.0 million.Based on the current operating plan and financial projections  Nanobiotix anticipates that the cash and cash equivalents of €83.9 million as of December 31  2021  will fund its operations into the second quarter of 2023.Revenue: Full year 2021 revenue totaled €9.7k compared to €50.0k for the year ended December 31  2020. The revenue generated in 2021 was primarily related to the Company’s now concluded collaboration with PharmaEngine  Inc. Other income includes research tax credits which increased from €1.9 million in 2020 to €2.5 million in 2021 due mainly to an increase of research and development expenses.Research and Development (“R&D”) Expenses: R&D expenses consist primarily of preclinical  clinical  and manufacturing expenses related to the development of NBTXR3 and totaled €30.4 million for the twelve-month period ended December 31  2021  as compared to €24.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2020. The increase in net R&D expenses was primarily due to increases in development costs related to the Company’s priority pathways  including preparation and initiation of its pivotal Phase III registration study  NANORAY-312  continuation of Expansion Study 102 and its ongoing immunotherapy combination Study 1100 as well as increases in personnel related expenses  including share-based compensation.Selling  General and Administrative (“SG&A”) Expenses: SG&A expenses consist primarily of administrative employee-related expenses  legal and other professional fees  patent filing and maintenance fees  and insurance. These expenses were €19.4 million year-ended December 31  2021  as compared to €14.6 million for twelve-months ended December 31  2020. The increase in G&A expenses year-over-year was due to increased headcount  consulting fees  legal & compliance expenses resulting from the Nasdaq listing and recruitment expenses.Net loss: Net loss attributable to shareholders was €47.0 million  or €1.35 per share  for the twelve-month period ended December 31  2021. This compares to a net loss of €33.6 million  or €1.38 per share for the year ended December 31  2020.Conference Call and WebcastNanobiotix will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Thursday  March 31  2022  at 8:00 AM EDT / 2:00 PM CET  prior to the open of the U.S. market.

The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy; and a phase III global registrational study initiated patient enrollment in 2022. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the planned phase III study.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/ metastatic HNSCC and lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a strategic collaboration strategy with world class partners to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

The Company is required under Belgian law to have its accounts audited by either an EU audit firm or a third country audit firm registered in Belgium. Following Brexit  the Company’s statutory auditor PwC UK ceased to be an EU audit firm on 30 June 2021.The Company has been informed that there is currently no legal mechanism for PwC UK to register as a third country audit firm in Belgium; the Company is therefore required to also have its accounts audited by PwC Belgium. A new date for the publication of its results will be set and these will be released before the end of April 2022 as required under the applicable rules.ENDContactsAcacia Pharma Group plcMike Bolinder  CEO+44 1223 919760 / +1 317 505 1280IR@acaciapharma.comInternational MediaFrazer Hall  Mark Swallow  David DibleMEDiSTRAVA Consulting+44 20 3928 6900acaciapharma@medistrava.comUS InvestorsLifeSci AdvisorsIrina Koffler+1 917-734-7387ikoffler@lifesciadvisors.com Media in Belgium and the NetherlandsChris Van Raemdonck+32 499 58 55 31chrisvanraemdonck@telenet.beAbout Acacia PharmaAcacia Pharma is a hospital pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new products aimed at improving the care of patients undergoing significant treatments such as surgery  other invasive procedures  or cancer chemotherapy.

This  together with the recovery of Convention & Exhibition activity and the delivery of URW’s committed pipeline  will support the return of Group EBITDA for Europe to 2019 levels in 2024. URW will reinstate a sustainable dividend from the fiscal year 2023 in line with the company’s disciplined capital allocation framework.URW’s unrivalled European portfolio also provides a unique platform to generate significant new revenues from advertising  brand experience and data by turning URW’s 2021 footfall of 550 million annual visits into qualified audiences highly valued by brands. URW’s investments in media assets and data capabilities will generate €75 Mn in annual net revenues1 by 2024  a €45 Mn increase compared to 2021  with strong growth potential beyond the plan horizon.Story continuesURW will unlock untapped asset value through targeted  sustainable mixed-use development  with an emphasis on residential opportunities. This includes the delivery of €2.0 Bn2 of the committed pipeline by the end of 2024 that will generate a stabilised NRI of €125 Mn3. URW has also identified up to 2.4 million sqm4 of development opportunities  with the target of adding €1 Bn5 to the Group’s controlled pipeline by 2024. URW will retain full flexibility about how and when to launch these new projects and will deploy limited predevelopment expenses in the coming three years.URW confirmed that it is on track to meet the industry-leading commitments in its Better Places 2030 ESG strategy and will announce an update in 2023  with the aim of enhancing the Group’s decarbonisation commitments.Jean-Marie Tritant  Chief Executive Officer of URW  said: “By 2024  we will have successfully reshaped the business to capture future growth  centred on our portfolio of Flagship destinations in the wealthiest cities and catchment areas in Europe.Physical stores are a vital part of leading brands’ omnichannel and drive-to-store strategy  a role reinforced and validated by the post-pandemic recovery. Our top 50 retailers in Europe6 have increased their GLA and MGR with us since 2019  while in many cases streamlining their store portfolios elsewhere. This dynamic will support a full recovery of our European retail NRI and Group EBITDA on a stabilised basis to pre-COVID levels.Our platform of shopping and lifestyle destinations in Europe presents a powerful opportunity to grow media advertising and brand experience revenues by converting our European footfall of 550 million visits in 2021 into qualified audiences. We are building the capabilities to market URW’s pan-European platform to advertisers by creating a dedicated business division  powered by new data intelligence. These strong foundations will generate €75 million in annual net revenues by 2024  with significant upside potential.We will deliver €2 billion in projects from our committed pipeline by 2024  generating €125 million of stabilised NRI  and will add €1 billion in densification development opportunities to our controlled pipeline.This is the beginning of an exciting journey for URW that will reshape the business to focus on our core strengths in Europe  create a new media platform and unlock value from our asset portfolio to generate sustainable growth by 2024 and beyond.”The company’s plan will be presented by URW’s Management Board at an investor event today starting at 10:30 CET.

The Group is positioned to execute the radical reduction in financial exposure to the US over the course of 2022 and 2023  supported by the quality of its US assets  of which 95% are in the A-category9  as well as the strength of the recovery which is driving occupancy and rental growth for long term leases.In Europe  URW will secure the remaining €1.5 Bn of its €4 Bn disposal programme by the end of 2022. This process combines the full sale of non-core assets as well as the disposal of stakes to institutional investors  where URW will receive asset and property management fees going forward.Once completed  URW’s LTV  is expected to be below or around 40% including the Group’s hybrid bonds.RETURN OF RETAIL NRI & GROUP EBITDAFollowing completion of the deleveraging process  URW will be a European pure play with a €41 Bn portfolio10 of high-quality and well-located assets. 95% of the Group’s European retail assets are in the A-category9.These assets generate higher sales intensity for retailers  as well as increased value given the role of the physical store as part of their omnichannel and drive-to-store strategy.Key retailers are increasing their footprint with URW. Between 2019 and 2021  the Group’s top 50 retailers in Europe  who account for 29% of total MGR  increased their GLA by an average of 7% for an average MGR increase of 6%.URW expects tenant sales to return to pre-COVID levels in 2022  occupancy and variable income in the course of 2023  and retail NRI on a run rate basis in 2023  with full effect in 2024. In 2024  the Group forecasts Retail NRI of €1.56 Bn and EBITDA of circa €1.9 Bn for its streamlined European portfolio.The Group’s Convention and Exhibition business is expected to further recover in 2022 and return to normalised levels in 2023  ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics. URW’s Offices business will benefit from the full letting of recently completed projects as well as new deliveries.GROWTH OF NEW REVENUESURW has created a dedicated division to generate increased revenues from advertising  brand experience and data services.The new division will generate €75 Mn in annual net revenues by 2024 with €23 Mn in additional CAPEX11 to support this growth. This investment will be split between upgrading and increasing the Group’s 1 700 in-mall advertising screens  and the roll out of fully GDPR-compliant technology to qualify footfall at URW’s Westfield-branded malls.UNLOCKING VALUE THROUGH MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTURW will continue to maximise the value of its assets through targeted mixed-use development  capitalising on its established position in the most valuable European real estate markets with high barriers to entry.By 2024  URW will deliver €2 Bn of its committed pipeline which will generate €125 Mn in stabilized NRI. In addition  URW will unlock further development opportunities embedded in its assets during the plan horizon  with a potential €1 Bn in projects to add to its controlled pipeline  with limited predevelopment expenses.Underpinned by the Group’s disciplined capital allocation approach  URW will focus on densifying its flagships with office  hotels and residential  as well as repurposing retail space and  where appropriate  extending to add high-growth alternative uses.BUILDING ON ESG LEADERSHIPURW launched its ambitious  industry leading Better Places 2030 ESG strategy in 2016 and has consistently ranked in the top-quartile on ESG performance. URW’s comprehensive approach addresses all stakeholders and the Group’s carbon reduction targets have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative and are consistent with levels required to meet the Paris agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 °C.URW is on track to meet all Better Places 2030 commitments  including cutting carbon emissions across its value chain by 50% between 2015 and 2030. The Group has also made good progress in energy efficiency and green energy usage. 90% of URW assets in Europe have received Outstanding or Excellent ratings from the BREEAM IN-USE certification  the world’s leading sustainability assessment method  compared to 30% for the European Retail Real Estate sector as a whole.URW is committed to contributing to global carbon neutrality and will present a step-change update to its plan in 2023 with a view to establishing new commitments.CAPITAL ALLOCATION & DIVIDENDURW outlined its disciplined capital allocation framework that balances continued investment in future growth with maintaining a strong balance sheet.URW will continue to sell mature assets that do not meet its return criteria or that do not fit its destination strategy. URW will continue to invest in projects and acquisitions on an opportunistic basis  looking at the expected Internal Rate of Return  the level of risk and any balance sheet constraints. URW will resume the payment of sustainable dividend from fiscal year 2023.For further information  please contact :Investor RelationsMaarten Otte+33 7 63 86 88 78Maarten.Otte@urw.comMedia RelationsCornelia Schnepf – Finelk+44 7387 108 998Cornelia.Schnepf@finelk.euAbout Unibail-Rodamco-WestfieldUnibail-Rodamco-Westfield is the premier global developer and operator of Flagship Destinations  with a portfolio valued at €54.5 Bn as at December 31  2021  of which 86% in retail  6% in offices  5% in convention & exhibition venues and 2% in services.

That makes choosing the right mattress no easy matter. And a lot of people don’t know whether they actually prefer a hard or soft mattress or something in between. Beter Bed aims to help! By screening customers and letting them feel for themselves what a good night’s sleep means  the ‘Beter Slapen ID’ system takes just a few minutes to provide an independent mattress recommendation based on the customer's personal needs. Introduction of the new system is in line with the company’s strategy presented last year for modernising its current stores.Beter Bed intends switching to three different types of stores. The first are experience stores such as the one recently opened at the Sontplein retail area in Groningen; these stores have a strategic function within a region. They will be joined by city stores  with the first (200 m2) opening at the Mall of the Netherlands in June. Beter Bed also aims to introduce this concept in inner-city shopping streets. Over the next few years  the company's current shopping-centre stores will also be modernised.Beter Slapen ID: personal  data-driven sleep adviceIn line with its “Sleep Better  Live Better” mission  Beter Bed is supporting these shopping concepts with a new service: Beter Slapen ID. This system uses sensors to measure the customer's body and matches the results with data about our entire mattress range. Using the results of this test combined with the knowledge of our sleep consultants  we can offer customised  independent mattress advice. The device has been successfully tested in two stores over the past few months.""During tests with this new technology  it became clear that many people have very different preferences than they initially thought. In the near future  Beter Bed wants to make it possible for people to take measurements themselves at home so as to discover their ideal sleep solution. Customers can already be measured in 12 stores in the Netherlands (Groningen Sontplein  Den Bosch  Zoeterwoude  Amsterdam Arena  Rotterdam Alexandrium  Heerlen  Veenendaal  Breda  Leeuwarden  Apeldoorn  and The Hague) and in the Belgian city of Genk. A whole series of measurements and thousands of calculations provide an objective overview of the five most suitable mattresses within just five minutes. And that’s only the beginning  many more will follow""  says a proud Perijn Hoefsloot  responsible for Strategic Business Development at Beter Bed.Story continuesFollowing the success of the Peter de Beter Bed-weter campaign  the introduction of the Beter Slapen ID will be supported by an extensive marketing campaign on TV  radio and online.About Beter Bed HoldingBeter Bed Holding (BBH) is the Netherlands’ leading sleep specialist in retail  wholesale and B2B.Our mission is simple.

1924,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.whitecase.com/publications/insight/global-ipos-blockbuster-year/european-ipo-activity,European IPO activity proved strong  led by e-commerce and tech listings - White & Case LLP,SubscribeStay current on your favorite topics253%The year-on-year percentage increase in value of the European IPO market in 2021,"253% The year-on-year percentage increase in value of the European IPO market in 2021It was a blockbuster year for IPOs of European firms  following the global trend. In total  476 European firms listed last year  excluding SPACs. Collectively  they raised US$90 billion. That represented increases of 156 percent and 253 percent  respectively  compared to 2020.This was  by some margin  the busiest year for IPOs of European companies on record  even without counting SPACs  which likewise had a banner year—64 European SPACs listed in 2021  raising a total of US$13.8 billion. This represented an annual growth of 392 percent and 339 percent  respectively (see ""A rollercoaster year for SPACs"" on p. 6 for more on SPACs).The range of businesses coming to market last year was remarkably wide. Indeed  each of the five largest IPOs of the year featured a different sector. From transport to telecoms and from technology to machinery  businesses in every area of the market were able to raise money.InPost leads the wayThe largest 2021 deal involving a European company saw Polish logistics operator InPost list on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange in an IPO raising US$3.9 billion  underlining the huge demand for businesses offering exposure to the booming e-commerce market and the supply chains that support it.The second-biggest IPO of a European company also played into an important structural shift. Volvo Cars raised US$2.7 billion in a listing on Nasdaq Stockholm that will support the Swedish auto manufacturer's move into electric cars  as the industry transitions to cleaner technologies in the face of climate change.Similarly  Vantage Towers benefited from another market development. The business  created by the telecoms giant Vodafone  builds and operates the infrastructure that enables mobile networks  which carry increasing data traffic  to operate across Europe. Its IPO  with a listing in Frankfurt  raised US$2.6 billion last year.Technology IPOs race ahead—followed by finance and life sciencesOverall  technology was the single busiest sector for IPO activity last year  with 162 new issues that raised US$27.5 billion. As in other markets  those figures include a number of businesses that are better described as technology-enabled  rather than pure technology plays. For example  the year's biggest IPO in the sector was for Allfunds  which operates an online marketplace for the investment industry  connecting asset managers with customers such as retail banks and wealth managers. Allfunds  which is based in Spain  raised US$2.6 billion.In second place  life sciences businesses were also market favorites; the sector completed 65 IPOs that raised US$8.9 billion. Deals such as the US$974 million listing of animal health group Vimian and the US$932 million IPO of Swiss drug maker PolyPeptide underscored investors' demand for exposure to the life sciences sector.Finance was the third-biggest sectoral contributor to last year's IPO figures  with 33 new issues raising US$7.8 billion in the aggregate. The sector continues to see consolidation and innovation  particularly in the fintech arena  but there is also growing interest in IPOs from businesses that have previously preferred to stay private. In particular  last year's US$1.2 billion IPO of UK private equity firm Bridgepoint turned heads. Following the strong stock market performance of Sweden's EQT AB since its 2019 listing  the Bridgepoint deal was another success for the private equity sector.Sweden was second only to the UK in IPO volumes last year  amid increasing demand for businesses across the Nordics.Nordics flourish while the UK bucks BrexitThe Vimian deal was among Sweden's largest IPOs of 2021 in a boom year for new issues in the country  which also included the listings of Volvo Cars and oat milk producer Oatly. Sweden was second only to the UK in IPO volumes last year  amid increasing demand for businesses across the Nordics.That represented a continuation of the flourishing IPO market seen in the Nordic region for several years now  with a strong startup community  supportive regulation and a healthy domestic institutional investment industry all contributing to this performance. The very strong performance of Sweden's stock market in particular last year—up 23.5 percent—also encouraged IPO activity  and issuers in the region won praise for their speedy adaptation to the pandemic; they were early adopters of tools such as virtual roadshows  for example.In the UK  meanwhile  the uncertainties of Brexit do not appear to have dampened the IPO market. Last year saw 133 IPOs of UK companies—almost a quarter of Europe's total volume—which raised US$25.3 billion. That was a 209 percent increase in volume on the previous year and a 204 percent increase by value.Although a couple of IPOs performed poorly in the aftermarket—food delivery business Deliveroo  for example  saw its share price trade at approximately 33 percent below listing price one month after listing  and e-commerce group The Hut Group (THG) has similarly been trading below its IPO price since its January 2021 listing—the London Stock Exchange continued to attract a number of technology and high-growth issuers including Oxford Nanopore  Wise  Darktrace and Trustpilot.In addition to tech IPOs  the LSE is still attracting listings from other sectors  plus listings from foreign issuers. Singaporean food firm Olam International  for instance  announced last year its intention to seek a dual listing in London and Singapore in the second half of 2022.Events in Ukraine send markets into turmoilEven under normal circumstances  European IPO activity would have struggled to match the same heights as the blockbuster 2021  but events in Ukraine only further depressed the potential for listing activity in the region. Equity markets in Europe will likely remain volatile as long as the situation lasts  especially given Europe's dependence on Russia for energy. Soaring oil and gas prices and potential shortages could have knock-on effects on the rest of the economy  and further destabilize stock markets. As such  new listings activity is likely to be muted until later in the year.In time  however  listings should come trickling back. Although central banks are poised to raise interest rates this year  any hike will be modest  and alternative options will be limited for investors. Broad secular trends such as digitalization and the energy transition will provide further impetus for new listings. As long as volatility eases  listings should return to European markets.Click here to read the full magazineGlobal IPOs: A blockbuster yearThis publication is provided for your convenience and does not constitute legal advice.

The Egide Group's consolidated revenue for 2021 was €32.50 million  up 8.5% compared to 2020.The revenue had been impacted in H1-2021 by delays in the reconstruction of the Cambridge plating shop due to supply of materials for the plating equipment. Before the end of the year  the plating shop was 100% operational  and had been audited by a number of key customers in the US Aerospace and Defense markets. The overall growth would have been greater if not for the labor shortages experienced in the US due to the pandemic. Both technical professionals and direct labor demand have not been fulfilled in H2. This will require new strategies in 2022 to as the labor market continues to be tight in the US. The revenue of the American entities represents 56% of the total revenue of the group.For information  the average euro/dollar exchange rate in 2021 was 1.18 compared to 1.14 in 2020.RESULTS AS OF 12/31/2021EBITDA (restated of rents) amounted to €1.5m  compared with €3.8m in 2020.Non recurrent items (fire insurance and expenses  PPP  impairment) represent a positive impact of 1.09m€ in 2021 vs 4.53m€ in 2020  which decrease is mainly due to plating subcontracting (shown in External costs) of 2.84m€ in 2021.Considering all these elements  the Egide Group generated a net profit of €0.05m on December 31  2021 (compared to €0.98 in 2020).CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 31  2021ASSETS * LIABILITIES * 2021 2020 2021 2020 Fixed assets 9.5 6.5 Equity 11.4 10.6 Usage rights of leased assets 2.0 2.3 Other financial fixed assets 0.5 0.5 Accruals 0.9 0.8 Differed tax assets 0.7 0.8 Financial debt 7.8 6.6 Inventory  AR and other assets 13.8 16.3 Rent debts 2.2 2.5 Cash 1.6 1.4 AP & other 5.8 7.3 TOTAL 28.1 27.8 TOTAL 28.1 27.8* In €M – UnauditedFixed assets include depreciation of 0.3M€ because of Impairment of Santier and 2.6M€ Capex financed by the insurance in Cambridge + 0.4M€ in Egide SA + 0.5 M€ release of impairment depreciation from 2018 in Egide SA.The financial debts include the reclass of 1.8M€ from long to short term due to covenants in Egide USA and Santier not respected. The current financial institution has given the company until June 30th to find another partner. Investment grant waiting for depreciation and lease to be recognized as profit.The working capital represents 90 days of revenue.SIGNIFICANT SUBSEQUENT EVENTS AFTER DECEMBER 31ST  2021 : LEASE BACK PROCESS FOR EGIDE USA IN CAMBRIDGEEgide USA (Cambridge) would sell its building to strengthen its cash position and finance future investments. A Lease arrangement for the facility is being negotiated with the potential owner for 15 years  with option for an additional 10 years. Negotiations and due diligence audits are in progress with a contract expected to be signed before end H1 2022 for $6M.This operation would allow Egide Group to reduce its American debt to almost zero  and make a capital gain of nearly $3M.2022 OUTLOOKThe good rhythm of our order book build-up over the end of 2021  driven largely by the Defense sector  provides a solid foundation for growth in 2022.Geopolitical situation in Europe should have a positive effect although a concrete sign regarding order intake has yet to be seen. Defense contractors in both the EU and US have indicated  without clear purchase orders  that they expect their respective businesses to be strong in H2.In addition  the sale-leaseback of the Cambridge facility (underway in H1-2022) will strengthen the Group’s cash position.Egide SA expects an acceleration of its revenues through new customer acquisition in the thermal imaging market  by multiple new engagements for next generation high speed communication transceivers. Multiple new important projects acquired in 2021 will ramp in 2022 boosting Israel and China regions revenue.Egide USA’s HTCC ceramics order book has recovered with close to $ 1 million backlog  including two new customers. A multi-year multi-million $ agreement with its largest power customer has been confirmed with new orders. And significant increase is expected for the thermal battery market. A new sales team in the US is working to develop new opportunities for Santier’s capabilities – thermal management materials and machining capabilities. Order intake in Q1 appears to reflect that the team is successful.Jim Collins  Chairman and CEO  comments: ""While many businesses have been hampered significantly by the pandemic  Egide Group continues to be resilient and defy the challenges brought by the pandemic and our industrial fire in Cambridge. Our loyal customers continue to support our business units  and it has resulted in very strong order intake in Q4-2021 and Q1-2022. We expect 2022 to be a year of improved revenue and margins for the Group. ”FINANCIAL CALENDARGeneral Meeting : June 16  20222022 H1 revenue: July 21  2022CONTACTSEGIDE – Finance Department - Luc Ardon - +33 4 90 30 35 94 – luc.ardon@fr.egide-group.comFIN’EXTENSO – Press Relations - Isabelle Aprile - +33 6 17 38 61 78 – i.aprile@finextenso.frAbout Egide - www.egide-group.comEgide is a group with an international dimension. specialized in the manufacture of hermetic packages and heat dissipation solutions for sensitive electronic components.

Accor is the largest hotel operator in Queensland  with 101 hotels across the state and ...,"An uplift in occupancy levels on the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast is driving a resurgence in Queensland hotel performances for Australia’s largest hotel group.Accor is the largest hotel operator in Queensland  with 101 hotels across the state and over 4 000 team members.For the period between January – March 2022  Accor’s Queensland hotels recorded an average occupancy of 70% compared to 67% in the same period in 2019  prior to Covid-19.The figures for 2022 exclude nearly all international travel to the state and take into account the impact of the Omicron variant.The two leading destinations for Accor in Q1 2022 were the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast.The Gold Coast  which suffered significantly from losses of international travel due to closed borders until mid-February  saw domestic markets recover strongly  with the drive market fueling growth in booking demand at higher levels than 2019.The Sunshine Coast saw holiday season occupancies on par with 2019 figures  as the region attracted consistently high levels of interstate and intrastate business.Far North Queensland  based on Cairns and Port Douglas  are facing a slower recovery due to the absence of international travellers and caution around long-haul domestic flights. Occupancies remained subdued during the quarter  but began to show signs of revival towards the end of February.The lack of corporate and conference travel – with ‘work from home’ recommendations still in place for much of the quarter – saw Brisbane city hotels record occupancies up to 25% lower than the similar pre-pandemic period.Accor Pacific Chief Executive Officer  Sarah Derry  said that while the continuing prevalence of COVID-19 variants  uncertainty about borders  and the ban on international tourists until last month had all suppressed demand  Accor’s Queensland hotels had been successful in pivoting to largely domestic leisure business.“Queensland is set to lead the Australian recovery in travel. The state’s natural attractions  climate and environment  combined with its popularity for conferences and events  provide us with considerable optimism for the rest of 2022 ” said Ms Derry  who was appointed CEO of Accor Pacific in January 2022.“We saw two of Australia’s most popular leisure destinations – the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast – regain most of the ground lost over the past two years by successfully targeting the drive markets within Queensland and interstate.""“The results reveal that Australians love to travel to Queensland. A combination of greater certainty regarding borders  an increase in flights  State and Federal stimulus measures  and a range of targeted marketing programs have significantly elevated holiday travel to Queensland in 2022.""“It is particularly encouraging that all restrictions impacting travel between Australia and New Zealand will be lifted from 12 April – that will provide a massive shot in the arm for Queensland  as the trans-Tasman market is a strong source market for the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast  particularly during the winter season. New Zealand travellers generally stay longer than any other market.""“Other international markets will take considerably longer to return to pre-pandemic levels. Airlines are beginning to ramp up schedules  with Queensland attracting increased services from Asia  the Pacific and North America. Australia’s reputation for managing the pandemic  attractions such as our beautiful coastlines  national parks and lifestyle will be positive drivers of international inbound.""“Conferences and events are beginning to show encouraging signs of recovery. Conferences are vital for filling destinations mid-week  while events maximise occupancies over weekends.""“We are still some way from seeing a return to normal levels of corporate travel. With companies still often working remotely  and with caution about the pandemic  it could take until the second half of 2022 to see a sustained recovery in business travel. There were small indications of Brisbane rebuilding corporate travel in the latter period of the first quarter  but the floods in February and early March brought challenges.""“Last week’s announcement by the Federal Government to provide AU$5 million in additional funding to support Tourism Australia’s capacity to bid for major events is encouraging  as was the overall AU$60 million package to revive international travel  but this support will need to be ongoing if we are to re-build business  conference and events travel to pre-Covid levels. I urge Government to consider how they might provide further support to enable our great cities return to prosperity through arts  sports and cultural events.""“We are fortunate to work with partners who see the long-term potential of Queensland for growth in travel. We are working with them to maximise the guest experience through refurbishments and upgrades. We are also working closely with state and regional tourism organisations to generate new travel demand in their destinations through promotions and innovative marketing.""“As we recover  we will create more career opportunities for people  and our teams across the state have been recruiting strongly over the past quarter  with the advantage of Accor being able to offer unprecedented opportunities for career growth locally and internationally.""“Accor will be introducing a range of new hotels and new brands to the Queensland market over the next few years including Mövenpick Brisbane Spring Hill  Fairmont Port Douglas and Mondrian Gold Coast.”About AccorAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of more than 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

1935,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/artmarketcom-auction-market-as-builder-and-buffer-for-the-nft-market-301513738.html,Artmarket.com: auction market as builder and buffer for the NFT Market,PARIS  March 30  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Traditional auction houses have been playing a launchpad role in NFT trading  but they could provide greater stability for this growing market. By providing valuation estimates  they synthesize the current state of supply…,"thierry Ehrmann  CEO and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department: "" By preparing a sale  publishing a catalog several weeks in advance and by giving a range of estimates and guaranteeing the information long after adjudication  the auction house actually 'moderates' the NFT market. This does not prevent prices from soaring if demand is stronger than expected"" .Despite the transparency of blockchain technology  there are plenty of anomalies on major NFT marketplaces. Whether it's fake accounts (like those that appeared around Takashi Murakami) or arbitrage opportunities (offered to those who manage to integrate the whitelists of the most coveted projects)  NFT sales platforms have seen a large number of highly aggressive strategies contributing to price volatility and a degree of instability.Takashi Murakami's 'overly' anticipated NFTsSince the announcement of his Flowers NFT project  Japanese artist Takashi Murakami (ranked 105th in our global ranking of artists by 2021 auction turnover  all periods of creation combined) has been the subject of numerous fraud attempts using Instagram and Twitter accounts with deliberately similar names  such as murekemi.flower2022. By inciting you to mint NFTs as quickly as possible (as most NFT drops do)  these fake projects try to make you buy instantly  without checking the legitimacy of the creator.It is clear that Murakami's NFT project is attracting interest from both traditional collectors and from the crypto community. However  it is looking increasingly likely that his Flowers NFTs will not be launched until around the time of his solo show at the Gagosian in New York  scheduled for May 2022. We will therefore have to wait a little longer than was initially expected to buy into Murakami's digital Flowers.https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2022/takashi-murakami/Unfortunately  the lack of clarity that currently exists on NFT marketplaces as well as on social media is generating a large number of scams. Almost all of today's most famous NFT projects have replicas circulating in large numbers on Opensea. This situation could be improved by a more active presence of stabilizing agents such as auction houses in the NFT ecosystem.At last… a genuine reference priceOf the 10 000 items in the World of Women collection  only one copy went to public auction. Estimated between $400 000 and $665 000 by Christie's  Woman #5672 was sold on 1 March 2022 in London for $600 000 (to which a 26% buyer's fees was added  bringing the total purchase price to $755 000).The value of this work fitted perfectly with the estimate provided by the auction house Christie's. However  the price of this NFT has been very volatile: barely six months ago  Woman #5672 was acquired for $117 000 (37.95 eth) on the OpenSea platform  and the best offer for this NFT is today $70 000 (20 eth).https://opensea.io/assets/0xe785e82358879f061bc3dcac6f0444462d4b5330/5672Because it was outside the blockchain  data relating to Christie's sale does not appear in the work's activity log on OpenSea. On the other hand  the identity (or rather the pseudonym) of the buyer of Woman #5672 has been revealed by Opensea: it is the moonpay.eth account. In this way  the OpenSea platform and Christie's auction house both provide two complementary bits of information.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/03/image1-Abdoulaye-Barry-Globule-Blanc-2022.jpg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The full-year financial report will be included in a registration document due to be published on 27 April 2022.Gilles Avenard  Chief Executive Officer and founder of Acticor Biotech  comments: “To carry out our clinical trials in treating cardiovascular emergencies  which remains a key public health concern  we have strengthened our financial capacity thanks in particular to our successful IPO on the Euronext Growth market in Paris in October 2021. As a result of this fundraising round supported by our existing shareholders as well as a number of new shareholders  we will continue with the clinical development of our first-in-class drug glenzocimab in stroke treatment. We recently obtained very promising results for our ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial in this indication  and which confirm the clinical interest of GPVI inhibition. In keeping with the roadmap set out at the time of our IPO  we have made a calm and enthusiastic start to 2022  with major clinical milestones to come such as recruiting the first patients in the United States for the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 clinical trial  as well as the start of the GREEN phase 2/3 trial  both in stroke treatment.”Main financial information (audited – in accordance with IFRS)Given the Company’s stage of clinical development  it does not generate any revenue.Research and development costs1 amounted to €7 766 thousand in 2021 compared with €5 770 thousand in 2020. This increase is mainly due to the conduct of the ACTIMIS and GARDEN clinical trials  recruitment for which ended in 2021  as well as the start of the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 clinical trial in Europe and the rise in staff costs.Operating and administrative expenses amounted to €3 749 thousand in 2021 compared with €1 483 thousand in 2020. This increase relates primarily to fees and charges incurred within the framework of the IPO on Euronext Growth Paris.The Company therefore sustained a net loss of €12 608 thousand in 2021 compared with €7 651 thousand in 2020.Cash and cash equivalents totalled €11.3 million at 31 December 2021  thanks in particular to the capital increase within the framework of Acticor Biotech’s IPO  which raised €15.5 million.Highlights since the IPOOctober 2021 - Successful IPO on Euronext Growth® in ParisThe IPO enabled the Company to carry out a €15.5 million capital increase by issuing 2 178 176 new ordinary shares.November 2021 - FDA approval of the IND application for glenzocimab in acute ischemic strokeThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the launch in the United States of the clinical development of glenzocimab  a new humanised monoclonal antibody fragment to be used on acute ischemic stroke patients. This active Investigational New Drug (IND) application represents a major step forward and marks the start in the United States of America of the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 clinical trial  evaluating the efficacy of glenzocimab in treating ischemic stroke  in combination with the reference treatment in this indication.February 2022 - Results of the GARDEN phase 2 clinical trial in Covid-19-related respiratory distress syndromeThe results of the GARDEN clinical trial evaluating the use of glenzocimab on Covid-19 patients presenting with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) confirmed glenzocimab’s high level of tolerance administered in a 1000 mg dose for three consecutive days. It was not possible to demonstrate any difference in the main criterion of efficacy  i.e.  progression to clinical aggravation  between glenzocimab and the placebo  both combined with standard treatments. An imbalance in inclusion was observed with regard to the risk factors recognised within this population not in favour of glenzocimab involving patients who usually have high blood pressure  are diabetic or older.February 2022 - Positive results of the ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial on patients presenting with Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS)The positive results of the ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial evaluating glenzocimab in combination with the reference treatment (thrombolysis with or without thrombectomy) in patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) demonstrated glenzocimab’s very favourable safety profile by meeting the main criterion of the trial as well as a significant reduction in the number of intracerebral haemorrhages and mortality in the group treated with glenzocimab.March 2022 - Appointment of Corinne Le Goff to the Board of Directors as independent board memberCorinne Le Goff has agreed to join Acticor Biotech’s Board of Directors as an independent board member. Her appointment will be submitted to the shareholder vote at the combined general meeting of 12 May 2022.Outlook for 2022Acticor Biotech’s clinical strategy consists of developing its drug  glenzocimab  across several major indications in the treatment of cardiovascular emergencies. Two phase 2/3 trials are planned in stroke treatment  including ACTISAVE  which began in Europe in 2021. The company is also extending its clinical development programme to other indications such as pulmonary embolism and myocardial infarction  for which phase 2 trials are planned to be launched this year.Recruitment of the first US patient in the ACTISAVE phase 2/3 trial with glenzocimab in ischemic stroke  in combination with the reference treatment in this indication - 2nd quarter of 2022Presentation of final results of the ACTIMIS phase 1b/2a clinical trial on patients presenting with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) – 2nd quarter of 2022Recruitment of the first patient in the GREEN phase 2/3 trial in stroke  funded by Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) – 2nd half of 2022Launch of two phase 2 clinical trials in pulmonary embolism (BREATH trial) and myocardial infarction (LIBERATE trial) – end of 2nd half of 2022Next financial publication: Results for the 1st half of 2022  on September 29  2022 (after market closing)About ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company  a spin-off from INSERM (the French National Institute of Health and Medical Research)  which is aiming to develop an innovative treatment for cardiovascular emergencies  including ischemic stroke.Acticor Biotech is developing glenzocimab (ACT017)  a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) fragment directed against a novel target of major interest  platelet glycoprotein VI (GPVI). Glenzocimab inhibits platelet binding to the thrombus without affecting physiological hemostasis  thereby limiting the bleeding risk  particularly in the brain.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Mirae Asset Capital  Anaxago  Primer Capital  Mediolanum farmaceutici and the Armesa foundation).

Pyrum is now listed in the stock exchange’s “Scale” segment  which offers small and midsized companies access to investors and equity financing. Today’s German listing follows Pyrum’s listing in the Euronext Growth segment of the Oslo Stock Exchange in September 2021.The dual listing was accompanied by ICF Bank.Founded in 2007  Pyrum quickly developed into a pioneering company in the GreenTech sector. It is based in Dillingen  Saarland  Germany and sustainably recycles old tires with its innovative pyrolysis technology. The company develops  builds  and operates plants that recover high-quality raw materials such as oil  gas and coke from used tires  rubber and plastic waste  which are then fed back into the materials cycle. The process is energy-autonomous and saves a large proportion of the CO2 emissions normally produced during the disposal of used tires. In addition  the GreenTech company is researching on new input materials as well as on new raw materials to be produced. BASF has held a stake in Pyrum Innovations AG since September 2020 and guarantees the purchase of the thermolysis oil produced by Pyrum and its contractors.“We are proud to have had the opportunity to accompany Pyrum in this important step in its growth strategy.

In the event that the purchase offer is oversubscribed  the acquisition may be conducted in accordance with the proportion of the shareholdings held by the tendering shareholders to each other (shareholding quotas) or in accordance with the proportion of the tendered shares (tendering quotas). In addition  for the avoidance of calculational fractions of shares  rounding may be applied. A preferential acceptance of small numbers of shares (up to 50 tendered shares per shareholder) may be provided for.

The purchase price per share payable upon exercise of Put Options or Call Options or upon falling due of the Forward Purchase may not exceed or fall short of  by more than 10 per cent  the arithmetic mean of the auction closing prices of shares of the same class of the Company in Xetra trading (or a functionally comparable successor system to the Xetra system) at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on the last three exchange trading days before the conclusion of the relevant derivative transaction (in each case without ancillary acquisition costs  but taking into account the option premium received or  respectively  paid).If treasury shares are acquired using Derivatives in accordance with the above provisions  any right of shareholders to enter into such Derivatives transactions with the Company and any right of shareholders to tender their shares shall be excluded.With regard to the utilisation of treasury shares of the Company that were acquired using Derivatives the provisions stipulated in the resolution proposal regarding item (20) above apply.(22) Closing of the Meeting2 MEETING MATERIALSThe proposals of the Board of Directors relating to the agenda of the General Meeting of Shareholders as well as this notice and the Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies are available on Multitude SE’s website at https://www.multitude.com/.The Annual Report of Multitude SE  the Company’s Annual Accounts  the report of the Board of Directors and the Auditor’s report  are also available on the above-mentioned Multitude SE’s website.Copies of these documents and of this notice will be sent to shareholders upon request.The minutes of the meeting will be made available on Multitude SE’s website no later than on 11 May 2022.3 INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERSA shareholder may participate in the General Meeting and exercise his/her rights at the meeting only by voting in advance and by presenting counterproposals and questions in advance in accordance with the instructions provided below.It will not be possible to participate in the meeting in person.3.1 Shareholders Registered in Shareholders’ RegisterEach shareholder who is registered in the shareholders’ register of the Company held by Euroclear Finland Oy on 13 April 2022  has the right to participate in the General Meeting of Shareholders.

The Board of Directors proposes that the authorization entitles the Board to deviate from the shareholders' proportional shareholdings (directed acquisition).

A right may also be given to a creditor in such manner that the right includes a condition that the creditor's receivable is used to set off the subscription price (convertible loan). The subscription price of the new shares and the amount paid for the company's own shares will be added to the fund for invested unrestricted equity.The authorization entitles the Board to deviate from the from the pre-emptive subscription rights of the existing shareholders  provided that the company has an important financial reason to do so  as regards the issue against payment  and that there is an especially important reason for the company and the good of the shareholders to do so  as regards the free issue.

The fear  regulators and lawmakers have said  is that a run on tokens that aren’t fully backed by cash could be calamitous.In December  fears surrounding commercial paper  or corporate loans  sent traditional and crypto markets plummeting after Chinese developer Evergrande missed an $82 million loan payment.

Explanatory notes to the business to be considered are set out from page 6 of this document.VOTING AT THE AGMI will  once again  be inviting you to vote on all Resolutions at the AGM by way of a poll rather than on a show of hands. Poll voting is in line with practice adopted by many UK public companies and provides a more transparent method of voting. It will result in a more accurate reflection of the views of shareholders by ensuring that every vote is recognised  including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting. On a poll  each shareholder has one vote for every share held. I would encourage shareholders to exercise their right to vote  but in light of the COVID-19 pandemic  the Company strongly encourages all shareholders to submit a proxy vote in advance of the AGM  appointing the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy rather than a named person. This will ensure that your vote will be counted if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting (for example because of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic). Instructions for completing the Form of Proxy are outlined below. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person.ACTION TO BE TAKENPlease complete and return the enclosed Form of Proxy so that it is received by the Company’s Registrar  Equiniti  by no later than 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022. If you are a member of CREST  you may submit a proxy appointment electronically through the CREST voting service. Further details are set out in the Notes section on pages 10 to 11.The results of voting on the Resolutions will be announced to the London Stock Exchange and posted on the Company’s website following the conclusion of the AGM.RECOMMENDATIONThe Directors recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each of the Resolutions at the AGM. The Board considers that the Resolutions are in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders as a whole and will promote the success of the Company for their benefit. The Directors intend to vote in favour of the Resolutions in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings in the Company (save in respect of those Resolutions in which they are interested).COVID-19In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic  the Company may put in place procedures  including as a condition of admission to the AGM venue  to align with UK government guidelines at the time of the AGM or as a safety measure  where appropriate. Anyone attending the AGM in person shall be required to adhere to all UK Government guidance and restrictions and all site rules at the AGM venue.Should it become appropriate to revise the current arrangements for the AGM  any such changes will be notified to shareholders through our website (www.osb.co.uk) and  where appropriate  by announcement made by the Company to a Regulatory Information Service.Yours faithfullyDavid WeymouthChairmanNOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGNotice is hereby given that the Annual General Meeting of OSB GROUP PLC (the Company) will be held at 90 Whitfield Street  Fitzrovia  London W1T 4EZ on Thursday  12 May 2022 at 11 am to consider and  if thought fit  pass the following Resolutions.Resolutions 1 to 9 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions.

The Board considers that Simon Walker has and will continue to make a valuable contribution to the Board and that he has sufficient time to devote to the Company’s affairs. The election to the Board of Simon Walker has been recommended by the Group Nomination and Governance Committee. The biographies of Directors can be found in the Appendix to this document and also on the Company’s website www.osb.co.uk.RESOLUTIONS 5 AND 6: Re-appointment and remuneration of the Auditor (ordinary resolutions)The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company  to hold office until the conclusion of the next such meeting. The Group Audit Committee has recommended to the Board the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as Auditor of the Company and has confirmed to the Board that its recommendation is free from third party influence and that no restrictive contractual provisions have been imposed on the Company limiting the choice of auditor. Resolution 5 proposes the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Auditor of the Company and Resolution 6 authorises the Group Audit Committee to agree the Auditor’s remuneration.RESOLUTION 7: Authority to make political donations (ordinary resolution)Section 368 of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) prohibits companies from making political donations exceeding £5 000 in aggregate in any 12-month period to (i) political parties  (ii) other political organisations and (iii) independent election candidates  and from incurring political expenditure  without shareholder approval. In line with the Group’s policy  neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries made any political donations nor incurred any political expenditure during 2021. It is not proposed or intended to alter this policy. However  some of the Group’s activities may potentially fall within the wide definitions of ‘political donation’ or ‘political expenditure’ in the Act and  without the necessary statutory authorisation  the Group’s ability to communicate its views effectively to political audiences and to relevant interest groups could be inhibited. Such activities may include briefings at receptions or conferences – when the Group seeks to communicate its views on issues vital to its business interests – including  for example  conferences of a party political nature or of special interest groups in specific areas.Accordingly  the Company believes that the authority contained in this Resolution is necessary to allow it and its subsidiaries to fund activities which it is in the interests of shareholders that the Company should support. Such authority will enable the Company and its subsidiaries to be sure that they do not  because of any uncertainty as to the bodies or the activities covered by the Companies Act 2006  unintentionally commit a technical breach of the statutes. Any political donation made or expenditure incurred under authority of this Resolution will be disclosed in next year’s Annual Report and Accounts.This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2021 and will expire at close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2023.RESOLUTION 8: Directors’ authority to allot shares (ordinary resolution)The Directors currently have a general authority to allot new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any securities into  shares. This authority is  however  due to expire at the AGM and the Board would like to renew it to provide the Directors with flexibility to allot new shares and grant rights up until the Company’s next AGM within the limits prescribed by The Investment Association.The Investment Association’s guidelines on Directors’ authority to allot shares state that the Association’s members will regard as routine any proposal at a general meeting to seek a general authority to allot an amount up to two-thirds of the existing share capital  provided that any amount in excess of one-third of the existing share capital is applied to fully pre-emptive rights issues only. Accordingly  if passed  this resolution will authorise the Directors to allot (or grant rights over) new shares in the Company: (i) under an open offer or in other situations (including a rights issue) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1 499 087.56 (representing approximately 33 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital); and (ii) under a rights issue only  up to a further aggregate nominal amount of £1 499 087.56 (representing approximately 33 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital). In each case  the reference to the Company’s issued ordinary share capital is to the issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document).If passed  this authority will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2023. The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority  however  the Board considers it prudent to maintain the flexibility that it provides to enable the Directors to respond to any appropriate opportunities that may arise. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 24 March 2022.RESOLUTION 9: Directors’ authority to allot shares in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (ordinary resolution)This Resolution renews the Directors’ authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £539 671.22  in connection with the issue of ‘Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments’. Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments are any securities to be issued by the Company or any member of the Group  or by a Company outside of the Group with the consent of the Company or a member of the Group and which are intended on issue to form all or part of a type or class of securities  the terms of which are eligible to meet any Regulatory Capital Requirements and which are:convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares of the Company; orissued together with share warrants relating to ordinary shares of the Company;and in each case  which grant to  or require  the holder of such security and/or its nominee a right or obligation (as applicable) to subscribe for such ordinary shares following a specified event relating to an actual or prospective adverse change in the capital position or viability of the Company  any member of the Group or the Group as a whole or any other event specified in the Regulatory Capital Requirements and otherwise on such terms as may be determined by the Directors of the Company or a Committee thereof upon issue.The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company to have the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments at any time and from time to time. The authority sought in this Resolution will be used as considered desirable to comply with or maintain compliance with such Regulatory Capital Requirements or targets applicable to the Company. Regulatory Capital Requirements are specified by the Prudential Regulation Authority or such other authority having primary supervisory authority with respect to the Company from time to time in relation to the margin of solvency  capital resources  capital  contingent capital or buffer capital of the Company  a member of the Group or the Group taken as a whole.The Company intends to seek to renew authority for the issuance of such Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments on an annual basis.The amount of this authority is  in aggregate  equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). No ordinary shares were held in treasury as at that date.Resolutions 9 and 12 are intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to authorise the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which contain contractual debt to equity conversion features. The Resolutions are not intended to provide authority for any future UK statutory conversion requirements as may become part of UK national law in the future  for which such authority would not be required.The authority sought in Resolution 9 is separate and distinct from the authority sought in Resolution 8 which is the usual authority sought on an annual basis in line with guidance issued by The Investment Association. The authority sought in Resolution 9 will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2023.RESOLUTIONS 10 and 11: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights (special resolutions)Resolutions 10 and 11 are special resolutions which  if passed by shareholders  will enable the Directors to allot ordinary shares in the Company  and/or to sell any shares out of treasury  for cash  without first offering those shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.The proposed resolutions essentially replicate the powers which were granted at last year’s AGM (and which will expire at the AGM). Such powers reflect the Statement of Principles published by The Pre-Emption Group in March 2015  which provides that a company may seek power to issue  on a non-pre-emptive basis for cash  shares in any one year representing:(i) no more than five per cent of the company’s issued ordinary share capital; and (ii) no more than an additional five per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital provided that such additional power is only used in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment.The 2015 Statement of Principles defines a ‘specified capital investment’ as ‘one or more specific capital investment related uses for the proceeds of an issuance of equity securities  in respect of which sufficient information regarding the effect of the transaction on the listed company  the assets  the subject of the transaction and (where appropriate) the profits attributable to them is made available to shareholders to enable them to reach an assessment of the potential return’. Items that are regarded as operating expenditure rather than capital expenditure will not typically be regarded as falling within the term ‘specified capital investment’.In line with best practice  the Company has structured its pre-emption disapplication request as two separate resolutions. Resolution 10 is proposed as a special resolution. If this resolution is passed by shareholders  it will permit the Directors to allot ordinary shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis both in connection with a rights issue or similar pre-emptive offer and  otherwise than in connection with any such issue  up to a maximum nominal amount of £224 863.01. This amount represents approximately five per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document). This resolution will permit the Directors to allot any such shares for cash in any circumstances (whether or not in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment).Resolution 11 is also proposed as a special resolution. If this resolution is passed by shareholders  it will afford the Directors an additional power to allot ordinary shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis up to a further maximum nominal amount of £224 863.01. This amount also represents approximately five per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022. The Directors shall use any power conferred by Resolution 11 only in connection with an acquisition or a specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issue  or which has taken place in the preceding six month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue.The Directors confirm their intention to follow the provisions of the 2015 Statement of Principles regarding cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling three year period. Those provisions state that a company should not issue shares for cash representing more than 7.5 per cent of the company’s issued share capital in any rolling three year period  other than to existing shareholders  without prior consultation with shareholders. This limit excludes any ordinary shares issued pursuant to a general disapplication of pre-emption rights in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment.RESOLUTION 12: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (special resolution)Resolution 9 renews the Directors’ authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £539 671.22 specifically in connection with the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments. Resolution 12 proposes that the Directors be empowered to allot equity securities pursuant to that authority for cash  without first offering those equity securities to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. £539 671.22 is equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document).Renewing this Resolution will permit the Company the flexibility necessary to allot equity securities pursuant to any proposal to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments and  by virtue of such disapplication  without the need to comply with the pre-emption requirements of the UK statutory regime. Together with Resolution 9  Resolution 12 is intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which may convert into ordinary shares.Conditional upon the passing of Resolutions 9 and 12  the Directors would not expect to make use of Resolutions 8 and 11 to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments  however  they may do so  to the extent permissible  if deemed appropriate in light of capital requirements  market conditions and/or high demand. Any exercise of the authorities in Resolutions 8 and 10 (if passed) would be separate from  and in addition to  the exercise of powers under Resolutions 9 and 12 and would have the effect of diluting the interests of ordinary shareholders.RESOLUTION 13: Authority to purchase own shares (special resolution)Resolution 13 gives the Company authority to buy back its own ordinary shares in the market as permitted by the Companies Act 2006.The authority limits the maximum number of shares that could be purchased to 44 972 602 (representing approximately 10 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022) and sets minimum and maximum prices at which shares may be purchased.This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2021 and will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2023. A listed company purchasing its own shares may hold those shares in treasury and make them available for re-sale as an alternative to cancelling them. Accordingly  if this Resolution is passed  the Company will have the option of holding  as treasury shares  any of its own shares that it purchases pursuant to the authority conferred.This would give the Company the ability to sell treasury shares quickly and cost-effectively and provide the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base. No dividends are paid and no voting rights are attached to shares held in treasury. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). As at that date  there were 2 413 983 options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the capital of the Company  representing 0.54 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. If the full authority conferred by this Resolution were to be exercised in full  these options would represent 0.60 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.Further to the announcement on 17 March 2022  the Company has commenced a share buyback programme for an amount of up to £100 million (the Share Buyback) pursuant to the authority granted at last year’s AGM. The Share Buyback is expected to end no later than 21 February 2023. Any shares purchased by the Company under the Share Buyback are to be cancelled. The Directors regard having the flexibility to repurchase issued shares in suitable circumstances as an important part of the financial management of the Company. The Directors may consider exercising the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares if market conditions and the Company’s financial position make this possible but will keep the matter under review. Shares would only be purchased if the Directors believed that to do so would result in an improvement in earnings per share and would be in the interests of shareholders generally. Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases on a recognised investment exchange and purchased shares would be cancelled (in which case the number of shares in issue would thereby be reduced) or  alternatively  held in treasury  depending on which course of action is considered by the Directors to be in the best interests of the shareholders at that time.RESOLUTION 14: Notice of general meetings (special resolution)The statutory notice period required for general meetings of the Company is at least 21 clear days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period  which cannot  however  be less than 14 clear days (AGMs will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice). At last year’s AGM  shareholders passed a resolution enabling the Company to call general meetings  other than an AGM  on at least 14 clear days’ notice. This approval must be renewed at each AGM  so  in order to preserve this ability  Resolution 14 seeks such approval. It is intended that the shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole. If given  the approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM  when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.NOTES1. The Company strongly encourages all shareholders to submit a proxy vote in advance of the AGM  appointing the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy rather than a named person. These notes to the Notice should be read in this context.2. Only persons entered on the Register of Members of the Company at 6.30 pm on Tuesday  10 May 2022 (or  if the AGM is adjourned  at 6.30 pm on the date which is two business days prior to the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM or adjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of persons to attend or vote (and the number of votes they may cast) at the AGM or adjourned meeting.3. A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint another person as her/his proxy to exercise all or any of her/his rights to attend  speak and vote at the AGM. A shareholder can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the AGM  provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder.4. A proxy does not need to be a shareholder of the Company but must attend the AGM to represent you. Your proxy could be the Chairman or another person who has agreed to attend to represent you. If you wish for a proxy to make any comments on your behalf at the AGM  you will need to appoint someone other than the Chairman of the meeting and give them the relevant instructions directly. Those submitting a Form of Proxy are strongly encouraged to appoint the Chairman of the meeting rather than a named person as their proxy. This will ensure that your vote will be counted even if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person.5. A shareholder who wishes to appoint a proxy should complete the Form of Proxy which accompanies this notice and includes full details of how to appoint a proxy. If you do not have a Form of Proxy and believe that you should have one  or if you require additional Forms of Proxy  please contact Equiniti’s helpline on 0371 384 2701 (+44 121 415 7047 if calling from overseas). Lines are open between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays in England and Wales). Shareholders who hold their shares in uncertificated form may use ‘the CREST voting service’ to appoint a proxy electronically  as explained below.6. In order to be valid  a proxy appointment must be returned (together with any power of attorney or other authority under which it is executed or a copy of the authority certified in ink by a bank  a stockbroker or a solicitor) by one of the following methods:– in hard copy form by post  by courier or by hand to the Company’s registrar at the address shown on the Form of Proxy; or in the case of CREST members  by utilising the CREST voting service in accordance with the procedures set out in note 9 below.The appointment of a proxy in each case must formally be received by the Company’s registrar no later than 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022.You may also appoint your proxy electronically online at www.sharevote.co.uk where full instructions on the procedure are given. The Voting ID  Task ID and Shareholder Reference Number printed on the Form of Proxy will be required to use this electronic proxy appointment system. Alternatively  shareholders who have already registered with Equiniti Registrars’ online portfolio service  Shareview  can appoint their proxy electronically by logging on to their portfolio at www.shareview.co.uk using their user ID and password. Once logged in  click ‘view’ on the ‘My Investments’ page. Click on the link to vote and follow the on screen instructions.7. To change your proxy instructions you may return a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard copy Form of Proxy and would like to change the instructions using another hard copy Form of Proxy  please contact Equiniti at Aspect House  Spencer Road  Lancing  West Sussex BN99 6DA. The deadline for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in relation to amended instructions. Any attempt to terminate or amend a proxy appointment received after the relevant deadline will be disregarded. Where two or more valid but differing appointments of proxy are delivered or (in the case of appointments in electronic form) received in respect of the same share for use at the same meeting  the one which is last delivered or  as the case may be  received as aforesaid (regardless of its date  its date of sending or the date of its execution) shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other or others as regards that share. If the Company is unable to determine either which is last sent or which is last delivered or received  none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of the relevant share(s).In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).8. A copy of this notice has been sent for information only  to Nominated Persons (that is  a person who has been nominated by a shareholder to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006). The rights to appoint a proxy cannot be exercised by a Nominated Person; they can only be exercised by a shareholder. However  a Nominated Person may have a right under an agreement with the shareholder by whom she or he was nominated to be appointed as a proxy for the AGM or to have someone else so appointed. If a Nominated Person does not have such a right or does not wish to exercise it  she or he may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.9. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual  which can be viewed at www.euroclear.com. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID number RA19) by 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022 (the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in this notice). For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.10. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.11. Voting on all Resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll rather than a show of hands. This is a more transparent method of voting as shareholders’ votes (including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting) are to be counted according to the number of shares held. As soon as practicable  following the AGM  the results of the voting will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and also placed on the Company’s website: osb.co.uk/investors/shareholder-services/.12. Please note that the Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that no viruses are present in any electronic communication it sends out but the Company cannot accept responsibility for loss or damage arising from the opening or use of any email or attachments from the Company and recommends that shareholders subject all messages to virus checking procedures prior to use. Any electronic communication received by the Company  including the lodgment of an electronic proxy form  that is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.13. A shareholder of the Company  that is a corporation  may authorise a person or persons to act as its representative(s) at the AGM. In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006  each such representative may exercise (on behalf of the corporation) the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual shareholder of the Company  provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.14. Shareholders satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 can require the Company to publish a statement on its website setting out any matter relating to the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the Auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the AGM and that the shareholders propose to raise at the AGM. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting the publication to pay its expenses. Any statement placed on the website must also be sent to the Company’s Auditor no later than the time it makes its statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the AGM includes any statement that the Company has been required to publish on its website.15. Under section 319A of the Companies Act 2006  the Company must  subject to limited exceptions  answer any question relating to the business being dealt with at the AGM which is put by a shareholder attending the AGM. Information relating to the AGM which the Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website in advance of the meeting may be viewed at osb.co.uk/investors/ shareholder-services/. You may not use any electronic address provided in this notice to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.16. Shareholders have the right to ask questions in relation to the business of the AGM but no answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the AGM or involve the disclosure of confidential information  (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question  or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the AGM that the question be answered. Shareholders wishing to raise any questions relating to the business of the AGM may do so by submitting them to the Company Secretariat ahead of the AGM at company.secretariat@osb.co.uk. You may submit questions until 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022 and the Company will endeavour to publish and maintain an appropriate summary of responses on the ‘AGM Information’ page of its website in advance of the AGM.17. As at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document)  the Company’s issued share capital consisted of 449 726 018 ordinary shares  carrying one vote each.

1981,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.globalinvestorgroup.com/articles/3698366/euroclear-joins-blockchain-payment-system-what-this-means-for-crypto-tech,Euroclear joins blockchain payment system: What this means for crypto tech,As Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) continues to grow in scope and scale  its use is becoming ever more widespread among diverse financial institutions - from improving their clearance and settlement mechanisms to enabling speedy payment processing services and matching growing customer expectations for more personalised ,By Manoj Mistry  Managing Director  IBOS AssociationAs Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) continues to grow in scope and scale  its use is becoming ever more widespread among diverse financial institutions - from improving their clearance and settlement mechanisms to enabling speedy payment processing services and matching growing customer expectations for more personalised  digitised services by enhancing the customer experience.Euroclear  the Belgium-headquartered international securities settlement house  is among the most recent of them to take the plunge through a small strategic investment in the regulated blockchain payments consortium  Fnality International - formerly Utility Settlement Coin (USC) - which is primarily comprised of global banks.The impetus of developing and investing in DLT is reinforced by new initiatives from assorted regulators to create the right conditions for its use in securities markets  such as the EU DLT pilot regime: a sandbox for tokenised securities and settlement that focuses on the tokenisation of conventional financial instruments such as stocks  bonds and UCITS.Last year  the Bank of England approved a new type of account at the central bank to cater for a broader range of anticipated payments systems  including those based on blockchain. In parallel  there is an increasing acceptance of DLT by market participants who recognise its potential to achieve a transformation of global capital markets.Euroclear currently offers settlement as an intermediary clearing agent for stock and bond trades: cash is swapped for the legal ownership of an asset at the conclusion of each transaction. It also provides settlement and custody of domestic and cross-border securities for bonds  equities and derivatives to investment funds.Owned by a group of banks and exchanges  which includes Euronext and the London Stock Exchange Group  Euroclear revealed that it settled nearly €1000 (£845 trillion) in securities last year. Its investment in Fnality is designed to develop its future DLT capabilities for stock and bond trades.The focus of its new partner is to build a blockchain-based payment system that supports the adoption of tokenised assets and marketplaces. With a global roll-out anticipated to start this year  Fnality’s network of distributed Financial Market Infrastructures (dFMIs) will aim to provide a near real time settlement capability in a central bank money-like digital cash asset while simultaneously facilitating compatibility and interaction with other platforms.Established in 2019  Fnality’s founding shareholders are: Banco Santander  BNY Mellon  Barclays  CIBC  Commerzbank  Credit Suisse  ING  KBC Group  Lloyds Banking Group  Mizuho Bank  MUFG Bank  Nasdaq  State Street Corporation  Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and UBS.By using DLT  Fnality can offer central banks a system for managing payments that it describes as simpler  faster  safer and more resilient. Euroclear’s investment will have a positive impact on meeting Fnality’s objectives: to digitalise the process by removing paperwork and use digital versions of currencies instead.Through its stake in Fnality  Euroclear will hope to settle tokenised assets  or digital securities  against digital cash in a faster  more efficient way. Its contribution to Fnality will inevitably help to expand the consortium’s footprint in financial market infrastructure. The positive implications for the execution of Fnality’s business are self-evident  according to its CEO  Rhomaios Ram.For Euroclear  this strategic move will provide what it describes as ‘an innovative solution for the settlement of digital securities against digital cash on DLT.’ The ultimate aim is to increase speed and efficiency for assorted post-trade operations - from primary market issuance to secondary market and collateral trades  and servicing interest payments.The engagement with Fnality is also part of Euroclear’s continuing development of its DLT capabilities. Last October  a Euroclear-led consortium successfully experimented with a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for settling French treasury bonds on a test blockchain. Commissioned by the Banque de France  the French market experiment confirmed that blockchain technology is suitable to manage post-trade market operations in CBDC.The benefits for Euroclear are also self-evident  not least that the leverage of DLT will open more doors with the provision of enhanced product and liquidity options on a real-time basis. It is certainly a step in the right direction.Looking ahead  the focus on Real-Time Gross Settlement (RGTS) should be interesting  especially when combined with Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS). Notably  this also may be a potential threat to the offering that CLS provides to its current members  especially in relation to RTGS and the clearance of foreign exchange obligations.,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.61,0.14,0.25,True,English,"['blockchain payment system', 'crypto tech', 'Euroclear', 'near real time settlement capability', 'Belgium-headquartered international securities settlement house', 'speedy payment processing services', 'Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation', 'EU DLT pilot regime', 'distributed Financial Market Infrastructures', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'central bank digital currency', 'personalised, digitised services', 'State Street Corporation', 'foreign exchange obligations', 'diverse financial institutions', 'conventional financial instruments', 'Distributed Ledger Technology', 'intermediary clearing agent', 'Lloyds Banking Group', 'Banque de France', 'primary market issuance', 'French market experiment', 'growing customer expectations', 'Utility Settlement Coin', 'blockchain-based payment system', 'Continuous Linked Settlement', 'central bank money', 'Real-Time Gross Settlement', 'post-trade market operations', 'global capital markets', 'French treasury bonds', 'small strategic investment', 'future DLT capabilities', 'digital cash asset', 'blockchain payments consortium', 'post-trade operations', 'market participants', 'secondary market', 'securities markets', 'digital securities', 'Fnality International', 'settlement mechanisms', 'customer experience', 'KBC Group', 'strategic move', 'blockchain technology', 'real-time basis', 'digital versions', 'central banks', 'global roll-out', 'Mizuho Bank', 'MUFG Bank', 'tokenised securities', 'cross-border securities', 'Manoj Mistry', 'Managing Director', 'IBOS Association', 'global banks', 'new initiatives', 'right conditions', 'new type', 'broader range', 'payments systems', 'increasing acceptance', 'bond trades', 'legal ownership', 'new partner', 'tokenised assets', 'other platforms', 'founding shareholders', 'Banco Santander', 'BNY Mellon', 'Credit Suisse', 'positive impact', 'efficient way', 'positive implications', 'Rhomaios Ram', 'innovative solution', 'ultimate aim', 'collateral trades', 'interest payments', 'continuing development', 'Euroclear-led consortium', 'test blockchain', 'enhanced product', 'liquidity options', 'right direction', 'current members', 'investment funds', 'potential threat', 'scope', 'scale', 'clearance', 'plunge', 'USC', 'impetus', 'assorted', 'regulators', 'sandbox', 'tokenisation', 'stocks', 'UCITS', 'England', 'account', 'parallel', 'transformation', 'conclusion', 'transaction', 'custody', 'domestic', 'equities', 'derivatives', 'exchanges', 'Euronext', 'focus', 'adoption', 'marketplaces', 'network', 'dFMIs', 'compatibility', 'interaction', 'Barclays', 'CIBC', 'Commerzbank', 'Nasdaq', 'UBS', 'objectives', 'paperwork', 'currencies', 'stake', 'contribution', 'footprint', 'execution', 'business', 'CEO', 'efficiency', 'engagement', 'CBDC', 'benefits', 'leverage', 'doors', 'provision', 'step', 'RGTS', 'CLS', 'offering', 'relation', 'RTGS']",2022-03-31,2022-03-31,globalinvestorgroup.com

By providing valuation estimates  they synthesize the current state of supply and demand;,"PARIS  March 31  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Traditional auction houses have been playing a launchpad role in NFT trading  but they could provide greater stability for this growing market. By providing valuation estimates  they synthesize the current state of supply and demand; by selling an NFT  they provide a reference price that is independent of the prices practiced on peer-to-peer platforms (like Opensea  Nifty Gateway  SuperRare  etc.). In other words  with their expertise and their temporization of the market  the auction houses may well have a stabilizing effect on the effervescent NFT market.Abdoulaye Barry  Globule blanc (2022). Paper print + NFT. Estimated €500 - €800  sold €1 080 by Fauve Paris auction house in Paris on 10 March 2022thierry Ehrmann  CEO and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department: ""By preparing a sale  publishing a catalog several weeks in advance and by giving a range of estimates and guaranteeing the information long after adjudication  the auction house actually 'moderates' the NFT market. This does not prevent prices from soaring if demand is stronger than expected"".Despite the transparency of blockchain technology  there are plenty of anomalies on major NFT marketplaces. Whether it's fake accounts (like those that appeared around Takashi Murakami) or arbitrage opportunities (offered to those who manage to integrate the whitelists of the most coveted projects)  NFT sales platforms have seen a large number of highly aggressive strategies contributing to price volatility and a degree of instability.Takashi Murakami's 'overly' anticipated NFTsSince the announcement of his Flowers NFT project  Japanese artist Takashi Murakami (ranked 105th in our global ranking of artists by 2021 auction turnover  all periods of creation combined) has been the subject of numerous fraud attempts using Instagram and Twitter accounts with deliberately similar names  such as murekemi.flower2022. By inciting you to mint NFTs as quickly as possible (as most NFT drops do)  these fake projects try to make you buy instantly  without checking the legitimacy of the creator.It is clear that Murakami's NFT project is attracting interest from both traditional collectors and from the crypto community. However  it is looking increasingly likely that his Flowers NFTs will not be launched until around the time of his solo show at the Gagosian in New York  scheduled for May 2022. We will therefore have to wait a little longer than was initially expected to buy into Murakami's digital Flowers.https://gagosian.com/exhibitions/2022/takashi-murakami/Unfortunately  the lack of clarity that currently exists on NFT marketplaces as well as on social media is generating a large number of scams. Almost all of today's most famous NFT projects have replicas circulating in large numbers on Opensea. This situation could be improved by a more active presence of stabilizing agents such as auction houses in the NFT ecosystem.At last… a genuine reference priceOf the 10 000 items in the World of Women collection  only one copy went to public auction. Estimated between $400 000 and $665 000 by Christie's  Woman #5672 was sold on 1 March 2022 in London for $600 000 (to which a 26% buyer's fees was added  bringing the total purchase price to $755 000).The value of this work fitted perfectly with the estimate provided by the auction house Christie's. However  the price of this NFT has been very volatile: barely six months ago  Woman #5672 was acquired for $117 000 (37.95 eth) on the OpenSea platform  and the best offer for this NFT is today $70 000 (20 eth).https://opensea.io/assets/0xe785e82358879f061bc3dcac6f0444462d4b5330/5672Because it was outside the blockchain  data relating to Christie's sale does not appear in the work's activity log on OpenSea. On the other hand  the identity (or rather the pseudonym) of the buyer of Woman #5672 has been revealed by Opensea: it is the moonpay.eth account. In this way  the OpenSea platform and Christie's auction house both provide two complementary bits of information.Image: [https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/03/image1-Abdoulaye-Barry-Globule-Blanc-2022.jpg]Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.comfor your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: econometrics@artprice.com Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

This has left foreign OFZ investors cut off from their rouble bond holdings and local sovereign Eurobond holders  in turn  from interest payments in hard currency.The National Settlement Depository (NSD)  a Russian national clearing house  citing a central bank's order  said this month that foreign OFZ bond holders are barred from receiving coupon payments until further notice.NSD  which processes OFZ interest payments on behalf of the finance ministry  did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for information on which investors received the coupon payouts.OFZs are used by the government to finance some of its budget needs. Before a growing standoff between Moscow and the west made the bonds a risky asset  they were popular with foreign investors thanks to their lucrative yields and Russia's then-strong economic fundamentals.The share of foreign investors among OFZ holders declined to 17.8% in February  the lowest since late 2012  from 19.1% a month earlier.This week  Russia has offered to repay in roubles part of a $2 billion Eurobond that matures on April 4  to secure payments for local investors who may not be able to receive dollars.Investors declining the rouble offer would be paid in U.S. dollars on April 4 when repayment is due  a source has said.($1 = 81.5000 roubles)(Reporting by Reuters),neutral,0.02,0.87,0.1,negative,0.02,0.17,0.81,True,English,"['seven OFZ bond issues', 'finance ministry', 'Russia', 'coupons', 'seven OFZ treasury bond issues', 'The National Settlement Depository', 'Russian national clearing house', 'local sovereign Eurobond holders', 'foreign OFZ bond holders', 'European clearing houses', 'rouble bond holdings', 'strong economic fundamentals', '$447 million coupon payment', 'U.S. dollars', 'OFZ interest payments', 'OFZ holders', 'Russian clients', 'OFZ investors', 'dollar Eurobond', '$2 billion Eurobond', 'local investors', 'rouble offer', 'coupon payouts', 'coupon payments', 'finance ministry', 'hard currency', 'central bank', 'budget needs', 'growing standoff', 'lucrative yields', 'foreign investors', '50.2 billion roubles', 'roubles part', 'Western sanctions', 'Reuters request', '81.5000 roubles', 'coupons', 'data', 'website', 'Thursday', 'Moscow', 'servicing', 'debt', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'business', 'turn', 'NSD', 'order', 'notice', 'behalf', 'information', 'OFZs', 'government', 'bonds', 'asset', 'share', 'February', 'April', 'repayment', 'source']",2022-03-31,2022-03-31,ca.news.yahoo.com

It is proposed that the fees for work in the auditing committee are SEK 280 000 for the chair and SEK 200 000 for each of the other members.If the meeting approves the nomination committee's proposal for the composition of the board  and if the number of members of the auditing committee remains as previously  the total fees will be SEK 7 905 000 compared with the previous year's fees of SEK 6 825 000. Among other things  the increase is to be seen in light of the fact that the fees have been unchanged since 2019.It is proposed that the auditor's fees be paid based on approved invoices.Item 12 - The nomination committee proposes the following board of directors:Re-election of current board members: Stina Bergfors  Anders Dahlvig  Danica Kragic Jensfelt Lena Patriksson Keller  Karl-Johan Persson  Christian Sievert  Erica Wiking Häger  Niklas Zennström.Chair of the board: re-election of Karl-Johan Persson.Item 13 - The nomination committee proposes  in accordance with the recommendation by the auditing committee  that registered accounting firm Deloitte AB be elected as auditor of the company until the conclusion of the 2023 annual general meeting.

COMPOSITION OF NOMINATION COMMITTEE1. The nomination committee is to consist of the chair of the board and four other members.The four other members are to be appointed as follows: each of the four largest shareholders measured by voting power  according to the register of shareholders kept by Euroclear Sweden AB as at the last banking day in August each year  appoints a member. Determination of which are the four largest owners measured by voting power is to be based on shareholder statistics that are sorted by voting rights (in ownership groups) and include the 25 largest registered shareholders in Sweden  i.e. shareholders holding an account with Euroclear Sweden AB in their own name or shareholders holding a custody account with a manager that has given the name of the shareholder to Euroclear Sweden AB.2. Unless the members of the nomination committee agree otherwise  the chair of the nomination committee is to be the member appointed by the largest owner measured by voting power. The chair of the committee will have the casting vote in the event that the votes are equal.3. If any of the four largest shareholders measured by voting power declines to take part in the nomination committee  or can otherwise be assumed to have declined such a right  the next largest shareholder (measured by voting power) is to be given opportunity to appoint a member.4. If a shareholder that nominated a member of the nomination committee notifies the nomination committee that this shareholder wishes the person it appointed to no longer be a member of the nomination committee (e.g. because the person concerned is no longer employed)  the person concerned will no longer be a member of the nomination committee.5. If a shareholder has appointed a member of the nomination committee but at a time no less than four months before the annual general meeting is no longer one of the four largest shareholders measured by voting power  the nomination committee can decide that the member appointed by this shareholder will no longer be a member of the nomination committee.6. If a member leaves the nomination committee before its work is completed  a replacement is to be appointed if the nomination committee considers this appropriate (taking into consideration  for example  how much of the nomination committee's work remains to be done). Such replacement member is to be appointed by the same shareholder as appointed the departing member or  if this shareholder is no longer one of the four largest shareholders measured by voting power  by the next largest shareholder.7. H&M is to provide information on the company's website concerning the composition of the nomination committee at least six months before each annual general meeting. The company is also to provide information there concerning changes in the composition of the nomination committee.8. The terms owner and shareholder in expressions such as ""the four largest owners measured by voting power"" or ""the next largest shareholder"" refers to shareholders as recorded in the shareholder statistics stated in 1 above.B. INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE1. As soon as possible after the last banking day in August each year  the chair of the board is to convene the nomination committee's first meeting and  as part of the nomination committee's work  is also to report to the nomination committee the circumstances relating to the board's work and need for special expertise etc. that may be of significance for the nomination committee's work.2. No fees are to be paid to the members of the nomination committee. The nomination committee may charge to the company any reasonable costs for travel and investigations.3. The nomination committee is to submit proposals to each annual general meeting for the following:a) election of a chair for the meeting;b) resolution on the number of board members;c) resolution on board fees for the chair of the board and for each of the other members of the board (including work in board committees);d) election of board members;e) election of chair of the board;f) resolution on the number of auditors;g) resolution on fees to the auditor(s);h) election of auditor(s).4. All information that the members of the nomination committee receive within the context of their position on the committee or otherwise receive from the company is to be kept strictly confidential and must not be disclosed to third parties until the information has been made public. The nomination committee's proposals  reports and statements are to be communicated to the company in reasonable time to ensure compliance with the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.Resolutions proposed by the boardDIVIDEND  item 9 bThe board proposes that the 2022 annual general meeting resolve to distribute a dividend to the shareholders of SEK 6.50 per share.

In the event that the purchase offer is oversubscribed  the acquisition may be conducted in accordance with the proportion of the shareholdings held by the tendering shareholders to each other (shareholding quotas) or in accordance with the proportion of the tendered shares (tendering quotas). In addition  for the avoidance of calculational fractions of shares  rounding may be applied. A preferential acceptance of small numbers of shares (up to 50 tendered shares per shareholder) may be provided for.

Investors are watching closely Moscow's servicing of its debt after Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically.,(Reuters) -Russia's finance ministry has paid 50.2 billion roubles ($616 million) in coupons on seven OFZ treasury bond issues  data on its website showed.The payments come as the finance ministry is due to make a $447 million coupon payment on Thursday on a dollar Eurobond that matures in 2030.Investors are watching closely Moscow's servicing of its debt after Western sanctions aimed at isolating Russia economically.The sanctions have led European clearing houses Euroclear and Clearstream to limit their business with Russian clients. This has left foreign OFZ investors cut off from their rouble bond holdings and local sovereign Eurobond holders  in turn  from interest payments in hard currency.The National Settlement Depository (NSD)  a Russian national clearing house  citing a central bank's order  said this month that foreign OFZ bond holders are barred from receiving coupon payments until further notice.NSD  which processes OFZ interest payments on behalf of the finance ministry  did not immediately reply to a Reuters request for information on which investors received the coupon payouts.OFZs are used by the government to finance some of its budget needs. Before a growing standoff between Moscow and the west made the bonds a risky asset  they were popular with foreign investors thanks to their lucrative yields and Russia's then-strong economic fundamentals.The share of foreign investors among OFZ holders declined to 17.8% in February  the lowest since late 2012  from 19.1% a month earlier.This week  Russia has offered to repay in roubles part of a $2 billion Eurobond that matures on April 4  to secure payments for local investors who may not be able to receive dollars.Investors declining the rouble offer would be paid in U.S. dollars on April 4 when repayment is due  a source has said.($1 = 81.5000 roubles)(Reporting by Reuters),neutral,0.02,0.87,0.1,negative,0.02,0.17,0.81,True,English,"['seven OFZ bond issues', 'finance ministry', 'Russia', 'coupons', 'seven OFZ treasury bond issues', 'The National Settlement Depository', 'Russian national clearing house', 'local sovereign Eurobond holders', 'foreign OFZ bond holders', 'European clearing houses', 'rouble bond holdings', 'strong economic fundamentals', '$447 million coupon payment', 'U.S. dollars', 'OFZ interest payments', 'OFZ holders', 'Russian clients', 'OFZ investors', 'dollar Eurobond', '$2 billion Eurobond', 'local investors', 'rouble offer', 'coupon payouts', 'coupon payments', 'finance ministry', 'hard currency', 'central bank', 'budget needs', 'growing standoff', 'lucrative yields', 'foreign investors', '50.2 billion roubles', 'roubles part', 'Western sanctions', 'Reuters request', '81.5000 roubles', 'coupons', 'data', 'website', 'Thursday', 'Moscow', 'servicing', 'debt', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'business', 'turn', 'NSD', 'order', 'notice', 'behalf', 'information', 'OFZs', 'government', 'bonds', 'asset', 'share', 'February', 'April', 'repayment', 'source']",2022-03-31,2022-03-31,ca.news.yahoo.com

The ETPs have been named WisdomTree Solana (SOLW)  WisdomTree Cardano (ADAW) and WisdomTree Polkadot (DOTW). The ETPs have been created in such a way so that the investors in Europe gain sufficient exposure to the price of Solana  Cardano and Polkadot via regulated exchanges.SOLW  ADAW and DOTW have an overall expense ratio of 0.95%. The expense ratio is determined by dividing a fund’s operating expenses by the average dollar value of its assets under management. The growing offering of crypto assets in Europe has lowered the cost of crypto ETPs  where Wisdom Tree’s expense ratio of 0.95 % is one of the lowest. The ETPs would have a pan-Europe presence and are currently available for sale in the following places :* The ETPs would be available in Austria  Belgium  Denmark  Finland  France  Germany  Italy  Ireland  Luxembourg  Netherlands  Norway  Poland  Spain  Sweden and Switzerland.* Major European digital exchanges like Deutsche Boerse’s Xetra  Swiss Exchange’s SIX  and the Swiss Stock Exchange have Wisdom Tree’s newly launched 3 crypto ETPs.Wisdom Tree has previously also launched crypto ETPs. In December 2021  Wisdom Tree launched its first crypto-backed ETPs on Euronext exchanges in Paris and Amsterdam. It traded under the ticker symbol MEGA  and was backed by physical crypto assets including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). Besides  Wisdom tree  American crypto exchange  FTX and European digital assets manager CoinShares have also launched physically-baked Solana ETPs in March 2022. Global investment managers like 21Shares and VanEck have also issued their crypto ETPs.Exchange Traded Products track underlying securities  an index  or other financial instruments. They trade on exchanges  just like stocks and their prices can fluctuate throughout the day.

Onnik Agbulut. The article is available online on the journal’s website (Articles in Press: Canadian Journal of Cardiology (onlinecjc.ca); DOI: 10.1016/j.cjca.2022.01.019).The data reported in this article demonstrate the effectiveness of oral treatment with QGC606 to improve cardiac function and reduce fibrosis  thus preventing the onset of heart failure after myocardial infarction  at a dose 6 times lower than the firibastat. Data shows the efficacy of QGC606 is also comparable to that of ramipril selected as a drug reference but unlike ramipril  QGC606  like firibastat  does not affect blood pressure levels in mice.« The experimental data obtained with this new product are particularly promising because they position QGC606 as a potential best-in-class product »  said Fabrice Balavoine  Vice-President Research & Development at Quantum Genomics. « This represents a reinforcement of the results already obtained with firibastat and further validate the therapeutic benefit of brain aminopeptidase A inhibitors in preventing cardiac dysfunction after myocardial infarction. »Story continuesAbout Quantum GenomicsQuantum Genomics is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of a new class of cardiovascular drugs  based on the Brain Aminopeptidase A Inhibition (BAPAI) mechanism. It is the only company in the world to pursue this innovative approach directly targeting the brain  founded upon more than twenty years of research work by Paris-Descartes University and the INSERM/CNRS laboratory led by Dr. Catherine Llorens-Cortès at the Collège de France. Quantum Genomics thus aims to develop innovative treatments for complicated or even resistant hypertension (in approximately 30% of patients it is poorly controlled  or treatment failure occurs)  and heart failure (one in two patients diagnosed dies within five years).Based in Paris  the company is listed on the Euronext Growth market in Paris (FR0011648971 - ALQGC) and is registered on the US OTCQX market (symbol: QNNTF).Find out more at www.quantum-genomics.com  or on our Twitter and Linkedin accounts.ContactsQuantum Genomics contact@quantum-genomics.frEdifice Communication (EUROPE) Financial and media communicationquantum-genomics@edifice-communication.comLifeSci (USA) Mike TattoryMedia communication+1 (646) 751-4362 - mtattory@lifescipublicrelations.com,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.34,0.27,0.39,True,English,"['New Scientific Article', 'Quantum Genomics', 'Publication', 'QGC606', 'aminopeptidase A inhibitor prodrug', 'Dr. Catherine Llorens-Cortès', 'brain aminopeptidase A inhibitors', 'Brain Aminopeptidase A Inhibition', 'Mike Tattory Media communication', 'Collège de France', 'Pr.

Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases – including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure – with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed €3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR® is estimated to be over €5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.The alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.Story continuesIn the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints and a rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life. All patients have been enrolled in the study and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines. Over 900 alfapump systems have been implanted to date.Sequana Medical has combined its proven alfapump and proprietary DSR therapy  and is developing the alfapump DSR  a breakthrough approach to fluid overload due to heart failure. RED DESERT demonstrated that repeated DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients is able to manage their fluid and sodium balance  improve their cardio-renal status and restore their diuretic response for months post-treatment. Interim results from the ongoing SAHARA DESERT study in decompensated heart failure patients indicated that repeated DSR therapy can safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate persistent congestion and restore euvolemia  together with considerable benefit in cardio-renal status and a dramatic improvement in diuretic responsiveness. Reporting of top-line data is planned for H2 2022.Sequana Medical is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

I am convinced that the separation of roles between a non-executive chairman and a CEO  as well as the choice to entrust the chairmanship to an independent director with great scientific skills in the field of oncology  will deliver important and valuable advantages for Transgene and its shareholders. I would like to thank the Board of Directors for approving this change in governance. Alessandro’s medical and scientific competence  international experience and human qualities make him an ideal candidate to play a key role in the further development of Transgene.”Dr. Alessandro Riva added: “Transgene’s promising drug candidates  generated from its world leading myvac® and Invir.IO™ platforms  represent exciting new frontiers for targeted solid tumor immunotherapies  tapping into the unrealized potential of personalized cancer vaccinations and next-generation multifunctional oncolytic viruses.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.Story continuesABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European developer  manager and owner of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

The Notes may not be offered  sold  pledged or otherwise transferred directly or indirectly within the United States or to  or for the account or benefit of  U.S. Persons (as such term is defined in Regulation S under the Securities Act).This announcement is not directed at retail clients in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) or in the United Kingdom (the “UK”). The Notes are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK. For these purposes  a retail investor in the EEA means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended  “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”)  and a retail investor in the UK means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client  as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000  as amended (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client  as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; and (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended  the “PRIIPs Regulation”) or by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation and/or the UK PRIIPS Regulation.MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market – Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process  the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only  each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate.

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. These statements include projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions  statements regarding plans  objectives  intentions and expectations with respect to future financial results  events  operations  services  product development and potential  and statements regarding future performance. Forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words “expects”  “anticipates”  “believes”  “intends”  “estimates”  “plans” and similar expressions. Although Sanofi’s management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable  investors are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Sanofi  that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied or projected by  the forward-looking information and statements. These risks and uncertainties include among other things  the uncertainties inherent in research and development  future clinical data and analysis  including post marketing  decisions by regulatory authorities  such as the FDA or the EMA  regarding whether and when to approve any drug  device or biological application that may be filed for any such product candidates as well as their decisions regarding labelling and other matters that could affect the availability or commercial potential of such product candidates  the fact that product candidates if approved may not be commercially successful  the future approval and commercial success of therapeutic alternatives  Sanofi’s ability to benefit from external growth opportunities  to complete related transactions and/or obtain regulatory clearances  risks associated with intellectual property and any related pending or future litigation and the ultimate outcome of such litigation  trends in exchange rates and prevailing interest rates  volatile economic and market conditions  cost containment initiatives and subsequent changes thereto  and the impact that COVID-19 will have on us  our customers  suppliers  vendors  and other business partners  and the financial condition of any one of them  as well as on our employees and on the global economy as a whole. Any material effect of COVID-19 on any of the foregoing could also adversely impact us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise of which we are not currently aware and may exacerbate other previously identified risks. The risks and uncertainties also include the uncertainties discussed or identified in the public filings with the SEC and the AMF made by Sanofi  including those listed under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Sanofi’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021.

The increase in personnel costs is directly linked to the winning of several private security contracts  which will be the breeding ground for our strategy to dronify the sector. Conversely  there was a decrease in purchases and changes in inventories as well as depreciation allowances. Finally  the decline in other revenues of the activity  including in particular the fixed production of the period  illustrates the end of the R&D program dedicated to the development of the professional solutions ISS Spotter (security) and Countbot (inventory)  now operational and in the commercial start-up phase.Story continuesThe beginning of 2022 was marked by the winning of several contracts in the field of events  signed by ATM Group Sécurité (subsidiary of Delta Drone Human Tech)  which consist of a mixed offer combining security agents and ISS Spotter system  which fully validates the relevance of the strategy.At the same time  in partnership with Geodis  the first Countbot missions were carried out to the satisfaction of the first customers  who see the system as a major innovation  a source of better management of their inventories under favorable economic conditions.Considering the Australian subsidiary Delta Drone International  the cash sale for $ A6 million (about € 4 million) of the Israeli company ParaZero completes the process of setting up a pole focused on the southern hemisphere and the mining sector. Delta Drone International is now firmly established in two major mining countries  South Africa and Australia  and has the necessary resources to self-finance its development.The adoption of IFRS standards allows Groupe to recognise the ""fair value"" of its shareholdings  housed within the UDT subsidiary. This investment policy aimed at creating an ecosystem within the Group  generating numerous industrial synergies  is crowned with success since the portfolio brings overall a revenue of more than €5 million into the income statement.Finally  the loss for the year was reduced to €4.3 million  halved compared to the previous year's loss.Please note that the Group's detailed accounts are available in French and English on the Group's website (www.deltadrone.com).The final terms of the agreement with the Canadian group Volatus Aerospace are still under discussionBy means of a press release dated March 3  2022  the Delta Drone and Volatus Aerospace groups had announced the signing of an agreement  subject to several conditions precedent  whose purpose was to constitute together a world leader in the sector  present on all continents.As stated in the statement  the agreement required the approval of the French Ministry of the Economy  as part of the 2019 law on investments by foreign companies in French companies. The investigation of the file is still ongoing  without the date of the Ministry's response being precisely known.In addition  the agreement also requires the approval of minority shareholders of Australian subsidiary Delta Drone International  as the company is listed on the Sydney ASX Stock Exchange. This approval will be submitted to shareholders at a General Meeting to be held in May.However  while waiting for the Delta Drone and Volatus Aerospace teams have started working on joint projects:for North America  the commercial development of the solutions proposed by Delta Drone for Delta Drone's locations  the products and systems marketed by Volatus Aeropace.A €2 million operating expense reduction plan is launched immediately  financed by a €1 million tranche of OrnanGiven the evolution of the Delta Drone Group and its ambitions for the coming years  the need to continue efforts to rationalize operating expenses remains crucial. Thus  to achieve the objective of reaching the operating balance next year  Delta Drone decides to launch at the beginning of the 2nd quarter a plan to reduce operating expenses  which represents a potential saving in full year of around € 2 million.In accordance with the authority granted to the Board of Directors by the Extraordinary General Shareholders’ meeting of Delta Drone (the “Company”) dated 24 April 2020 pursuant to its sixth resolution  the Board of Directors dated 14th October 2020:approved the principle of issuing 2 500 tranche warrants (the “ Tranche Warrants ”)  giving access to 2 500 bonds redeemable in cash and/or new shares (the “ ORNAN ”) with share subscription warrants attached (the “ Warrants ”) upon exercise  to the investment fund YA II PN  LTD (the “ Investor ”)  a fund managed by the US management company Yorkville Advisors  representing a financing of up to €25M of aggregate nominal value; andempowered the Chairman and CEO to decide to launch this transaction  to approve its final terms and conditions  to issue the Tranche Warrants and to drawdown the tranches of ORNAN with Warrants attached.Pursuant to the sub-delegation of authority granted to him by the Board of Directors on 28 April 2020  the CEO decided today to drawdown 1 tranche of ORNAN with Warrants attached.The main characteristics of the Tranche Warrants  ORNAN and Warrants (the terms and conditions of which are available in detail on the Company’s website ( www.deltadrone.com ) under the « Investors » tab) have been presented in a press release dated 14 October 2020.In accordance with the financing agreement entered into on 14 October 2020 with the Investor  1 tranche of ORNAN with Warrants attached of €1M of nominal value has been drawdown today  corresponding to the issuance of 100 ORNAN with 714 285 714 Warrants attached.The share consolidation operation will be implemented in AprilIn accordance with the 3rd resolution voted at the Annual General Meeting of 27 December 2021  the Board of Directors decided to implement in April the consolidation of the shares composing its share capital at the rate of 10 000 old shares against 1 new share.The objective of this merger is to support a new stock market dynamic of the company as well as to reduce the volatility of the Delta Drone share price  induced by the low level of its current value. This transaction will not affect the overall value of delta Drone shares held in the portfolio by shareholders  with the exception of the broken ones.The details and the exact timing of the operation will be the subject of a specific press release.ProspectsDelta Drone continues its construction in a still emerging sector  marked by a multitude of communications and announcements sometimes unrealistic  often peremptory. Rather than suggesting that ""the drone can do everything""  the Groupe strives to anchor its strategy on solid and reasonable foundations  in direct contact with the needs of its customers  following a process of progressive integration of technology into professional uses  respecting in all respects the regulations and rules of safety of people and goods.After 10 years of existence  Delta Drone is in the process of building with its partner Volatus Aerospace a set without equivalent in the sector  present all over the world and with an extremely wide range of services and products. The combination of French technology and North American commercial know-how will undoubtedly be a winning combination to accelerate revenue development and achieve balance in terms of EBITDA. The achievement of this objective is obviously based on the rationalization of operating expenses initiated in 2022; so that it can be achieved in 2023.On a like-for-like basis  Delta Drone is expected to see sustained revenue growth this year  in line with the commercial development of the professional ISS Spotter (security) and Countbot (inventory) solutions and the growing success of new private security service offerings.About Delta Drone : Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the field of civilian drones for professional use.

Customers will benefit from a strengthened and enhanced geographical and broadened service offering  built on the highly complementary strengths of CSC’s leadership in the US and Intertrust’s leadership in Europe. CSC shares Intertrust's vision and regards its emphasis on ESG principles with a particular focus on human capital. Employees will benefit from CSC’s strong corporate culture and values  and a significantly larger and more global company  offering enhanced career development opportunities.Full and unanimous support and recommendation by the Intertrust BoardsFollowing the diligent and carefully executed process  the Intertrust Boards believe that the Offeror has made the most compelling offer representing an attractive cash premium to the Shareholders  as well as favourable non-financial terms and commitments in respect of deal certainty. The Intertrust Boards conclude that the Offer is in the best interest of the Company and the sustainable  long-term success of its business  taking especially into account the interests of all Intertrust's stakeholders.Taking all these considerations into account  the Intertrust Boards unanimously support the proposed Transaction and recommend that the Shareholders tender their Shares under the Offer. Accordingly  the Intertrust Boards recommend that the Shareholders vote in favour of the Offer Resolutions at the upcoming AGM.Non-Financial CovenantsIntertrust and the Offeror have agreed to certain covenants  including covenants on structure and corporate governance  strategy  employees  leverage and costs  minority shareholders and other non- financial matters  for a duration of two years after settlement (the ""Non-Financial Covenants"").Structure and GovernanceThe Intertrust Group's headquarters will remain in Amsterdam  the Netherlands  and the Offeror will not divest or transfer any material part of the Intertrust Group.

On 30 December 2021  Intertrust filed a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act. On 26 January 2022  the waiting period under the HSR Act expired with respect to each filing  which concluded the HSR Act review of the proposed combination of CSC and Intertrust.

As a result of the Transaction  CSC will become an indirect owner of the Intertrust Regulated Subsidiaries. Accordingly  CSC and  in some cases  certain of its shareholders and Affiliates are required to undergo review by the regulators with oversight of the Intertrust Regulated Subsidiaries before CSC becomes the indirect owner of the Licenses  in accordance with local law.Intertrust and the Offeror must make certain filings to apply for the Regulatory Clearances required in connection with the Transaction (the ""Regulatory Applications"").

If the Offer Condition relating to the Competition Clearances set out in section 6.6(a)(ii) ( Offer Conditions) of the Offer Memorandum or the Regulatory Clearances set out in section 6.6(a)(iii) ( Offer Conditions) of the Offer Memorandum is not satisfied or waived in accordance with section 6.6(b) (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum on the Postponed Closing Date  the Offeror shall  subject to receipt of an exemption granted by the AFM  extend the Offer Period until such time as the Parties reasonably believe is necessary to cause such Offer Condition to be satisfied but ultimately until the Long Stop Date. At the Offeror's request  Intertrust shall express in writing to the AFM its full support for the exemption request in relation to such extension  subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement.If the Offer Period is extended  so that the obligation pursuant to Article 16 of the Decree to announce whether the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand wordt gedaan) is postponed  a public announcement to that effect will be made no later than on the third (3rd) Business Day following the initial Closing Date in accordance with the provisions of Article 15  paragraphs 1 and 2 of the Decree. During an extension of the Offer Period  any Shares previously tendered and not validly withdrawn will remain tendered under the Offer  subject to the right of each Shareholder to withdraw the Shares he or she has already tendered in accordance with section 5.3(e) (Withdrawal rights) of the Offer Memorandum.If no exemption is granted by the AFM while not all Offer Conditions have been satisfied before the end of the extended Offer Period (and if such Offer Condition(s) has or have not been waived in accordance with section 6.6(b) (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum)  the Offer will be terminated as a consequence of such Offer Condition(s) not having been satisfied or waived on or before the Unconditional Date.Declaring the Offer unconditionalThe obligation of the Offeror to declare the Offer unconditional (gestand doen) is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the Offer Conditions. Reference is made to section 6.6 (Offer Conditions  waiver and satisfaction) of the Offer Memorandum. The Offer Conditions may be waived  to the extent permitted by Applicable Rules  as set out in section 6.6(b) (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum. If any Offer Condition is waived in accordance with section 6.6(b) (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum  the Offeror will inform the Shareholders as required by the Applicable Rules.No later than on the Unconditional Date (i.e. the third (3rd) Business Day following the Closing Date)  the Offeror will determine whether the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived as set out in section 6.6 (Offer Conditions  waiver and satisfaction) of the Offer Memorandum  to the extent permitted by Applicable Rules. In addition  the Offeror will announce on the Unconditional Date whether (i) the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand is gedaan)  (ii) the Offer Period will be extended in accordance with Article 15 of the Decree  or (iii) the Offer is terminated as a result of the Offer Conditions set out in section 6.6(a) (Offer Conditions) not having been satisfied or waived  all in accordance with section 6.6(b) ( Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum and section 6.6(d) (Satisfaction) of the Offer Memorandum and Article 16 of the Decree. In the event that the Offer is not declared unconditional (niet gestand is gedaan)  the Offeror will explain such decision.In the event that the Offeror declares the Offer unconditional (gestand is gedaan)  the Offeror will accept all Tendered Shares and will announce a Post-Acceptance Period (na-aanmeldingstermijn) as set out in section 5.8 (Post-Acceptance Period) of the Offer Memorandum of two (2) weeks to enable Shareholders who did not tender their Shares during the Offer Period to tender their Shares during the Post-Acceptance Period under the same terms and conditions as the Offer.SettlementIn the event that the Offeror declares the Offer unconditional (gestand is gedaan)  Shareholders who have validly tendered (or defectively tendered provided that such defect has been waived by the Offeror) and have not validly withdrawn and have transferred (geleverd) their Shares for acceptance pursuant to the Offer on or prior to the Closing Date will receive no later than on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Closing Date or Postponed Closing Date  as the case may be  the Offer Price in respect of each Tendered Share  as of which moment revocation (herroeping)  dissolution (ontbinding) or annulment (vernietiging) of a Shareholder's tender or transfer (levering) shall not be permitted. Settlement will only take place if the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand is gedaan). The Offeror cannot guarantee that Shareholders holding Shares through an Admitted Institution will actually receive payment within such five (5) Business Day period from the Admitted Institution with whom they hold their Shares.Post-Acceptance PeriodIn the event that the Offeror declares the Offer unconditional (gestand is gedaan)  the Offeror will  in accordance with Article 17 of the Decree  within three (3) Business Days after declaring the Offer unconditional  publicly announce a Post-Acceptance Period (na-aanmeldingstermijn) of two (2) weeks to enable Shareholders who did not tender their Shares during the Offer Period to tender their Shares during the Post-Acceptance Period under the same terms and conditions as the Offer.In the Post-Acceptance Period  Shareholders who hold their Shares through an Admitted Institution are requested to make their acceptance known through their bank or stockbroker no later than 17:40 hours CET on the last Business Day of the Post-Acceptance Period. The custodian  bank or stockbroker may set an earlier deadline for communication by Shareholders in order to permit the custodian  bank or stockbroker to communicate its acceptances to the Settlement Agent in a timely manner. Accordingly  Shareholders holding Shares through a financial intermediary should comply with the dates communicated by such financial intermediary  as such dates may differ from the dates and times noted in the Offer Memorandum.The Offeror will publicly announce the results of the Post-Acceptance Period and the total amount and total percentage of Shares held by it in accordance with Article 17  paragraph 4 of the Decree ultimately on the third (3rd) Business Day following the last day of the Post-Acceptance Period. The Offeror shall accept all Tendered Shares during such Post-Acceptance Period.During the Post-Acceptance Period  Shareholders have no right to withdraw Shares from the Offer  which are validly tendered (or defectively tendered  provided that such defect has been waived by the Offeror) during the Offer Period or during the Post-Acceptance Period. Shareholders who have validly tendered (or defectively tendered provided that such defect has been waived by the Offeror) and transferred ( geleverd) their Shares for acceptance pursuant to the Offer during the Post-Acceptance Period will receive the Offer Price in respect of each Tendered Share within two Dutch trading days of the Offeror’s acceptance of such Shares tendered.In the event any Distribution on the Shares is made by Intertrust on or prior to the settlement date of the Shares tendered in the Post-Acceptance Period  whereby the record date is decisive for entitlement to such Distribution  the Offer Price will be decreased by the full amount of any such Distribution made by Intertrust in respect of each Share (before any applicable withholding tax).As of the relevant settlement date  revocation (herroeping)  dissolution (ontbinding) or annulment (vernietiging) of the tendering  sale or transfer (levering) of any Share tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period is not possible.Acquisition of 100%Intertrust and the Offeror believe the sustainable and long-term success of Intertrust will be enhanced under private ownership and acknowledge the importance of acquiring 100% of the Shares and achieving a delisting in order to execute on the Combined Group’s long-term strategy. Intertrust and the Offeror intend to as soon as possible (1) terminate the listing of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam  and (2) if deemed desirable by the Offeror  convert the Company into a private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid).In the event that  following the Settlement Date and the Post-Acceptance Period  (i) the Offeror meets either the threshold to initiate a compulsory acquisition procedure ( uitkoopprocedure) in accordance with article 2:92a of the Dutch Civil Code or the threshold to initiate a takeover buy-out procedure in accordance with article or 2:201a or 2:359c of the Dutch Civil Code (the ""Squeeze-Out Proceedings Threshold"")  (ii) the Asset Sale Resolution has been adopted  and (iii) the Offeror elects to implement the Pre-Squeeze-Out Asset Sale  then the Offeror and Intertrust shall implement the Pre-Squeeze-Out Asset Sale and promptly after completion thereof the Offeror shall initiate Squeeze-Out Proceedings in accordance with section 6.15 (Post-closing measures and future legal structure) of the Offer Memorandum  whereby an amount equal to the value attributable to the Offeror's shareholding will be paid through a loan note (the ""Offeror's Note""). At the request of the Offeror  the articles of association of the Company will be amended to  inter alia  provide for a new class of shares (the ""B Shares"") and subsequently  the Company will issue a number of B Shares to the Offeror equal to the number of Shares held by the Offeror  against the transfer of the Shares held by the Offeror to the Company. The Company will thereafter make a distribution equal to the Offeror's Note on the B Shares to the Offeror (the ""Offeror's Distribution""). The Company and the Offeror have agreed to implement appropriate guarantees and indemnities in relation to issuance of the B Shares  the acquisition of Shares and the Offeror's Distribution to protect the Company's minority shareholders.In the event that  following the Settlement Date and the Post-Acceptance Period  the Offeror does not meet the Squeeze-Out Proceedings Threshold but does meet the Acceptance Threshold and the Asset Sale and Liquidation Resolutions have been adopted  then the Offeror and Intertrust shall implement  at the election of the Offeror  the Asset Sale and Liquidation in accordance with section 6.15 (Post-closing measures and future legal structure) of the Offer Memorandum. As soon as possible after commencement of the Liquidation  an advance liquidation distribution will be made to the Shareholders consisting of a payment per Share equal to the Offer Price  without any interest and subject to withholding taxes and other taxes.If  after the Post-Acceptance Period  the Offeror meets the Squeeze-Out Proceedings Threshold  while the Asset Sale Resolution has not been adopted  the Offeror shall commence the Squeeze-Out Proceedings to obtain 100% of the Shares without implementation of the Pre-Squeeze-Out Asset Sale.Liquidity and delistingThe purchase of Shares by the Offeror pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of Shareholders  as well as the number of Shares that might otherwise be traded publicly. As a result  the liquidity and market value of the Shares that were not tendered under the Offer  or were tendered and validly withdrawn  may be adversely affected. The Offeror does not intend to compensate for such adverse effect by  for example  setting up a liquidity mechanism for the Shares that are not tendered following the Settlement Date and the Post-Acceptance Period.Should the Offer be declared unconditional (gestanddoening)  the Offeror and Intertrust intend to procure the delisting of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam as soon as possible under Applicable Rules. This may further adversely affect the liquidity and market value of any Shares not tendered.If the Offeror acquires 95% or more of the Shares  it will be able to procure delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam in accordance with applicable (policy) rules. However  the listing of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam will also terminate after a successful Asset Sale and Liquidation as set out in section 6.15(d) (Asset Sale and Liquidation) of the Offer Memorandum or any other measures or procedures set out in section 6.15(f) (Other Post-Closing Measures) of the Offer Memorandum. In the event that Intertrust will no longer be listed  the provisions applicable to the governance of listed companies will no longer apply and the rights of remaining minority Shareholders may be limited to the statutory minimum.AnnouncementsAny announcement contemplated by the Offer Memorandum will be issued by means of a press release. Any press release issued by the Offeror will be made available on the website www.cscglobal.com. Any press release issued by Intertrust will be made available on the website www.intertrustgroup.com.Subject to any applicable legal requirements and without limiting the manner in which the Offeror may choose to make any public announcement  the Offeror will have no obligation to communicate any public announcement other than as described above and in section 5.12 ( Announcements) of the Offer Memorandum.Offer Memorandum  Position Statement and further informationThe Offeror is making the Offer on the terms and subject to the conditions and restrictions contained in the Offer Memorandum which is available as of today.

It will result in a more accurate reflection of the views of shareholders by ensuring that every vote is recognised  including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting. On a poll  each shareholder has one vote for every share held. I would encourage shareholders to exercise their right to vote  but in light of the COVID-19 pandemic  the Company strongly encourages all shareholders to submit a proxy vote in advance of the AGM  appointing the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy rather than a named person. This will ensure that your vote will be counted if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting (for example because of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic). Instructions for completing the Form of Proxy are outlined below. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person.ACTION TO BE TAKENPlease complete and return the enclosed Form of Proxy so that it is received by the Company’s Registrar  Equiniti  by no later than 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022. If you are a member of CREST  you may submit a proxy appointment electronically through the CREST voting service. Further details are set out in the Notes section on pages 10 to 11.The results of voting on the Resolutions will be announced to the London Stock Exchange and posted on the Company’s website following the conclusion of the AGM.RECOMMENDATIONThe Directors recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each of the Resolutions at the AGM. The Board considers that the Resolutions are in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders as a whole and will promote the success of the Company for their benefit. The Directors intend to vote in favour of the Resolutions in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings in the Company (save in respect of those Resolutions in which they are interested).COVID-19In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic  the Company may put in place procedures  including as a condition of admission to the AGM venue  to align with UK government guidelines at the time of the AGM or as a safety measure  where appropriate. Anyone attending the AGM in person shall be required to adhere to all UK Government guidance and restrictions and all site rules at the AGM venue.Should it become appropriate to revise the current arrangements for the AGM  any such changes will be notified to shareholders through our website (www.osb.co.uk) and  where appropriate  by announcement made by the Company to a Regulatory Information Service.Yours faithfullyDavid WeymouthChairmanNOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGNotice is hereby given that the Annual General Meeting of OSB GROUP PLC (the Company) will be held at 90 Whitfield Street  Fitzrovia  London W1T 4EZ on Thursday  12 May 2022 at 11 am to consider and  if thought fit  pass the following Resolutions.Resolutions 1 to 9 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions.

This Notice of AGM and the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts are available at www.osb.co.uk. For the purpose of this Notice  the issued share capital of the Company with voting rights on 24 March 2022  being the latest practicable date prior to the printing of this document  was 449 726 018 ordinary shares of £0.01 each.RESOLUTION 1: 2021 Annual Report and Accounts (ordinary resolution)The Directors of the Company present the Directors’ reports  the Auditor’s report and the audited financial statements of the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2021 (the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts) to the AGM as required by the Companies Act 2006.The Company proposes an ordinary resolution to receive the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts and  accordingly  shareholders have the opportunity to raise any questions on those documents under this Resolution.RESOLUTION 2: Directors’ Remuneration Report (excluding the Remuneration Policy) for the year ended 31 December 2021 (ordinary resolution)In accordance with the Companies Act 2006  shareholders are invited to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 31 December 2021. This consists of the Annual Statement from the Chair of the Group Remuneration Committee and the Annual Report on Remuneration  which may be found on pages 144 to 146 and 154 to 163 of the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts. It details the Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2021 and sets out the way in which the Company intends to implement the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2022. The Auditor has audited those parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report required to be audited and its report can be found on pages 170 to 179 of the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts. For the purposes of this Resolution  the Directors’ Remuneration Report does not include the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The vote on Resolution 2 is advisory only and the Directors’ entitlement to remuneration is not conditional on it being passed.The Companies Act 2006 requires the Directors’ Remuneration Policy to be put to shareholders for approval annually unless the approved policy remains unchanged  in which case it need only be put to shareholders for approval at least every three years. The Company is not proposing any changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy that was approved at the Annual General Meeting in 2021.RESOLUTION 3: Final dividend (ordinary resolution)A final dividend of 21.1 pence per ordinary share has been recommended by the Board for the year ended 31 December 2021 and  if approved by shareholders  will be paid on 18 May 2022 to all shareholders on the register at the close of business on 25 March 2022.RESOLUTIONS 4 (a) to (i): Election and re-election of Directors (ordinary resolutions)Resolution 4(a) relates to the election of a Director. Simon Walker is standing for election as an Independent Non-Executive Director having been appointed to the Board of Directors with effect from 4 January 2022.Resolutions 4 (b) to (i) relate to the retirement and re-election of the Company’s Directors. The Company’s articles of association require each Director to retire at the AGM. This is in line with best practice recommendations of the Financial Reporting Council’s UK Corporate Governance Code.The Board has confirmed  following a performance review  that each of the Directors standing for re-election continues to be an effective member of the Board  to make a positive contribution and to demonstrate commitment to his or her role. The Board believes that the considerable and wide-ranging experience of the Directors will continue to be invaluable to the Company. The Board considers that Simon Walker has and will continue to make a valuable contribution to the Board and that he has sufficient time to devote to the Company’s affairs. The election to the Board of Simon Walker has been recommended by the Group Nomination and Governance Committee. The biographies of Directors can be found in the Appendix to this document and also on the Company’s website www.osb.co.uk.RESOLUTIONS 5 AND 6: Re-appointment and remuneration of the Auditor (ordinary resolutions)The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company  to hold office until the conclusion of the next such meeting. The Group Audit Committee has recommended to the Board the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as Auditor of the Company and has confirmed to the Board that its recommendation is free from third party influence and that no restrictive contractual provisions have been imposed on the Company limiting the choice of auditor. Resolution 5 proposes the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Auditor of the Company and Resolution 6 authorises the Group Audit Committee to agree the Auditor’s remuneration.RESOLUTION 7: Authority to make political donations (ordinary resolution)Section 368 of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) prohibits companies from making political donations exceeding £5 000 in aggregate in any 12-month period to (i) political parties  (ii) other political organisations and (iii) independent election candidates  and from incurring political expenditure  without shareholder approval. In line with the Group’s policy  neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries made any political donations nor incurred any political expenditure during 2021. It is not proposed or intended to alter this policy. However  some of the Group’s activities may potentially fall within the wide definitions of ‘political donation’ or ‘political expenditure’ in the Act and  without the necessary statutory authorisation  the Group’s ability to communicate its views effectively to political audiences and to relevant interest groups could be inhibited. Such activities may include briefings at receptions or conferences – when the Group seeks to communicate its views on issues vital to its business interests – including  for example  conferences of a party political nature or of special interest groups in specific areas.Accordingly  the Company believes that the authority contained in this Resolution is necessary to allow it and its subsidiaries to fund activities which it is in the interests of shareholders that the Company should support. Such authority will enable the Company and its subsidiaries to be sure that they do not  because of any uncertainty as to the bodies or the activities covered by the Companies Act 2006  unintentionally commit a technical breach of the statutes. Any political donation made or expenditure incurred under authority of this Resolution will be disclosed in next year’s Annual Report and Accounts.This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2021 and will expire at close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2023.RESOLUTION 8: Directors’ authority to allot shares (ordinary resolution)The Directors currently have a general authority to allot new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any securities into  shares. This authority is  however  due to expire at the AGM and the Board would like to renew it to provide the Directors with flexibility to allot new shares and grant rights up until the Company’s next AGM within the limits prescribed by The Investment Association.The Investment Association’s guidelines on Directors’ authority to allot shares state that the Association’s members will regard as routine any proposal at a general meeting to seek a general authority to allot an amount up to two-thirds of the existing share capital  provided that any amount in excess of one-third of the existing share capital is applied to fully pre-emptive rights issues only. Accordingly  if passed  this resolution will authorise the Directors to allot (or grant rights over) new shares in the Company: (i) under an open offer or in other situations (including a rights issue) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1 499 087.56 (representing approximately 33 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital); and (ii) under a rights issue only  up to a further aggregate nominal amount of £1 499 087.56 (representing approximately 33 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital). In each case  the reference to the Company’s issued ordinary share capital is to the issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document).If passed  this authority will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2023. The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority  however  the Board considers it prudent to maintain the flexibility that it provides to enable the Directors to respond to any appropriate opportunities that may arise. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 24 March 2022.RESOLUTION 9: Directors’ authority to allot shares in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (ordinary resolution)This Resolution renews the Directors’ authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £539 671.22  in connection with the issue of ‘Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments’. Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments are any securities to be issued by the Company or any member of the Group  or by a Company outside of the Group with the consent of the Company or a member of the Group and which are intended on issue to form all or part of a type or class of securities  the terms of which are eligible to meet any Regulatory Capital Requirements and which are:convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares of the Company; orissued together with share warrants relating to ordinary shares of the Company;and in each case  which grant to  or require  the holder of such security and/or its nominee a right or obligation (as applicable) to subscribe for such ordinary shares following a specified event relating to an actual or prospective adverse change in the capital position or viability of the Company  any member of the Group or the Group as a whole or any other event specified in the Regulatory Capital Requirements and otherwise on such terms as may be determined by the Directors of the Company or a Committee thereof upon issue.The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company to have the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments at any time and from time to time. The authority sought in this Resolution will be used as considered desirable to comply with or maintain compliance with such Regulatory Capital Requirements or targets applicable to the Company. Regulatory Capital Requirements are specified by the Prudential Regulation Authority or such other authority having primary supervisory authority with respect to the Company from time to time in relation to the margin of solvency  capital resources  capital  contingent capital or buffer capital of the Company  a member of the Group or the Group taken as a whole.The Company intends to seek to renew authority for the issuance of such Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments on an annual basis.The amount of this authority is  in aggregate  equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). No ordinary shares were held in treasury as at that date.Resolutions 9 and 12 are intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to authorise the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which contain contractual debt to equity conversion features. The Resolutions are not intended to provide authority for any future UK statutory conversion requirements as may become part of UK national law in the future  for which such authority would not be required.The authority sought in Resolution 9 is separate and distinct from the authority sought in Resolution 8 which is the usual authority sought on an annual basis in line with guidance issued by The Investment Association. The authority sought in Resolution 9 will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2023.RESOLUTIONS 10 and 11: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights (special resolutions)Resolutions 10 and 11 are special resolutions which  if passed by shareholders  will enable the Directors to allot ordinary shares in the Company  and/or to sell any shares out of treasury  for cash  without first offering those shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.The proposed resolutions essentially replicate the powers which were granted at last year’s AGM (and which will expire at the AGM). Such powers reflect the Statement of Principles published by The Pre-Emption Group in March 2015  which provides that a company may seek power to issue  on a non-pre-emptive basis for cash  shares in any one year representing:(i) no more than five per cent of the company’s issued ordinary share capital; and (ii) no more than an additional five per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital provided that such additional power is only used in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment.The 2015 Statement of Principles defines a ‘specified capital investment’ as ‘one or more specific capital investment related uses for the proceeds of an issuance of equity securities  in respect of which sufficient information regarding the effect of the transaction on the listed company  the assets  the subject of the transaction and (where appropriate) the profits attributable to them is made available to shareholders to enable them to reach an assessment of the potential return’. Items that are regarded as operating expenditure rather than capital expenditure will not typically be regarded as falling within the term ‘specified capital investment’.In line with best practice  the Company has structured its pre-emption disapplication request as two separate resolutions. Resolution 10 is proposed as a special resolution. If this resolution is passed by shareholders  it will permit the Directors to allot ordinary shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis both in connection with a rights issue or similar pre-emptive offer and  otherwise than in connection with any such issue  up to a maximum nominal amount of £224 863.01. This amount represents approximately five per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document). This resolution will permit the Directors to allot any such shares for cash in any circumstances (whether or not in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment).Resolution 11 is also proposed as a special resolution. If this resolution is passed by shareholders  it will afford the Directors an additional power to allot ordinary shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis up to a further maximum nominal amount of £224 863.01. This amount also represents approximately five per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022. The Directors shall use any power conferred by Resolution 11 only in connection with an acquisition or a specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issue  or which has taken place in the preceding six month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue.The Directors confirm their intention to follow the provisions of the 2015 Statement of Principles regarding cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling three year period. Those provisions state that a company should not issue shares for cash representing more than 7.5 per cent of the company’s issued share capital in any rolling three year period  other than to existing shareholders  without prior consultation with shareholders. This limit excludes any ordinary shares issued pursuant to a general disapplication of pre-emption rights in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment.RESOLUTION 12: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (special resolution)Resolution 9 renews the Directors’ authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £539 671.22 specifically in connection with the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments. Resolution 12 proposes that the Directors be empowered to allot equity securities pursuant to that authority for cash  without first offering those equity securities to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. £539 671.22 is equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document).Renewing this Resolution will permit the Company the flexibility necessary to allot equity securities pursuant to any proposal to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments and  by virtue of such disapplication  without the need to comply with the pre-emption requirements of the UK statutory regime. Together with Resolution 9  Resolution 12 is intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which may convert into ordinary shares.Conditional upon the passing of Resolutions 9 and 12  the Directors would not expect to make use of Resolutions 8 and 11 to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments  however  they may do so  to the extent permissible  if deemed appropriate in light of capital requirements  market conditions and/or high demand. Any exercise of the authorities in Resolutions 8 and 10 (if passed) would be separate from  and in addition to  the exercise of powers under Resolutions 9 and 12 and would have the effect of diluting the interests of ordinary shareholders.RESOLUTION 13: Authority to purchase own shares (special resolution)Resolution 13 gives the Company authority to buy back its own ordinary shares in the market as permitted by the Companies Act 2006.The authority limits the maximum number of shares that could be purchased to 44 972 602 (representing approximately 10 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022) and sets minimum and maximum prices at which shares may be purchased.This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2021 and will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2023. A listed company purchasing its own shares may hold those shares in treasury and make them available for re-sale as an alternative to cancelling them. Accordingly  if this Resolution is passed  the Company will have the option of holding  as treasury shares  any of its own shares that it purchases pursuant to the authority conferred.This would give the Company the ability to sell treasury shares quickly and cost-effectively and provide the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base. No dividends are paid and no voting rights are attached to shares held in treasury. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). As at that date  there were 2 413 983 options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the capital of the Company  representing 0.54 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. If the full authority conferred by this Resolution were to be exercised in full  these options would represent 0.60 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.Further to the announcement on 17 March 2022  the Company has commenced a share buyback programme for an amount of up to £100 million (the Share Buyback) pursuant to the authority granted at last year’s AGM. The Share Buyback is expected to end no later than 21 February 2023. Any shares purchased by the Company under the Share Buyback are to be cancelled. The Directors regard having the flexibility to repurchase issued shares in suitable circumstances as an important part of the financial management of the Company. The Directors may consider exercising the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares if market conditions and the Company’s financial position make this possible but will keep the matter under review. Shares would only be purchased if the Directors believed that to do so would result in an improvement in earnings per share and would be in the interests of shareholders generally. Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases on a recognised investment exchange and purchased shares would be cancelled (in which case the number of shares in issue would thereby be reduced) or  alternatively  held in treasury  depending on which course of action is considered by the Directors to be in the best interests of the shareholders at that time.RESOLUTION 14: Notice of general meetings (special resolution)The statutory notice period required for general meetings of the Company is at least 21 clear days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period  which cannot  however  be less than 14 clear days (AGMs will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice). At last year’s AGM  shareholders passed a resolution enabling the Company to call general meetings  other than an AGM  on at least 14 clear days’ notice. This approval must be renewed at each AGM  so  in order to preserve this ability  Resolution 14 seeks such approval. It is intended that the shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole. If given  the approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM  when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.NOTES1. The Company strongly encourages all shareholders to submit a proxy vote in advance of the AGM  appointing the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy rather than a named person. These notes to the Notice should be read in this context.2. Only persons entered on the Register of Members of the Company at 6.30 pm on Tuesday  10 May 2022 (or  if the AGM is adjourned  at 6.30 pm on the date which is two business days prior to the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM or adjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of persons to attend or vote (and the number of votes they may cast) at the AGM or adjourned meeting.3. A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint another person as her/his proxy to exercise all or any of her/his rights to attend  speak and vote at the AGM. A shareholder can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the AGM  provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder.4. A proxy does not need to be a shareholder of the Company but must attend the AGM to represent you. Your proxy could be the Chairman or another person who has agreed to attend to represent you. If you wish for a proxy to make any comments on your behalf at the AGM  you will need to appoint someone other than the Chairman of the meeting and give them the relevant instructions directly. Those submitting a Form of Proxy are strongly encouraged to appoint the Chairman of the meeting rather than a named person as their proxy. This will ensure that your vote will be counted even if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person.5. A shareholder who wishes to appoint a proxy should complete the Form of Proxy which accompanies this notice and includes full details of how to appoint a proxy. If you do not have a Form of Proxy and believe that you should have one  or if you require additional Forms of Proxy  please contact Equiniti’s helpline on 0371 384 2701 (+44 121 415 7047 if calling from overseas). Lines are open between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays in England and Wales). Shareholders who hold their shares in uncertificated form may use ‘the CREST voting service’ to appoint a proxy electronically  as explained below.6. In order to be valid  a proxy appointment must be returned (together with any power of attorney or other authority under which it is executed or a copy of the authority certified in ink by a bank  a stockbroker or a solicitor) by one of the following methods:– in hard copy form by post  by courier or by hand to the Company’s registrar at the address shown on the Form of Proxy; or in the case of CREST members  by utilising the CREST voting service in accordance with the procedures set out in note 9 below.The appointment of a proxy in each case must formally be received by the Company’s registrar no later than 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022.You may also appoint your proxy electronically online at www.sharevote.co.uk where full instructions on the procedure are given. The Voting ID  Task ID and Shareholder Reference Number printed on the Form of Proxy will be required to use this electronic proxy appointment system. Alternatively  shareholders who have already registered with Equiniti Registrars’ online portfolio service  Shareview  can appoint their proxy electronically by logging on to their portfolio at www.shareview.co.uk using their user ID and password. Once logged in  click ‘view’ on the ‘My Investments’ page. Click on the link to vote and follow the on screen instructions.7. To change your proxy instructions you may return a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard copy Form of Proxy and would like to change the instructions using another hard copy Form of Proxy  please contact Equiniti at Aspect House  Spencer Road  Lancing  West Sussex BN99 6DA. The deadline for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in relation to amended instructions. Any attempt to terminate or amend a proxy appointment received after the relevant deadline will be disregarded. Where two or more valid but differing appointments of proxy are delivered or (in the case of appointments in electronic form) received in respect of the same share for use at the same meeting  the one which is last delivered or  as the case may be  received as aforesaid (regardless of its date  its date of sending or the date of its execution) shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other or others as regards that share. If the Company is unable to determine either which is last sent or which is last delivered or received  none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of the relevant share(s).In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).8. A copy of this notice has been sent for information only  to Nominated Persons (that is  a person who has been nominated by a shareholder to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006). The rights to appoint a proxy cannot be exercised by a Nominated Person; they can only be exercised by a shareholder. However  a Nominated Person may have a right under an agreement with the shareholder by whom she or he was nominated to be appointed as a proxy for the AGM or to have someone else so appointed. If a Nominated Person does not have such a right or does not wish to exercise it  she or he may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.9. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual  which can be viewed at www.euroclear.com. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID number RA19) by 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022 (the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in this notice). For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.10. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.11. Voting on all Resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll rather than a show of hands. This is a more transparent method of voting as shareholders’ votes (including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting) are to be counted according to the number of shares held. As soon as practicable  following the AGM  the results of the voting will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and also placed on the Company’s website: osb.co.uk/investors/shareholder-services/.12. Please note that the Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that no viruses are present in any electronic communication it sends out but the Company cannot accept responsibility for loss or damage arising from the opening or use of any email or attachments from the Company and recommends that shareholders subject all messages to virus checking procedures prior to use. Any electronic communication received by the Company  including the lodgment of an electronic proxy form  that is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.13. A shareholder of the Company  that is a corporation  may authorise a person or persons to act as its representative(s) at the AGM. In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006  each such representative may exercise (on behalf of the corporation) the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual shareholder of the Company  provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.14. Shareholders satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 can require the Company to publish a statement on its website setting out any matter relating to the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the Auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the AGM and that the shareholders propose to raise at the AGM. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting the publication to pay its expenses. Any statement placed on the website must also be sent to the Company’s Auditor no later than the time it makes its statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the AGM includes any statement that the Company has been required to publish on its website.15. Under section 319A of the Companies Act 2006  the Company must  subject to limited exceptions  answer any question relating to the business being dealt with at the AGM which is put by a shareholder attending the AGM. Information relating to the AGM which the Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website in advance of the meeting may be viewed at osb.co.uk/investors/ shareholder-services/. You may not use any electronic address provided in this notice to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.16. Shareholders have the right to ask questions in relation to the business of the AGM but no answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the AGM or involve the disclosure of confidential information  (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question  or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the AGM that the question be answered. Shareholders wishing to raise any questions relating to the business of the AGM may do so by submitting them to the Company Secretariat ahead of the AGM at company.secretariat@osb.co.uk. You may submit questions until 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022 and the Company will endeavour to publish and maintain an appropriate summary of responses on the ‘AGM Information’ page of its website in advance of the AGM.17.

NEW YORK  March 31  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- FABRIC  the Fashion And Business Resource Innovation Center  implemented Lectra'…,"From their early beginnings  they realized that one of the best ways they could help their designers be competitive in the industry as a whole was to integrate Gerber Technology  a Lectra company's IoT-enabled solutions into their workflow. This foresight was critical when the pandemic hit  as people started to seize the opportunity to start their long-awaited apparel businesses but couldn't access the resources or the manufacturing usually available overseas. The need to produce product domestically and in smaller batches  without a significant price increase for the customer  became essential.The co-founders of FABRIC both knew first-hand how daunting  overwhelming and costly it was to start an apparel business and wanted to ease that burden for others. They called it ""Democratizing Fashion"".""We wanted to figure out how to provide the resources for an apparel entrepreneur under one roof and help these apparel entrepreneurs be more competitive with the bigger brands "" said co-founder Angela Johnson  on why they started FABRIC.Their mission has resulted in helping nearly 800 apparel entrepreneurs bring their dreams to life and resulted in more than $6.8 million donated in free and discounted programs and services. FABRIC is unique in that they don't turn away brands who need help finding the right resources to manufacture garments. They focus their efforts on helping a higher volume of smaller brands  instead of allowing the production needs of bigger brands to edge out those most in need of their services.This strategy of small batches and unique products required a reinvention of the process  as well as an ability to connect the dots between the different systems and managing data from design to the final product. FABRIC always wanted to support 21st century manufacturing for smaller  digitally-native brands  and when they saw Gerber's Innovation Center and Microfactory in New York City—they were able to realize the possibilities.Upon visiting the Innovation Center  co-founder Sherri Barry remarked how seamless and integrated the process was and imagined the possibilities for her own customers. She noted the ability to ""start with any surface design  have it patterned in Gerber AccuMark® 2D/3D  visualized with a 3D sample  digitally printed  then cut with an IoT-enabled cutter and sewn  really made on-demand production a reality.""Gerber AccuMark allows the development of 2D digital patterns that can be visualized in 3D with production accuracy while avoiding the need for creating a physical sample and ensuring a perfect fit. When surface designs are involved  the images are positioned in AccuMark patterns  and then data is passed seamlessly to the Kornit Presto digital printer and accurately read and cut using the Gerber Z1 cutter with ContourVision™.FABRIC continued to fuel the expansion of their technology suite by including Gerber YuniquePLM®  a cloud-based PLM system that helps to manage all the orders for their many brands. It also helps keep the data seamlessly connected to AccuMark and have it updated in real time.Adopting technology also helped FABRIC successfully pivot during the pandemic to large-batch production of PPE thanks to having a fully integrated technology-based system.Because of their reliance on Gerber's technology suite  FABRIC and The Fashioneer's complete microfactory are now able to provide cutting edge solutions and much needed resources to up and coming brands and designers nation-wide and may someday rival the traditional fashion hubs of the world.About Lectra:For companies that breathe life into our wardrobes  car interiors  furniture and more  Lectra crafts the premium technologies that facilitate the digital transformation of their industry.

2054,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://wwd.com/accessories-news/watches/the-panerai-playbook-jean-marc-pontroue-discusses-his-eco-ambitions-1235139721/,The Panerai Playbook: Jean-Marc Pontroué Discusses His Eco Ambitions,"Panerai's CEO Jean-Marc Pontroué believes sustainability is all about ""changing your habits. It’s a psychological thing. I strongly believe that the sort of changes that we are making don’t really take much — they don’t require a lot of effort.""",A high-end watch brand is taking on the Goliath of global warming by sourcing recycled materials for its products and packaging  and inviting fellow makers to do the same.Panerai’s chief executive officer Jean-Marc Pontroué has been defying watch industry convention in a number of ways.Not only is he making watches with recycled materials  but he’s published lists of his suppliers in the hope that Panerai’s competitors can use similar metals and substances  so they can all drive prices down.His collegial moves are unheard of in the secretive  and ultra-competitive  world of luxury watches.Pontroué is also committed to using only recycled packaging by 2023 and looking outside — way outside — the industry for inspiration.“We’ve learned a lot from the car industry  and from the Nespresso people. If they can recycle billions of coffee capsules  then why not us?” Pontroué said in an interview.Jean-Marc Pontroué ©The French executive  who cycles to work like many of his other Richemont colleagues in Switzerland  has also been looking at the automobile industry’s shift to electric power.“After 100 years  carmakers had to think differently  and they’ve invested billions in making changes. We don’t talk about that scale of investment in the watch industry  but we do feel a sense of responsibility to change the business model ” he said  adding that Panerai has a duty to make more sustainable products partly because of its historic connection to the ocean.The company was founded by Giovanni Panerai in Florence in 1860 as a watch shop  a workshop and a watchmaking school. It supplied precision instruments  and later technical watches  to the Italian Navy  and later to the Egyptian Navy.For most of its history  it’s been associated with the military and underwater performance  one reason why Panerai is working with UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. Together  they are developing ocean awareness activities as part of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development.It was only in the early ’90s that Panerai began making watches for civilians. It was acquired by Compagnie Financière Richemont (then known as the Vendôme Group) in 1997 and has developed a cult following.Collectors and fans of the watches  which range in price from around 3 800 pounds to upward of 60 000 pounds  are known as “Paneristi ” and once a year  a group of them — unrelated to the company — will meet to discuss the latest developments of the watches.Panerai’s largest market is the U.S.  where it has 20 stores. That’s partly down to Sylvester Stallone  who snapped up a host of Panerai watches while filming the 1996 film “Daylight” at Cinecittà studios in Rome  and gifted them to friends back in Hollywood — no doubt attracted by the watch’s unique oversize style — easier for a diver to see underwater and perfect for an action hero’s thicker wrists.Today  Panerai owners include Michael Jordan  former President Bill Clinton  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jason Statham. Earlier this year  Panerai got a free advertising boost after Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson wore the Panerai Submersible Goldtech OroCarbo while making his opening speech at the Super Bowl.Courtesy of NASA  and a Panerai customer from Scottsdale  Ariz.  Panerai has even traveled to the International Space Station to be tested in extreme temperature and pressure conditions.Pontroué’s sustainability drive has been going for a few years now. The first effort was small  and inspired by one of the brand’s longtime ambassadors  the explorer Mike Horn  who approached Pontroué about a steel shaft  weighing about 10 kg  from his sailing yacht Pangea. He could no longer use it and was wondering whether Panerai could somehow give it a new life.Panerai’s Submersible QuarantaQuattro eSteel Courtesy Image“So we brought it back to Neuchâtel [Switzerland] and asked the team what they could do with it. A couple of days later  they told me they could work with the metal ” Pontroué said.The result was the Panerai Submersible Ecopangaea Tourbillon GMT 50mm Mike Horn Edition of five watches  which cost $190 000 each. Every person who purchased the watch also had the opportunity to travel to the Arctic with Horn himself. How’s that for experiential retail?Although only five watches were made  the experiment with recycled metal set Panerai on its own mission to explore the possibilities of plying recycled materials into luxury  high-performance watches. “At the time  nobody was speaking about recyclability  or environment-friendly initiatives in the watch industry ” Pontroué said.Not long after  the company developed the Submersible eLab-ID “concept” watch  which boasted 98.6 percent recycled components. It made 30 of them  priced at 60 000 euros each. “We did the straps  the movements  each and every screw  the dial  the hands  the buckles  the packaging. It was not a profitable business. But based on those designs  we thought we could make it profitable ” he said.The watches featured a lightweight recycled titanium alloy. It also used recycled SuperLuminova on its dial and hands and recycled silicon.The eLab-ID concept watch was a shining example of Richemont’s sustainability strides last year  according to Matthew Kilgarriff  group director of corporate social responsibility and the author of the group’s annual ESG and DEI report. The report quotes Panerai as saying that it’s now possible to build a watch from scratch from existing materials  “and reduce the need for virgin material extraction  and its associated high environmental impact.”In order to source those recycled materials  Panerai said it had to establish a new supply chain and create the blueprint for these eco-watches.For his part  Kilgarriff noted that Panerai has proven that non-virgin material can be applied — in significant quantities — to anything  including “the glass in my office window  in your window and the watch on my wrist. For me  [Panerai] was one of the highlights of the year ” Kilgarriff told WWD in an interview last year.The company would later come out with a series of eSteel watches made from recycled metal. At Watches and Wonders this year  the company will be unveiling its latest eSteel models  with plans to make around 2 500 of them.The Mike Horn limited-edition watch. ©Panerai has described the Luminor Marina eSteel model  as “a big step in our commitment to reduce the need for virgin material extraction and its associated high environmental impact.”Some 89 grams of the Luminor Marina eSteel components are made of recycled-based materials  corresponding to nearly 60 percent of the weight of the watch.It will also be inviting competitors to source similar recycled materials and take inspiration from Panerai’s supply chain for their own models.“In Switzerland  everything is secret. Banking is a secret and so is watchmaking. Everything is low-profile. Now  we’re saying we want everybody to join in and copy what we’re doing. And  soon  we plan to talk about other brands’ recycled steel watches based on what we’ve been doing at Panerai ” Pontroué said.Panerai’s recycled steel comes from Eramet  a French multinational mining and metallurgy company  listed on the Euronext Paris exchange. According to the group’s website  it has earmarked multimillions of euros for innovation  and is looking to meet the needs “of the new digital and renewable energies industries.”Eramet is researching the recycling of numerous metals and their mineral derivatives; developing new grades of “superalloys and special steels” and researching the recycling of processed materials  such as lithium and nickel cadmium.Other companies that supplied recycled materials for the eLab-ID concept watch include Siltronix ST  which specializes in high-tech silicon products and processing; ProCadrans  which developed several technologies to deliver a dial made out of recycled materials  including titanium; RC Tritec  which produces luminescent materials for watchmaking; Novo Cristal  Panerai’s recycled sapphire partner; Ugitech  a France-based steel manufacturer and supplier of recycled steel  and Morellato  which makes watch straps from recycled plastic.The customer response to the watches made with recycled materials was overwhelmingly positive  Pontroué said.“We had no idea what the customer would say  or whether they would buy the watches. Now they are asking us why we don’t [use recycled materials] in the rest of our assortment. But we will. In the next three years  by 2025  all of the steel in our company will be recycled. There will be no more original steel in our assortment ” he said.Asked whether Panerai would have pushed its eco-agenda without the initial nudge from its ambassador Mike Horn  Pontroué said absolutely. He said living in Switzerland and making watches that can function in the deep sea  which is threatened by mountains of plastic waste  has been enough of an impetus.“We have the chance to live in the incredible country of Switzerland. Our feet are on the mountains  and we are relatively protected from pollution compared to many other cities in the world. And I strongly believe that the sort of changes that we are making don’t really take much — they don’t require a lot of effort  and not too much more money.”Panerai’s Swiss offices in Neuchâtel  which opened nearly a decade ago  have zero environmental impact with regard to carbon dioxide production  according to the company. The buildings have emission-reducing devices  electricity from renewable sources  while employees are cycling to work  rather than driving.The water used in production processes is reused for the toilets  for cleaning and in the cooling systems  while the energy produced by the machinery is reused in the heating system.A state-of-the-art heat pump system permits optimization of the energy produced by both the heating and cooling systems.Pontroué said sustainability shouldn’t be difficult. “It’s about changing your habits. It’s a psychological thing. Think about when you recycle plastic bottles. Maybe that was a challenge 10 or 20 years ago. Now we’re recycling espresso capsules  and I am cycling to work on my mountain bike. I do seven kilometers each morning  and each evening  which is the best moment of the day.”,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.15,0.22,0.63,True,English,"['The Panerai Playbook', 'Jean-Marc Pontroué', 'Eco\xa0Ambitions', 'Panerai Submersible Ecopangaea Tourbillon GMT 50mm Mike Horn Edition', 'Submersible QuarantaQuattro eSteel Courtesy Image', 'former President Bill Clinton', 'Submersible eLab-ID “concept” watch', 'Compagnie Financière Richemont', 'Panerai Submersible Goldtech OroCarbo', 'lightweight recycled titanium alloy', 'other Richemont colleagues', 'Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission', 'United Nations Decade', 'unique oversize style', 'free advertising boost', 'The Rock” Johnson', 'International Space Station', 'sailing yacht Pangea', 'chief executive officer', 'ocean awareness activities', 'Vendôme Group', 'recycled metal set', 'high-end watch brand', 'watch industry convention', 'luxury, high-performance watches', 'recycled materials', 'French executive', 'watch shop', 'luxury watches', 'global warming', 'fellow makers', 'similar metals', 'collegial moves', 'ultra-competitive, world', 'car industry', 'Nespresso people', 'coffee capsules', 'Jean-Marc Pontroué', 'automobile industry', 'electric power', 'business model', 'historic connection', 'watchmaking school', 'precision instruments', 'Italian Navy', 'Egyptian Navy', 'one reason', 'Ocean Sciences', 'Sustainable Development', 'early ’90s', 'latest developments', 'largest market', 'U.S.', 'Sylvester Stallone', 'Cinecittà studios', 'action hero', 'thicker wrists', 'Michael Jordan', 'Arnold Schwarzenegger', 'Jason Statham', 'opening speech', 'Super Bowl', 'extreme temperature', 'pressure conditions', 'sustainability drive', 'first effort', 'longtime ambassadors', 'steel shaft', 'new life', 'Neuchâtel', 'experiential retail', 'environment-friendly initiatives', 'profitable business', 'Giovanni Panerai', 'Panerai owners', 'Panerai customer', 'recycled packaging', 'technical watches', 'five watches', 'Panerai watches', 'sustainable products', 'underwater performance', 'Jean-Marc Pontroué', 'Goliath', 'number', 'ways', 'lists', 'suppliers', 'hope', 'competitors', 'substances', 'prices', 'inspiration', 'lot', 'billions', 'interview', 'Switzerland', 'shift', '100 years', 'carmakers', 'changes', 'scale', 'investment', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'duty', 'company', 'Florence', 'workshop', 'history', 'military', 'UNESCO', 'part', 'civilians', 'cult', 'Collectors', 'fans', '3,800 pounds', '60,000 pounds', 'Paneristi', '20 stores', 'host', '1996 film', 'Daylight', 'Rome', 'friends', 'Hollywood', 'diver', 'Dwayne', 'NASA', 'Scottsdale', 'Ariz.', 'explorer', '10 kg', 'team', 'result', 'person', 'opportunity', 'Arctic', 'experiment', 'possibilities', 'recyclability', '98.6 percent', 'components', 'straps', 'movements', 'screw', 'dial', 'hands', 'buckles', 'designs', 'SuperLu']",2022-03-31,2022-03-31,wwd.com

It measures the total costs associated with operating a certain investment fund.According to Eric Balchunas  Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst  the offering is poised to severely undercut Switzerland-based crypto ETP issuer 21Shares  which charges its investors a 2.5% management fee.Earlier this week  the Solana  Cardano and Polkadot ETPs were also launched on Zurich-based SIX Swiss Exchange and Frankfurt-based Xetra.Cryptocurrency ETPs provide investors with exposure to a slew of cryptocurrencies in a secure and cost-efficient manner. Such products are typically popular in Europe  where regulators have shown a willingness to list such products. As reported by U.Today  21Shares recently launched ETPs for such exotic cryptocurrencies as Decentraland (MANA) and Aave (AAVE).Crypto investment firms are getting more creative. Earlier this month  Bloomberg reported that CoinShares had joined forces with crypto exchange FTX in order to launch a Solana-based ETP that would offer staking rewards in order to reduce management costs for investors.No Bitcoin ETF in the U.S.While there is already stiff competition among ETP issuers that offer exposure to esoteric altcoins  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is yet to greenlight a physically backed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.Leading cryptocurrency asset management Grayscale Investments  which is vying to be the first to launch a spot-based Bitcoin ETF  recently warned that its quest to launch such a product could result in a lawsuit against the formidable regulator.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.01,0.06,0.93,True,English,"['Polkadot ETPs', 'Euronext Exchanges', 'WisdomTree', 'Solana', 'Cardano', 'New York-based exchange-traded product sponsor', 'Zurich-based SIX Swiss Exchange', 'Switzerland-based crypto ETP issuer', 'Leading cryptocurrency asset management', 'crypto exchange FTX', 'Crypto investment firms', 'senior ETF analyst', 'total expense ratio', 'Bitcoin exchange-traded fund', 'spot-based Bitcoin ETF', 'U.S. Securities', 'investment fund', 'Exchange Commission', 'exchange-traded products', 'Cryptocurrency ETPs', '2.5% management fee', 'Solana-based ETP', 'management costs', 'ETP issuers', 'total costs', 'U.Today', 'Euronext exchanges', 'Eric Balchunas', 'Frankfurt-based Xetra', 'cost-efficient manner', 'staking rewards', 'stiff competition', 'esoteric altcoins', 'Grayscale Investments', 'formidable regulator', 'two ETPs', 'Such products', 'exotic cryptocurrencies', 'Polkadot ETPs', 'WisdomTree', 'Cardano', 'France', 'Netherlands', 'Amsterdam', 'Paris', 'Bloomberg', 'offering', '21Shares', 'investors', 'exposure', 'slew', 'secure', 'Europe', 'regulators', 'willingness', 'Decentraland', 'Aave', 'CoinShares', 'forces', 'order', 'quest', 'lawsuit']",2022-03-31,2022-03-31,u.today
2057,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.etfexpress.com/2022/03/31/309712/unique-geographies-lead-exchange-growth,Unique geographies lead to exchange growth,13 hours ago,Euronext | Best European Exchange for Listing ETFs - Silvia Bosoni  Group Head of ETFs  Euronext believes that its offering is unique  covering seven pan-European economies  now including Borsa Italiana in Milan.“Our goal is to supply services to all ETF issuers  to the liquidity providers and the buyside in all our geographies in a standardised manner ” Bosoni says.“I believe that Euronext won this award because ETP issuers appreciate the efficiency of our markets and the exposure we can give to their products  and for this reason they are increasing the offer on our markets. In 2021 we were able to list 765 ETPs and welcome 18 new ETP providers”Last year’s turnover on Euronext was EUR221 billion. The offer of listed ETPs at the end of 2021 was made up of 1 482 products in Italy and 1 333 in Paris and Amsterdam.A number of trends has dominated new listings  with ESG and sustainability being the most prevalent.“209 ESG ETPs were listed last year  nearly double what we did the previous year ” Bosoni says. “Almost all ETP issuers have increased their range of ESG products  emphasizing the fact that many companies are expanding their offers of sustainable exposures due to the high interest that both institutional and retail investors have on this topic.”She also notes that thematic exposure keeps growing  with ETPs based on a wide range of trends such as exposure to energy innovation  blockchain  technological evolution and products and services targeting the ageing population and millennials.Cryptocurrencies are another growing trend  with 60 cryptocurrency ETPs listed over 2021. These products  listed in Paris and Amsterdam  were particularly popular with retail investors.Single stock short and leveraged ETPs are also appreciated by retail investors looking for more volatility. Retail investors are important on the Italian market  in terms of volume  on overall products invested in by retail investors  they represent about 21 per cent  while in Paris this number is 14 per cent but steadily growing in the last two years.Looking forward  Bosoni believes that the increasing interest in commodities exposure will inevitably make ETPs in this sector more widely adopted and will also likely happen with products that capture the spike in inflation and its subsequent volatility.“From an industry point of view  it is clear that ESG has become a crucial component for every type of investment  influencing all products that are offered. One area that has huge potential is fixed income ETFs  which until now the ESG development has mainly been concentrated in the equity space.”She believes that this thematic trend will also continue with increased granularity and customisation to reflect the appetite from investors.Considering the European regulatory outlook  she also considers that the ongoing MiFID II review might have a relevant impact in shaping European markets in the next few years  while financial products will be modelled by the implementation of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).“From an exchange point of view  our aim is to continue to provide a marketplace where ETP issuers can offer the widest range of products  and investors can find the perfect match to their needs in a fair and efficient trading environment” Bosoni says.To return to the ETF Express European Awards’ Report 2022 click here.,neutral,0.26,0.72,0.02,positive,0.68,0.29,0.03,True,English,"['Unique geographies', 'exchange growth', 'ETF Express European Awards’ Report', 'ongoing MiFID II review', 'Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation', 'European regulatory outlook', 'seven pan-European economies', 'Single stock short', 'efficient trading environment', 'Best European Exchange', 'last two years', 'fixed income ETFs', '18 new ETP providers', 'ETF issuers', 'sustainable exposures', 'European markets', 'liquidity providers', 'new listings', 'exchange point', 'ETP issuers', 'Listing ETFs', 'Group Head', 'Borsa Italiana', 'standardised manner', 'many companies', 'high interest', 'energy innovation', 'technological evolution', 'ageing population', 'growing trend', 'Italian market', '21 per cent', '14 per cent', 'increasing interest', 'industry point', 'crucial component', 'One area', 'huge potential', 'equity space', 'thematic trend', 'relevant impact', 'perfect match', 'retail investors', 'wide range', 'widest range', 'ESG development', 'thematic exposure', 'commodities exposure', 'subsequent volatility', '60 cryptocurrency ETPs', 'leveraged ETPs', 'overall products', 'financial products', 'Silvia Bosoni', '209 ESG ETPs', 'ESG products', '765 ETPs', '1,482 products', 'Euronext', 'offering', 'Milan', 'goal', 'services', 'buyside', 'geographies', 'efficiency', 'reason', 'turnover', 'Italy', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'number', 'trends', 'sustainability', 'fact', 'offers', 'institutional', 'topic', 'blockchain', 'millennials', 'Cryptocurrencies', 'terms', 'volume', 'sector', 'spike', 'inflation', 'type', 'investment', 'granularity', 'customisation', 'appetite', 'implementation', 'SFDR', 'aim', 'marketplace', 'needs', 'fair']",2022-03-31,2022-03-31,etfexpress.com

Although the mainnet was launched in 2020 and is still in beta testing stage  Solana has gained popularity with use cases such as building decentralized social networks  blockchain gaming  and decentralized exchanges.Cardano was created in 2015 as a layer-1 smart contract platform as an alternative to the Ethereum network. It is built with a two-layer structure for enhanced security and utilize the PoS consensus model. Cardano delivered its smart contract functionality in 2021  and could see more decentralized applications for use cases such as education credential verification  retail product counterfeiting and in finance for Know Your Customer/Anti-Money Laundering checks.Polkadot was created in 2016 with a focus on interoperability between various blockchains for transferring data or assets. It utilizes a Proof of Authority model and is designed with a governance model that means the network does not need to be forked when incorporating upgrades. It hosts a wide variety of use cases including decentralized exchanges  data processors and bridging solutions.Through WisdomTree's cryptocurrency ETPs  investors can conveniently access a range of crypto assets without the need to hold them directly  store private access keys or interact with the blockchain or digital currency infrastructure in any way.

2067,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.globalinvestorgroup.com/articles/3698366/euroclear-joins-blockchain-payment-system-what-this-means-for-crypto-tech,Euroclear joins blockchain payment system: What this means for crypto tech,As Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) continues to grow in scope and scale  its use is becoming ever more widespread among diverse financial institutions - from improving their clearance and settlement mechanisms to enabling speedy payment processing services and matching growing customer expectations for more personalised ,By Manoj Mistry  Managing Director  IBOS AssociationAs Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) continues to grow in scope and scale  its use is becoming ever more widespread among diverse financial institutions - from improving their clearance and settlement mechanisms to enabling speedy payment processing services and matching growing customer expectations for more personalised  digitised services by enhancing the customer experience.Euroclear  the Belgium-headquartered international securities settlement house  is among the most recent of them to take the plunge through a small strategic investment in the regulated blockchain payments consortium  Fnality International - formerly Utility Settlement Coin (USC) - which is primarily comprised of global banks.The impetus of developing and investing in DLT is reinforced by new initiatives from assorted regulators to create the right conditions for its use in securities markets  such as the EU DLT pilot regime: a sandbox for tokenised securities and settlement that focuses on the tokenisation of conventional financial instruments such as stocks  bonds and UCITS.Last year  the Bank of England approved a new type of account at the central bank to cater for a broader range of anticipated payments systems  including those based on blockchain. In parallel  there is an increasing acceptance of DLT by market participants who recognise its potential to achieve a transformation of global capital markets.Euroclear currently offers settlement as an intermediary clearing agent for stock and bond trades: cash is swapped for the legal ownership of an asset at the conclusion of each transaction. It also provides settlement and custody of domestic and cross-border securities for bonds  equities and derivatives to investment funds.Owned by a group of banks and exchanges  which includes Euronext and the London Stock Exchange Group  Euroclear revealed that it settled nearly €1000 (£845 trillion) in securities last year. Its investment in Fnality is designed to develop its future DLT capabilities for stock and bond trades.The focus of its new partner is to build a blockchain-based payment system that supports the adoption of tokenised assets and marketplaces. With a global roll-out anticipated to start this year  Fnality’s network of distributed Financial Market Infrastructures (dFMIs) will aim to provide a near real time settlement capability in a central bank money-like digital cash asset while simultaneously facilitating compatibility and interaction with other platforms.Established in 2019  Fnality’s founding shareholders are: Banco Santander  BNY Mellon  Barclays  CIBC  Commerzbank  Credit Suisse  ING  KBC Group  Lloyds Banking Group  Mizuho Bank  MUFG Bank  Nasdaq  State Street Corporation  Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation and UBS.By using DLT  Fnality can offer central banks a system for managing payments that it describes as simpler  faster  safer and more resilient. Euroclear’s investment will have a positive impact on meeting Fnality’s objectives: to digitalise the process by removing paperwork and use digital versions of currencies instead.Through its stake in Fnality  Euroclear will hope to settle tokenised assets  or digital securities  against digital cash in a faster  more efficient way. Its contribution to Fnality will inevitably help to expand the consortium’s footprint in financial market infrastructure. The positive implications for the execution of Fnality’s business are self-evident  according to its CEO  Rhomaios Ram.For Euroclear  this strategic move will provide what it describes as ‘an innovative solution for the settlement of digital securities against digital cash on DLT.’ The ultimate aim is to increase speed and efficiency for assorted post-trade operations - from primary market issuance to secondary market and collateral trades  and servicing interest payments.The engagement with Fnality is also part of Euroclear’s continuing development of its DLT capabilities. Last October  a Euroclear-led consortium successfully experimented with a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for settling French treasury bonds on a test blockchain. Commissioned by the Banque de France  the French market experiment confirmed that blockchain technology is suitable to manage post-trade market operations in CBDC.The benefits for Euroclear are also self-evident  not least that the leverage of DLT will open more doors with the provision of enhanced product and liquidity options on a real-time basis. It is certainly a step in the right direction.Looking ahead  the focus on Real-Time Gross Settlement (RGTS) should be interesting  especially when combined with Continuous Linked Settlement (CLS). Notably  this also may be a potential threat to the offering that CLS provides to its current members  especially in relation to RTGS and the clearance of foreign exchange obligations.,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.61,0.14,0.25,True,English,"['blockchain payment system', 'crypto tech', 'Euroclear', 'near real time settlement capability', 'Belgium-headquartered international securities settlement house', 'speedy payment processing services', 'Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation', 'EU DLT pilot regime', 'distributed Financial Market Infrastructures', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'central bank digital currency', 'personalised, digitised services', 'State Street Corporation', 'foreign exchange obligations', 'diverse financial institutions', 'conventional financial instruments', 'Distributed Ledger Technology', 'intermediary clearing agent', 'Lloyds Banking Group', 'Banque de France', 'primary market issuance', 'French market experiment', 'growing customer expectations', 'Utility Settlement Coin', 'blockchain-based payment system', 'Continuous Linked Settlement', 'central bank money', 'Real-Time Gross Settlement', 'post-trade market operations', 'global capital markets', 'French treasury bonds', 'small strategic investment', 'future DLT capabilities', 'digital cash asset', 'blockchain payments consortium', 'post-trade operations', 'market participants', 'secondary market', 'securities markets', 'digital securities', 'Fnality International', 'settlement mechanisms', 'customer experience', 'KBC Group', 'strategic move', 'blockchain technology', 'real-time basis', 'digital versions', 'central banks', 'global roll-out', 'Mizuho Bank', 'MUFG Bank', 'tokenised securities', 'cross-border securities', 'Manoj Mistry', 'Managing Director', 'IBOS Association', 'global banks', 'new initiatives', 'right conditions', 'new type', 'broader range', 'payments systems', 'increasing acceptance', 'bond trades', 'legal ownership', 'new partner', 'tokenised assets', 'other platforms', 'founding shareholders', 'Banco Santander', 'BNY Mellon', 'Credit Suisse', 'positive impact', 'efficient way', 'positive implications', 'Rhomaios Ram', 'innovative solution', 'ultimate aim', 'collateral trades', 'interest payments', 'continuing development', 'Euroclear-led consortium', 'test blockchain', 'enhanced product', 'liquidity options', 'right direction', 'current members', 'investment funds', 'potential threat', 'scope', 'scale', 'clearance', 'plunge', 'USC', 'impetus', 'assorted', 'regulators', 'sandbox', 'tokenisation', 'stocks', 'UCITS', 'England', 'account', 'parallel', 'transformation', 'conclusion', 'transaction', 'custody', 'domestic', 'equities', 'derivatives', 'exchanges', 'Euronext', 'focus', 'adoption', 'marketplaces', 'network', 'dFMIs', 'compatibility', 'interaction', 'Barclays', 'CIBC', 'Commerzbank', 'Nasdaq', 'UBS', 'objectives', 'paperwork', 'currencies', 'stake', 'contribution', 'footprint', 'execution', 'business', 'CEO', 'efficiency', 'engagement', 'CBDC', 'benefits', 'leverage', 'doors', 'provision', 'step', 'RGTS', 'CLS', 'offering', 'relation', 'RTGS']",2022-03-31,2022-03-31,globalinvestorgroup.com
