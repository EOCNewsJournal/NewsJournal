PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy has announced that the principally responsible auditor would be Maria Grönroos (APA). The term of the auditor will end at the closing of the next Annual General Meeting following the election.The proposal of the Board of Directors is based on the competitive procurement process of the company’s audit. As a result of the competitive process  the company received offers from four authorised public accountant organisations. According to the evaluation of the Board  PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy best fulfils the selection criteria that had been determined in advance. Under the Article 16 paragraph 2 of the Audit Regulation the Board needs to identify two choices for the auditor engagement and express a justified preference for one of them. The Board has evaluated the auditor candidates against a variety of customary used selection criteria. Based on the criteria the Board has identified PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy and Ernst&Young Oy as the best choices for the audit engagement. After careful assessment and considerations  the Board’s preference is PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy.The Board of Directors notes that its recommendation is free from influence by a third party  and the Board of Directors is not subject to compliance with any such clauses referred to in Article 16(6) of the EU Audit Regulation (537/2014) that would restrict the choice as regards the appointment of a statutory auditor or audit firm.16. Share issue without payment (share split)The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting that in order to enhance the liquidity of the company’s shares  new company shares shall be issued to the shareholders without payment in proportion to their holdings so that four new shares are issued for each share (share split).Based on the number of company’s shares as at the date of this notice  a total of 23 397 308 new shares will be issued. The shares shall be issued to the shareholders who are registered in the shareholders’ register maintained by Euroclear Finland Ltd on the record day of the share issue of 3 May 2022. The share issue without payment shall be executed in the book-entry system and will not require any actions by the shareholders. The new shares will generate shareholder rights when they have been registered in the trade register  approximately on 3 May 2022. The registration of the new shares in the shareholders’ book-entry accounts is planned to occur on 4 May 2022.The new shares will not entitle their holders to dividends decided before registration to the trade register  but they will entitle to dividends decided after the registration.17. Authorising the Board of Directors to decide on the issuance of shares as well as the issuance of other special rights entitling to sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting will authorise the Board of Directors to decide to issue new shares either against payment or without payment. The authorisation would be given to a maximum quantity of 584 932 new shares which represent approximately 10 per cent of the total number of shares in the company at the date of this notice. If the Annual General Meeting approves the Board’s proposal concerning a share issue without payment in accordance with section 16 of this notice  the maximum number of shares to be issued totals a maximum of 2 924 660 shares  which represent approximately 10 per cent of total number of shares in the company after the new shares to be issued in share issue without payment have been registered.The new shares may be issued to the company's shareholders in proportion to their current shareholdings in the company or deviating from the shareholders' pre-emptive right through one or more directed share issue  if the company has a weighty financial reason to do so  such as developing the company's equity structure  implementing mergers and acquisitions or other restructuring measures aimed at developing the company's business  financing of investments and operations or using the shares as a part of the company's remuneration and compensation system. The Board of Directors would decide upon terms and scope related to share issues.Based on the authorisation  the Board of Directors can  pursuant to chapter 10  section 1  of the Companies Act  also decide on issuing other special rights  either against payment or without payment  entitling to new shares of the company.The subscription price of the new shares can be recorded partly or fully to the invested unrestricted equity reserves or to equity according to the decision of the Board of Directors.

In the event that the purchase offer is oversubscribed  the acquisition may be conducted in accordance with the proportion of the shareholdings held by the tendering shareholders to each other (shareholding quotas) or in accordance with the proportion of the tendered shares (tendering quotas). In addition  for the avoidance of calculational fractions of shares  rounding may be applied. A preferential acceptance of small numbers of shares (up to 50 tendered shares per shareholder) may be provided for.

The purchase price per share payable upon exercise of Put Options or Call Options or upon falling due of the Forward Purchase may not exceed or fall short of  by more than 10 per cent  the arithmetic mean of the auction closing prices of shares of the same class of the Company in Xetra trading (or a functionally comparable successor system to the Xetra system) at the Frankfurt Stock Exchange on the last three exchange trading days before the conclusion of the relevant derivative transaction (in each case without ancillary acquisition costs  but taking into account the option premium received or  respectively  paid).If treasury shares are acquired using Derivatives in accordance with the above provisions  any right of shareholders to enter into such Derivatives transactions with the Company and any right of shareholders to tender their shares shall be excluded.With regard to the utilisation of treasury shares of the Company that were acquired using Derivatives the provisions stipulated in the resolution proposal regarding item (20) above apply.(22) Closing of the Meeting2 MEETING MATERIALSThe proposals of the Board of Directors relating to the agenda of the General Meeting of Shareholders as well as this notice and the Remuneration Report for Governing Bodies are available on Multitude SE’s website at https://www.multitude.com/.The Annual Report of Multitude SE  the Company’s Annual Accounts  the report of the Board of Directors and the Auditor’s report  are also available on the above-mentioned Multitude SE’s website.Copies of these documents and of this notice will be sent to shareholders upon request.The minutes of the meeting will be made available on Multitude SE’s website no later than on 11 May 2022.3 INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERSA shareholder may participate in the General Meeting and exercise his/her rights at the meeting only by voting in advance and by presenting counterproposals and questions in advance in accordance with the instructions provided below.It will not be possible to participate in the meeting in person.3.1 Shareholders Registered in Shareholders’ RegisterEach shareholder who is registered in the shareholders’ register of the Company held by Euroclear Finland Oy on 13 April 2022  has the right to participate in the General Meeting of Shareholders.

The Board of Directors proposes that the authorization entitles the Board to deviate from the shareholders' proportional shareholdings (directed acquisition).

A right may also be given to a creditor in such manner that the right includes a condition that the creditor's receivable is used to set off the subscription price (convertible loan). The subscription price of the new shares and the amount paid for the company's own shares will be added to the fund for invested unrestricted equity.The authorization entitles the Board to deviate from the from the pre-emptive subscription rights of the existing shareholders  provided that the company has an important financial reason to do so  as regards the issue against payment  and that there is an especially important reason for the company and the good of the shareholders to do so  as regards the free issue.

The fear  regulators and lawmakers have said  is that a run on tokens that aren’t fully backed by cash could be calamitous.In December  fears surrounding commercial paper  or corporate loans  sent traditional and crypto markets plummeting after Chinese developer Evergrande missed an $82 million loan payment.

Explanatory notes to the business to be considered are set out from page 6 of this document.VOTING AT THE AGMI will  once again  be inviting you to vote on all Resolutions at the AGM by way of a poll rather than on a show of hands. Poll voting is in line with practice adopted by many UK public companies and provides a more transparent method of voting. It will result in a more accurate reflection of the views of shareholders by ensuring that every vote is recognised  including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting. On a poll  each shareholder has one vote for every share held. I would encourage shareholders to exercise their right to vote  but in light of the COVID-19 pandemic  the Company strongly encourages all shareholders to submit a proxy vote in advance of the AGM  appointing the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy rather than a named person. This will ensure that your vote will be counted if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting (for example because of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic). Instructions for completing the Form of Proxy are outlined below. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person.ACTION TO BE TAKENPlease complete and return the enclosed Form of Proxy so that it is received by the Company’s Registrar  Equiniti  by no later than 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022. If you are a member of CREST  you may submit a proxy appointment electronically through the CREST voting service. Further details are set out in the Notes section on pages 10 to 11.The results of voting on the Resolutions will be announced to the London Stock Exchange and posted on the Company’s website following the conclusion of the AGM.RECOMMENDATIONThe Directors recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each of the Resolutions at the AGM. The Board considers that the Resolutions are in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders as a whole and will promote the success of the Company for their benefit. The Directors intend to vote in favour of the Resolutions in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings in the Company (save in respect of those Resolutions in which they are interested).COVID-19In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic  the Company may put in place procedures  including as a condition of admission to the AGM venue  to align with UK government guidelines at the time of the AGM or as a safety measure  where appropriate. Anyone attending the AGM in person shall be required to adhere to all UK Government guidance and restrictions and all site rules at the AGM venue.Should it become appropriate to revise the current arrangements for the AGM  any such changes will be notified to shareholders through our website (www.osb.co.uk) and  where appropriate  by announcement made by the Company to a Regulatory Information Service.Yours faithfullyDavid WeymouthChairmanNOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGNotice is hereby given that the Annual General Meeting of OSB GROUP PLC (the Company) will be held at 90 Whitfield Street  Fitzrovia  London W1T 4EZ on Thursday  12 May 2022 at 11 am to consider and  if thought fit  pass the following Resolutions.Resolutions 1 to 9 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions.

The Board considers that Simon Walker has and will continue to make a valuable contribution to the Board and that he has sufficient time to devote to the Company’s affairs. The election to the Board of Simon Walker has been recommended by the Group Nomination and Governance Committee. The biographies of Directors can be found in the Appendix to this document and also on the Company’s website www.osb.co.uk.RESOLUTIONS 5 AND 6: Re-appointment and remuneration of the Auditor (ordinary resolutions)The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company  to hold office until the conclusion of the next such meeting. The Group Audit Committee has recommended to the Board the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as Auditor of the Company and has confirmed to the Board that its recommendation is free from third party influence and that no restrictive contractual provisions have been imposed on the Company limiting the choice of auditor. Resolution 5 proposes the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Auditor of the Company and Resolution 6 authorises the Group Audit Committee to agree the Auditor’s remuneration.RESOLUTION 7: Authority to make political donations (ordinary resolution)Section 368 of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) prohibits companies from making political donations exceeding £5 000 in aggregate in any 12-month period to (i) political parties  (ii) other political organisations and (iii) independent election candidates  and from incurring political expenditure  without shareholder approval. In line with the Group’s policy  neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries made any political donations nor incurred any political expenditure during 2021. It is not proposed or intended to alter this policy. However  some of the Group’s activities may potentially fall within the wide definitions of ‘political donation’ or ‘political expenditure’ in the Act and  without the necessary statutory authorisation  the Group’s ability to communicate its views effectively to political audiences and to relevant interest groups could be inhibited. Such activities may include briefings at receptions or conferences – when the Group seeks to communicate its views on issues vital to its business interests – including  for example  conferences of a party political nature or of special interest groups in specific areas.Accordingly  the Company believes that the authority contained in this Resolution is necessary to allow it and its subsidiaries to fund activities which it is in the interests of shareholders that the Company should support. Such authority will enable the Company and its subsidiaries to be sure that they do not  because of any uncertainty as to the bodies or the activities covered by the Companies Act 2006  unintentionally commit a technical breach of the statutes. Any political donation made or expenditure incurred under authority of this Resolution will be disclosed in next year’s Annual Report and Accounts.This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2021 and will expire at close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2023.RESOLUTION 8: Directors’ authority to allot shares (ordinary resolution)The Directors currently have a general authority to allot new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any securities into  shares. This authority is  however  due to expire at the AGM and the Board would like to renew it to provide the Directors with flexibility to allot new shares and grant rights up until the Company’s next AGM within the limits prescribed by The Investment Association.The Investment Association’s guidelines on Directors’ authority to allot shares state that the Association’s members will regard as routine any proposal at a general meeting to seek a general authority to allot an amount up to two-thirds of the existing share capital  provided that any amount in excess of one-third of the existing share capital is applied to fully pre-emptive rights issues only. Accordingly  if passed  this resolution will authorise the Directors to allot (or grant rights over) new shares in the Company: (i) under an open offer or in other situations (including a rights issue) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1 499 087.56 (representing approximately 33 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital); and (ii) under a rights issue only  up to a further aggregate nominal amount of £1 499 087.56 (representing approximately 33 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital). In each case  the reference to the Company’s issued ordinary share capital is to the issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document).If passed  this authority will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2023. The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority  however  the Board considers it prudent to maintain the flexibility that it provides to enable the Directors to respond to any appropriate opportunities that may arise. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 24 March 2022.RESOLUTION 9: Directors’ authority to allot shares in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (ordinary resolution)This Resolution renews the Directors’ authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £539 671.22  in connection with the issue of ‘Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments’. Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments are any securities to be issued by the Company or any member of the Group  or by a Company outside of the Group with the consent of the Company or a member of the Group and which are intended on issue to form all or part of a type or class of securities  the terms of which are eligible to meet any Regulatory Capital Requirements and which are:convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares of the Company; orissued together with share warrants relating to ordinary shares of the Company;and in each case  which grant to  or require  the holder of such security and/or its nominee a right or obligation (as applicable) to subscribe for such ordinary shares following a specified event relating to an actual or prospective adverse change in the capital position or viability of the Company  any member of the Group or the Group as a whole or any other event specified in the Regulatory Capital Requirements and otherwise on such terms as may be determined by the Directors of the Company or a Committee thereof upon issue.The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company to have the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments at any time and from time to time. The authority sought in this Resolution will be used as considered desirable to comply with or maintain compliance with such Regulatory Capital Requirements or targets applicable to the Company. Regulatory Capital Requirements are specified by the Prudential Regulation Authority or such other authority having primary supervisory authority with respect to the Company from time to time in relation to the margin of solvency  capital resources  capital  contingent capital or buffer capital of the Company  a member of the Group or the Group taken as a whole.The Company intends to seek to renew authority for the issuance of such Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments on an annual basis.The amount of this authority is  in aggregate  equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). No ordinary shares were held in treasury as at that date.Resolutions 9 and 12 are intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to authorise the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which contain contractual debt to equity conversion features. The Resolutions are not intended to provide authority for any future UK statutory conversion requirements as may become part of UK national law in the future  for which such authority would not be required.The authority sought in Resolution 9 is separate and distinct from the authority sought in Resolution 8 which is the usual authority sought on an annual basis in line with guidance issued by The Investment Association. The authority sought in Resolution 9 will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2023.RESOLUTIONS 10 and 11: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights (special resolutions)Resolutions 10 and 11 are special resolutions which  if passed by shareholders  will enable the Directors to allot ordinary shares in the Company  and/or to sell any shares out of treasury  for cash  without first offering those shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.The proposed resolutions essentially replicate the powers which were granted at last year’s AGM (and which will expire at the AGM). Such powers reflect the Statement of Principles published by The Pre-Emption Group in March 2015  which provides that a company may seek power to issue  on a non-pre-emptive basis for cash  shares in any one year representing:(i) no more than five per cent of the company’s issued ordinary share capital; and (ii) no more than an additional five per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital provided that such additional power is only used in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment.The 2015 Statement of Principles defines a ‘specified capital investment’ as ‘one or more specific capital investment related uses for the proceeds of an issuance of equity securities  in respect of which sufficient information regarding the effect of the transaction on the listed company  the assets  the subject of the transaction and (where appropriate) the profits attributable to them is made available to shareholders to enable them to reach an assessment of the potential return’. Items that are regarded as operating expenditure rather than capital expenditure will not typically be regarded as falling within the term ‘specified capital investment’.In line with best practice  the Company has structured its pre-emption disapplication request as two separate resolutions. Resolution 10 is proposed as a special resolution. If this resolution is passed by shareholders  it will permit the Directors to allot ordinary shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis both in connection with a rights issue or similar pre-emptive offer and  otherwise than in connection with any such issue  up to a maximum nominal amount of £224 863.01. This amount represents approximately five per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document). This resolution will permit the Directors to allot any such shares for cash in any circumstances (whether or not in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment).Resolution 11 is also proposed as a special resolution. If this resolution is passed by shareholders  it will afford the Directors an additional power to allot ordinary shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis up to a further maximum nominal amount of £224 863.01. This amount also represents approximately five per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022. The Directors shall use any power conferred by Resolution 11 only in connection with an acquisition or a specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issue  or which has taken place in the preceding six month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue.The Directors confirm their intention to follow the provisions of the 2015 Statement of Principles regarding cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling three year period. Those provisions state that a company should not issue shares for cash representing more than 7.5 per cent of the company’s issued share capital in any rolling three year period  other than to existing shareholders  without prior consultation with shareholders. This limit excludes any ordinary shares issued pursuant to a general disapplication of pre-emption rights in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment.RESOLUTION 12: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (special resolution)Resolution 9 renews the Directors’ authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £539 671.22 specifically in connection with the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments. Resolution 12 proposes that the Directors be empowered to allot equity securities pursuant to that authority for cash  without first offering those equity securities to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. £539 671.22 is equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document).Renewing this Resolution will permit the Company the flexibility necessary to allot equity securities pursuant to any proposal to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments and  by virtue of such disapplication  without the need to comply with the pre-emption requirements of the UK statutory regime. Together with Resolution 9  Resolution 12 is intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which may convert into ordinary shares.Conditional upon the passing of Resolutions 9 and 12  the Directors would not expect to make use of Resolutions 8 and 11 to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments  however  they may do so  to the extent permissible  if deemed appropriate in light of capital requirements  market conditions and/or high demand. Any exercise of the authorities in Resolutions 8 and 10 (if passed) would be separate from  and in addition to  the exercise of powers under Resolutions 9 and 12 and would have the effect of diluting the interests of ordinary shareholders.RESOLUTION 13: Authority to purchase own shares (special resolution)Resolution 13 gives the Company authority to buy back its own ordinary shares in the market as permitted by the Companies Act 2006.The authority limits the maximum number of shares that could be purchased to 44 972 602 (representing approximately 10 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022) and sets minimum and maximum prices at which shares may be purchased.This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2021 and will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2023. A listed company purchasing its own shares may hold those shares in treasury and make them available for re-sale as an alternative to cancelling them. Accordingly  if this Resolution is passed  the Company will have the option of holding  as treasury shares  any of its own shares that it purchases pursuant to the authority conferred.This would give the Company the ability to sell treasury shares quickly and cost-effectively and provide the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base. No dividends are paid and no voting rights are attached to shares held in treasury. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). As at that date  there were 2 413 983 options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the capital of the Company  representing 0.54 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. If the full authority conferred by this Resolution were to be exercised in full  these options would represent 0.60 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.Further to the announcement on 17 March 2022  the Company has commenced a share buyback programme for an amount of up to £100 million (the Share Buyback) pursuant to the authority granted at last year’s AGM. The Share Buyback is expected to end no later than 21 February 2023. Any shares purchased by the Company under the Share Buyback are to be cancelled. The Directors regard having the flexibility to repurchase issued shares in suitable circumstances as an important part of the financial management of the Company. The Directors may consider exercising the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares if market conditions and the Company’s financial position make this possible but will keep the matter under review. Shares would only be purchased if the Directors believed that to do so would result in an improvement in earnings per share and would be in the interests of shareholders generally. Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases on a recognised investment exchange and purchased shares would be cancelled (in which case the number of shares in issue would thereby be reduced) or  alternatively  held in treasury  depending on which course of action is considered by the Directors to be in the best interests of the shareholders at that time.RESOLUTION 14: Notice of general meetings (special resolution)The statutory notice period required for general meetings of the Company is at least 21 clear days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period  which cannot  however  be less than 14 clear days (AGMs will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice). At last year’s AGM  shareholders passed a resolution enabling the Company to call general meetings  other than an AGM  on at least 14 clear days’ notice. This approval must be renewed at each AGM  so  in order to preserve this ability  Resolution 14 seeks such approval. It is intended that the shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole. If given  the approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM  when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.NOTES1. The Company strongly encourages all shareholders to submit a proxy vote in advance of the AGM  appointing the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy rather than a named person. These notes to the Notice should be read in this context.2. Only persons entered on the Register of Members of the Company at 6.30 pm on Tuesday  10 May 2022 (or  if the AGM is adjourned  at 6.30 pm on the date which is two business days prior to the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM or adjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of persons to attend or vote (and the number of votes they may cast) at the AGM or adjourned meeting.3. A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint another person as her/his proxy to exercise all or any of her/his rights to attend  speak and vote at the AGM. A shareholder can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the AGM  provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder.4. A proxy does not need to be a shareholder of the Company but must attend the AGM to represent you. Your proxy could be the Chairman or another person who has agreed to attend to represent you. If you wish for a proxy to make any comments on your behalf at the AGM  you will need to appoint someone other than the Chairman of the meeting and give them the relevant instructions directly. Those submitting a Form of Proxy are strongly encouraged to appoint the Chairman of the meeting rather than a named person as their proxy. This will ensure that your vote will be counted even if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person.5. A shareholder who wishes to appoint a proxy should complete the Form of Proxy which accompanies this notice and includes full details of how to appoint a proxy. If you do not have a Form of Proxy and believe that you should have one  or if you require additional Forms of Proxy  please contact Equiniti’s helpline on 0371 384 2701 (+44 121 415 7047 if calling from overseas). Lines are open between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays in England and Wales). Shareholders who hold their shares in uncertificated form may use ‘the CREST voting service’ to appoint a proxy electronically  as explained below.6. In order to be valid  a proxy appointment must be returned (together with any power of attorney or other authority under which it is executed or a copy of the authority certified in ink by a bank  a stockbroker or a solicitor) by one of the following methods:– in hard copy form by post  by courier or by hand to the Company’s registrar at the address shown on the Form of Proxy; or in the case of CREST members  by utilising the CREST voting service in accordance with the procedures set out in note 9 below.The appointment of a proxy in each case must formally be received by the Company’s registrar no later than 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022.You may also appoint your proxy electronically online at www.sharevote.co.uk where full instructions on the procedure are given. The Voting ID  Task ID and Shareholder Reference Number printed on the Form of Proxy will be required to use this electronic proxy appointment system. Alternatively  shareholders who have already registered with Equiniti Registrars’ online portfolio service  Shareview  can appoint their proxy electronically by logging on to their portfolio at www.shareview.co.uk using their user ID and password. Once logged in  click ‘view’ on the ‘My Investments’ page. Click on the link to vote and follow the on screen instructions.7. To change your proxy instructions you may return a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard copy Form of Proxy and would like to change the instructions using another hard copy Form of Proxy  please contact Equiniti at Aspect House  Spencer Road  Lancing  West Sussex BN99 6DA. The deadline for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in relation to amended instructions. Any attempt to terminate or amend a proxy appointment received after the relevant deadline will be disregarded. Where two or more valid but differing appointments of proxy are delivered or (in the case of appointments in electronic form) received in respect of the same share for use at the same meeting  the one which is last delivered or  as the case may be  received as aforesaid (regardless of its date  its date of sending or the date of its execution) shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other or others as regards that share. If the Company is unable to determine either which is last sent or which is last delivered or received  none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of the relevant share(s).In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).8. A copy of this notice has been sent for information only  to Nominated Persons (that is  a person who has been nominated by a shareholder to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006). The rights to appoint a proxy cannot be exercised by a Nominated Person; they can only be exercised by a shareholder. However  a Nominated Person may have a right under an agreement with the shareholder by whom she or he was nominated to be appointed as a proxy for the AGM or to have someone else so appointed. If a Nominated Person does not have such a right or does not wish to exercise it  she or he may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.9. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual  which can be viewed at www.euroclear.com. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID number RA19) by 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022 (the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in this notice). For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.10. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.11. Voting on all Resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll rather than a show of hands. This is a more transparent method of voting as shareholders’ votes (including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting) are to be counted according to the number of shares held. As soon as practicable  following the AGM  the results of the voting will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and also placed on the Company’s website: osb.co.uk/investors/shareholder-services/.12. Please note that the Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that no viruses are present in any electronic communication it sends out but the Company cannot accept responsibility for loss or damage arising from the opening or use of any email or attachments from the Company and recommends that shareholders subject all messages to virus checking procedures prior to use. Any electronic communication received by the Company  including the lodgment of an electronic proxy form  that is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.13. A shareholder of the Company  that is a corporation  may authorise a person or persons to act as its representative(s) at the AGM. In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006  each such representative may exercise (on behalf of the corporation) the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual shareholder of the Company  provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.14. Shareholders satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 can require the Company to publish a statement on its website setting out any matter relating to the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the Auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the AGM and that the shareholders propose to raise at the AGM. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting the publication to pay its expenses. Any statement placed on the website must also be sent to the Company’s Auditor no later than the time it makes its statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the AGM includes any statement that the Company has been required to publish on its website.15. Under section 319A of the Companies Act 2006  the Company must  subject to limited exceptions  answer any question relating to the business being dealt with at the AGM which is put by a shareholder attending the AGM. Information relating to the AGM which the Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website in advance of the meeting may be viewed at osb.co.uk/investors/ shareholder-services/. You may not use any electronic address provided in this notice to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.16. Shareholders have the right to ask questions in relation to the business of the AGM but no answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the AGM or involve the disclosure of confidential information  (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question  or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the AGM that the question be answered. Shareholders wishing to raise any questions relating to the business of the AGM may do so by submitting them to the Company Secretariat ahead of the AGM at company.secretariat@osb.co.uk. You may submit questions until 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022 and the Company will endeavour to publish and maintain an appropriate summary of responses on the ‘AGM Information’ page of its website in advance of the AGM.17. As at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document)  the Company’s issued share capital consisted of 449 726 018 ordinary shares  carrying one vote each.

Russia has made other dollar coupon payments earlier this month.Russia has said the buyback of the Eurobonds would stop discrimination against Russian bondholders  who were not able to access funds that are due to be sent to settlement system Euroclear.The finance ministry did not say how much of the 2022 issue was owned by foreign investors  but a Russian source familiar with the process had said that the bulk of the Eurobonds due next week has been split among Russian holders.Russian Agricultural Bank  one of the country’s biggest lenders  said over 70% of holders of 2022 Eurobonds that the bank had on its balance have applied for the buyback.Russia’s next deadline is on April 4  when it is also due to pay $84 million in coupons on a 2042 sovereign dollar bond .Earlier on Thursday  the finance ministry paid 50.2 billion roubles ($637.5 million) in coupons on seven rouble-denominated OFZ treasury bond issues.

JPMorgan declined to comment.Bondholders can now expect to receive $87.5 million in coupons and $359 million in principal payments.However  Western sanctions slapped on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine have meant money is only slowly trickling through the system  as banks seek approval from the US Treasury to process funds.Russia has so far kept up payments on its foreign currency denominated bonds  despite major ratings agencies saying in early March that a debt default was highly likely.The country last defaulted fully on its foreign bonds in 1918  when communist revolutionaries refused to honor the Tsar's debts.The payment comes even though the government's ability to pay its foreign debts was thrown into doubt last week when Clearstream  a company that settles international payments  blocked Russia's National Settlement Depository account.Further questions were asked when Russia offered to buy back a $2 billion bond  which matures April 4  in rubles.However  the Finance Ministry later clarified that it had offered to pay in rubles to ensure that the money reaches domestic bondholders. Bloomberg reported that foreign holders would receive dollars.Russia's commitment to making its foreign payments has surprised some analysts. The country has already been frozen out of global capital markets  which is the traditional punishment meted out to governments who default on their debts.""It has been quite clear that the government doesn't want to default at the moment "" Althea Spinozzi  senior fixed income strategist at Saxo Bank  told Insider.""Russia wants to keep the capability  wants to continue to keep a good credit profile because once it can access international markets again it wants physically to have a good relationship with investors "" she said.Investors will be keeping a close eye on the upcoming $2 billion bond maturity payment on April 4. The government must then make a further $1.9 billion worth of payments before the end of the year.Russia's central bank has scrambled to keep the economy afloat since the war in Ukraine began.

Shares represent gold bars held in vaults and are easy to buy and sell  freeing investors from the hassle of buying and storing bullion themselves.ETFs and similar products together held 3 570 tonnes of gold worth $210 billion at the end of 2021  according to the World Gold Council  which tracks the sector.As part of a report on ethical gold investments  Reuters asked the ten largest ETF operators - all based in Europe or North America - what gold they own.All the funds only hold gold bars made by refiners accredited by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)  a standard-setting industry body.Six  with 955 tonnes of gold between them  said they prioritised bars made since 2012  when the LBMA introduced rules aimed at stopping the use of gold linked to crime or violence.Before that date  LBMA rules focused only on the purity  weight and size of gold bars.Three of the six ETF issuers that focus on newer bars said they aimed to hold bars made after 2019  when the LBMA rules had become tougher. These three held 378 tonnes of gold at the end of 2021.Four of the top 10 fund operators  with 2 188 tonnes of gold between them  said they were comfortable holding bars made before and after 2012.Following are data and comment from the funds.FUND BRANDS OPERATOR HOLDINGS FOCUS ON FOCUS ON(TO THE POST-2012 POST-2019NEAREST BARS BARSTONNE)31.12.2021SPDR Gold World Gold 1 050 - -Shares  SPDR CouncilGoldMiniSharesiShares BlackRock 769 - -WisdomTree WisdomTree 260 Yes YesInvesco Invesco 243 Yes -Xetra-Gold Deutsche 238 - -BoerseCommoditiesZKB  Zuercher 192 Yes -Swisscanto Kantonalbank(ZKB)Xtrackers DWS Group 142 Yes -Sprott Sprott Inc 131 - -Amundi Amundi 68 - YesAberdeen abrdn 50 Yes YesStandardWORLD GOLD COUNCIL (SPDR)The WGC said in its role as an industry body it was working to implement higher ethical standards for miners  refiners and traders.It said the LBMA considers old gold bars eligible to trade  and that excluding them would have no meaningful ethical impact while impairing the liquidity needed for ETFs to do what investors want  which is to effectively track the gold price.""It's about improving liquidity  keeping standards high and getting higher  and making sure that people understand that the full pool of gold bars is acceptable "" said Joe Cavatoni  head of the Americas  Global Sales and ETFs at the WGC.BLACKROCK (ISHARES)""Our ETPs (exchange traded products) are classified as responsibly sourced by the LBMA based on the industry standards that are set by the association  and we accept metal from only LBMA-accredited refineries "" a spokesperson said.WISDOMTREE""WisdomTree's physically backed gold exchange-traded commodities (ETCs) aim to allocate responsibly sourced gold bullion  to promote high ethical standards "" the company said.""(Our) entire physical gold ETC offering is now 100% backed by LBMA responsible gold which means at a minimum all bullion is sourced post-2012  and (we) have allocations to post-2019 gold bars.""""Responsible standards keep improving and we endeavour to have our physically backed gold ETCs always allocated to the most responsibly sourced bullion possible.""INVESCOInvesco said it works with mining companies  the World Gold Council and the LBMA to encourage high ethical standards.""Invesco Physical Gold ETC seeks to minimise exposure to gold mined prior to the 2012 introduction of the LBMA's Responsible Gold Guidance "" it said.""While much of the gold mined prior to 2012 is likely to have also complied with the responsible gold guidance  it was not previously mandatory.

Onnik Agbulut. The article is available online on the journal’s website (Articles in Press: Canadian Journal of Cardiology (onlinecjc.ca); DOI: 10.1016/j.cjca.2022.01.019).The data reported in this article demonstrate the effectiveness of oral treatment with QGC606 to improve cardiac function and reduce fibrosis  thus preventing the onset of heart failure after myocardial infarction  at a dose 6 times lower than the firibastat. Data shows the efficacy of QGC606 is also comparable to that of ramipril selected as a drug reference but unlike ramipril  QGC606  like firibastat  does not affect blood pressure levels in mice.« The experimental data obtained with this new product are particularly promising because they position QGC606 as a potential best-in-class product »  said Fabrice Balavoine  Vice-President Research & Development at Quantum Genomics. « This represents a reinforcement of the results already obtained with firibastat and further validate the therapeutic benefit of brain aminopeptidase A inhibitors in preventing cardiac dysfunction after myocardial infarction. »Story continuesAbout Quantum GenomicsQuantum Genomics is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of a new class of cardiovascular drugs  based on the Brain Aminopeptidase A Inhibition (BAPAI) mechanism. It is the only company in the world to pursue this innovative approach directly targeting the brain  founded upon more than twenty years of research work by Paris-Descartes University and the INSERM/CNRS laboratory led by Dr. Catherine Llorens-Cortès at the Collège de France. Quantum Genomics thus aims to develop innovative treatments for complicated or even resistant hypertension (in approximately 30% of patients it is poorly controlled  or treatment failure occurs)  and heart failure (one in two patients diagnosed dies within five years).Based in Paris  the company is listed on the Euronext Growth market in Paris (FR0011648971 - ALQGC) and is registered on the US OTCQX market (symbol: QNNTF).Find out more at www.quantum-genomics.com  or on our Twitter and Linkedin accounts.ContactsQuantum Genomics contact@quantum-genomics.frEdifice Communication (EUROPE) Financial and media communicationquantum-genomics@edifice-communication.comLifeSci (USA) Mike TattoryMedia communication+1 (646) 751-4362 - mtattory@lifescipublicrelations.com,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.34,0.27,0.39,True,English,"['New Scientific Article', 'Quantum Genomics', 'Publication', 'QGC606', 'aminopeptidase A inhibitor prodrug', 'Dr. Catherine Llorens-Cortès', 'brain aminopeptidase A inhibitors', 'Brain Aminopeptidase A Inhibition', 'Mike Tattory Media communication', 'Collège de France', 'Pr.

Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases – including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure – with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed €3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR® is estimated to be over €5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.The alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.Story continuesIn the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints and a rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life. All patients have been enrolled in the study and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines. Over 900 alfapump systems have been implanted to date.Sequana Medical has combined its proven alfapump and proprietary DSR therapy  and is developing the alfapump DSR  a breakthrough approach to fluid overload due to heart failure. RED DESERT demonstrated that repeated DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients is able to manage their fluid and sodium balance  improve their cardio-renal status and restore their diuretic response for months post-treatment. Interim results from the ongoing SAHARA DESERT study in decompensated heart failure patients indicated that repeated DSR therapy can safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate persistent congestion and restore euvolemia  together with considerable benefit in cardio-renal status and a dramatic improvement in diuretic responsiveness. Reporting of top-line data is planned for H2 2022.Sequana Medical is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

If this nomination is accepted by Company shareholders at the upcoming General Shareholder Meeting  the Board intends to appoint Dr. Riva to the position of Chairman. This appointment reflects the evolution of Transgene’s corporate governance  which foresees the separation of the roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO).Dr. Riva  if confirmed as Chairman  will act as an independent member of the Board of Directors and will work closely with the Board and Transgene’s CEO  Hedi Ben Brahim  to realize the potential of the Company’s product portfolio to benefit patients with solid tumors.Dr. Riva has nearly 30 years’ experience in the Life Sciences industry and is currently CEO of Intima Bioscience which specializes in cell therapies for solid cancers. Prior to this role  he served as CEO of Ichnos Sciences and Executive Vice President (EVP)  Global Head of Oncology Therapeutics and Cell & Gene Therapy at Gilead Sciences  where he was instrumental in the acquisition of Kite Pharma and led its integration and growth.

He received his bachelor’s degree in medicine and surgery from the University of Milan and a certificate board in oncology and hematology from the same institution.Hedi Ben Brahim  Transgene’s CEO  commented: “I am very happy about the prospect of working with Alessandro as Chairman of the Board of Directors. I am convinced that the separation of roles between a non-executive chairman and a CEO  as well as the choice to entrust the chairmanship to an independent director with great scientific skills in the field of oncology  will deliver important and valuable advantages for Transgene and its shareholders. I would like to thank the Board of Directors for approving this change in governance. Alessandro’s medical and scientific competence  international experience and human qualities make him an ideal candidate to play a key role in the further development of Transgene.”Dr. Alessandro Riva added: “Transgene’s promising drug candidates  generated from its world leading myvac® and Invir.IO™ platforms  represent exciting new frontiers for targeted solid tumor immunotherapies  tapping into the unrealized potential of personalized cancer vaccinations and next-generation multifunctional oncolytic viruses. I’m delighted to be joining an increasingly important player in the oncology space as the Company prepares for the next key steps in its development.”In addition  the Board proposes two new Directors  Prof. Jean-Yves Blay and Laurence Espinasse  to join current Board members: Philippe Archinard  Jean-Luc Bélingard  Hedi Ben Brahim  Benoît Habert  Marie Landel  Maya Said and TSGH  represented by Sandrine Flory. These three new members (including the Chairman) will replace Dr. Jean-Pierre Bizzari  Prof. Laurence Zitvogel and Antoine Béret. Transgene’s shareholders will vote on the nominations of Dr. Riva  Prof. Blay and Ms Espinasse at the General Shareholder Meeting to be held on May 25  2022  and the Board of Directors intends to appoint Dr. Riva as its chairman immediately thereafter.Hedi Ben Brahim added  “The Board is also very pleased with the arrival of Prof. Jean‑Yves Blay and Laurence Espinasse. Jean-Yves’ clinical development know-how and Laurence’s legal experience will be strong assets for the Company.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.Story continuesABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European developer  manager and owner of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

The Notes are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK. For these purposes  a retail investor in the EEA means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended  “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the “Prospectus Regulation”)  and a retail investor in the UK means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client  as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the “EUWA”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000  as amended (the “FSMA”) and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client  as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; and (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended  the “PRIIPs Regulation”) or by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the “UK PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA or in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA or in the UK may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation and/or the UK PRIIPS Regulation.MIFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market – Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer’s product approval process  the target market assessment in respect of the Notes has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only  each as defined in MiFID II; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering  selling or recommending the Notes (a “distributor”) should take into consideration the manufacturers’ target market assessment; however  a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers’ target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.The information provided in this release and any offer materials relating to the Notes are addressed to and directed only at persons in the United Kingdom (a) that have professional experience in matters relating to investments falling within Article 19(5) of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005 (the “Order”)  (b) falling within Article 49(2)(a) to (d) (“high net worth companies  unincorporated associations etc.”) of the Order  (c) to whom this announcement may otherwise be directed without contravention of Section 21 of the FSMA or (d) to whom this announcement may otherwise be lawfully communicated (all such persons together being referred to as “relevant persons”).

The increase in personnel costs is directly linked to the winning of several private security contracts  which will be the breeding ground for our strategy to dronify the sector. Conversely  there was a decrease in purchases and changes in inventories as well as depreciation allowances. Finally  the decline in other revenues of the activity  including in particular the fixed production of the period  illustrates the end of the R&D program dedicated to the development of the professional solutions ISS Spotter (security) and Countbot (inventory)  now operational and in the commercial start-up phase.Story continuesThe beginning of 2022 was marked by the winning of several contracts in the field of events  signed by ATM Group Sécurité (subsidiary of Delta Drone Human Tech)  which consist of a mixed offer combining security agents and ISS Spotter system  which fully validates the relevance of the strategy.At the same time  in partnership with Geodis  the first Countbot missions were carried out to the satisfaction of the first customers  who see the system as a major innovation  a source of better management of their inventories under favorable economic conditions.Considering the Australian subsidiary Delta Drone International  the cash sale for $ A6 million (about € 4 million) of the Israeli company ParaZero completes the process of setting up a pole focused on the southern hemisphere and the mining sector. Delta Drone International is now firmly established in two major mining countries  South Africa and Australia  and has the necessary resources to self-finance its development.The adoption of IFRS standards allows Groupe to recognise the ""fair value"" of its shareholdings  housed within the UDT subsidiary. This investment policy aimed at creating an ecosystem within the Group  generating numerous industrial synergies  is crowned with success since the portfolio brings overall a revenue of more than €5 million into the income statement.Finally  the loss for the year was reduced to €4.3 million  halved compared to the previous year's loss.Please note that the Group's detailed accounts are available in French and English on the Group's website (www.deltadrone.com).The final terms of the agreement with the Canadian group Volatus Aerospace are still under discussionBy means of a press release dated March 3  2022  the Delta Drone and Volatus Aerospace groups had announced the signing of an agreement  subject to several conditions precedent  whose purpose was to constitute together a world leader in the sector  present on all continents.As stated in the statement  the agreement required the approval of the French Ministry of the Economy  as part of the 2019 law on investments by foreign companies in French companies. The investigation of the file is still ongoing  without the date of the Ministry's response being precisely known.In addition  the agreement also requires the approval of minority shareholders of Australian subsidiary Delta Drone International  as the company is listed on the Sydney ASX Stock Exchange. This approval will be submitted to shareholders at a General Meeting to be held in May.However  while waiting for the Delta Drone and Volatus Aerospace teams have started working on joint projects:for North America  the commercial development of the solutions proposed by Delta Drone for Delta Drone's locations  the products and systems marketed by Volatus Aeropace.A €2 million operating expense reduction plan is launched immediately  financed by a €1 million tranche of OrnanGiven the evolution of the Delta Drone Group and its ambitions for the coming years  the need to continue efforts to rationalize operating expenses remains crucial. Thus  to achieve the objective of reaching the operating balance next year  Delta Drone decides to launch at the beginning of the 2nd quarter a plan to reduce operating expenses  which represents a potential saving in full year of around € 2 million.In accordance with the authority granted to the Board of Directors by the Extraordinary General Shareholders’ meeting of Delta Drone (the “Company”) dated 24 April 2020 pursuant to its sixth resolution  the Board of Directors dated 14th October 2020:approved the principle of issuing 2 500 tranche warrants (the “ Tranche Warrants ”)  giving access to 2 500 bonds redeemable in cash and/or new shares (the “ ORNAN ”) with share subscription warrants attached (the “ Warrants ”) upon exercise  to the investment fund YA II PN  LTD (the “ Investor ”)  a fund managed by the US management company Yorkville Advisors  representing a financing of up to €25M of aggregate nominal value; andempowered the Chairman and CEO to decide to launch this transaction  to approve its final terms and conditions  to issue the Tranche Warrants and to drawdown the tranches of ORNAN with Warrants attached.Pursuant to the sub-delegation of authority granted to him by the Board of Directors on 28 April 2020  the CEO decided today to drawdown 1 tranche of ORNAN with Warrants attached.The main characteristics of the Tranche Warrants  ORNAN and Warrants (the terms and conditions of which are available in detail on the Company’s website ( www.deltadrone.com ) under the « Investors » tab) have been presented in a press release dated 14 October 2020.In accordance with the financing agreement entered into on 14 October 2020 with the Investor  1 tranche of ORNAN with Warrants attached of €1M of nominal value has been drawdown today  corresponding to the issuance of 100 ORNAN with 714 285 714 Warrants attached.The share consolidation operation will be implemented in AprilIn accordance with the 3rd resolution voted at the Annual General Meeting of 27 December 2021  the Board of Directors decided to implement in April the consolidation of the shares composing its share capital at the rate of 10 000 old shares against 1 new share.The objective of this merger is to support a new stock market dynamic of the company as well as to reduce the volatility of the Delta Drone share price  induced by the low level of its current value. This transaction will not affect the overall value of delta Drone shares held in the portfolio by shareholders  with the exception of the broken ones.The details and the exact timing of the operation will be the subject of a specific press release.ProspectsDelta Drone continues its construction in a still emerging sector  marked by a multitude of communications and announcements sometimes unrealistic  often peremptory. Rather than suggesting that ""the drone can do everything""  the Groupe strives to anchor its strategy on solid and reasonable foundations  in direct contact with the needs of its customers  following a process of progressive integration of technology into professional uses  respecting in all respects the regulations and rules of safety of people and goods.After 10 years of existence  Delta Drone is in the process of building with its partner Volatus Aerospace a set without equivalent in the sector  present all over the world and with an extremely wide range of services and products. The combination of French technology and North American commercial know-how will undoubtedly be a winning combination to accelerate revenue development and achieve balance in terms of EBITDA. The achievement of this objective is obviously based on the rationalization of operating expenses initiated in 2022; so that it can be achieved in 2023.On a like-for-like basis  Delta Drone is expected to see sustained revenue growth this year  in line with the commercial development of the professional ISS Spotter (security) and Countbot (inventory) solutions and the growing success of new private security service offerings.About Delta Drone : Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the field of civilian drones for professional use. It develops a range of professional solutions based on drone technology as well as all associated services that form a complete value chain.Delta Drone shares are listed on the Euronext Growth Paris market – ISIN code: FR0011522168BSA Y – ISIN code: FR 0013400991www.deltadrone.comInvestor contacts: Press contact:Jérôme Gacoin Marie-Laure Laville +33 1 75 77 54 65 +33 1 55 02 15 13 jgacoin@aelium.fr ml.laville@open2europe.comSarah Ousahla+33 1 55 02 15 31s.ousahla@open2europe.comAttachment",neutral,0.12,0.86,0.02,mixed,0.35,0.21,0.45,True,English,"['many high-value assets', 'Delta Drone', 'financial situation', 'FY', 'development', 'French Gaap IFRS IFRS Turnover', 'new stock market momentum', 'ATM Group Sécurité', 'two major mining countries', 'Delta Drone Human Tech', 'several private security contracts', 'Canadian group Volatus Aerospace', 'NET INCOME GROUP SHARE', 'many high-value assets', 'significant major developments', 'R&D program', 'commercial start-up phase', 'favorable economic conditions', 'numerous industrial synergies', 'Volatus Aerospace groups', 'several conditions precedent', 'Delta Drone International', 'net financial debt', 'cost reduction plan', 'Other financial income', 'Net depreciation allowances', 'first Countbot missions', 'Other operating income', 'DELTA DRONE FY', 'ISS Spotter system', 'CURRENT OPERATIONAL RESULT', 'several contracts', 'IFRS standards', 'major innovation', 'financial situation', 'Net provisions', 'current operations', 'NET RESULT', 'first customers', 'French Ministry', 'French companies', 'Other products', 'Other income/expenses', 'other revenues', 'operating balance', 'security agents', 'mining sector', 'income statement', 'Key points', 'accounting framework', 'strong improvement', 'southern hemisphere', '€1 million draw', 'short-term equities', 'Personnel costs', 'INTEGRATED COMPANIES', 'divested companies', 'non-controlling interests', 'apparent stability', 'breeding ground', 'fixed production', 'professional solutions', 'mixed offer', 'same time', 'Israeli company', 'South Africa', 'necessary resources', 'fair value', 'investment policy', 'detailed accounts', 'press release', 'world leader', 'foreign companies', 'QP result', 'Israeli subsidiary', 'Australian subsidiary', 'UDT subsidiary', 'Tax expense', 'health crisis', 'final terms', 'previous year', 'inventory changes', 'cash sale', '334 RESULT', 'March', '8am', 'transition', 'ParaZero', 'agreement', 'dimension', 'Launch', 'Ornan', 'Consolidation', 'activity', 'Purchases', 'Taxes', 'EBITDA', 'impairments', 'associates', 'EQUITY', 'ASSIMILATION', 'EQUIVALENT', 'effects', 'level', 'formation', 'increase', 'winning', 'strategy', 'decrease', 'inventories', 'decline', 'period', 'end', 'Story', 'beginning', 'field', 'events', 'relevance', 'partnership', 'Geodis', 'satisfaction', 'management', 'process', 'pole', 'adoption', 'Groupe', 'shareholdings', 'ecosystem', 'success', 'portfolio', 'loss', 'English', 'website', 'deltadrone', 'discussion', 'means', 'signing', 'purpose', 'continents', 'approval', 'Economy', '2019 law', 'investments', '349']",2022-03-31,2022-04-01,finance.yahoo.com

If the Offeror obtains 95% or more of the Shares it expects to implement the Asset Sale and initiate the Squeeze-Out Proceedings  and if it obtains between 80% and 95% it expects to implement the Asset Sale and Liquidation  if approved by the ShareholdersIntertrust's joint Works Council in the Netherlands has rendered a positive advice on the decision of the Intertrust Boards to support the Transaction and recommend the OfferWith reference to the publication of the Offer Memorandum today  the Offeror and Intertrust jointly announce that the Offeror is making a recommended public all-cash offer to all holders of issued and outstanding ordinary shares (the ""Shares""  and each holder of such Shares  a ""Shareholder"") in the share capital of Intertrust at an offer price of EUR 20.00 (cum dividend)  without interest and less mandatory withholding tax payable under the applicable Law (if any) (the ""Offer Price"")  in cash per Share on the terms and subject to the conditions and restrictions as set forth in the Offer Memorandum (the ""Offer""). The Offer Period runs from 1 April 2022 until and including 10 June 2022. Completion of the Offer is expected in the second half of 2022. Terms not defined in this press release will have the meaning as set forth in the Offer Memorandum.The OfferThe Offer is made on the terms and subject to the conditions and restrictions set forth in the Offer Memorandum. Shareholders who have validly tendered (or defectively tendered  provided that such defect has been waived by the Offeror) and have not validly withdrawn their Shares and have transferred (geleverd) their Shares to the Offeror prior to or on the Closing Date (each of these Shares  a ""Tendered Share"") will receive the Offer Price in consideration of each Tendered Share.In the event of any cash or share dividend or other distribution on the Shares (the ""Distributions"") by Intertrust prior to Settlement  whereby the record date is decisive for entitlement to such Distribution  the Offer Price will be decreased by the full amount of any such Distribution made by Intertrust in respect of each Share (before any applicable withholding tax).The Offer values 100% of the Shares at approximately EUR 1.8 billion. The Offeror expects to fund the Offer through a combination of cash available resources and third-party debt financing. In the press release dated 6 December 2021  Corporation Service Company (""CSC"") confirmed that sufficient equity financing is in place to complete the Offer. CSC has entered into binding debt commitment papers with a consortium of reputable banks  led by Bank of America  N.A.  for senior debt financing in an aggregate amount of approximately (a) USD 1.8 billion of first lien term USD debt  (b) EUR 1.0 billion of first lien term Euro debt  (c) USD 420 million of second lien term USD debt and (d) a USD 250 million first lien revolving facility  which is fully committed on a ""certain funds"" basis (the ""Debt Financing""). Further details can be found in section 6.5 (Financing of the Offer) of the Offer Memorandum.Rationale of the OfferThe combination of CSC and Intertrust creates a clear and differentiated leader for corporate  fund  private  and capital markets clients on an international scale  built on the combined strengths of each other’s global teams. Customers will benefit from a strengthened and enhanced geographical and broadened service offering  built on the highly complementary strengths of CSC’s leadership in the US and Intertrust’s leadership in Europe. CSC shares Intertrust's vision and regards its emphasis on ESG principles with a particular focus on human capital. Employees will benefit from CSC’s strong corporate culture and values  and a significantly larger and more global company  offering enhanced career development opportunities.Full and unanimous support and recommendation by the Intertrust BoardsFollowing the diligent and carefully executed process  the Intertrust Boards believe that the Offeror has made the most compelling offer representing an attractive cash premium to the Shareholders  as well as favourable non-financial terms and commitments in respect of deal certainty. The Intertrust Boards conclude that the Offer is in the best interest of the Company and the sustainable  long-term success of its business  taking especially into account the interests of all Intertrust's stakeholders.Taking all these considerations into account  the Intertrust Boards unanimously support the proposed Transaction and recommend that the Shareholders tender their Shares under the Offer. Accordingly  the Intertrust Boards recommend that the Shareholders vote in favour of the Offer Resolutions at the upcoming AGM.Non-Financial CovenantsIntertrust and the Offeror have agreed to certain covenants  including covenants on structure and corporate governance  strategy  employees  leverage and costs  minority shareholders and other non- financial matters  for a duration of two years after settlement (the ""Non-Financial Covenants"").Structure and GovernanceThe Intertrust Group's headquarters will remain in Amsterdam  the Netherlands  and the Offeror will not divest or transfer any material part of the Intertrust Group. The Intertrust Group's core values and culture will be respected and maintained.Upon successful completion of the Offer  it is envisaged that from the current members of Intertrust's Supervisory Board  Charlotte Lambkin and Toine van Laack will continue as independent Supervisory Board members (the ""Independent Supervisory Board Members"") and will especially monitor compliance with the Non-Financial Covenants. Any deviation from the Non-Financial Covenants shall require the approval of the Independent Supervisory Board Members within this two-year period.StrategyIt is envisaged that the Offeror's and Intertrust's businesses will be aligned following Settlement in order to fully benefit from the reach  scale and resources from their combined businesses. Parties will work on a joint strategy in the period prior to Settlement  to the extent permitted by law  and will regularly consult with the Works Council on the contemplated alignment.CSC confirms the growth potential of the Combined Group and intends to explore and invest in existing and new opportunities to expand the Combined Group's business.EmployeesThe existing rights and benefits of Intertrust's employees will be respected  including existing rights and benefits under their individual employment agreements  collective labour agreements and social plans  and including existing rights and benefits under existing covenants made to the Works Council. The Offeror will also respect the existing pension rights of the Group's current and former employees and the Intertrust Group's employee consultation structure.The Offeror will strive to apply the highest standards of human resources management within the Combined Group and organise its workforce in both a socially exemplary and competitive manner. The culture and diversity of Intertrust will be reflected in the best possible way  while taking a balanced and fair approach towards both Intertrust's and the Offeror's employees.There will be no reduction in the number of employees of the Intertrust Group as a direct consequence of the Transaction  it being understood that the above shall not limit the Combined Group’s ability to take into account the fact that the Company will no longer be a publicly traded independent company or to act in accordance with the following sentence. To the extent that any positions within the Intertrust Group and the Offeror's Group overlap following Settlement  such positions will be filled based on fair allocation principles  such as ""best person for the job""  without any discrimination on the basis of nationality or current employer. The Offeror is committed to provide Intertrust's employees with appropriate career opportunities and training.Leverage and costsCSC and Intertrust will ensure that the Combined Group will be prudently financed to safeguard business continuity and to support the success of the business  while also ensuring that the financial leverage of the Combined Group remains at a sustainable level on a rolling basis.Until the earlier of (i) completion of the Asset Sale and (ii) commencement of statutory squeeze-out proceedings (the ""Integration Date"")  the net debt position of the Combined Group shall correspond to a maximum of 6.0x EBITDA and no dividends or other distributions will be paid by the Intertrust Group to the Offeror or any of its affiliates (excluding the Intertrust Group) unless the net debt position of the Intertrust Group is lower than 6.0x EBITDA.CSC or its affiliates will not effect any debt push-down to the Intertrust Group  except as reasonably necessary to consummate the Debt Financing  or charge any management fees or other costs before the Integration Date.Corporate governance post-SettlementIt is envisaged that the Supervisory Board will as of the Settlement Date consist of six members  with Charlotte Lambkin and Toine van Laack as the Independent Supervisory Board Members. As independent members of the Supervisory Board  they will especially monitor compliance with the Non-Financial Covenants. Subject to the Offer being declared unconditional and the relevant Offer Resolutions having been adopted at the AGM  Rod Ward  Jackie Smetana  E.J. Dealy and James Stoltzfus will join the Supervisory Board as members designated by CSC.At Settlement  the current members of the Management Board shall continue to serve as members of the Management Board.Following completion of the Asset Sale  the governance of Intertrust is applied to the Offeror  to the extent legally applicable  provided that Jackie Smetana will not join the supervisory board of the Offeror.Board IrrevocablesThe CEO and CFO of Intertrust and Mr. Ruys and Mr. Willing  members of the Supervisory Board  have executed undertakings to tender all the Shares held by them in the Offer. No other Shareholders have been approached for an irrevocable undertaking to support and accept the Offer.The AGMIn accordance with article 18  paragraph 1 of the Decree  Intertrust must hold a general meeting to discuss the Offer with the Shareholders. Intertrust will combine such general meeting with the AGM. In part I of the AGM  the annually recurring items will be discussed and resolved upon. Part II of the AGM will address the Offer and the Offer Resolutions. Subject to the terms of the Merger Agreement  the Intertrust Boards recommend that the Shareholders vote in favour of the Offer Resolutions put to the Shareholders at the AGM.The AGM will be held on 31 May 2022  starting at 15:00 hours CET  instead of the previously announced date of 12 May 2022. Intertrust will hold the AGM in hybrid form  allowing Shareholders to attend the AGM either in person or virtually. Separate convocation materials and information on the hybrid meeting are available on Intertrust's website (www.intertrustgroup.com/investors).The information for Shareholders as required pursuant to Section 18  paragraph 2 of the Decree  is included in the position statement  which also includes the convocation notice and agenda for the AGM  which has been made available as of today at Intertrust's website (www.intertrustgroup.com/investors).Works Council of IntertrustIntertrust's joint Works Council in the Netherlands has rendered a positive advice on the decision of the Intertrust Boards to support the Transaction and recommend the Offer on 24 December 2021. Furthermore  the joint Works Council will  if and when applicable  at a later stage be informed of  and consulted on  the financing of the Transaction.Competition ClearancesOn 24 December 2021  WMB filed a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act  with the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. On 30 December 2021  Intertrust filed a Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act. On 26 January 2022  the waiting period under the HSR Act expired with respect to each filing  which concluded the HSR Act review of the proposed combination of CSC and Intertrust. Accordingly  to date  the Competition Clearances condition is satisfied.Regulatory ClearancesIn connection with the provision by the Intertrust Group of trust company and other specialised administrative and financial services in various jurisdictions around the world  certain of Intertrust’s subsidiaries (the “Intertrust Regulated Subsidiaries”) hold licenses or other authorisations (collectively  “Licenses”) permitting the provision of such services in these jurisdictions  and by virtue of this holding are subject to oversight by local regulators.The local rules and regulations applying to the Licenses generally provide that  upon a change of control of a licensee  an investigation and due diligence process is conducted in order for the applicable regulator to assess the acquiring entity and certain of its ultimate owners and policymakers. As a result of the Transaction  CSC will become an indirect owner of the Intertrust Regulated Subsidiaries. Accordingly  CSC and  in some cases  certain of its shareholders and Affiliates are required to undergo review by the regulators with oversight of the Intertrust Regulated Subsidiaries before CSC becomes the indirect owner of the Licenses  in accordance with local law.Intertrust and the Offeror must make certain filings to apply for the Regulatory Clearances required in connection with the Transaction (the ""Regulatory Applications""). Regulatory Applications have or will be made in various jurisdictions including British Virgin Islands  Bahamas  Cayman Islands  Curaçao  Guernsey  Hong Kong  Ireland  Jersey  Luxembourg  Netherlands  Singapore  United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom. The Regulatory Applications are subject to varying review periods of up to 90 – 120 business days  and are subject to extension in certain instances if requested or required by the applicable regulator.Indicative timetableExpected date and time (All times are CET) Event 09:00 hours CET  1 April 2022 Commencement of the Offer Period 15:00 hours CET on 31 May 2022 AGM  at which meeting  among other matters  the Offer will be discussed  and the Offer Resolutions will be voted on 17:40 hours CET  10 June 2022 Closing Date and Closing Time: deadline for Shareholders to tender their Shares  unless the Offer Period is extended in accordance with Article 15 of the Decree No later than three (3) Business Days after the Closing Date (or the Postponed Closing Date) Unconditional Date: the date on which the Offeror will publicly announce whether the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand is gedaan) in accordance with Article 16 of the Decree No later than the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Closing Date (or the Postponed Closing Date) Settlement Date: the date on which  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer  the Offeror will pay the Offer Price for each Tendered Share No later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the Unconditional Date Post-Acceptance Period: if the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand is gedaan)  the Offeror will announce a Post- Acceptance Period for a period of two (2) weeks in accordance with Article 17 of the Decree No later than the third (3rd) Business Day after the expiration of the Post- Acceptance Period The Offeror will publicly announce the results of the Post- Acceptance Period No later than two (2) Dutch trading days after the Offeror’s acceptance of Tendered Shares in the Post- Acceptance Period Settlement of the Tendered Shares during the Post- Acceptance Period: in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Offer  the Offeror will pay the Offer Price for each Tendered ShareOffer PeriodThe Offer Period will commence at 09:00 hours CET on 1 April 2022 and will expire on 10 June 2022 at 17:40 hours CET on the Closing Date  unless the Offer Period is extended in accordance with section 5.5 (Extension) of the Offer Memorandum.Shares tendered on or prior to the Closing Date may not be withdrawn  subject to the right of withdrawal of any tender of Shares pursuant to the provisions of Article 5b  paragraph 5 and Article 15  paragraphs 3 and 8 and Article 15a paragraph 3 of the Decree and in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 5.3 (Acceptance by Shareholders) of the Offer Memorandum.Acceptance by the ShareholdersShareholders who hold their Shares through an Admitted Institution are requested to make their acceptance known through their bank or stockbroker no later than the Closing Time  being 17:40 hours CET on the initial Closing Date  unless the Offer Period is extended in accordance with section 5.5 (Extension) of the Offer Memorandum. The custodian  bank or stockbroker may set an earlier deadline for communication by Shareholders in order to permit the custodian  bank or stockbroker to communicate its acceptances to ABN AMRO Bank N.V.

If the Offer Condition relating to the Competition Clearances set out in section 6.6(a)(ii) ( Offer Conditions) of the Offer Memorandum or the Regulatory Clearances set out in section 6.6(a)(iii) ( Offer Conditions) of the Offer Memorandum is not satisfied or waived in accordance with section 6.6(b) (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum on the Postponed Closing Date  the Offeror shall  subject to receipt of an exemption granted by the AFM  extend the Offer Period until such time as the Parties reasonably believe is necessary to cause such Offer Condition to be satisfied but ultimately until the Long Stop Date.

Reference is made to section 6.6 (Offer Conditions  waiver and satisfaction) of the Offer Memorandum. The Offer Conditions may be waived  to the extent permitted by Applicable Rules  as set out in section 6.6(b) (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum. If any Offer Condition is waived in accordance with section 6.6(b) (Waiver) of the Offer Memorandum  the Offeror will inform the Shareholders as required by the Applicable Rules.No later than on the Unconditional Date (i.e. the third (3rd) Business Day following the Closing Date)  the Offeror will determine whether the Offer Conditions have been satisfied or waived as set out in section 6.6 (Offer Conditions  waiver and satisfaction) of the Offer Memorandum  to the extent permitted by Applicable Rules.

In the event that the Offer is not declared unconditional (niet gestand is gedaan)  the Offeror will explain such decision.In the event that the Offeror declares the Offer unconditional (gestand is gedaan)  the Offeror will accept all Tendered Shares and will announce a Post-Acceptance Period (na-aanmeldingstermijn) as set out in section 5.8 (Post-Acceptance Period) of the Offer Memorandum of two (2) weeks to enable Shareholders who did not tender their Shares during the Offer Period to tender their Shares during the Post-Acceptance Period under the same terms and conditions as the Offer.SettlementIn the event that the Offeror declares the Offer unconditional (gestand is gedaan)  Shareholders who have validly tendered (or defectively tendered provided that such defect has been waived by the Offeror) and have not validly withdrawn and have transferred (geleverd) their Shares for acceptance pursuant to the Offer on or prior to the Closing Date will receive no later than on the fifth (5th) Business Day after the Closing Date or Postponed Closing Date  as the case may be  the Offer Price in respect of each Tendered Share  as of which moment revocation (herroeping)  dissolution (ontbinding) or annulment (vernietiging) of a Shareholder's tender or transfer (levering) shall not be permitted. Settlement will only take place if the Offer is declared unconditional (gestand is gedaan). The Offeror cannot guarantee that Shareholders holding Shares through an Admitted Institution will actually receive payment within such five (5) Business Day period from the Admitted Institution with whom they hold their Shares.Post-Acceptance PeriodIn the event that the Offeror declares the Offer unconditional (gestand is gedaan)  the Offeror will  in accordance with Article 17 of the Decree  within three (3) Business Days after declaring the Offer unconditional  publicly announce a Post-Acceptance Period (na-aanmeldingstermijn) of two (2) weeks to enable Shareholders who did not tender their Shares during the Offer Period to tender their Shares during the Post-Acceptance Period under the same terms and conditions as the Offer.In the Post-Acceptance Period  Shareholders who hold their Shares through an Admitted Institution are requested to make their acceptance known through their bank or stockbroker no later than 17:40 hours CET on the last Business Day of the Post-Acceptance Period. The custodian  bank or stockbroker may set an earlier deadline for communication by Shareholders in order to permit the custodian  bank or stockbroker to communicate its acceptances to the Settlement Agent in a timely manner. Accordingly  Shareholders holding Shares through a financial intermediary should comply with the dates communicated by such financial intermediary  as such dates may differ from the dates and times noted in the Offer Memorandum.The Offeror will publicly announce the results of the Post-Acceptance Period and the total amount and total percentage of Shares held by it in accordance with Article 17  paragraph 4 of the Decree ultimately on the third (3rd) Business Day following the last day of the Post-Acceptance Period. The Offeror shall accept all Tendered Shares during such Post-Acceptance Period.During the Post-Acceptance Period  Shareholders have no right to withdraw Shares from the Offer  which are validly tendered (or defectively tendered  provided that such defect has been waived by the Offeror) during the Offer Period or during the Post-Acceptance Period. Shareholders who have validly tendered (or defectively tendered provided that such defect has been waived by the Offeror) and transferred ( geleverd) their Shares for acceptance pursuant to the Offer during the Post-Acceptance Period will receive the Offer Price in respect of each Tendered Share within two Dutch trading days of the Offeror’s acceptance of such Shares tendered.In the event any Distribution on the Shares is made by Intertrust on or prior to the settlement date of the Shares tendered in the Post-Acceptance Period  whereby the record date is decisive for entitlement to such Distribution  the Offer Price will be decreased by the full amount of any such Distribution made by Intertrust in respect of each Share (before any applicable withholding tax).As of the relevant settlement date  revocation (herroeping)  dissolution (ontbinding) or annulment (vernietiging) of the tendering  sale or transfer (levering) of any Share tendered during the Post-Acceptance Period is not possible.Acquisition of 100%Intertrust and the Offeror believe the sustainable and long-term success of Intertrust will be enhanced under private ownership and acknowledge the importance of acquiring 100% of the Shares and achieving a delisting in order to execute on the Combined Group’s long-term strategy. Intertrust and the Offeror intend to as soon as possible (1) terminate the listing of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam  and (2) if deemed desirable by the Offeror  convert the Company into a private company with limited liability (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid).In the event that  following the Settlement Date and the Post-Acceptance Period  (i) the Offeror meets either the threshold to initiate a compulsory acquisition procedure ( uitkoopprocedure) in accordance with article 2:92a of the Dutch Civil Code or the threshold to initiate a takeover buy-out procedure in accordance with article or 2:201a or 2:359c of the Dutch Civil Code (the ""Squeeze-Out Proceedings Threshold"")  (ii) the Asset Sale Resolution has been adopted  and (iii) the Offeror elects to implement the Pre-Squeeze-Out Asset Sale  then the Offeror and Intertrust shall implement the Pre-Squeeze-Out Asset Sale and promptly after completion thereof the Offeror shall initiate Squeeze-Out Proceedings in accordance with section 6.15 (Post-closing measures and future legal structure) of the Offer Memorandum  whereby an amount equal to the value attributable to the Offeror's shareholding will be paid through a loan note (the ""Offeror's Note""). At the request of the Offeror  the articles of association of the Company will be amended to  inter alia  provide for a new class of shares (the ""B Shares"") and subsequently  the Company will issue a number of B Shares to the Offeror equal to the number of Shares held by the Offeror  against the transfer of the Shares held by the Offeror to the Company. The Company will thereafter make a distribution equal to the Offeror's Note on the B Shares to the Offeror (the ""Offeror's Distribution""). The Company and the Offeror have agreed to implement appropriate guarantees and indemnities in relation to issuance of the B Shares  the acquisition of Shares and the Offeror's Distribution to protect the Company's minority shareholders.In the event that  following the Settlement Date and the Post-Acceptance Period  the Offeror does not meet the Squeeze-Out Proceedings Threshold but does meet the Acceptance Threshold and the Asset Sale and Liquidation Resolutions have been adopted  then the Offeror and Intertrust shall implement  at the election of the Offeror  the Asset Sale and Liquidation in accordance with section 6.15 (Post-closing measures and future legal structure) of the Offer Memorandum. As soon as possible after commencement of the Liquidation  an advance liquidation distribution will be made to the Shareholders consisting of a payment per Share equal to the Offer Price  without any interest and subject to withholding taxes and other taxes.If  after the Post-Acceptance Period  the Offeror meets the Squeeze-Out Proceedings Threshold  while the Asset Sale Resolution has not been adopted  the Offeror shall commence the Squeeze-Out Proceedings to obtain 100% of the Shares without implementation of the Pre-Squeeze-Out Asset Sale.Liquidity and delistingThe purchase of Shares by the Offeror pursuant to the Offer will reduce the number of Shareholders  as well as the number of Shares that might otherwise be traded publicly. As a result  the liquidity and market value of the Shares that were not tendered under the Offer  or were tendered and validly withdrawn  may be adversely affected. The Offeror does not intend to compensate for such adverse effect by  for example  setting up a liquidity mechanism for the Shares that are not tendered following the Settlement Date and the Post-Acceptance Period.Should the Offer be declared unconditional (gestanddoening)  the Offeror and Intertrust intend to procure the delisting of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam as soon as possible under Applicable Rules. This may further adversely affect the liquidity and market value of any Shares not tendered.If the Offeror acquires 95% or more of the Shares  it will be able to procure delisting of the Shares from Euronext Amsterdam in accordance with applicable (policy) rules. However  the listing of the Shares on Euronext Amsterdam will also terminate after a successful Asset Sale and Liquidation as set out in section 6.15(d) (Asset Sale and Liquidation) of the Offer Memorandum or any other measures or procedures set out in section 6.15(f) (Other Post-Closing Measures) of the Offer Memorandum. In the event that Intertrust will no longer be listed  the provisions applicable to the governance of listed companies will no longer apply and the rights of remaining minority Shareholders may be limited to the statutory minimum.AnnouncementsAny announcement contemplated by the Offer Memorandum will be issued by means of a press release.

The Offer will be made in the United States in compliance with applicable Dutch securities laws and  except to the extent of relief granted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") described below  the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended (the ""U.S. Exchange Act"") and the rules and regulations adopted by the SEC thereunder  including Regulation 14E. As set forth below  in accordance with the relief granted by the SEC  the Offer will be subject to disclosure and other procedural requirements  including with respect to withdrawal rights  offer timetable  settlement procedures and timing of payments that are different from those applicable under U.S. domestic tender offer procedures and law.

Each U.S. holder of Shares is urged to consult his or her independent professional adviser immediately regarding the tax consequences of acceptance of the Offer.It may be difficult for U.S. holders of Shares to enforce their rights and any claim arising out of the U.S. federal securities laws  because the Offeror and Intertrust are located in a country other than the United States  and some or all of their officers and directors may be residents of a country other than the United States. U.S. holders of Shares may not be able to sue a non-U.S. company or its officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of the U.S. securities laws. Further  it may be difficult to compel a non-U.S. company and its affiliates to subject themselves to a U.S. court's judgment.Neither the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission nor any U.S. state securities commission or other regulatory authority has approved or disapproved the Offer  passed upon the fairness or merits of the Offer or provided an opinion as to the accuracy or completeness of this Offer Memorandum or any other documents regarding the Offer.

Registered office: OSB House  Quayside  Chatham Maritime  Chatham  United Kingdom  ME4 4QZ)Notice of Annual General Meeting onThursday  12 May 2022 at 11 amat 90 Whitfield Street  Fitzrovia  London W1T 4EZ31 March 2022LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMANDear Shareholder2021 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS AND 2022 ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGI am pleased to inform you that the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2021 and the Notice of the 2022 Annual General Meeting of OSB GROUP PLC (the Company) have now been published. A copy of the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts is enclosed with this document  together with a Form of Proxy to enable you to exercise your voting rights at the 2022 Annual General Meeting (AGM).The AGM will be held at 90 Whitfield Street  Fitzrovia  London W1T 4EZ on Thursday  12 May 2022 at 11 am.The formal notice of the AGM is set out on pages 3 to 5 of this document and contains the proposed resolutions (the Resolutions). Explanatory notes to the business to be considered are set out from page 6 of this document.VOTING AT THE AGMI will  once again  be inviting you to vote on all Resolutions at the AGM by way of a poll rather than on a show of hands. Poll voting is in line with practice adopted by many UK public companies and provides a more transparent method of voting. It will result in a more accurate reflection of the views of shareholders by ensuring that every vote is recognised  including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting. On a poll  each shareholder has one vote for every share held. I would encourage shareholders to exercise their right to vote  but in light of the COVID-19 pandemic  the Company strongly encourages all shareholders to submit a proxy vote in advance of the AGM  appointing the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy rather than a named person. This will ensure that your vote will be counted if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting (for example because of restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic). Instructions for completing the Form of Proxy are outlined below. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person.ACTION TO BE TAKENPlease complete and return the enclosed Form of Proxy so that it is received by the Company’s Registrar  Equiniti  by no later than 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022. If you are a member of CREST  you may submit a proxy appointment electronically through the CREST voting service. Further details are set out in the Notes section on pages 10 to 11.The results of voting on the Resolutions will be announced to the London Stock Exchange and posted on the Company’s website following the conclusion of the AGM.RECOMMENDATIONThe Directors recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each of the Resolutions at the AGM. The Board considers that the Resolutions are in the best interests of the Company’s shareholders as a whole and will promote the success of the Company for their benefit. The Directors intend to vote in favour of the Resolutions in respect of their own beneficial shareholdings in the Company (save in respect of those Resolutions in which they are interested).COVID-19In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic  the Company may put in place procedures  including as a condition of admission to the AGM venue  to align with UK government guidelines at the time of the AGM or as a safety measure  where appropriate. Anyone attending the AGM in person shall be required to adhere to all UK Government guidance and restrictions and all site rules at the AGM venue.Should it become appropriate to revise the current arrangements for the AGM  any such changes will be notified to shareholders through our website (www.osb.co.uk) and  where appropriate  by announcement made by the Company to a Regulatory Information Service.Yours faithfullyDavid WeymouthChairmanNOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGNotice is hereby given that the Annual General Meeting of OSB GROUP PLC (the Company) will be held at 90 Whitfield Street  Fitzrovia  London W1T 4EZ on Thursday  12 May 2022 at 11 am to consider and  if thought fit  pass the following Resolutions.Resolutions 1 to 9 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions.

This consists of the Annual Statement from the Chair of the Group Remuneration Committee and the Annual Report on Remuneration  which may be found on pages 144 to 146 and 154 to 163 of the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts. It details the Directors’ remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2021 and sets out the way in which the Company intends to implement the Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2022. The Auditor has audited those parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report required to be audited and its report can be found on pages 170 to 179 of the 2021 Annual Report and Accounts. For the purposes of this Resolution  the Directors’ Remuneration Report does not include the Directors’ Remuneration Policy. The vote on Resolution 2 is advisory only and the Directors’ entitlement to remuneration is not conditional on it being passed.The Companies Act 2006 requires the Directors’ Remuneration Policy to be put to shareholders for approval annually unless the approved policy remains unchanged  in which case it need only be put to shareholders for approval at least every three years. The Company is not proposing any changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy that was approved at the Annual General Meeting in 2021.RESOLUTION 3: Final dividend (ordinary resolution)A final dividend of 21.1 pence per ordinary share has been recommended by the Board for the year ended 31 December 2021 and  if approved by shareholders  will be paid on 18 May 2022 to all shareholders on the register at the close of business on 25 March 2022.RESOLUTIONS 4 (a) to (i): Election and re-election of Directors (ordinary resolutions)Resolution 4(a) relates to the election of a Director. Simon Walker is standing for election as an Independent Non-Executive Director having been appointed to the Board of Directors with effect from 4 January 2022.Resolutions 4 (b) to (i) relate to the retirement and re-election of the Company’s Directors. The Company’s articles of association require each Director to retire at the AGM. This is in line with best practice recommendations of the Financial Reporting Council’s UK Corporate Governance Code.The Board has confirmed  following a performance review  that each of the Directors standing for re-election continues to be an effective member of the Board  to make a positive contribution and to demonstrate commitment to his or her role. The Board believes that the considerable and wide-ranging experience of the Directors will continue to be invaluable to the Company. The Board considers that Simon Walker has and will continue to make a valuable contribution to the Board and that he has sufficient time to devote to the Company’s affairs. The election to the Board of Simon Walker has been recommended by the Group Nomination and Governance Committee. The biographies of Directors can be found in the Appendix to this document and also on the Company’s website www.osb.co.uk.RESOLUTIONS 5 AND 6: Re-appointment and remuneration of the Auditor (ordinary resolutions)The Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company  to hold office until the conclusion of the next such meeting. The Group Audit Committee has recommended to the Board the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as Auditor of the Company and has confirmed to the Board that its recommendation is free from third party influence and that no restrictive contractual provisions have been imposed on the Company limiting the choice of auditor. Resolution 5 proposes the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Auditor of the Company and Resolution 6 authorises the Group Audit Committee to agree the Auditor’s remuneration.RESOLUTION 7: Authority to make political donations (ordinary resolution)Section 368 of the Companies Act 2006 (the Act) prohibits companies from making political donations exceeding £5 000 in aggregate in any 12-month period to (i) political parties  (ii) other political organisations and (iii) independent election candidates  and from incurring political expenditure  without shareholder approval. In line with the Group’s policy  neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries made any political donations nor incurred any political expenditure during 2021. It is not proposed or intended to alter this policy. However  some of the Group’s activities may potentially fall within the wide definitions of ‘political donation’ or ‘political expenditure’ in the Act and  without the necessary statutory authorisation  the Group’s ability to communicate its views effectively to political audiences and to relevant interest groups could be inhibited. Such activities may include briefings at receptions or conferences – when the Group seeks to communicate its views on issues vital to its business interests – including  for example  conferences of a party political nature or of special interest groups in specific areas.Accordingly  the Company believes that the authority contained in this Resolution is necessary to allow it and its subsidiaries to fund activities which it is in the interests of shareholders that the Company should support. Such authority will enable the Company and its subsidiaries to be sure that they do not  because of any uncertainty as to the bodies or the activities covered by the Companies Act 2006  unintentionally commit a technical breach of the statutes. Any political donation made or expenditure incurred under authority of this Resolution will be disclosed in next year’s Annual Report and Accounts.This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2021 and will expire at close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held in 2023.RESOLUTION 8: Directors’ authority to allot shares (ordinary resolution)The Directors currently have a general authority to allot new ordinary shares in the capital of the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any securities into  shares. This authority is  however  due to expire at the AGM and the Board would like to renew it to provide the Directors with flexibility to allot new shares and grant rights up until the Company’s next AGM within the limits prescribed by The Investment Association.The Investment Association’s guidelines on Directors’ authority to allot shares state that the Association’s members will regard as routine any proposal at a general meeting to seek a general authority to allot an amount up to two-thirds of the existing share capital  provided that any amount in excess of one-third of the existing share capital is applied to fully pre-emptive rights issues only. Accordingly  if passed  this resolution will authorise the Directors to allot (or grant rights over) new shares in the Company: (i) under an open offer or in other situations (including a rights issue) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1 499 087.56 (representing approximately 33 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital); and (ii) under a rights issue only  up to a further aggregate nominal amount of £1 499 087.56 (representing approximately 33 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital). In each case  the reference to the Company’s issued ordinary share capital is to the issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document).If passed  this authority will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2023. The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority  however  the Board considers it prudent to maintain the flexibility that it provides to enable the Directors to respond to any appropriate opportunities that may arise. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 24 March 2022.RESOLUTION 9: Directors’ authority to allot shares in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (ordinary resolution)This Resolution renews the Directors’ authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £539 671.22  in connection with the issue of ‘Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments’. Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments are any securities to be issued by the Company or any member of the Group  or by a Company outside of the Group with the consent of the Company or a member of the Group and which are intended on issue to form all or part of a type or class of securities  the terms of which are eligible to meet any Regulatory Capital Requirements and which are:convertible into or exchangeable for ordinary shares of the Company; orissued together with share warrants relating to ordinary shares of the Company;and in each case  which grant to  or require  the holder of such security and/or its nominee a right or obligation (as applicable) to subscribe for such ordinary shares following a specified event relating to an actual or prospective adverse change in the capital position or viability of the Company  any member of the Group or the Group as a whole or any other event specified in the Regulatory Capital Requirements and otherwise on such terms as may be determined by the Directors of the Company or a Committee thereof upon issue.The Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company to have the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments at any time and from time to time. The authority sought in this Resolution will be used as considered desirable to comply with or maintain compliance with such Regulatory Capital Requirements or targets applicable to the Company. Regulatory Capital Requirements are specified by the Prudential Regulation Authority or such other authority having primary supervisory authority with respect to the Company from time to time in relation to the margin of solvency  capital resources  capital  contingent capital or buffer capital of the Company  a member of the Group or the Group taken as a whole.The Company intends to seek to renew authority for the issuance of such Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments on an annual basis.The amount of this authority is  in aggregate  equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). No ordinary shares were held in treasury as at that date.Resolutions 9 and 12 are intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to authorise the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which contain contractual debt to equity conversion features. The Resolutions are not intended to provide authority for any future UK statutory conversion requirements as may become part of UK national law in the future  for which such authority would not be required.The authority sought in Resolution 9 is separate and distinct from the authority sought in Resolution 8 which is the usual authority sought on an annual basis in line with guidance issued by The Investment Association. The authority sought in Resolution 9 will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2023.RESOLUTIONS 10 and 11: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights (special resolutions)Resolutions 10 and 11 are special resolutions which  if passed by shareholders  will enable the Directors to allot ordinary shares in the Company  and/or to sell any shares out of treasury  for cash  without first offering those shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.The proposed resolutions essentially replicate the powers which were granted at last year’s AGM (and which will expire at the AGM). Such powers reflect the Statement of Principles published by The Pre-Emption Group in March 2015  which provides that a company may seek power to issue  on a non-pre-emptive basis for cash  shares in any one year representing:(i) no more than five per cent of the company’s issued ordinary share capital; and (ii) no more than an additional five per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital provided that such additional power is only used in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment.The 2015 Statement of Principles defines a ‘specified capital investment’ as ‘one or more specific capital investment related uses for the proceeds of an issuance of equity securities  in respect of which sufficient information regarding the effect of the transaction on the listed company  the assets  the subject of the transaction and (where appropriate) the profits attributable to them is made available to shareholders to enable them to reach an assessment of the potential return’. Items that are regarded as operating expenditure rather than capital expenditure will not typically be regarded as falling within the term ‘specified capital investment’.In line with best practice  the Company has structured its pre-emption disapplication request as two separate resolutions. Resolution 10 is proposed as a special resolution. If this resolution is passed by shareholders  it will permit the Directors to allot ordinary shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis both in connection with a rights issue or similar pre-emptive offer and  otherwise than in connection with any such issue  up to a maximum nominal amount of £224 863.01. This amount represents approximately five per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document). This resolution will permit the Directors to allot any such shares for cash in any circumstances (whether or not in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment).Resolution 11 is also proposed as a special resolution. If this resolution is passed by shareholders  it will afford the Directors an additional power to allot ordinary shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis up to a further maximum nominal amount of £224 863.01. This amount also represents approximately five per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022. The Directors shall use any power conferred by Resolution 11 only in connection with an acquisition or a specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issue  or which has taken place in the preceding six month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue.The Directors confirm their intention to follow the provisions of the 2015 Statement of Principles regarding cumulative usage of authorities within a rolling three year period. Those provisions state that a company should not issue shares for cash representing more than 7.5 per cent of the company’s issued share capital in any rolling three year period  other than to existing shareholders  without prior consultation with shareholders. This limit excludes any ordinary shares issued pursuant to a general disapplication of pre-emption rights in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment.RESOLUTION 12: Disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights in relation to the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments (special resolution)Resolution 9 renews the Directors’ authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £539 671.22 specifically in connection with the issue of Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments. Resolution 12 proposes that the Directors be empowered to allot equity securities pursuant to that authority for cash  without first offering those equity securities to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. £539 671.22 is equivalent to approximately 12 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document).Renewing this Resolution will permit the Company the flexibility necessary to allot equity securities pursuant to any proposal to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments and  by virtue of such disapplication  without the need to comply with the pre-emption requirements of the UK statutory regime. Together with Resolution 9  Resolution 12 is intended to provide the Directors with the flexibility to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments which may convert into ordinary shares.Conditional upon the passing of Resolutions 9 and 12  the Directors would not expect to make use of Resolutions 8 and 11 to issue Regulatory Capital Convertible Instruments  however  they may do so  to the extent permissible  if deemed appropriate in light of capital requirements  market conditions and/or high demand. Any exercise of the authorities in Resolutions 8 and 10 (if passed) would be separate from  and in addition to  the exercise of powers under Resolutions 9 and 12 and would have the effect of diluting the interests of ordinary shareholders.RESOLUTION 13: Authority to purchase own shares (special resolution)Resolution 13 gives the Company authority to buy back its own ordinary shares in the market as permitted by the Companies Act 2006.The authority limits the maximum number of shares that could be purchased to 44 972 602 (representing approximately 10 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 24 March 2022) and sets minimum and maximum prices at which shares may be purchased.This authority replaces the similar authority given to the Directors at the Annual General Meeting in 2021 and will expire at the close of business on 30 June 2023 or  if earlier  at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2023. A listed company purchasing its own shares may hold those shares in treasury and make them available for re-sale as an alternative to cancelling them. Accordingly  if this Resolution is passed  the Company will have the option of holding  as treasury shares  any of its own shares that it purchases pursuant to the authority conferred.This would give the Company the ability to sell treasury shares quickly and cost-effectively and provide the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base. No dividends are paid and no voting rights are attached to shares held in treasury. The Company did not hold any shares in treasury as at 24 March 2022 (being the latest practicable date before the publication of this document). As at that date  there were 2 413 983 options to subscribe for ordinary shares in the capital of the Company  representing 0.54 per cent of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. If the full authority conferred by this Resolution were to be exercised in full  these options would represent 0.60 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company.Further to the announcement on 17 March 2022  the Company has commenced a share buyback programme for an amount of up to £100 million (the Share Buyback) pursuant to the authority granted at last year’s AGM. The Share Buyback is expected to end no later than 21 February 2023. Any shares purchased by the Company under the Share Buyback are to be cancelled. The Directors regard having the flexibility to repurchase issued shares in suitable circumstances as an important part of the financial management of the Company. The Directors may consider exercising the authority to purchase the Company’s ordinary shares if market conditions and the Company’s financial position make this possible but will keep the matter under review. Shares would only be purchased if the Directors believed that to do so would result in an improvement in earnings per share and would be in the interests of shareholders generally. Any purchases of ordinary shares would be by means of market purchases on a recognised investment exchange and purchased shares would be cancelled (in which case the number of shares in issue would thereby be reduced) or  alternatively  held in treasury  depending on which course of action is considered by the Directors to be in the best interests of the shareholders at that time.RESOLUTION 14: Notice of general meetings (special resolution)The statutory notice period required for general meetings of the Company is at least 21 clear days unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period  which cannot  however  be less than 14 clear days (AGMs will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice). At last year’s AGM  shareholders passed a resolution enabling the Company to call general meetings  other than an AGM  on at least 14 clear days’ notice. This approval must be renewed at each AGM  so  in order to preserve this ability  Resolution 14 seeks such approval. It is intended that the shorter notice period would not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings but only where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting and is thought to be in the interests of shareholders as a whole. If given  the approval will be effective until the Company’s next AGM  when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.NOTES1. The Company strongly encourages all shareholders to submit a proxy vote in advance of the AGM  appointing the Chairman of the meeting as their proxy rather than a named person. These notes to the Notice should be read in this context.2. Only persons entered on the Register of Members of the Company at 6.30 pm on Tuesday  10 May 2022 (or  if the AGM is adjourned  at 6.30 pm on the date which is two business days prior to the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM or adjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of persons to attend or vote (and the number of votes they may cast) at the AGM or adjourned meeting.3. A shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint another person as her/his proxy to exercise all or any of her/his rights to attend  speak and vote at the AGM. A shareholder can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the AGM  provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder.4. A proxy does not need to be a shareholder of the Company but must attend the AGM to represent you. Your proxy could be the Chairman or another person who has agreed to attend to represent you. If you wish for a proxy to make any comments on your behalf at the AGM  you will need to appoint someone other than the Chairman of the meeting and give them the relevant instructions directly. Those submitting a Form of Proxy are strongly encouraged to appoint the Chairman of the meeting rather than a named person as their proxy. This will ensure that your vote will be counted even if ultimately you (or any other proxy you might otherwise appoint) are not able to attend the meeting. The valid appointment of a proxy does not prevent you from attending the AGM and voting in person.5. A shareholder who wishes to appoint a proxy should complete the Form of Proxy which accompanies this notice and includes full details of how to appoint a proxy. If you do not have a Form of Proxy and believe that you should have one  or if you require additional Forms of Proxy  please contact Equiniti’s helpline on 0371 384 2701 (+44 121 415 7047 if calling from overseas). Lines are open between 8.30 am and 5.30 pm Monday to Friday (excluding public holidays in England and Wales). Shareholders who hold their shares in uncertificated form may use ‘the CREST voting service’ to appoint a proxy electronically  as explained below.6. In order to be valid  a proxy appointment must be returned (together with any power of attorney or other authority under which it is executed or a copy of the authority certified in ink by a bank  a stockbroker or a solicitor) by one of the following methods:– in hard copy form by post  by courier or by hand to the Company’s registrar at the address shown on the Form of Proxy; or in the case of CREST members  by utilising the CREST voting service in accordance with the procedures set out in note 9 below.The appointment of a proxy in each case must formally be received by the Company’s registrar no later than 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022.You may also appoint your proxy electronically online at www.sharevote.co.uk where full instructions on the procedure are given. The Voting ID  Task ID and Shareholder Reference Number printed on the Form of Proxy will be required to use this electronic proxy appointment system. Alternatively  shareholders who have already registered with Equiniti Registrars’ online portfolio service  Shareview  can appoint their proxy electronically by logging on to their portfolio at www.shareview.co.uk using their user ID and password. Once logged in  click ‘view’ on the ‘My Investments’ page. Click on the link to vote and follow the on screen instructions.7. To change your proxy instructions you may return a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard copy Form of Proxy and would like to change the instructions using another hard copy Form of Proxy  please contact Equiniti at Aspect House  Spencer Road  Lancing  West Sussex BN99 6DA. The deadline for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in relation to amended instructions. Any attempt to terminate or amend a proxy appointment received after the relevant deadline will be disregarded. Where two or more valid but differing appointments of proxy are delivered or (in the case of appointments in electronic form) received in respect of the same share for use at the same meeting  the one which is last delivered or  as the case may be  received as aforesaid (regardless of its date  its date of sending or the date of its execution) shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other or others as regards that share. If the Company is unable to determine either which is last sent or which is last delivered or received  none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of the relevant share(s).In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company’s register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).8. A copy of this notice has been sent for information only  to Nominated Persons (that is  a person who has been nominated by a shareholder to enjoy information rights under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006). The rights to appoint a proxy cannot be exercised by a Nominated Person; they can only be exercised by a shareholder. However  a Nominated Person may have a right under an agreement with the shareholder by whom she or he was nominated to be appointed as a proxy for the AGM or to have someone else so appointed. If a Nominated Person does not have such a right or does not wish to exercise it  she or he may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.9. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual  which can be viewed at www.euroclear.com. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID number RA19) by 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022 (the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in this notice). For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.10. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.11. Voting on all Resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll rather than a show of hands. This is a more transparent method of voting as shareholders’ votes (including the votes of those shareholders who are unable to attend but who have appointed a proxy for the meeting) are to be counted according to the number of shares held. As soon as practicable  following the AGM  the results of the voting will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and also placed on the Company’s website: osb.co.uk/investors/shareholder-services/.12. Please note that the Company takes all reasonable precautions to ensure that no viruses are present in any electronic communication it sends out but the Company cannot accept responsibility for loss or damage arising from the opening or use of any email or attachments from the Company and recommends that shareholders subject all messages to virus checking procedures prior to use. Any electronic communication received by the Company  including the lodgment of an electronic proxy form  that is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.13. A shareholder of the Company  that is a corporation  may authorise a person or persons to act as its representative(s) at the AGM. In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006  each such representative may exercise (on behalf of the corporation) the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual shareholder of the Company  provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.14. Shareholders satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 can require the Company to publish a statement on its website setting out any matter relating to the audit of the Company’s accounts (including the Auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the AGM and that the shareholders propose to raise at the AGM. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting the publication to pay its expenses. Any statement placed on the website must also be sent to the Company’s Auditor no later than the time it makes its statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the AGM includes any statement that the Company has been required to publish on its website.15. Under section 319A of the Companies Act 2006  the Company must  subject to limited exceptions  answer any question relating to the business being dealt with at the AGM which is put by a shareholder attending the AGM. Information relating to the AGM which the Company is required by the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website in advance of the meeting may be viewed at osb.co.uk/investors/ shareholder-services/. You may not use any electronic address provided in this notice to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.16. Shareholders have the right to ask questions in relation to the business of the AGM but no answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the AGM or involve the disclosure of confidential information  (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question  or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the AGM that the question be answered. Shareholders wishing to raise any questions relating to the business of the AGM may do so by submitting them to the Company Secretariat ahead of the AGM at company.secretariat@osb.co.uk. You may submit questions until 11 am on Tuesday  10 May 2022 and the Company will endeavour to publish and maintain an appropriate summary of responses on the ‘AGM Information’ page of its website in advance of the AGM.17.

NEW YORK  March 31  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- FABRIC  the Fashion And Business Resource Innovation Center  implemented Lectra'…,"From their early beginnings  they realized that one of the best ways they could help their designers be competitive in the industry as a whole was to integrate Gerber Technology  a Lectra company's IoT-enabled solutions into their workflow. This foresight was critical when the pandemic hit  as people started to seize the opportunity to start their long-awaited apparel businesses but couldn't access the resources or the manufacturing usually available overseas. The need to produce product domestically and in smaller batches  without a significant price increase for the customer  became essential.The co-founders of FABRIC both knew first-hand how daunting  overwhelming and costly it was to start an apparel business and wanted to ease that burden for others. They called it ""Democratizing Fashion"".""We wanted to figure out how to provide the resources for an apparel entrepreneur under one roof and help these apparel entrepreneurs be more competitive with the bigger brands "" said co-founder Angela Johnson  on why they started FABRIC.Their mission has resulted in helping nearly 800 apparel entrepreneurs bring their dreams to life and resulted in more than $6.8 million donated in free and discounted programs and services. FABRIC is unique in that they don't turn away brands who need help finding the right resources to manufacture garments. They focus their efforts on helping a higher volume of smaller brands  instead of allowing the production needs of bigger brands to edge out those most in need of their services.This strategy of small batches and unique products required a reinvention of the process  as well as an ability to connect the dots between the different systems and managing data from design to the final product. FABRIC always wanted to support 21st century manufacturing for smaller  digitally-native brands  and when they saw Gerber's Innovation Center and Microfactory in New York City—they were able to realize the possibilities.Upon visiting the Innovation Center  co-founder Sherri Barry remarked how seamless and integrated the process was and imagined the possibilities for her own customers. She noted the ability to ""start with any surface design  have it patterned in Gerber AccuMark® 2D/3D  visualized with a 3D sample  digitally printed  then cut with an IoT-enabled cutter and sewn  really made on-demand production a reality.""Gerber AccuMark allows the development of 2D digital patterns that can be visualized in 3D with production accuracy while avoiding the need for creating a physical sample and ensuring a perfect fit. When surface designs are involved  the images are positioned in AccuMark patterns  and then data is passed seamlessly to the Kornit Presto digital printer and accurately read and cut using the Gerber Z1 cutter with ContourVision™.FABRIC continued to fuel the expansion of their technology suite by including Gerber YuniquePLM®  a cloud-based PLM system that helps to manage all the orders for their many brands. It also helps keep the data seamlessly connected to AccuMark and have it updated in real time.Adopting technology also helped FABRIC successfully pivot during the pandemic to large-batch production of PPE thanks to having a fully integrated technology-based system.Because of their reliance on Gerber's technology suite  FABRIC and The Fashioneer's complete microfactory are now able to provide cutting edge solutions and much needed resources to up and coming brands and designers nation-wide and may someday rival the traditional fashion hubs of the world.About Lectra:For companies that breathe life into our wardrobes  car interiors  furniture and more  Lectra crafts the premium technologies that facilitate the digital transformation of their industry. Lectra's offer empowers brands  manufacturers and retailers from design to production  providing them with the market respect and peace of mind they deserve.

2054,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://wwd.com/accessories-news/watches/the-panerai-playbook-jean-marc-pontroue-discusses-his-eco-ambitions-1235139721/,The Panerai Playbook: Jean-Marc Pontroué Discusses His Eco Ambitions,"Panerai's CEO Jean-Marc Pontroué believes sustainability is all about ""changing your habits. It’s a psychological thing. I strongly believe that the sort of changes that we are making don’t really take much — they don’t require a lot of effort.""",A high-end watch brand is taking on the Goliath of global warming by sourcing recycled materials for its products and packaging  and inviting fellow makers to do the same.Panerai’s chief executive officer Jean-Marc Pontroué has been defying watch industry convention in a number of ways.Not only is he making watches with recycled materials  but he’s published lists of his suppliers in the hope that Panerai’s competitors can use similar metals and substances  so they can all drive prices down.His collegial moves are unheard of in the secretive  and ultra-competitive  world of luxury watches.Pontroué is also committed to using only recycled packaging by 2023 and looking outside — way outside — the industry for inspiration.“We’ve learned a lot from the car industry  and from the Nespresso people. If they can recycle billions of coffee capsules  then why not us?” Pontroué said in an interview.Jean-Marc Pontroué ©The French executive  who cycles to work like many of his other Richemont colleagues in Switzerland  has also been looking at the automobile industry’s shift to electric power.“After 100 years  carmakers had to think differently  and they’ve invested billions in making changes. We don’t talk about that scale of investment in the watch industry  but we do feel a sense of responsibility to change the business model ” he said  adding that Panerai has a duty to make more sustainable products partly because of its historic connection to the ocean.The company was founded by Giovanni Panerai in Florence in 1860 as a watch shop  a workshop and a watchmaking school. It supplied precision instruments  and later technical watches  to the Italian Navy  and later to the Egyptian Navy.For most of its history  it’s been associated with the military and underwater performance  one reason why Panerai is working with UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. Together  they are developing ocean awareness activities as part of the United Nations Decade of Ocean Sciences for Sustainable Development.It was only in the early ’90s that Panerai began making watches for civilians. It was acquired by Compagnie Financière Richemont (then known as the Vendôme Group) in 1997 and has developed a cult following.Collectors and fans of the watches  which range in price from around 3 800 pounds to upward of 60 000 pounds  are known as “Paneristi ” and once a year  a group of them — unrelated to the company — will meet to discuss the latest developments of the watches.Panerai’s largest market is the U.S.  where it has 20 stores. That’s partly down to Sylvester Stallone  who snapped up a host of Panerai watches while filming the 1996 film “Daylight” at Cinecittà studios in Rome  and gifted them to friends back in Hollywood — no doubt attracted by the watch’s unique oversize style — easier for a diver to see underwater and perfect for an action hero’s thicker wrists.Today  Panerai owners include Michael Jordan  former President Bill Clinton  Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jason Statham. Earlier this year  Panerai got a free advertising boost after Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson wore the Panerai Submersible Goldtech OroCarbo while making his opening speech at the Super Bowl.Courtesy of NASA  and a Panerai customer from Scottsdale  Ariz.  Panerai has even traveled to the International Space Station to be tested in extreme temperature and pressure conditions.Pontroué’s sustainability drive has been going for a few years now. The first effort was small  and inspired by one of the brand’s longtime ambassadors  the explorer Mike Horn  who approached Pontroué about a steel shaft  weighing about 10 kg  from his sailing yacht Pangea. He could no longer use it and was wondering whether Panerai could somehow give it a new life.Panerai’s Submersible QuarantaQuattro eSteel Courtesy Image“So we brought it back to Neuchâtel [Switzerland] and asked the team what they could do with it. A couple of days later  they told me they could work with the metal ” Pontroué said.The result was the Panerai Submersible Ecopangaea Tourbillon GMT 50mm Mike Horn Edition of five watches  which cost $190 000 each. Every person who purchased the watch also had the opportunity to travel to the Arctic with Horn himself. How’s that for experiential retail?Although only five watches were made  the experiment with recycled metal set Panerai on its own mission to explore the possibilities of plying recycled materials into luxury  high-performance watches. “At the time  nobody was speaking about recyclability  or environment-friendly initiatives in the watch industry ” Pontroué said.Not long after  the company developed the Submersible eLab-ID “concept” watch  which boasted 98.6 percent recycled components. It made 30 of them  priced at 60 000 euros each. “We did the straps  the movements  each and every screw  the dial  the hands  the buckles  the packaging. It was not a profitable business. But based on those designs  we thought we could make it profitable ” he said.The watches featured a lightweight recycled titanium alloy. It also used recycled SuperLuminova on its dial and hands and recycled silicon.The eLab-ID concept watch was a shining example of Richemont’s sustainability strides last year  according to Matthew Kilgarriff  group director of corporate social responsibility and the author of the group’s annual ESG and DEI report. The report quotes Panerai as saying that it’s now possible to build a watch from scratch from existing materials  “and reduce the need for virgin material extraction  and its associated high environmental impact.”In order to source those recycled materials  Panerai said it had to establish a new supply chain and create the blueprint for these eco-watches.For his part  Kilgarriff noted that Panerai has proven that non-virgin material can be applied — in significant quantities — to anything  including “the glass in my office window  in your window and the watch on my wrist. For me  [Panerai] was one of the highlights of the year ” Kilgarriff told WWD in an interview last year.The company would later come out with a series of eSteel watches made from recycled metal. At Watches and Wonders this year  the company will be unveiling its latest eSteel models  with plans to make around 2 500 of them.The Mike Horn limited-edition watch. ©Panerai has described the Luminor Marina eSteel model  as “a big step in our commitment to reduce the need for virgin material extraction and its associated high environmental impact.”Some 89 grams of the Luminor Marina eSteel components are made of recycled-based materials  corresponding to nearly 60 percent of the weight of the watch.It will also be inviting competitors to source similar recycled materials and take inspiration from Panerai’s supply chain for their own models.“In Switzerland  everything is secret. Banking is a secret and so is watchmaking. Everything is low-profile. Now  we’re saying we want everybody to join in and copy what we’re doing. And  soon  we plan to talk about other brands’ recycled steel watches based on what we’ve been doing at Panerai ” Pontroué said.Panerai’s recycled steel comes from Eramet  a French multinational mining and metallurgy company  listed on the Euronext Paris exchange. According to the group’s website  it has earmarked multimillions of euros for innovation  and is looking to meet the needs “of the new digital and renewable energies industries.”Eramet is researching the recycling of numerous metals and their mineral derivatives; developing new grades of “superalloys and special steels” and researching the recycling of processed materials  such as lithium and nickel cadmium.Other companies that supplied recycled materials for the eLab-ID concept watch include Siltronix ST  which specializes in high-tech silicon products and processing; ProCadrans  which developed several technologies to deliver a dial made out of recycled materials  including titanium; RC Tritec  which produces luminescent materials for watchmaking; Novo Cristal  Panerai’s recycled sapphire partner; Ugitech  a France-based steel manufacturer and supplier of recycled steel  and Morellato  which makes watch straps from recycled plastic.The customer response to the watches made with recycled materials was overwhelmingly positive  Pontroué said.“We had no idea what the customer would say  or whether they would buy the watches. Now they are asking us why we don’t [use recycled materials] in the rest of our assortment. But we will. In the next three years  by 2025  all of the steel in our company will be recycled. There will be no more original steel in our assortment ” he said.Asked whether Panerai would have pushed its eco-agenda without the initial nudge from its ambassador Mike Horn  Pontroué said absolutely. He said living in Switzerland and making watches that can function in the deep sea  which is threatened by mountains of plastic waste  has been enough of an impetus.“We have the chance to live in the incredible country of Switzerland. Our feet are on the mountains  and we are relatively protected from pollution compared to many other cities in the world. And I strongly believe that the sort of changes that we are making don’t really take much — they don’t require a lot of effort  and not too much more money.”Panerai’s Swiss offices in Neuchâtel  which opened nearly a decade ago  have zero environmental impact with regard to carbon dioxide production  according to the company. The buildings have emission-reducing devices  electricity from renewable sources  while employees are cycling to work  rather than driving.The water used in production processes is reused for the toilets  for cleaning and in the cooling systems  while the energy produced by the machinery is reused in the heating system.A state-of-the-art heat pump system permits optimization of the energy produced by both the heating and cooling systems.Pontroué said sustainability shouldn’t be difficult. “It’s about changing your habits. It’s a psychological thing. Think about when you recycle plastic bottles. Maybe that was a challenge 10 or 20 years ago. Now we’re recycling espresso capsules  and I am cycling to work on my mountain bike. I do seven kilometers each morning  and each evening  which is the best moment of the day.”,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.15,0.22,0.63,True,English,"['The Panerai Playbook', 'Jean-Marc Pontroué', 'Eco\xa0Ambitions', 'Panerai Submersible Ecopangaea Tourbillon GMT 50mm Mike Horn Edition', 'Submersible QuarantaQuattro eSteel Courtesy Image', 'former President Bill Clinton', 'Submersible eLab-ID “concept” watch', 'Compagnie Financière Richemont', 'Panerai Submersible Goldtech OroCarbo', 'lightweight recycled titanium alloy', 'other Richemont colleagues', 'Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission', 'United Nations Decade', 'unique oversize style', 'free advertising boost', 'The Rock” Johnson', 'International Space Station', 'sailing yacht Pangea', 'chief executive officer', 'ocean awareness activities', 'Vendôme Group', 'recycled metal set', 'high-end watch brand', 'watch industry convention', 'luxury, high-performance watches', 'recycled materials', 'French executive', 'watch shop', 'luxury watches', 'global warming', 'fellow makers', 'similar metals', 'collegial moves', 'ultra-competitive, world', 'car industry', 'Nespresso people', 'coffee capsules', 'Jean-Marc Pontroué', 'automobile industry', 'electric power', 'business model', 'historic connection', 'watchmaking school', 'precision instruments', 'Italian Navy', 'Egyptian Navy', 'one reason', 'Ocean Sciences', 'Sustainable Development', 'early ’90s', 'latest developments', 'largest market', 'U.S.', 'Sylvester Stallone', 'Cinecittà studios', 'action hero', 'thicker wrists', 'Michael Jordan', 'Arnold Schwarzenegger', 'Jason Statham', 'opening speech', 'Super Bowl', 'extreme temperature', 'pressure conditions', 'sustainability drive', 'first effort', 'longtime ambassadors', 'steel shaft', 'new life', 'Neuchâtel', 'experiential retail', 'environment-friendly initiatives', 'profitable business', 'Giovanni Panerai', 'Panerai owners', 'Panerai customer', 'recycled packaging', 'technical watches', 'five watches', 'Panerai watches', 'sustainable products', 'underwater performance', 'Jean-Marc Pontroué', 'Goliath', 'number', 'ways', 'lists', 'suppliers', 'hope', 'competitors', 'substances', 'prices', 'inspiration', 'lot', 'billions', 'interview', 'Switzerland', 'shift', '100 years', 'carmakers', 'changes', 'scale', 'investment', 'sense', 'responsibility', 'duty', 'company', 'Florence', 'workshop', 'history', 'military', 'UNESCO', 'part', 'civilians', 'cult', 'Collectors', 'fans', '3,800 pounds', '60,000 pounds', 'Paneristi', '20 stores', 'host', '1996 film', 'Daylight', 'Rome', 'friends', 'Hollywood', 'diver', 'Dwayne', 'NASA', 'Scottsdale', 'Ariz.', 'explorer', '10 kg', 'team', 'result', 'person', 'opportunity', 'Arctic', 'experiment', 'possibilities', 'recyclability', '98.6 percent', 'components', 'straps', 'movements', 'screw', 'dial', 'hands', 'buckles', 'designs', 'SuperLu']",2022-03-31,2022-04-01,wwd.com

2057,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.etfexpress.com/2022/03/31/309712/unique-geographies-lead-exchange-growth,Unique geographies lead to exchange growth,1 day ago,Euronext | Best European Exchange for Listing ETFs - Silvia Bosoni  Group Head of ETFs  Euronext believes that its offering is unique  covering seven pan-European economies  now including Borsa Italiana in Milan.“Our goal is to supply services to all ETF issuers  to the liquidity providers and the buyside in all our geographies in a standardised manner ” Bosoni says.“I believe that Euronext won this award because ETP issuers appreciate the efficiency of our markets and the exposure we can give to their products  and for this reason they are increasing the offer on our markets. In 2021 we were able to list 765 ETPs and welcome 18 new ETP providers”Last year’s turnover on Euronext was EUR221 billion. The offer of listed ETPs at the end of 2021 was made up of 1 482 products in Italy and 1 333 in Paris and Amsterdam.A number of trends has dominated new listings  with ESG and sustainability being the most prevalent.“209 ESG ETPs were listed last year  nearly double what we did the previous year ” Bosoni says. “Almost all ETP issuers have increased their range of ESG products  emphasizing the fact that many companies are expanding their offers of sustainable exposures due to the high interest that both institutional and retail investors have on this topic.”She also notes that thematic exposure keeps growing  with ETPs based on a wide range of trends such as exposure to energy innovation  blockchain  technological evolution and products and services targeting the ageing population and millennials.Cryptocurrencies are another growing trend  with 60 cryptocurrency ETPs listed over 2021. These products  listed in Paris and Amsterdam  were particularly popular with retail investors.Single stock short and leveraged ETPs are also appreciated by retail investors looking for more volatility. Retail investors are important on the Italian market  in terms of volume  on overall products invested in by retail investors  they represent about 21 per cent  while in Paris this number is 14 per cent but steadily growing in the last two years.Looking forward  Bosoni believes that the increasing interest in commodities exposure will inevitably make ETPs in this sector more widely adopted and will also likely happen with products that capture the spike in inflation and its subsequent volatility.“From an industry point of view  it is clear that ESG has become a crucial component for every type of investment  influencing all products that are offered. One area that has huge potential is fixed income ETFs  which until now the ESG development has mainly been concentrated in the equity space.”She believes that this thematic trend will also continue with increased granularity and customisation to reflect the appetite from investors.Considering the European regulatory outlook  she also considers that the ongoing MiFID II review might have a relevant impact in shaping European markets in the next few years  while financial products will be modelled by the implementation of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).“From an exchange point of view  our aim is to continue to provide a marketplace where ETP issuers can offer the widest range of products  and investors can find the perfect match to their needs in a fair and efficient trading environment” Bosoni says.To return to the ETF Express European Awards’ Report 2022 click here.,neutral,0.26,0.72,0.02,positive,0.68,0.29,0.03,True,English,"['Unique geographies', 'exchange growth', 'ETF Express European Awards’ Report', 'ongoing MiFID II review', 'Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation', 'European regulatory outlook', 'seven pan-European economies', 'Single stock short', 'efficient trading environment', 'Best European Exchange', 'last two years', 'fixed income ETFs', '18 new ETP providers', 'ETF issuers', 'sustainable exposures', 'European markets', 'liquidity providers', 'new listings', 'exchange point', 'ETP issuers', 'Listing ETFs', 'Group Head', 'Borsa Italiana', 'standardised manner', 'many companies', 'high interest', 'energy innovation', 'technological evolution', 'ageing population', 'growing trend', 'Italian market', '21 per cent', '14 per cent', 'increasing interest', 'industry point', 'crucial component', 'One area', 'huge potential', 'equity space', 'thematic trend', 'relevant impact', 'perfect match', 'retail investors', 'wide range', 'widest range', 'ESG development', 'thematic exposure', 'commodities exposure', 'subsequent volatility', '60 cryptocurrency ETPs', 'leveraged ETPs', 'overall products', 'financial products', 'Silvia Bosoni', '209 ESG ETPs', 'ESG products', '765 ETPs', '1,482 products', 'Euronext', 'offering', 'Milan', 'goal', 'services', 'buyside', 'geographies', 'efficiency', 'reason', 'turnover', 'Italy', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'number', 'trends', 'sustainability', 'fact', 'offers', 'institutional', 'topic', 'blockchain', 'millennials', 'Cryptocurrencies', 'terms', 'volume', 'sector', 'spike', 'inflation', 'type', 'investment', 'granularity', 'customisation', 'appetite', 'implementation', 'SFDR', 'aim', 'marketplace', 'needs', 'fair']",2022-03-31,2022-04-01,etfexpress.com

It’s highly likely more investment would be needed if productivity were to be ratcheted up  depleting the potential for future dividends.And if the Russians are (more) comprehensively ejected from the Swift system  can they still pay the dividend?“Looking at the latest update ” says Danni Hewson from AJ Bell  “they [Polymetal] have a chunk of cash in non-sanctioned financial institutions so that might be the way [to pay dividends] but it does raise questions marks.”“It looks like the ‘divis’ are paid via Belgium based Euroclear and I’d guess that uses the Swift system ” Hewson adds.Kazakhstan a Special Op split?Polymetal’s Kazak operations account for almost half – around 48% – of net earnings.With two thirds of its assets based in Russia  could a separate operation stand on its own?Would it need a big chunk of fresh investment to keep productive?“If it could be spun off ” adds Hewson. “The move would likely be used as a blue-print for other London-listed businesses tied to Russia.”Polymetal also carries debt with European banks  which may need to be re-financed  it’s thought  at higher cost.GME 164.86 Current price -15.150% 1D% Trade now Swap Short: 91 % Swap Long: 9 % Long position overnight fee -0.0225% Short position overnight fee -0.0219% Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC) Spread Trade now Trade now AAPL 174.26 Current price -0.420% 1D% Trade now Swap Short: 96 % Swap Long: 4 % Long position overnight fee -0.0064% Short position overnight fee -0.0059% Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC) Spread Trade now Trade now GOOG 2812.70 Current price +0.280% 1D% Trade now Swap Short: 98 % Swap Long: 2 % Long position overnight fee -0.0225% Short position overnight fee -0.0219% Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC) Spread Trade now Trade now TSLA 1090.78 Current price +0.750% 1D% Trade now Swap Short: 90 % Swap Long: 10 % Long position overnight fee -0.0225% Short position overnight fee -0.0219% Overnight fee time 21:00 (UTC) Spread Trade now Trade nowMuch depends on how quickly more tightening of sanctions occurs. Trying to estimate the geopolitical investment risk with any accuracy is  bluntly  impossible.Political risks are legion  stillThe Russian rouble has seen a robust recovery  even touching levels pre-invasion. However capital controls are in place and trading volumes have all but dried up.Multinational sanctions have not been as savage as predicted. The Russian economy has not been crushed.Russia’s well regarded central bank governor  Elvira Nabiullina  a moderniser  steered Russia through its 2014 sanctions related to the annexation of Crimea – she has form.But harder Iran-type sanctions may be en route. International trust with Russia is now decimated.Also… how clean is Kazakhstan? Might secondary sanctions be applied – at some point – if a separate mining arm churns up enough cash to cover the dividend?Supporting PutinThen there’s another risk – moral. Buy Russian stocks and you’re supporting the Russian economy. Period.If your finances are at all fragile  take a hard swerve. Despite this week’s share price climb  Polymetal remains more than 75% down since January.Pre-invasion  Polymetal was looking solid with improving gross margins and a solid return on equity.But 2020/21 was strong for commodities generally.Year-on-year Polymetal net income was cut 15%With a price/earnings (P/E) ratio of 2.1 Polymetal is super-cheap – but for lots of reasons.There are other asset classes that are much safer on a range of metrics. For example  Northern Europe is working out how it can depend without Russian oil and natual gas.Think opportunities with aluminium  nickel as well as natural gas and oil; even uranium.But beware the volatility.

The Remuneration Policy aims also to align the interests of the Senior Management with those of the Company's shareholders.In this respect  there must be transparency and alignment to the delivery of strategic objectives  both at the group and individual level. There must also be scope for the reward of exceptional efforts and achievements that deliver value to the group and the shareholders.The remuneration offered by the Company shall be competitive and in line with market practice. It shall be designed to support the Company's strategy and interests  through different mechanisms. In particular  besides the fixed salary and other benefits in kind  it may include the following variable components for those members of the Senior Management who do not sit on the Board of Directors of the Company:• a possible cash variable component  in connection with the attainment of short-terms business goals (performance criteria will be applied  in connection with associated financial or non-financial goals  sometimes linked to the targets communicated to the market  to be achieved on certain quarters or on a yearly basis);• a possible share-based incentive scheme  to secure a strong ongoing alignment with the shareholders  through the Company's share price performance  in order to safeguard the Company's long-term interests.The combination of the above components seeks to create a well-balanced remuneration reflecting individual competences  responsibilities and performance  both short-term and long-term  to the benefit of the Company and its shareholders. In particular  the Company aims to balance equity and cash components  so that unnecessary risk-taking is not encouraged.The remuneration is reviewed annually  considering all elements of the remuneration together to ensure that the remuneration package as a whole remains competitive.TYPES OF REMUNERATIONThe total remuneration of the Senior Management may consist of the following components:Fixed base salaryThe Senior Management's fixed salary shall be competitive  in line with market practice and based on the individual member's competence  responsibilities and performance.

New hires shall receive their performance criteria within 4 weeks after their date of employment.• After the financial year has ended  the remuneration committee is responsible to evaluate the CEO's achievement rate  and the CEO is responsible to evaluate the senior management's achievement rates.• The payout of the bonus shall be based on the achievement rate  measured against the agreed and documented performance criteria. When more than one performance criteria have been defined  the average achievement rate shall be used to determine the payout.Achievement Rate Percentage Payout >110% target 100% 100% target 50% 95%-99% of target 25% <95% of target 0%• The performance criteria in 2022 will be based on the revenue and EBITDA of the Company  as per the 2022 budget approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.• 50% of the achieved bonus amount is paid within four weeks after the assessment has been completed  documented  and communicated to the employee.

The fact that any participating employees may have received a bonus at any time does not give rise to any expectation or entitlement to receive any bonus in the future  or as to the size of any future bonus.Share-based incentive schemesThe Board of Directors may also propose for the general meeting to resolve on long-term share incentive programs.FURTHER RELEVANT ASPECTSNotice of termination and severance paymentThe maximum notice of termination period in any member of Senior Management's contract is 9 months during which time payment of salary will continue.

The Directors shall be entitled  in their discretion  to resolve that a participant (or his/her heirs) may still exercise the options  even though the employment or assignment in the Company (or any of its subsidiaries) has ceased.Issuance of sharesThe Company will satisfy its obligations under the 2022 ESIP Program through the issuance of new shares following the exercise of share options by participants in the 2022 ESIP Program. All of the rights attached to the Company's shares are set out in the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association.Exercise priceEach share option entitles the holder to acquire one share in the Company at an exercise price corresponding to 130 per cent of the volume-weighted average price of the Company's share as quoted on Nasdaq First North Growth Market during a period of 10 trading days calculated as from and including 11 May 2022.Recalculation due to split  consolidation  new share issue  etc.The exercise price and the number of shares that each share option entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue  dividend  etc. in accordance with Swedish market practice.The rationale for the proposalThe Company shall offer remuneration in accordance with market practice which enables the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel. Remunerations within the Company shall be based on principles of performance  competitiveness and fairness. Share based incentive programs may be offered as part of the total compensation package. The Directors are of the opinion that the 2022 ESIP Program is in the best interest of both the Company and its shareholders. The rationale for the 2022 ESIP Program is to achieve a greater alignment of interests between the participants and the shareholders  to create conditions for retaining and recruiting competent persons to the Company and to increase the motivation among the participants in order to maintain and sustain the growth of the Company.CostsThe costs for the 2022 ESIP Program are estimated to amount to approximately EUR 650 000 (it should be noted that no social security costs are expected under current Maltese tax rules) calculated in accordance with IFRS 2. The costs have been estimated based on a share price of SEK 24 at the time of the start of the program and that full allocation and maximum outcome will apply. The costs are expected to have a limited effect on the Company's key ratios.Dilution and information about current outstanding incentive programsUpon maximum exercise of the options under the 2022 ESIP Program  the share capital of the Company will increase by EUR 2 160  1 080 000 new shares will be issued  meaning a dilution of approximately 2.55 per cent of the number of shares and votes in the Company. Currently  the Company has three active incentive programs to certain key employees outstanding which was adopted in 2019  2020 and 2021. Considering the shares which may be issued pursuant to the outstanding incentive programs in the Company  the maximum dilution  including all three programs  if ESIP 2022 is decided at the Meeting and fully allotted  can amount to 5.6 per cent.For more information regarding the Company's current outstanding incentive programs  please see the Company's Annual Report for 2021  which will be made available on the Company's website  www.raketech.com.Preparations of the proposalThe Directors of the Company and the Remuneration Committee have prepared the 2022 ESIP Program. The 2022 ESIP Program has been reviewed by the Directors and by the Remuneration Committee at meetings in March 2022.Majority RequirementA resolution to approve the 2022 ESIP Program is valid only where supported by shareholders holding more than 50 per cent of the voting rights attached to shares represented and entitled to vote at the Meeting.Agenda Item 17; Extraordinary resolution on certain changes to the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of the Company for the purpose of forming a fiscal unit in accordance with the Consolidated Group (Income Tax) Rules (Subsidiary Legislation 123.189 of the laws of MaltaThe Board is proposing the introduction of a new Clause 5(z) to the Memorandum for the purpose of forming a fiscal unit composed of the Company and its subsidiaries  Raketech Group Limited (C 48831) and Casumba Media Limited (C 76055)  in accordance with the Consolidated Group (Income Tax) Rules (Subsidiary Legislation 123.189 of the laws of Malta). On this basis  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves to adopt the following Extraordinary Resolution:""(1) That a new Clause 5(z) be added to the Memorandum of Association of the Company which shall read as follows:""(z) To consolidate the Company's results pursuant to any requirement or right in terms of Maltese law  including but not limited to the Companies Act (Cap. 386  Laws of Malta) and the Income Tax Acts (Cap. 123 and Cap. 372  Laws of Malta).""(2) That the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association (""M&A"") be updated to reflect the foregoing extraordinary resolution and any other changes that are required in terms of law to reflect any changes that may have taken place since the current version of the M&A was last approved and registered by the Registrar of Companies.(3) That any one director and/or the company secretary  acting singly  be and hereby is  authorised to: (i) issue a certified extract of these resolutions  (ii) sign and file the updated M&A on the Company's behalf with the Registrar of Companies  and (iii) do all things as may be necessary to give effect to these resolutions including inter alia submit any notifications and/or documents as may be necessary to the Commissioner for Inland Revenue and/or any other relevant authorities.Agenda Item 18; Extraordinary Resolution on certain changes to the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of the Company to alter the number of Equity Securities available for issuance by the Directors under Articles 4(b) and 4(c) of the Articles.The Board is proposing an amendment to article 4 of the Articles to: (a) alter the maximum number of Equity Securities which may be issued by the Directors subject to the provisions of article 85 of the Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) (""CA"") as payment for an acquisition of assets by the Company or by any of its subsidiaries after the date of the Meeting and/or as payment to a creditor in settlement of a debt owed by the Company or its subsidiaries after the date of the Meeting; and (b) extend the validity of the authorisation period set out therein until the end of the Company's Annual General Meeting for 2023  subject to the Company's ability in general meeting to renew this permission by ordinary resolution for further maximum periods of 5 years each thereafter.The rationale for these amendments is to ensure that the Company has sufficient flexibility to be able to meet its various obligations to third party investors  sellers and/or creditors. On this basis  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves to adopt the following Extraordinary Resolution:(1) That Article 4 of the Company's Articles be deleted and substituted in its entirety by the following:""4. Subject to the provisions of article 85 of the Act and  in the case of sub-articles (b) and (c) hereunder with effect from the 15 May 2022  the Directors are authorised to issue Equity Securities of the Company in any of the following cases:(a) an issuance of Equity Securities in relation to employee or director incentive programmes  up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital (or Equity Securities convertible into the maximum value of the authorised share capital) in respect of one or more issuances  provided that the Directors shall only be authorised to issue Equity Securities in relation to incentive programmes that are first approved and authorised by the Company in general meeting;(b) an issuance of Equity Securities as payment for an acquisition of assets (including shares) by the Company or by any of its subsidiaries; and/or(c) an issuance of convertible debt securities or an issuance of Equity Securities as payment to a creditor in settlement of a debt owed by the Company or its subsidiaries to such creditor.Provided that in the case of sub-articles (b) and (c) above  the Directors shall be authorised to issue Equity Securities up to an aggregate maximum of 20% of the issued Shares of the Company (or Equity Securities convertible into 20% of the issued Shares) on a rolling 12-month basis.The foregoing authorisation is valid until the end of the Company's annual general meeting for 2023 and the Company in general meeting may by ordinary resolution renew this permission for further periods of one (1) to five (5) years each.(2) That the Company's M&A be updated to reflect the foregoing extraordinary resolution and any other changes that are required in terms of law to reflect any changes that may have taken place since the current version of the memorandum and articles of association was last approved and registered by the Registrar of Companies.(3) That any one director and/or the company secretary  acting singly  be and hereby is  authorised to: (i) issue a certified extract of these resolutions  (ii) sign and file the updated M&A on the Company's behalf with the Registrar of Companies  and (iii) do all things as may be necessary to give effect to these resolutions.""Agenda Item 19; Extraordinary Resolution on certain changes to the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of the Company to authorise the Directors to issue Shares up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital of the CompanyThe Board is proposing the introduction of a new article 4A to the Articles for the purpose of authorising the Directors of the Company to issue Shares up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital of the Company. The rationale behind this proposed amendment is to grant the Directors of the Company (subject to prior shareholder approval in general meeting) the flexibility to issue Shares other than for the reasons already set out in article 4 subject to the provisions of article 85 CA.The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Meeting adopts the following Extraordinary Resolution:(1) That a new article 4A be added to the Company's Articles  which shall read as follows:""4A. Subject to the provisions of article 85 of the Act  the shareholders in general meeting may  by ordinary resolution  authorise the Directors to issue Shares up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital of the Company as provided by the Memorandum  which authorisation shall be for a maximum period of 5 years renewable for further maximum periods of 5 years each.(2) That the Company's M&A be updated to reflect the foregoing extraordinary resolution and any other changes that are required in terms of law to reflect any changes that may have taken place since the current version of the memorandum and articles of association was last approved and registered by the Registrar of Companies.(3) That any one director and/or the company secretary  acting singly  be and hereby is  authorised to: (i) issue a certified extract of these resolutions  (ii) sign and file the updated M&A on the Company's behalf with the Registrar of Companies  and (iii) do all things as may be necessary to give effect to these resolutions.""OtherThe Company has 41 295 601 shares issued as of the date of this notice (one vote per share).Except as otherwise provided in this Notice  all supporting documentation mentioned in this Notice and a copy of the Company's proposed amendments to its Memorandum and Articles of Association are available at the Company's website (www.raketech.com) as at the date of this Notice.

It then passed the funds on to paying agent BNY Mellon  said the person  who declined to be named because they aren’t authorized to speak publicly.Funds to pay the bond coupon and partial principal totaling $392.2 million were received by BNY Mellon  Russia’s finance ministry said in a statement on Thursday.When asked about BNY Mellon’s role  a spokesperson referred to a March 17 statement from the bank on “tragic events” in Ukraine.Questions arose over Russia’s ability to service its 2030 debt last week after Clearstream  the Luxembourg-based bank that was listed as the clearinghouse in bond documents  blocked the account for the National Settlement Depository.

That leaves just $552.4 million of the security remaining in circulation  according to the ministry  which said it sent corresponding notifications to the paying agent  Citibank N.A.’s London branch.It’s a step that ensures local investors get payments regardless of the restrictions and sanctions that have been slapped on the nation for its invasion of Ukraine. Still  the clock is ticking for President Vladimir Putin’s government to repay the outstanding balance when it matures.“Monday is still a key date for holders that did not sign up and are thus awaiting the final redemption payment at par ” said Padhraic Garvey  head of global debt and rate strategy at ING Financial Markets.The Finance Ministry said earlier this week that it would buy back the maturing April 4 bond before it comes due at 100% of par value using the official central-bank ruble rate on March 31. The onshore ruble  which has been paring its losses in Moscow trading amid capital controls  strengthened for a ninth straight session to 83.2 per dollar on Thursday.The 2022 bond was quoted at 90 cents on the dollar on Thursday  according to indicative pricing data  down from above-par in the week preceding Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Despite warnings from credit-rating companies  the government has so far stayed current on its debt obligations. Still  capital controls and restrictions imposed by the world’s biggest settlement systems have complicated and delayed the arrival of funds on previous payments for foreign and local investors alike.On Thursday  though  JPMorgan Chase & Co. processed a nearly $447 million payment from Russia for its dollar debt due in 2030  allowing the nation to continue sidestepping a default.Clearstream  the Luxembourg-based bank that was listed as the clearinghouse in the 2030 bond’s documents  also received payment for the coupon  according to a person familiar with the matter who declined to be named for not being authorized to speak publicly.(Updates with context throughout.)©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.04,0.85,0.11,negative,0.03,0.25,0.73,True,English,"['$1.45 Billion Bond Buyback', 'Russia', 'Investors', 'official central-bank ruble rate', 'Citibank N.A.', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'ING Financial Markets', 'ninth straight session', 'indicative pricing data', 'biggest settlement systems', 'The Finance Ministry', 'final redemption payment', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'maturing April 4 bond', 'rate strategy', 'onshore ruble', 'fewer dollars', 'corresponding notifications', 'paying agent', 'London branch', 'local investors', 'outstanding balance', 'key date', 'Padhraic Garvey', 'Moscow trading', 'capital controls', 'credit-rating companies', 'JPMorgan Chase', '$447 million payment', 'Luxembourg-based bank', 'global debt', 'debt obligations', '$2 billion bond', 'par value', 'previous payments', 'dollar debt', '2022 bond', '2030 bond', 'Russia', 'bulk', 'rubles', 'nation', 'far', 'holders', 'equivalent', 'Monday', 'statement', 'Thursday', 'security', 'circulation', 'step', 'restrictions', 'sanctions', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'clock', 'government', 'head', 'March', 'losses', '90 cents', 'week', 'warnings', 'world', 'arrival', 'funds', 'foreign', 'Co.', 'default', 'Clearstream', 'clearinghouse', 'documents', 'coupon', 'person', 'matter', 'Updates', 'context']",2022-03-31,2022-04-01,bnnbloomberg.ca

Years  even decades could go by  one hedge-fund firm recalls being told  before another relative-value trade this attractive comes along.For those comfortable with step one  the bet has indeed racked up quick gains. Known as a negative-basis trade  at its core it takes advantage of the near-unprecedented selloff in Russian debt since Vladimir Putin’s widely-condemned invasion. It involves buying beaten down government or corporate bonds along with corresponding credit-default swaps  which insure the debtholder in the event of non-payment.In normal times  the economics of such a transaction don’t make much sense. The cost of the debt and the hedges move inversely  typically offsetting each other. But for much of the past month  as institutional investors were rushing to offload their stakes in Russian assets amid mounting public outrage  bond prices were falling faster than the cost to hedge was rising.“It seems like a quasi-guaranteed trade ” said Jochen Felsenheimer  a managing director at XAIA Investment in Munich  where he trades both CDS and bonds. Felsenheimer said he’s observed “very active” buying and selling of negative basis  with packages seemingly assured to pay out at par quoted recently at 80 cents on the dollar.Rob Citrone’s $2.6 billion Discovery Capital Management is one of the firms taking advantage of the kink in the market. Discovery bought long-dated Russian government bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar  while also hedging with one-year CDS at a price of around 60 cents  according to a person with knowledge of the trade.In essence  if the country defaults  the firm can convert the near-worthless bonds into cash and pocket a substantial profit. And if it doesn’t  the notes could quadruple in value  or more. The arbitrage position accounts for a couple percentage points of Discovery’s portfolio  the person said.Other firms including Aurelius Capital Management  GoldenTree Asset Management and Silver Point Capital have been piling into Russian markets  primarily by snapping up corporate bonds  the Financial Times reported last week. And H2O Asset Management has told investors that it’s been adding to its Russian debt holdings  according to a client letter seen by Bloomberg.But ask around hedge fund circles and  beyond H2O  few will admit publicly or even privately that they’re getting into Russia. Discovery  Aurelius  GoldenTree and Silver Point all declined to comment for this story.Rarely has a trade elicited such fierce industry debate  according to distressed-debt veterans  a group known for its combative personalities and aggressive tactics. Not only about the moral and ethical repercussions but even more so over the inherent financial  legal and reputational risks that come with investing in the country.As much as firms are trying to cover their tracks  signs of their involvement are all over global debt markets.Volumes in Russian corporate bonds soared to their highest levels in two years last month  according to data from MarketAxess. Moreover trading of Russian credit-default swaps has surged  dwarfing other single-name contracts  Bloomberg data show.At the same time  the nation’s government bonds have almost tripled in value over the past three weeks  with dip buyers bidding up prices as the Kremlin manages to navigate a complex web of international roadblocks to ensure foreign creditors still get paid.“The appealing part for investors is the asymmetric payoff -- how much money you could make ” said Jean-Dominique Butikofer  head of emerging-markets fixed income at Voya Investment Management  which isn’t involved in the trade. He noted that some hedge funds did very well wagering on Russia in the aftermath of the country’s 1998 ruble devaluation and default. “That may be on their minds.”The steady climb in Russian bond prices in recent weeks has eroded some of the arbitrage opportunity in the negative-basis trade already. Bond and CDS packages more recently were being offered by sales desks for as much as 95 cents on the dollar  traders said. Others say they can still be had in the 70 cent range.‘Uninvestible’Yet for many  there’s seemingly no price that could compel them to get involved.The country “has become uninvestible for most in the West ” Marathon Asset Management’s Bruce Richards said in an interview. He noted that the firm doesn’t have any exposure to Russia outside of index products that will soon remove the country. “Russia may have the willingness and ability to pay its debts ” he said  but “this unimaginable aggression Putin and Russia have embarked upon will ultimately lead to a collapse of the Russian economy.”While an economic collapse may sound hyperbolic  mounting sanctions on Moscow are already beginning to take their toll. With half the nation’s foreign-exchange reserves frozen  the ruble plunged in early March. Inflation will surge to 18% over the course of the year  according to Bloomberg Economics  while the country’s GDP is expected to contract almost 10% in 2022.Even if Russia wants to pay its creditors  there remains the question of mechanics. While the Kremlin has managed to make interest payments on a handful of bonds over the past month  last week the country said operations via Clearstream  one of the biggest clearinghouses in the world  haven’t been going through after its account was blocked  raising questions over how easy it will be to send cash to creditors in the future.Settlement RiskThe negative-basis trade seemingly insulates investors from such risks. Still  some say the unorthodox language in certain Russia bond documents  along with uncertainty over sanctions  could raise issues about when default swap contracts are triggered and how they are settled.Future U.S. Treasury restrictions on Russian bonds  for example  could make the debt non-deliverable at CDS auctions  complicating the ability of holders to get paid.Jay Newman  the hedge fund veteran behind Elliott Management’s 15-year battle with Argentina following that nation’s default  said in an interview with Bloomberg that even experts in sovereign debt can’t make reasonable bets on Russia given the extreme variables at play.“It’s something no one in the distressed sovereign or corporate market has ever seen before ” he said of Russia’s default prospects  noting in particular the atypical immunity clauses the government has maintained in its debt documents  protecting it from foreign lawsuits. “Specialist investors have never faced something like this  and crossover investors have certainly never faced it.”There’s another  less tangible risk that fund managers must consider  warned Newman. Firms face long-term reputational damage by linking their names to Russia. That’s why many public institutions and pensions were quick dump Russian assets at the outset of the war. “There’s a lot of pressure being brought to bear on managers to not have Russia on their books ” Newman said.To avoid backlash  some fund managers have created private side accounts for clients seeking Russian investments  according to people with familiar with the matter. The vehicles are meant to keep securities out of primary funds where they could attract criticism from other clients.Julian Brigden  a managing partner at hedge-fund consultant Macro Intelligence 2 Partners  said some U.S. money managers have been weighing the merits of setting up offshore structures in order to buy Russian assets.Others  he said  “would never in a million years” expose themselves to such a high level of scrutiny.©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.01,0.08,0.91,mixed,0.06,0.14,0.8,True,English,"['Controversial Russian Bond Arbitrage', 'Guaranteed Profits', 'Wall Street sales desks', 'one hedge-fund firm recalls', '$2.6 billion Discovery Capital Management', 'dated Russian government bonds', 'Marathon Asset Management', 'corresponding credit-default swaps', 'couple percentage points', 'fierce industry debate', 'emerging-markets fixed income', 'Russian credit-default swaps', 'Voya Investment Management', 'mounting public outrage', 'Aurelius Capital Management', 'inherent financial, legal', 'other single-name contracts', 'Silver Point Capital', 'GoldenTree Asset Management', 'H2O Asset Management', 'hedge fund circles', 'past three weeks', 'Russian debt holdings', 'global debt markets', 'Russian corporate bonds', 'Russian bond prices', 'Russian markets', 'Russian assets', 'Russian economy', 'past month', 'XAIA Investment', 'Financial Times', 'recent weeks', 'mounting sanctions', 'worthless bonds', 'quick gains', 'unprecedented selloff', 'normal times', 'managing director', 'negative basis', 'Rob Citrone', 'substantial profit', 'arbitrage position', 'client letter', 'distressed-debt veterans', 'combative personalities', 'aggressive tactics', 'ethical repercussions', 'reputational risks', 'highest levels', 'same time', 'dip buyers', 'complex web', 'international roadblocks', 'foreign creditors', 'appealing part', 'asymmetric payoff', 'Jean-Dominique Butikofer', 'hedge funds', 'steady climb', 'arbitrage opportunity', '70 cent range', 'Bruce Richards', 'index products', 'unimaginable aggression', 'foreign-exchange reserves', 'early March', 'Other firms', 'one-year CDS', 'trading opportunity', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Jochen Felsenheimer', 'two years', '1998 ruble devaluation', 'economic collapse', 'relative-value trade', 'negative-basis trade', 'institutional investors', 'CDS packages', 'Bloomberg data', 'pitch', 'clients', 'something', 'horrors', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'decades', 'attractive', 'step', 'bet', 'core', 'advantage', 'invasion', 'debtholder', 'event', 'non', 'payment', 'economics', 'transaction', 'sense', 'cost', 'hedges', 'stakes', 'guaranteed', 'Munich', '80 cents', 'dollar', 'kink', '20 cents', '60 cents', 'knowledge', 'essence', 'country', 'cash', 'notes', 'portfolio', 'story', 'group', 'moral', 'investing', 'tracks', 'signs', 'involvement', 'Volumes', 'MarketAxess', 'Kremlin', 'money', 'head', 'aftermath', 'minds', '95 cents', 'traders', 'Others', 'West', 'interview', 'exposure', 'willingness', 'ability', 'debts', 'Moscow', 'toll', 'half', 'Inflation', 'course']",2022-04-01,2022-04-01,bnnbloomberg.ca

REUTERS/Ilya NaymushinLONDON  March 31 (Reuters) - Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are one of the most popular ways to invest in gold. Shares represent gold bars held in vaults and are easy to buy and sell  freeing investors from the hassle of buying and storing bullion themselves.ETFs and similar products together held 3 570 tonnes of gold worth $210 billion at the end of 2021  according to the World Gold Council  which tracks the sector.As part of a report on ethical gold investments  Reuters asked the ten largest ETF operators - all based in Europe or North America - what gold they own. read moreRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterAll the funds only hold gold bars made by refiners accredited by the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA)  a standard-setting industry body.Six  with 955 tonnes of gold between them  said they prioritised bars made since 2012  when the LBMA introduced rules aimed at stopping the use of gold linked to crime or violence.Before that date  LBMA rules focused only on the purity  weight and size of gold bars.Three of the six ETF issuers that focus on newer bars said they aimed to hold bars made after 2019  when the LBMA rules had become tougher.

L’Oréal  Sanofi’s largest shareholder  has committed to a lock-up period of 1 year following the settlement of the Distribution  i.e.  May 10  2022Paris  April 1  2022. Sanofi announced today that the French Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) has approved the listing prospectus prepared by EUROAPI in connection with the intended listing of its shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris.On March 17th  2022  Sanofi’s Board of Directors unanimously decided to submit for approval to its shareholders the proposed distribution in kind (the “Distribution”) of EUROAPI shares  via an additional extraordinary dividend  exclusively in kind  in addition to the previously proposed €3.33 cash dividend per Sanofi share. The Distribution relates to circa 58% of the share capital and voting rights of EUROAPI. In connection with the proposed Distribution  EPIC Bpifrance has agreed to purchase 12% of EUROAPI shares1 from Sanofi  which confirmed its intention to hold circa 30% of the share capital and voting rights of the company after the Distribution.Story continuesThe Distribution by Sanofi to its shareholders of EUROAPI shares in the form of an additional extraordinary dividend  exclusively in kind  is subject to the shareholders’ approval at Sanofi’s May 3  2022 Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting.Subject to certain customary exceptions  the following lock-up periods have been agreed:2 years for Sanofi and EPIC Bpifrance following the settlement and delivery of the EUROAPI shares to be sold to EPIC Bpifrance; and1 year for L’Oréal  Sanofi’s largest shareholder and for Karl Rotthier  CEO of the Company  following the settlement of the Distribution.Main features of the Distribution are as follows:The Distribution ratio will be one (1) EUROAPI share per twenty three (23) Sanofi shares.No fractional EUROAPI shares will be issued. Any right to receive a fractional share will not be tradable or transferable. Consequently  when the amount of the Distribution to which a Sanofi shareholder is entitled does not correspond to a whole number of EUROAPI shares (i.e.  less than twenty three (23) or a multiple of twenty three (23) Sanofi shares)  the shareholder will receive the immediately lower number of EUROAPI shares  plus a cash payment for the whole of the balance arising from the price at which EUROAPI shares corresponding to fractional shares were sold. Each financial intermediary will sell the shares corresponding to the fractional shares of its entitled clients. As a result  the amount of the cash balance may vary depending on the shareholder’s financial intermediary;The technical reference price of EUROAPI shares is expected to be announced on May 5  2022 by Euronext Paris after market close;The admission to trading of the EUROAPI shares and the ex-date (détachement) of the Distribution will occur at 9.00 am (CET) on May 6  2022;The record date (the date on which positions are closed) for Sanofi shares to be eligible to the Distribution is scheduled on May 9  2022;Payment of the Distribution (delivery and book-entry of the allocated EUROAPI shares) will take place on May 10  2022.Following the Distribution and the purchase of 12% of EUROAPI shares by EPIC Bpifrance  the Sanofi group will no longer control EUROAPI  resulting in a slightly accretive impact on Sanofi 2022 business operating income (BOI) margin2.Documents related to Sanofi shareholders’ meeting will be made available on April 11  2022 on the Sanofi dedicated web page.Investors are invited to read EUROAPI’s press release  issued concurrently and available on EUROAPI’s website announcing the AMF’s approval of its prospectus  and the listing prospectus in order to fully understand the potential risks and rewards associated with any decision to invest in EUROAPI shares.

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. These statements include projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions  statements regarding plans  objectives  intentions and expectations with respect to future financial results  events  operations  services  product development and potential  and statements regarding future performance.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces new data from the pivotal Phase II/III trial of...","LEIDEN  Netherlands  April 1  2022 /CNW/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces new data from the pivotal Phase II/III trial of leniolisib for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS)  a primary immunodeficiency. Principal Investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  shared the findings in a presentation at the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) 2022 Annual Meeting.Pharming Group N.V. logoAs announced on February 2  2022  the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized  Phase III portion of the clinical trial  conducted by Novartis  met its co-primary endpoints  which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of naïve B cells are important in this population  as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers. Presented for the first time at CIS  the co-primary endpoints at day 85 after baseline demonstrated:In the index lymphadenopathy lesions  a statistically significant adjusted mean change in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) of -0.30 among patients who received leniolisib compared with -0.06 among patients who received placebo (95% CI: -0.37  -0.11; p=0.0012).From a baseline level of ˂48%  an increase of 34.76% in the proportion of naïve B cells in patients who received leniolisib versus a -5.37% decrease in patients who received placebo (95% CI: 28.51  51.75; p˂0.0001).The study drug was well-tolerated. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Story continuesCharlotte Cunningham-Rundles  M.D.  Ph.D.  David S. Gottesman Professor of Immunology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York  said:""It is great news that leniolisib has achieved such positive results in this Phase III study in APDS. It is extremely encouraging to see that this medication is capable of targeting the cause of this difficult disease  both improving care and reducing patients' symptoms. Progress toward a treatment that is tailor-made for our patients with APDS is a milestone we have long awaited.""Pharming plans to begin submitting global regulatory filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""Pharming is delighted that leniolisib achieved significance in both co-primary endpoints and was well tolerated in these APDS patients  as the product's approval would address an unmet need for those with this rare disease  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. In addition to working closely with regulatory authorities across the globe to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients  we will continue to develop this treatment through our open-label extension study and two additional studies that will enroll children under the age of 12  as well as potentially extending the geographic reach of the product.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. is a global  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative protein replacement therapies and precision medicines for the treatment of rare diseases and unmet medical needs.The flagship of our portfolio is our recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) franchise. C1INH is a naturally occurring protein that down regulates the complement and contact cascades in order to control inflammation in affected tissues.Our lead product  RUCONEST®  is the first and only plasma-free rhC1INH protein replacement therapy. It is approved for the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks.

Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases. Efgartigimod is currently approved in the United States as VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

It would track the performance of Solana (SOL)  Cardano (ADA)  and Polkadot (DOT).The new ETPs dubbed WisdomTree Solana (SOLW)  WisdomTree Cardano (ADAW)  and WisdomTree Polkadot (DOTW) would give investors exposure to the prices of the underlying crypto assets. In that context  SOLW  ADAW  and DOTW had a total expense ratio of 0.95% or carried an expense ratio of 95 basis points.In addition  the pan-European exchange Euronext expected to record the crypto ETPs in Amsterdam and Paris on 7 April  the announcement noted.The firm also added that investors can access the three digital assets through its diversified crypto basket ETPs – WisdomTree Crypto Market (BLOC) and WisdomTree Crypto Altcoins (WALT) and are available for sale in Austria  Belgium  Denmark  Finland  France  Germany  Italy  Ireland  Luxembourg  Netherlands  Norway  Poland  Spain  Sweden  and Switzerland.Here comes the fee war?According to Eric Balchunas  Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst  the offering is poised to severely undercut Switzerland-based crypto ETP issuer 21Shares  which charged its investors a 2.5% management fee.WisdomTree launching Solana  Cardano and Polkadot ETPs in Europe fee of 0.95%  severely undercutting similar products from 21Shares' which charge 2.5%.

The products began trading on exchanges in Germany and Switzerland on Tuesday and hit Euronext exchanges in Amsterdam and Paris on Thursday.The trio of ETPs  which can be sold across the European Union  carry an expense ratio of 95 basis points.Jason Guthrie  the firm’s head of digital assets for Europe  told Blockworks its client base on the continent is composed entirely of institutional investors.“It’s not that you get a handful of clients or one big client saying  ‘I really want Cardano or Polkadot’ specifically  but rather there is this increasing appetite for an ever-expanding product set ” Guthrie said. “The ability for people to respond to market situations  to adjust their portfolio  to have a more robust toolkit I think is by far the loudest message that we get from our client base.”The market capitalizations of Solana (SOL) and Cardano (ADA) are roughly $40 billion and $37 billion  respectively — good for sixth- and eighth-highest among cryptocurrencies  according to data compiled by Blockworks. Polkadot (DOT) ranks 11th  at about $25 billion.WisdomTree now offers eight crypto ETPs. In addition to bitcoin and ethereum products  the company launched three crypto basket ETPs in November. The Crypto Market (BLOC)  Crypto Altcoins (WALT) and Crypto Mega Cap Equal Weight (MEGA) ETPs were designed to offer blended exposure to blue-chip coins  as well as decentralized finance payments  smart contracts and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).“While Bitcoin and Ethereum grab the headlines  altcoins are now viable options for many institutional investors  providing more options to diversify their crypto holdings just like they would with any other asset class ” WisdomTree Head of Europe Alexis Marinof said in a statement.In cherry-picking cryptocurrencies for products  Guthrie said the firm evaluates trading volumes and developer activity  as well as the support it has from exchanges and custodians.WisdomTree is looking into “plenty of very interesting projects ” he added  noting that future exposures could come in the form of single-asset or basket products. Guthrie did not reveal any specific assets the firm is considering.Exchange FTX and asset manager CoinShares launched a Physical Staked Solana ETP in Germany last week. DeFi Technologies subsidiary Valour launched Terra (LUNA) and Avalanche (AVAX) ETPs in the country a few days later.Issuer 21Shares  which has launched a number of crypto ETPs in recent months  plans to have products supporting what the firm considers the top 50 cryptocurrencies by the end of the year  CEO Hany Rashwan told Blockworks.Guthrie acknowledged the increasing competition in the European crypto ETP space. While it’s important to bring new offerings to market  the executive added  it’s a “balancing act” to ensure the firm maintains a “manageable” product range.“If you throw too much at the wall  it just becomes confusing to investors ” Guthrie said. “I also think there’s a risk with this space that if you go too far down the list  you can stray into products that are potentially not mature enough yet  are having regulatory issues or have less-established use cases.”Get the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your inbox every evening.

Principal Investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  shared the findings in a presentation at the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) 2022 Annual Meeting.As announced on February 2  2022  the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized  Phase III portion of the clinical trial  conducted by Novartis  met its co-primary endpoints  which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of naïve B cells are important in this population  as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers. Presented for the first time at CIS  the co-primary endpoints at day 85 after baseline demonstrated:In the index lymphadenopathy lesions  a statistically significant adjusted mean change in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) of -0.30 among patients who received leniolisib compared with -0.06 among patients who received placebo (95% CI: -0.37  -0.11; p=0.0012).From a baseline level of ˂48%  an increase of 34.76% in the proportion of naïve B cells in patients who received leniolisib versus a -5.37% decrease in patients who received placebo (95% CI: 28.51  51.75; p˂0.0001).The study drug was well-tolerated. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Charlotte Cunningham-Rundles  M.D.  Ph.D.  David S. Gottesman Professor of Immunology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York  said:""It is great news that leniolisib has achieved such positive results in this Phase III study in APDS. It is extremely encouraging to see that this medication is capable of targeting the cause of this difficult disease  both improving care and reducing patients' symptoms. Progress toward a treatment that is tailor-made for our patients with APDS is a milestone we have long awaited.""Pharming plans to begin submitting global regulatory filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""Pharming is delighted that leniolisib achieved significance in both co-primary endpoints and was well tolerated in these APDS patients  as the product's approval would address an unmet need for those with this rare disease  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. In addition to working closely with regulatory authorities across the globe to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients  we will continue to develop this treatment through our open-label extension study and two additional studies that will enroll children under the age of 12  as well as potentially extending the geographic reach of the product.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. is a global  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative protein replacement therapies and precision medicines for the treatment of rare diseases and unmet medical needs.The flagship of our portfolio is our recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) franchise. C1INH is a naturally occurring protein that down regulates the complement and contact cascades in order to control inflammation in affected tissues.Our lead product  RUCONEST®  is the first and only plasma-free rhC1INH protein replacement therapy. It is approved for the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks. We are commercializing RUCONEST® in the United States  the European Union and the United Kingdom through our own sales and marketing organization  and the rest of the world through our distribution network.In addition  we are investigating the clinical efficacy of rhC1INH in the treatment of further indications  including pre-eclampsia  acute kidney injury and severe pneumonia as a result of COVID-19 infections.We are also studying our oral precision medicine  leniolisib (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta  or PI3K delta  inhibitor)  for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome  or APDS. World-wide rights for leniolisib were licensed from Novartis AG in 2019. Leniolisib met both of its primary end points in a registration enabling Phase 2/3 study in the United States and Europe. We are targeting global regulatory filings for leniolisib from Q2 2022 onwards.Additionally  we entered into a strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex-vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of HAE.Furthermore  we are leveraging our transgenic manufacturing technology to develop next-generation protein replacement therapies  most notably for Pompe disease  which is currently in preclinical development.Forward-looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements  including with respect to timing and progress of Pharming's preclinical studies and clinical trials of its product candidates  Pharming's clinical and commercial prospects  Pharming's ability to overcome the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the conduct of its business  and Pharming's expectations regarding its projected working capital requirements and cash resources.

At the Board of Directors meeting held on March 31  2022  and chaired by Sophie Bellon  the Board closed the Consolidated accounts for the First half Fiscal 2022 ended February 28  2022.Financial performance for First half Fiscal 2022(in millions of euro) H1 FISCAL 2022 H1 FISCAL 2021 DIFFERENCE DIFFERENCE CONSTANT RATES Revenue 10 262 8 595 +19.4% +15.9% UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT 538 265 +103.0% +96.2% UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT MARGIN 5.2% 3.1% +210 bps +210 bps Other operating expenses (1) (128) -99.2% -100.9% OPERATING PROFIT 537 136 +294.9% +279.5% Net financial expense (53) (50) Tax charge (136) (53) Effective tax rate 28.3% 63.0% GROUP NET PROFIT 337 33 x10 x10 EPS (in euro) 2.30 0.23 x10 UNDERLYING NET PROFIT 339 128 +164.8% +156.0% UNDERLYING EPS (in euro) ² 2.32 0.87 +165.3%Sodexo Chairwoman and CEO Sophie Bellon said:“Revenue growth and margins improvement have been strong in this First half  reflecting the solid recovery in Education  Corporate Services and Sports & Leisure segments. Omicron did have an impact on the recovery in the second quarter  but we are seeing a pick-up since the end of February.We have closed the GET efficiency program  with better results than anticipated. The teams mobilized actively to implement measures to mitigate rising cost inflation: indexation  client negotiations  productivity  product substitution. These actions resulted in a +210 bps improvement of our Underlying operating profit margin to 5.2%.Since October 2021  we have made significant progress on our strategic priorities. Operational execution and sales development are improving in the United States. More new food model offers are being deployed in our major geographies. Our disposals and acquisitions are fully aligned with our portfolio strategy. The transfer of the management of Schools and Government & Agencies to the regions is a first step in the simplification of our organization.Story continuesIn the second half of the year  we are confident that the return to the workplace and Sports & Leisure events will continue to recover. However  the environment remains uncertain with intermittent local outbreaks of Covid-19  and the war in Ukraine. We are confident that we can manage the year end inflationary pressure on margins. Currencies should give us a nice tailwind  but we expect organic revenue growth to be around the bottom of the range we had given in October 2021.Our teams are mobilized to meet the challenges and I warmly thank them for their impressive engagement in the field with our clients and our suppliers. We remain confident in our capacity to continue to grow our business.”Highlights of the periodFirst half Fiscal 2022 Group revenue was 10 262 million euro  up +19.4%  with strong recovery coming through in all segments that were severely impacted by Covid. The currency effect was strong at +3.5%  resulting from the strength of all our major currencies against the euro. The net M&A contribution was -0.8% due to the exit of businesses  sold as part of the portfolio management program. As a result  Group organic revenue growth was +16.7%  back up to 95% of pre-Covid levels.On-site Services organic revenue growth was +17.0%   with a particularly strong first quarter up +17.9% and a second quarter at +16.1%  impacted by Omicron. The recovery was solid with the first quarter ending at 95 % of pre-Covid levels but falling back slightly to 94% in the second quarter due to Omicron. The key elements of the half-year were: In Business & Administrations   organic growth was +19.5% . It reflects a strong recovery in Corporate Services  back up to 89% of pre-Covid levels in Q2  due to a gradual but regular return to the workplace. Sports & Leisure is back up to 61%  as the number of events has picked up significantly. Energy & Resources and Government & Agencies remained solid. In Healthcare & Seniors   organic growth was +5.0%   with the first quarter up +7.4% and the second quarter up +2.5% reflecting a much tougher comparative base in Europe  including a high level of activities at the Testing Centers contract in the United Kingdom last year. In Education   organic growth was +29.5% . While the recovery in activity in Universities in North America was very strong during the period  Omicron did have an impact on the growth in the second quarter in Schools in North America and Europe. Relative to pre-Covid levels  Education was at 88% in the second quarter  back down from 92% in the first quarter  impacted also by the full effect of the Chicago Public Schools contract termination.Key Performance Indicators for the First half Fiscal 2022: Client retention was up +60 bps to 98.1%  improving in all regions and segments. New sales development was up +90 bps at 3.7%  with improvements in many regions  including North America. The higher levels of signings were combined with continued signing discipline  particularly regarding the average projected gross margin which is up +80 bps. Same site sales growth recovered strongly at +19.8%  as volume recovery came through  helped by some solid cross-selling in many segments and regions.Benefits & Rewards Services organic growth was +9.3%   with Employee benefits up a strong +14.5%. There was an acceleration in the second quarter in both the Europe  USA and Asia region and Latin America  where Brazil is also back to double digit growth.Underlying operating margin was 5.2%  up +210 bps versus First half Fiscal 2021. This significant improvement in performance is the result of the strong recovery in volumes  the successful completion of the GET efficiency program  and strong actions to mitigate inflation through indexation  contract renegotiations and productivity.Other operating expenses (net) amounted to only 1 million euros in First half Fiscal 2022  with restructuring costs falling to 3 million euros and gains on the sale of assets more or less off-setting losses. This compares to 128 million euros in the previous year.The Effective tax rate at 28.3% fell below 30%  back to a more regular rate.Group net profit recovered significantly at 337 million euros against 33 million euros in the previous year. Basic EPS was thus multiplied by 10 at €2.30 against €0.23 in the previous year. Underlying Net profit increased +164.8% to 339 million euros against 128 million euros in the previous year.First half Fiscal 2022 Free cash outflow was 75 million euros against the cash inflow of 237 million euros in the previous period. The previous year was boosted by delayed restructuring costs and government payment delays. This year performance was marred by the unwinding of these same government payment delays and restructuring costs combined with the reimbursement of Tokyo Olympics ticketing and an exceptional contribution to the United Kingdom pension funds. Recurring free cash flow was 182 million euros  after a significant increase in capex to 159 million euros  or 1.5% of revenues  relative to the exceptionally low level of 86 million euros  or 0.9% of revenues in the previous year.Net debt has risen year on year to 2.0 billion euros from 1.7 billion euros. However  gearing 2 is stable at 56% and as a result of the significant improvement in EBITDA  the net debt ratio 2 has fallen back down to 1.8x compared to 3.8x at the end of First half Fiscal 2021.Once again  our Corporate Responsibility achievements have been externally recognized: Sodexo earns its 15 th consecutive 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s annual assessment of LGBTQ+ workplace equality.

First time outsourcing contract signings are increasing and currently represent circa 40% of signatures in the First half. Investment in the Marketing & Sales resources is continuing with additions of new sales executives and managers and the recent launching of a new digital training program. A specific long-term incentive scheme for the North America leadership team has been launched to strengthen collective and individual accountability. Accelerate the food model transformation:The deployment of On-site brands & offers is accelerating with the scale-up of The Good Eating Company in the United States and new contracts signatures in the tech and finance sectors for Nourish  Fooditude and The Good Eating Company. We are developing partnerships with high-end brands such as an exclusive 10-year partnership with ForFive Coffee  a premium coffee and food company based in New York. The digitalization of the consumer experience is also progressing. In China  we are leveraging the Meican digital online ordering  mobile apps  smart waiter… to enhance the food offer and develop new smaller clients. We have signed an agreement to expand the Kiwibot fleet in 50 US universities by the end of the year. We are progressively transforming production & logistics: with our new branded offsite kitchens such as Fooditude  Nourish  Frontline Food Services but also with our new central production units in Boston or in Beijing. Manage more actively our portfolio:A number of strategic acquisitions & investments have been completed during the period: To expand the New Food Model offerings  we have acquired Frontline Food Services in North America and increased our participation in Meican in China. To strengthen our European GPO (Group purchasing organization)  two investments have been made in Europe.

Divestment of non-core activities and geographies have also accelerated in the First half. In On-site Services  subsidiaries in Morocco  non-strategic account portfolios in Australia and Czech Republic and The Lido in France have all been sold. Benefits & Rewards Services disposed of its Russian activity and also the sports-cards in Romania and Spain. The Global Childcare activities and On-site Services in the Congo were closed in March. As a result  the Group has now reduced its presence down to 55 countries at the end of February 2022. Enhance the effectiveness of our organization:The GET efficiency program closed ahead of plan with 382 million euros of savings against the target of 350 million euros and a savings/cost ratio of 117% versus 100%.

Sodexo has a small On-site presence in Russia: less than 1% of Group revenues. The situation is being monitored closely and we are reviewing different options at the moment. From the beginning of the war  Sodexo has been strongly mobilized to ensure business continuity for its clients  guarantee the safety of its employees  and provide support to the refugees in countries bordering Ukraine.

Since the end of February  momentum is picking back up. However  the current environment remains full of uncertainties. There is a resurgence of localized Covid outbreaks  several mobilizations in Russia will not happen  and the Testing Centers in the United Kingdom are closing earlier than expected.As a result  we expectFiscal 2022 organic growth to be around the bottom of the range of +15% to +18% given in October 2021.The currencies provided a strong tailwind in the First half and  at today’s rates  should continue to do so.Our teams have successfully managed the margins in the First half and are highly mobilized to mitigate all these uncertainties and in particular the additional inflation resulting from the disruption to the supply chain due to the Ukraine war.As a result  we maintain our expectations forFiscal 2022 Underlying Operating Profit margin close to 5%3  at constant rates.Conference callSodexo will hold a conference call in (English) today at 9:00 a.m. (Paris time)  8:00 a.m. (London time) to comment on its H1 Fiscal 2022 results.Those who wish to connect:From the United Kingdom: +44 2071 928 338  orFrom France: +33 1 70 70 07 81  orFrom the US: +1 646-741-3167 Following by the access code 92 69 446A live audio webcast is also available on www.sodexo.com.The press release  presentation and webcast will be available on the Group website www.sodexo.com in both the « Latest News » section and the « Finance – Financial Results » section.Fiscal 2022 financial calendarFiscal 2022 Third quarter Revenues July 1  2022 Fiscal 2022 Annual Results October 26  2022 Fiscal 2022 Annual Shareholders Meeting December 19  2022Please note that the date of the Annual Shareholders Meeting has changed.These dates are indicative and may be subject to change without notice.Regular updates are available in the calendar on our website www.sodexo.comAbout SodexoFounded in Marseille in 1966 by Pierre Bellon  Sodexo is the global leader in Quality of Life Services  an essential factor in individual and organizational performance.

However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the Underlying Operating Profit margin due to a change in the mix of margins. Conversely  when the Brazilian real strengthens Group margins increase.1€= AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2022 AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2021 AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2022 VS.

The Underlying operating margin was up +210 bps to 5.2%  reflecting the solid recovery in activity.The significant step-up in the Underlying operating margin semester after semester  since the low in Second half Fiscal 2020 of -1.5%  reflects the improvement in activity levels  very tight cost control  numerous contract renegotiations in the On-site activities  more active portfolio management  and the contribution from the GET efficiency program.The GET efficiency program was aimed at protecting the gross profit margin as government aid receded and structurally reducing SG&A for the long-term by simplifying the structures in the Group  to free up capacity to invest in growth and to enhance margins. The program has now been closed.GET PROGRAM FISCAL 2020 FISCAL 2021 FISCAL 2022 TARGET (in millions of euros) CUMULATED NUMBERS Total exceptional costs 158 312 327 350 Cash impact (75) (217) (305) (315) SG&A savings — 91 157 175 Gross profit cost avoidance — 127 225 175 Total savings — 218 382 350 Savings/Costs 117% 100%Cumulated up to the end of First half Fiscal 2022  the GET program has cost 327 million euros  generated 382 million euros of annual savings  with a cash impact of 305 million euros  of which of 37 million euros in First half Fiscal 2022.

The currency impact during the First half was limited.The performance by segment at constant rates is as follows:Business & Administrations Underlying Operating profit increased seven-fold from a very low level in Fiscal 2021. As a result  the Underlying operating margin was up +230 bps to 2.7%. Progress is solid  linked to the recovery in revenues  even though the margin is still some way off the Fiscal 2020 first half margin of 4%. It also represents a significant improvement in margins since the beginning of the pandemic  from -3.3% in Second half Fiscal 2020  to 0.4% in First half 2021 and 1.9% in the Second half. While the margin has recovered significantly in Corporate Services and is back to breakeven in Sports & Leisure  the margin in Energy & Resources has been temporarily impacted by high levels of Omicron-linked absenteeism  particularly in the mining sector  and some major contract ramp-ups.in Healthcare & Seniors  the Underlying Operating Profit margin is flat year on year at 6.4% but higher than in the First half Fiscal 2020  pre-Covid  at 6.3%. Net new business is positive for margins and inflation is being passed on either through indexation clauses  contract negotiations or productivity measures.in Education  Underlying Operating Profit more than doubled and the margin was up by +410 bps at 8.5%  compared to a margin of 8.4% in First half Fiscal 2020. This performance reflects strong volume recovery in North America and Asia  productivity in Europe and strict cost management throughout. Inflation has been passed on to clients or compensated by productivity.In Benefits & Rewards Services  excluding negligible currency impacts  Underlying Operating Profit was up +25.2% and the margin was 26.7%  up +330 bps. This represents a progressive pick-up in the margin over the last few semesters  as the business has recovered from the negative effects of the Covid confinements. While cost reduction has continued  spending on enhanced digitalization and new offerings has also continued. The recovery in financial revenues is also feeding through into enhanced margins.2.5 Group net profitOther net operating expenses amounted to 1 million euros compared to 128 million euros in the previous year.With the closing of the GET program  in First half Fiscal 2022  restructuring costs fell to only 3 million euros. Gains related to the sale of assets were more or less offset by the losses.As a result  the Operating Profit was up strongly at 537 million euros compared to 136 million euros in the previous year.(in millions of euros) H1 FISCAL 2022 H1 FISCAL 2021 UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT 538 265 OTHER OPERATING INCOME 67 8 Gains related to consolidation scope changes 33 3 Gain on disposals of non-current assets — — Gains on changes of post-employment benefits — 4 Other 34 — OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES (68) (136) Restructuring and rationalization costs (3) (107) Losses related to consolidation scope changes (34) (1) Amortization of purchased intangible assets (20) (21) Impairment of goodwill and non-current assets — — Acquisition-related costs (2) (2) Losses on changes of post-employment benefits (1) (1) Losses related to the disposal of non-current assets — — Other (8) (3) OTHER OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES (NET) (1) (128) OPERATING PROFIT 537 136First half Fiscal 2022 Net financial expense was up at 53 million euros against 50 million euros in the previous year. The increase is attributable to the increased gross debt resulting from the US Dollar bond issue in April 2021 somewhat offset by the 600 million euros reimbursement of a euro bond in October 2021. The blended cost of gross debt was 1.5% as at February 28  2022  which is slightly lower than the rate at the end of February and August 2021 of 1.6%.The tax charge was up strongly at 136 million euros due to the very significant increase in the pre-tax profit. However  the effective tax rate fell below 30%  back to a more regular rate at 28.3%  compared to 63% in the previous year.The share of profit of other companies accounted for using the equity method was 2 million euros in First half Fiscal 2022  compared to 2 million euros in the preceding year. Profit attributed to non-controlling interests was 11 million euros compared to the previous year amount of 2 million euros.As a result  First half Fiscal 2022 Group Net Profit was multiplied by 10 to 337 million euros  compared to 33 million euros in the previous year. Underlying Net Profit adjusted for Other Operating income and expenses net of tax amounted to 339 million euros  compared to 128 million euros in the previous year  up +164.8%.2.6 Earnings per sharePublished First half Fiscal 2022 EPS was 2.30 euros against 0.23 euro in the previous year. The weighted average number of shares for Fiscal 2022 was more or less stable at 146 292 627 compared to 146 001 603 shares for First half Fiscal 2021.Underlying EPS amounted to 2.32 euros  up +165.3% compared to the previous year.3 Consolidated financial position3.1 Cash flowsCash flows for the period were as follows:(in millions of euros) H1 Fiscal 2022 H2 Fiscal 2021 Operating cash flow 674 405 Change in working capital excluding change in BRS financial assets (1) (481) 41 IFRS 16 outflow (109) (123) Net capital expenditure (159) (86) Free cash flow (2) (75) 237 Net acquisitions (26) (10) Share buy-backs (13) (11) Dividends paid to shareholders (294) — Other changes (including scope and exchange rates) (156) (28) (Increase)/decrease in net debt (564) 187(1) Excluding change in financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity of 67 million euros in Fiscal 2022 versus -42 million euros in Fiscal 2021. Total change in working capital as reported in consolidated accounts: in Fiscal 2022: -414 million euros = -481 million euros + 67million euros and in Fiscal 2021: -1 million euros = 41 million euros - 42 million euros.(2) The Group does not believe the accounting treatment introduced by IFRS 16 modifies the operating nature of its lease transactions. Accordingly  to ensure the Group’s performance measures continue to best reflect its operating performance  the Group considers repayments of lease liabilities as operating items impacting the Free cash flow  which integrates all lease payments (fixed or variable). To be consistent  the lease liabilities are not included in Net debt (treated as operating items).First half Fiscal 2022 Free cash outflow was 75 million euros against an inflow of 237 million euros in the previous period.First half Fiscal 2022 Operating cash flow improved to 674 million euros against 405 million euros in the previous period as a result of the significant improvement in the operating profit of the Group. On the other hand  working capital deteriorated significantly with an outflow of cash of 481 million euros during the First half Fiscal 2022. This was exceptionally high due to the 37 million euros cash effect of the restructuring costs  the unwinding of the government Covid-linked payment delays for 100 million euros  reimbursement of the Tokyo Olympics hospitality packages for 55 million euros  an exceptional cash contribution to the UK pension fund for 71 million euros and a 7 million euros net cash inflow for Benefits & Rewards Services resulting from the Hungarian indemnity related to closing the business  which is offset by the fine related to the dispute with the French competition authorities which is being paid monthly.Net capital expenditure  including client investments  at 159 million euro  or 1.5% of revenues  increased year on year from the exceptionally low level of 86 million euros in the previous year.While contract-linked capital expenditure in some segments has continued to be delayed due to the effect of the pandemic  IT investment is maintained  and the digitization of Benefits & Rewards Services continues. Given the Group's mix of segments and geographies  and in a normal environment  this rate should be running at around 2.5% of annual revenues.Given the number of completed disposals since the beginning of the year  the cash impact of acquisitions net of disposals amounted to 26 million euros.The resumption of the payment of a dividend on Fiscal 2021 earnings resulted in an outflow of 294 million euros.After taking into account Other changes  consolidated net debt increased by 564 million euros during the First half to 2 042 million euros at February 28  2022.3.2 Acquisitions and disposals for the periodFirst half Fiscal 2022 has been an active period for closing numerous disposals of non-core activities and geographies:The On-site Services activities in MoroccoThe Lido in FranceNon-strategic account portfolios in Australia  Czech RepublicBenefits & Rewards Services in RussiaBenefits & Rewards Services sports cards in Romania and SpainThe Global Childcare activities and the Onsite Services business in the Congo were completed mid-March.On the other hand  further strategic acquisitions & investments have also been made:In the New Food Model  we have acquired Frontline Food Services  North America  and increased our participation in the digital food services company  Meican  ChinaIn the GPO space  we have made two investments to strengthen the position of Entegra in EuropeIn the Healthcare segment  we have a acquired a technical equipment management activity in China.3.3 Condensed consolidated statement of financial position at February 28  2022(in millions of euros) FEBRUARY 28  2022 FEBRUARY 28  2021 (in millions of euros) FEBRUARY 28  2022 FEBRUARY 28  2021 Non-current assets 10 063 9 766 Shareholders’ equity 3 615 2 917 Current assets excluding cash 5 980 4 943 Non-controlling interests 10 15 Restricted cash Benefits & Rewards 782 795 Non-current liabilities 7 129 6 238 Financial assetsBenefits & Rewards 221 342 Current liabilities 8 899 8 886 Cash 2 607 2 210 TOTAL ASSETS 19 653 18 056 TOTAL LIABILITIESAND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY 19 653 18 056 Borrowings 5 647 5 005 Net debt 2 042 1 681 Gearing 56% 57% Net debt ratio 1.8x 3.8xThe increase in shareholders’ equity was due to several factors: the currency translation adjustment of some currencies such as US Dollar  UK Sterling and the Brazilian real  as well as the revaluation of financial assets under IFRS 9.As of February 28  2022  net debt was 2 042 million euros  representing a gearing of 56%  and a net debt ratio of 1.8x  firmly within the target range of between 1 and 2x.In October 2021  Sodexo reimbursed by anticipation a 600 million euros bond due to mature in January 2022.As a result  at February 28  2022  the Group's gross debt amounted to 5.6 billion euros  of which 94% is at fixed rates and 21% is dollar-denominated  with an average maturity of 5.2 years and 100% covenant-free.Operating cash reached a total of 3 605 million euros  including 782 million euros of restricted cash and 221 million euros of financial assets of Benefits & Rewards Services.The Benefits & Rewards Services activity asset to liability coverage is at 114% compared to 113% as at February 28  2021  with operating cash of 2 442 million euros and client receivables of 1 600 million euros  compared to voucher liabilities payable of 3 556 million euros.The rest of the Group also had a significant operating cash position of 1 163 million euros.At the end of the First half  the Group had unused credit lines totaled 1.7 billion euros and total liquidity was 5.3 billion euros.3.4 Subsequent eventsThe operation to combine the Group's Childcare activities with those of the Grandir group  announced in July 2021  has been approved by the competition authorities.

342 (1 263) 2 917 15 2 9322 Notes to the consolidated financial statementsSodexo is a société anonyme (a form of limited liability company) registered in France  with its headquarters located in Issy-les-Moulineaux.Sodexo’s condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six-month period from September 1  2021  to February 28  2022  were approved by the Board of Directors on March 31  2022.The numbers shown in the tables were prepared in thousands of euros and are presented in millions of euros (unless otherwise indicated).Note 1.Significant events1 Impact of the Covid-19 pandemicAfter a strong recovery in the first quarter of the year in Sports & Leisure  Business Services and Education  the trend reversed slightly in January due to Omicron  particularly in Business Services due to a return to full teleworking in many countries and the number of sick students and teachers in schools and universities. The spread of the Omicron variant has also led to increased absenteeism in some countries  necessitating additional costs to ensure continuity of service. However  profitability continued to improve across all segments and regions.Management of liquidityWith sufficient cash flows provided by operating activities for investments and acquisitions  the Group’s financial situation remains solid.In addition  as mentioned in note 8.4  the Group has access to credit facilities that can be utilized at any time as needed for 1.7 billion euros (the confirmed credit facilities are undrawn as of February 28  2022). Furthermore  with operating cash of 3.6 billion euros  the Group has access to 5.3 billion euros of liquidity as of February 28  2022.Therefore  as of the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements by the Board of Directors  the Group considers there is no risk of going concern.2 Impacts of the Ukraine warThe Sodexo Group has no subsidiary in Ukraine. The Group operates in Russia but given the limited size of its operations (less than 1% of Group revenue and Underlying operating profit)  the Group does not expect material impacts in its consolidated financial statements.Note 2.Accounting policies1 Basis of preparation of the financial statements1.1 Basis of preparation of financial information for Fiscal 2022The condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended February 28  2022  have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ""Interim Financial Reporting""  as published by the IASB and endorsed by the European Union. They do not include all the disclosures required for a complete set of annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Sodexo Group for the fiscal year ended August 31  2021.The accounting policies applied by the Group in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended February 28  2022 are the same as those used in the annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 31  2021  with the exception of the specific requirements of IAS 34 (see note 2.2) and of the accounting principles impacted by the IFRS Interpretation Committee relating to IAS 19 ""Employee benefits"" (see note 2.1.2). The other texts effective as of September 1  2021  did not have a material impact on interim consolidated financial statements of the Group.The Group has not applied any IFRSs that had not yet been approved by the European Union as of February 28  2022. The Group has not elected to early adopt any standards or interpretations whose application is not mandatory in Fiscal 2022.1.2 New accounting standards and interpretations required to be appliedThe application of the IFRS Interpretation Committee decision issued in April 2021 clarifying the calculation methods  in application of IAS 19 ""Employee benefits""  for certain commitments relating to defined benefit plans impacted the consolidated shareholder's equity as of September 1  2021  for 10 million euros after tax.In March 2021  the IFRS Interpretation Committee made final its decision providing details on the accounting for configuration and customization costs of SaaS (Software as a Service) type software. The impacts on consolidated financial statements of the Group of this decision is currently being analyzed.2 Specific interim reporting requirementsIncome tax expenseIncome tax expense (current and deferred) in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements is computed by applying an estimated average annual tax rate for the current fiscal year to each tax reporting entity's pre-tax profit for the first half of the year as adjusted  where applicable  for the tax effect of any specific events that may have occurred during the period. The resulting deferred tax charge or benefit is recognized in deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.Post-employment and other long-term employee benefitsThe expense for post-employment and other long-term employee benefits is computed as one half of the annual charge estimated as of August 31  2021. The actuarial projections are updated to take into account any material changes to assumptions or one-off impacts (discount rates  applicable legislation...) during the six-month period.3 Use of estimatesThe preparation of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements requires the management of Sodexo and its subsidiaries to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported for assets  liabilities and contingent liabilities as of the date of preparation of the financial statements  and of revenues and expenses for the period.These estimates and judgments are updated continuously based on past experience and on various other factors considered reasonable in view of the situation prevailing as of February 28  2022 and are the basis for the assessments of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities. Unpredictability generated by Covid-19 pandemic made the use of estimations and hypothesis a key factor in the establishment of the consolidated financial statements.Final amounts may differ substantially from these estimates if assumptions or circumstances change.Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions are the same as those described in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended August 31  2021 (valuation of current and non-current assets  assessment of deferred tax assets recoverability  valuation of financial assets measured at fair value  provisions – including uncertain tax treatments – and litigations  assessment of the lease term in measuring the lease liabilities and related right-of-use assets  post-employment defined benefit plan assets and liabilities  and share-based payments).Note 3.Main changes in scope of consolidation1 Business combinationsDuring the First Half Fiscal 2022  goodwill totaling 129 million euros was recognized  mainly on the acquisition of Frontline Food Services in the United States of America in February 2022 for On-site Services and Wedoogift goodwill adjustment in France for Benefits & Rewards Services.The remaining goodwill change corresponds to exchange rates differences.The table below shows the impact of newly consolidated entities. It includes the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as provisionally estimated as of February 28  2022:(in millions of euros) FEBRUARY 28  2022 Intangible assets 1 Property  plant and equipment 33 Financial assets 2 Trade receivables 39 Cash and cash equivalents 67 Income tax payable — Trade and other payables (110) Net deferred tax — TOTAL IDENTIFIABLE NET ASSETS 34 CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED (1) 163 GOODWILL (2) 129(1) Including 55 million euros increase during corresponding to the increase of liabilities recognized in connection with written put options over non-controlling interests in certain subsidiaries.(2) Goodwill is recognized as the difference between acquisition price and identifiable net assets at fair value. It principally represents the savoir-faire and expertise of employees and synergies expected from acquired companies.Business combinations impacts the Cash flow statement as follows:Price paid during the period (109) Cash acquired 68 Business combinations (41)Companies consolidated during the First Half Fiscal 2022 were integrated from the date of acquisition and contributed for 6 million euros to consolidated revenue and for 1 million euros to the consolidated underlying operating profit of the period.2 Disposed or held for sales activitiesThe Group continued its portfolio rationalization by disposing a certain number of activities  resulting in a net loss on disposal of 1 million euros recognized in ""Other operating income and expenses"" during the First Half Fiscal 2022 (see note 4.2.2 ""Other operating income and expenses"").Assets and liabilities classified as “Assets held for sale” for 331 million euros and “Liabilities directly associated with assets held for sale” for 177 million euros mainly concern Childcare activities in France and in Spain  for which the Group has announced on July 27  2021  to have entered exclusive negotiations in relation with their disposal with the group Grandir. The transaction closed in March 2022 (see note 9.5 ""Subsequent events""). As the fair value of the assets held for sale is higher than the carrying value  no impairment has been recorded for these assets in the consolidated financial statements as of February 28  2022.Note 4.Segment information and other operating items1 Segment informationThe segment information presented below has been prepared based on internal management data as monitored by the Group Executive Committee  which is Sodexo’s chief operating decision-maker: On-site Services and Benefits & Rewards Services.For On-site Services  Revenue and Underlying operating profit are followed by global client segments. These global client segments meet the definition of operating segments in IFRS 8.Sodexo’s operating segments and groups of operating segments are as follows:On-site Services: Business & Administrations  which includes Corporate Services  Energy & Resources  Government & Agencies  Sports & Leisure and other non-segmented activities  Healthcare  combined with Seniors  Education  comprising Schools and Universities;Benefits & Rewards Services.The operating segments that have been aggregated carry out similar operations – both in terms of type of services rendered and the processes and methods used to deliver the services – and have similar economic characteristics (notably in terms of the margins they generate).Segment assets and liabilities are not presented as they are not included in the chief operating decision-maker’s measurement of segment performance.No single Group client or contract accounts contribute for more than 2% of the consolidated revenues.1.1 By business segmentFIRST HALF FISCAL 2022(in millions of euros) ON-SITE SERVICES BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATIONS HEALTHCARE & SENIORS EDUCATION BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES ELIMINATIONSAND CORPORATE EXPENSES GROUP TOTAL Revenues (third-party) 9 865 5 160 2 675 2 030 397 — 10 262 Inter-segment sales (Group) — — — — 1 (1) — TOTAL REVENUES 9 865 5 160 2 675 2 030 398 (1) 10 262 Underlying operating profit* 481 138 171 172 106 (50) 538* Including Group’s share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method that directly contribute to the Group’s business and excluding other operating income and expenses.FIRST HALF FISCAL 2021(in millions of euros) ON-SITE SERVICES BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATIONS HEALTHCARE & SENIORS EDUCATION BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES ELIMINATIONSAND CORPORATE EXPENSES GROUP TOTAL Revenues (third-party) 8 238 4 280 2 338 1 620 357 — 8 595 Inter-segment sales (Group) — — — — 2 (2) — TOTAL REVENUES 8 238 4 280 2 338 1 620 359 (2) 8 595 Underlying operating profit* 235 16 149 69 85 (55) 265* Including Group’s share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method that directly contribute to the Group’s business and excluding other operating income and expenses.1.2 By significant countryThe Group’s operations are spread across 55 countries  including three that each represent over 10% of consolidated revenues in First Half Fiscal 2022: France (the Group’s registration country)  the United States and the United Kingdom.

The Group has also analyzed the evolution since August 31  2021  of the main financial parameters (discount rate and long-term growth rate).Despite the uncertainty around the evolution of the pandemic  the Group’s management has concluded that there was no evidence of triggers indicating a decrease in the recoverable value of its operating segments as of February 28  2022  compared to August 31  2021. The annual review of the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets will be realized during the Second Half Fiscal 2022.Note 6.Provisions  litigation  and contingent liabilities1 Provisions(in millions of euros) AUGUST 31  2021 INCREASES/CHARGES REVERSALS WITH UTILIZATION REVERSALS WITHOUT UTILIZATION CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT AND OTHER CHANGES IN SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION FEBRUARY 28  2022 Reorganization costs 67 2 (31) (4) — 0 34 Employee claims and litigation 56 7 (6) (6) 1 0 53 Tax and social security exposures 30 1 (1) — 1 — 32 Contract termination and loss-making contracts 27 3 (7) (4) 1 — 20 Client/supplier claims and litigation 23 16 (6) — — — 33 Negative net assets of associates (1) 6 — — — 0 — 7 Other provisions 45 3 (1) (2) 1 0 46 TOTAL PROVISIONS 254 34 (51) (17) 5 — 225(1) Investments in companies accounted for using the equity method that have negative net assets.Provisions for exposures and litigation are determined on a case-by-case basis and rely on management’s best estimate of the outflows deemed likely to satisfy legal or implicit obligations to which the Group is exposed as of the end of the fiscal year.2 Litigation and contingent liabilitiesDisputes with the Brazilian tax authoritiesThe Group is in dispute with the Brazilian tax authorities regarding the tax deductibility of the amortization of goodwill recognized on the purchase of VR in March 2008. For the record  in Fiscal year 2017  Sodexo Pass do Brasil received a tax reassessment notice from the Brazilian tax authorities for fiscal years 2010  2011 and 2012 relating to the deductibility for tax purposes of the amortization of goodwill recognized on the purchase of VR in March 2008. The reassessment amounted to 93 million euros (breaking down as 25 million euros in principal and 68 million euros in penalties and late payment interest).Sodexo Pass do Brasil is firmly disputing this reassessment  which the Brazilian tax authorities originally envisaged during a previous tax audit covering fiscal years 2008 and 2009 but then abandoned. The Group considers that the goodwill amortization was valid  both in terms of its underlying reasons and the way it has been recorded. Therefore  the Group considers that there is a strong probability of winning the dispute with the tax authorities  and this has been confirmed by its tax advisors. Consequently  no provision was recorded for this dispute in the statement of financial position as of August 31  2017.This dispute was presented on August 14  2018  for a judgment of the competent administrative court. The court ruled in favor of Sodexo Pass do Brasil as it considered that the goodwill and corresponding tax amortization were legitimately recognized on the acquisition of VR. The judgment therefore confirms that Sodexo Pass do Brasil acquired a full business structure when it purchased VR.This judgment can be reversed on appeal. The Group believes  after consulting its advisors  that the risk of change in this judgement is low.The tax savings generated by this tax depreciation were offset in the combined accounts of the Group by a deferred tax expense of the same amount for each of the financial periods concerned  in accordance with the IFRS rules. The deferred tax liability related to the reassessed periods amounts to 25 million euros as of First Half Fiscal 2022 (24 million euros as of August 31  2021).Dispute with the French competition authorityOn October 9  2015  the company Octoplus filed a complaint with the French Competition Authority (Autorité de la concurrence) concerning several French meal voucher issuers  including Sodexo Pass France. Following the hearing of the parties concerned in April and July 2016  the Competition Authority decided on October 6  2016  to continue the proceedings  without ordering interim measures against Sodexo Pass France.On February 27  2019  the prosecution services sent their final investigation report to Sodexo Pass France. In its response filed on April 29  2019  the Group contested both of the grievances notified by the Authority (exchange of information and foreclosure of the meal voucher market through the Centrale de Règlement des Titres). On December 17  2019  the French Competition Authority ruled against the meal voucher issuers and fined Sodexo Pass France  jointly and severally with Sodexo S.A.  126 million euros. This decision was formally notified to Sodexo Pass France and Sodexo S.A. on February 6  2020. Sodexo vigorously contests this decision considering that it demonstrates a flawed understanding of the practices in question and of the way in which the market operates. Sodexo has therefore lodged an appeal against the decision with the Paris Court of Appeal. The hearing was held on November 18  2021  and the Court of Appeal is expected to render its decision on November 24  2022. Given the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Group's activities and performance  Sodexo obtained a decision from the State collection services allowing it to defer payment of the fine until December 15  2021  without any penalty being due  subject to providing a bank guarantee  and from that date a monthly settlement plan until the decision of the Court of Appeal.Dispute in HungaryFollowing legislative and regulatory changes to the issuance of food and meal voucher market in Hungary  Sodexo made an application to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in July 2014 for arbitration proceedings to be commenced against the Hungarian state.The ICSID issued its decision on January 28  2019  ordering the Hungarian State to pay compensation in an amount of 73 million euros to Sodexo  together with accrued interest from December 31  2011.On May 27  2019  the Hungarian State lodged an appeal against this decision  which was rejected by the ICSID on May 7  2021  thereby definitively confirming its decision of January 28  2019  and the obligation of the Hungarian state to compensate Sodexo in accordance with international law.The Hungarian State paid an indemnity in an amount of 33.5 million euros to Sodexo Pass International on December 31  2021  in consideration of the prejudice caused as a result of the expropriation by the Hungarian state of Sodexo Pass International’s investment in Hungary further to the legislative and regulatory changes implemented by the Hungarian State in the issuance of food and meal voucher market in Hungary.This payment definitively puts an end to the dispute between them with regard to the ICSID arbitration award. An income of 33.5 million euros has been recognized accordingly in other operating income in First Half Fiscal 2022 (see note 4.2.2 Other operating income and expenses)French tax reassessmentSodexo S.A. received in December 2021 a notification for proposed tax reassessments concerning Fiscal 2016  Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018. After review with its tax advisors  the Company considers that it has strong arguments to contest the major part of the proposed reassessments.Other disputesGroup subsidiaries can also be subject to tax audits certain of which may result in reassessments.

This shareholding does not give the Group significant influence over Bellon SA  as voting rights attached to Bellon SA shares cannot be exercised by Sofinsod  in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 233-31 of Code de Commerce.In accordance with IFRS 9  this investment is measured at its fair value  determined in accordance with IFRS 13. The valuation of the fair value of the investment depends  among other things  on the revalued net asset value (NAV) of Bellon SA which has limited debt and holds no assets other than shares of Sodexo S.A. These shares are valued at their closing share price for the calculation of the NAV of Bellon SA. Furthermore  the valuation method used by management (Level 3 of the hierarchy defined by IFRS 13) incorporates the illiquidity implied by the characteristics of the holding's ownership structure (discount to net asset value of Bellon SA estimated at 40% as of February 28  2022  and August 31  2021).As of February 28  2022  the fair value of the investment is assessed at 533 million euros (481 million euros as of August 31  2021)  and its change since the opening of the year has been recorded in other non-recyclable items of comprehensive income (OCI).Restricted cash and financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activityRestricted cash corresponds to 782 million euros of “Financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity” primarily in funds set aside to comply with regulations governing the issuance of service vouchers in France (256 million euros)  Romania (94 million euros)  Belgium (181 million euros)  India (110 million euros) and China (70 million euros).

April 1  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- UCB today announced that new data from its expansive and innovative neurology portfolio will be presented at the 74th American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting  from April 2-7  2022.Twelve scientific abstracts have been accepted including data from UCB's epilepsy portfolio and Parkinson's disease development program.""At UCB  we are inspired to develop new solutions that help transform the lives of people living with severe neurological disorders. Our world-class scientists make this ambition possible  advancing our understanding of human biology and driving breakthroughs in areas of science "" said Charl van Zyl  Executive Vice President Neurology & Head of Europe/International Markets at UCB. ""We are excited to showcase the scale and passion of our commitment at AAN  building on our legacy and expertise in epilepsy  myasthenia gravis  and Parkinson's disease.""EpilepsyAt the congress  UCB will be reporting data from several significant clinical epilepsy studies from its broad epilepsy portfolio. Notably  these data include real-world  retrospective  interim evidence evaluating the effectiveness and tolerability of brivaracetam for adult patients with partial-onset seizures  in routine clinical practice in a large multicenter international patient population as well as prospective U.S. RWE data. In the U.S.  brivaracetam is approved for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older.2Additionally  presented data will evaluate dose-response relationships for the impact of fenfluramine on everyday executive function in patients  as captured using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF®). In the U.S.  fenfluramine is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.1Data will also summarize the early use of midazolam nasal spray in patients with seizure clusters. In the U.S.  midazolam nasal spray is indicated for the acute treatment of intermittent  stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e.  seizure clusters  acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient's usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older.5 Please see IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION  including Boxed Warning  below.Two podium presentations will also be taking place during the congress  highlighting the long-term evidence of the cardiovascular safety profile of fenfluramine. Please note that fenfluramine is available only through the REMS Program due to the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

BRIVIACT was approved as monotherapy for adults in September 2017   and as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in patients four years of age and older with partial-onset seizures in 2018. In August 2021   BRIVIACT was approved for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients as young as one month of age. BRIVIACT is available in three formulations: oral tablets  oral solution  and intravenous (IV) injection. More information is available at [email protected] : FDA-Approved Drugs.BRIVIACT IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSSuicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs  including BRIVIACT  increase the risk of suicidal behavior and ideation.

Advise patients to report these symptoms immediately to a healthcare provider. Hypersensitivity: BRIVIACT can cause hypersensitivity reactions. Bronchospasm and angioedema have been reported. Discontinue BRIVIACT if a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction after treatment. BRIVIACT is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to brivaracetam or any of the inactive ingredients.BRIVIACT can cause hypersensitivity reactions. Bronchospasm and angioedema have been reported. Discontinue BRIVIACT if a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction after treatment. BRIVIACT is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to brivaracetam or any of the inactive ingredients. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with all antiepileptic drugs  BRIVIACT should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn adult adjunctive therapy placebo-controlled clinical trials  the most common adverse reactions (at least 5% for BRIVIACT and at least 2% more frequently than placebo) were somnolence and sedation  dizziness  fatigue  and nausea and vomiting symptoms. Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies of pediatric patients were generally similar to those in adult patients. Adverse reactions with BRIVIACT injection in adult and pediatric patients were generally similar to those observed with BRIVIACT tablets. Other adverse events that occurred in adult patients who received BRIVIACT injection included dysgeusia  euphoric mood  feeling drunk  and infusion site pain.BRIVIACT is a Schedule V controlled substance.Please refer to the full U.S. Prescribing Information and visit www.BRIVIACThcp.com.Important Safety Information about BRIVIACT® in the EU and EEA3BRIVIACT® (brivaracetam) is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy. Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance  other pyrrolidone derivatives or any of the excipients. Special warnings and precautions for use Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in several indications  including BRIVIACT®. Patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviour and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers) should be advised to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. BRIVIACT® film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance  total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take BRIVIACT®. Brivaracetam film-coated tablets  solution for injection/infusion and oral solution contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per tablet/vial/ml respectively  that is to say essentially 'sodium free'. The oral solution contains 168 mg sorbitol (E420) in each ml. Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take this medicinal product. The oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218)  which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). Brivaracetam oral solution contains propylene glycol (E1520). Posology No dose adjustment is needed in adults with impaired renal function. Based on data in adults  no dose adjustment is necessary neither in paediatric patients with impaired renal function. No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with renal impairment. In patients with hepatic impairment  the following adjusted doses  administered in 2 divided doses  approximately 12 hours apart  are recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment: In adults  adolescents and children weighing ≥50 kg  a 50 mg/day starting dose is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 150 mg/day. For adolescents and children weighing from 20 kg to <50 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day starting dose is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 3 mg/kg/day. For children weighing from 10 kg to <20 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day starting dose is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 4 mg/kg/day. No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with hepatic impairment.Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction. With co-administration of BRIVIACT® 200 mg single dose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy subjects there was no pharmacokinetic interaction  but the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function  attention and memory was doubled. Intake of BRIVIACT® with alcohol is not recommended. Limited clinical data are available implying that coadministration of cannabidiol may increase the plasma exposure of brivaracetam  possibly through CYP2C19 inhibition  but the clinical relevance is uncertain. In healthy subjects  co-administration with rifampicin  a strong enzyme-inducer (600 mg/day for 5 days)  decreased BRIVIACT® area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by 45%. Prescribers should consider adjusting the dose of BRIVIACT® for patients starting or ending treatment with rifampicin. Other strong enzyme-inducers (such as St John´s wort [Hypericum perforatum]) may also decrease the systemic exposure of BRIVIACT®. Therefore  starting or ending treatment with St John's wort should be done with caution. In vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms except for CYP2C19. Brivaracetam may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g.  lansoprazole  omeprazole  diazepam). CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and BRIVIACT® may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 (e.g. efavirenz). In vitro studies have also shown that BRIVIACT® has inhibitory effects on OAT3. BRIVIACT® 200 mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products transported by OAT3. BRIVIACT® plasma concentrations are decreased when co-administered with strong enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine  phenobarbital  phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required. Effects on ability to drive and use machines BRIVIACT®  has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of BRIVIACT®  on their ability to perform such activities. Undesirable effects. The most frequently reported adverse reactions with BRIVIACT® (reported by >10% of patients) were somnolence (14.3%) and dizziness (11.0%). They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Somnolence and fatigue were reported at higher incidences with increasing dose. Very common adverse reactions (≥1% to <10%) were influenza  decreased appetite  depression  anxiety  insomnia  irritability  convulsion  vertigo  upper respiratory tract infections  cough  nausea  vomiting  constipation and fatigue. Neutropenia has been reported in 0.5% (6/1 099) BRIVIACT® patients and 0% (0/459) placebo-treated patients. Four of these patients had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline  and experienced additional decrease in neutrophil counts after initiation of BRIVIACT®. None of the six cases were severe  required any specific treatment  led to BRIVIACT® discontinuation or had associated infections. Suicidal ideation was reported in 0.3 % (3/1099) of BRIVIACT® treated patients and 0.7 % (3/459) of placebo-treated patients. In short-term clinical studies of BRIVIACT® in patients with epilepsy  there were no cases of completed suicide and suicide attempt  however both were reported in the long-term open-label extension studies. Reactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of BRIVIACT® patients (9/3022) during clinical development. The safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children from 1 month of age was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. In the open label  uncontrolled  long-term studies suicidal ideation was reported in 4.7 % of paediatric patients assessed from 6 years onwards (more common in adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioural disorders were reported in 24.8 % of paediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority of events were mild or moderate in intensity  were non-serious  and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. An additional adverse reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity (4.7 %). No specific pattern of adverse event (AE) was identified in children from 1 month to < 4 years of age when compared to older paediatric age groups. No significant safety information was identified indicating the increasing incidence of a particular AE in this age group. As data available in children younger than 2 years of age are limited  brivaracetam is not indicated in this age range. No clinical data are available in neonates. Overdose There is limited clinical experience with BRIVIACT® overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness were reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1 400 mg of BRIVIACT®. The following adverse reactions were reported with brivaracetam overdose: nausea  vertigo  balance disorder  anxiety  fatigue  irritability  aggression  insomnia  depression  and suicidal ideation in the post-marketing experience. In general  the adverse reactions associated with brivaracetam overdose were consistent with the known adverse reactions. There is no specific antidote. Treatment of an overdose should include general supportive measures. Since less than 10% of BRIVIACT® is excreted in urine  haemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance BRIVIACT® clearance.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information. Date of revision: 24 February 2022http://www.ema.europa.eu/About FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine)Important Safety Information about FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) oral solution  CIV in the U.S.1INDICATIONS AND USAGEFINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5–HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSAdministration to patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact Zogenix Inc. at 1-866-964-3649 (1-866-Zogenix) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.Important Safety Information about FINTEPLA® in the EU and EEA4ContraindicationsHypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

In the controlled clinical studies of fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome  no valvular heart disease was observed.Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to establish a baseline prior to initiating treatment (see section 4.3) and exclude any pre-existing valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension.Echocardiogram monitoring should be conducted every 6 months for the first 2 years and annually thereafter. If an echocardiogram indicates pathological valvular changes  a follow-up echocardiogram should be considered at an earlier timeframe to evaluate whether the abnormality is persistent. If pathological abnormalities on the echocardiogram are observed  it is recommended to evaluate the benefit versus risk of continuing fenfluramine treatment with the prescriber  caregiver  and cardiologist.If treatment is stopped because of aortic or mitral valvular heart disease  appropriate monitoring and follow-up should be provided in accordance with local guidelines for the treatment of aortic or mitral valvular heart disease.With past use in higher doses to treat adult obesity  fenfluramine was reported to be associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pulmonary arterial hypertension was not observed in the clinical programme  but because of the low incidence of this disease  the clinical trial experience with fenfluramine is inadequate to determine if fenfluramine increases the risk for pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with Dravet syndrome.If echocardiogram findings are suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension  a repeat echocardiogram should be performed as soon as possible and within 3 months to confirm these findings. If the echocardiogram finding is confirmed suggestive of an increased probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension defined as ""intermediate probability"" by the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines  it should lead to a benefit-risk evaluation of continuation of Fintepla by the prescriber  carer  and cardiologist. If the echocardiogram finding  after confirmation  suggests of a high probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension  as defined by the 2015 ESC and ERS Guidelines  it is recommended fenfluramine treatment should be stopped.Decreased appetite and weight lossFenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss (see section 4.8). An additive effect on decreased appetite can occur when fenfluramine is combined with other anti-epileptic medicines  for example stiripentol. The decrease in weight appears to be dose related. Most subjects resumed weight gain over time while continuing treatment. The patient's weight should be monitored. A benefit risk evaluation should be undertaken prior to commencing treatment with fenfluramine in patients with a history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.Fintepla controlled access programmeA controlled access programme has been created to 1) prevent off-label use in weight management in obese patients and 2) confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla.SomnolenceFenfluramine can cause somnolence.Other central nervous system depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate the somnolence effect of fenfluramine (see sections 4.5 and 4.7).Suicidal behaviour and ideationSuicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicines in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials with anti-epileptic medicines that did not include fenfluramine has shown a small increased risk of suicidal behaviour and ideation. The mechanism of this risk is not known  and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for fenfluramine. Patients and caregivers of patients should be advised to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation emerge.Serotonin syndromeAs with other serotonergic agents  serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with fenfluramine treatment  particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents (including SSRIs  SNRIs  tricyclic antidepressants  or triptans); with agents that impair metabolism of serotonin such as MAOIs; or with antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular aberrations (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhoea).If concomitant treatment with fenfluramine and other serotonergic agents that may affect the serotonergic systems is clinically warranted  careful observation of the patient is advised  particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.Increased seizure frequencyAs with other anti-epileptic medicines  a clinically relevant increase in seizure frequency may occur during treatment with fenfluramine  which may require adjustment in the dose of fenfluramine and/or concomitant anti-epileptic medicines  or discontinuation of fenfluramine  should the benefit-risk be negative.CyproheptadineCyproheptadine is a potent serotonin receptor antagonist and may therefore decrease the efficacy of fenfluramine. If cyproheptadine is added to treatment with fenfluramine  patients should be monitored for worsening of seizures. If fenfluramine treatment is initiated in a patient taking cyproheptadine  fenfluramine's efficacy may be reduced.GlaucomaFenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Discontinue therapy in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity. Consider discontinuation if there is ocular pain and another cause cannot be determined.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducersCo-administration with strong CYP1A2 inducers or CYP2B6 inducers may decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations (see section 4.5).An increase in fenfluramine dosage should be considered when co-administered with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer; the maximum daily dose should not be exceeded.ExcipientsThis medicinal product contains sodium ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 219) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).It also contains sulfur dioxide (E 220) which may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm.Patients with rare glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per the maximum daily dose of 12 mL  that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.This medicinal product contains glucose which may be harmful to the teeth.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information. Date of revision: 04 Nov 2021.https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/fintepla-epar-product-information_en.pdfThis medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.About NAYZILAM® (midazolam) nasal spray  CIV in the U.S.5NAYZILAM is a benzodiazepine indicated for the acute treatment of intermittent  stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e.  seizure clusters  acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient's usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older.NAYZILAM IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSNAYZILAM is contraindicated in patients with acute narrow-angle glaucoma.RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDSConcomitant use of benzodiazepines  including NAYZILAM  and opioids may result in profound sedation  respiratory depression  coma  and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.ABUSE  MISUSE  AND ADDICTIONThe use of benzodiazepines  including NAYZILAM  exposes users to risks of abuse  misuse  and addiction  which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications  alcohol  and/or illicit substances  which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing NAYZILAM and throughout treatment  assess each patient's risk for abuse  misuse  and addiction.DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS AFTER USE OF NAYZILAM MORE FREQUENTLY THAN RECOMMENDEDThe continued use of benzodiazepines may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Although NAYZILAM is indicated only for intermittent use  if used more frequently than recommended  abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of NAYZILAM may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions  which can be life-threatening. For patients using NAYZILAM more frequently than recommended  to reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions  use a gradual taper to discontinue NAYZILAM.Risks of Cardiorespiratory Adverse ReactionsSerious cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have occurred after administration of midazolam. Warn patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression  cardiac and respiratory arrest.Respiratory depression was observed with the administration of NAYZILAM during clinical trials. Cardiac or respiratory arrest caused by NAYZILAM was not reported during clinical trials.Central Nervous System Depression from Concomitant Use with Other Central Nervous System Depressants  or Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 InhibitorsDrug products containing midazolam  including NAYZILAM  have a central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect.Risks from Concomitant Use with Other CNS DepressantsNAYZILAM may cause an increased CNS-depressant effect when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants (e.g.  opioids). Warn patients and caregivers that the use of NAYZILAM in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs may increase the risk of hypoventilation  airway obstruction  desaturation  or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect.Risks from Concomitant Use with Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 InhibitorsConcomitant use of NAYZILAM with moderate or strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors may result in prolonged sedation because of a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam. Caution patients against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness  such as operating machinery  driving a motor vehicle or riding a bicycle until they have completely returned to their level of baseline functioning.Suicidal Behavior and IdeationAntiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including NAYZILAM  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Monitor patients treated with NAYZILAM for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behavior  and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Advise patients and caregivers to be alert for these behavioral changes and to immediately report them to the healthcare provider.Impaired Cognitive FunctionMidazolam  including NAYZILAM  is associated with a high incidence of partial or complete impairment of recall for several hours following an administered dose. Counsel patients on when they can engage in activities requiring complete mental alertness  operate hazardous machinery  or drive a motor vehicle after taking NAYZILAM.GlaucomaBenzodiazepines  including NAYZILAM  can increase intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. NAYZILAM may be used in patients with open-angle glaucoma only if they are receiving appropriate therapy. NAYZILAM is contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn the randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial  the most common adverse reactions (≥5% in any NAYZILAM treatment group) were somnolence  headache  nasal discomfort  throat irritation  and rhinorrhea.NAYZILAM is a Schedule IV controlled substance.Please refer to the full Prescribing Information.For additional medical information about NAYZILAM  patient assistance  or any other information please visit our website or call UCBCares® at 1-844-599-2273.About UCB0599UCB0599 is an orally administered  brain penetrant  small molecule inhibitor of ASYN misfolding under investigation for the potential use as a disease-modifying treatment to slow the progression of PD.6 7 UCB0599 was discovered by NeuroPore and was licenced to UCB in 2014 for further development.6 In 2021  UCB entered into a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Novartis covering UCB0599.8For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.9414[email protected]Corporate CommunicationsCorporate CommunicationsLaurent Schots  Media RelationsT+32.2.559.9264[email protected]Nick FrancisT +44 7769 307745[email protected]Allyson Funk (U.S. Media)T +678 365 6321[email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces new data from the pivotal Phase II/III trial of leniolisib for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS)  a primary immunodeficiency. Principal Investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  shared the findings in a presentation at the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) 2022 Annual Meeting.As announced on February 2  2022  the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized  Phase III portion of the clinical trial  conducted by Novartis  met its co-primary endpoints  which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of naïve B cells are important in this population  as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers. Presented for the first time at CIS  the co-primary endpoints at day 85 after baseline demonstrated:In the index lymphadenopathy lesions  a statistically significant adjusted mean change in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) of -0.30 among patients who received leniolisib compared with -0.06 among patients who received placebo (95% CI: -0.37  -0.11; p=0.0012).From a baseline level of ˂48%  an increase of 34.76% in the proportion of naïve B cells in patients who received leniolisib versus a -5.37% decrease in patients who received placebo (95% CI: 28.51  51.75; p˂0.0001).The study drug was well-tolerated. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Charlotte Cunningham-Rundles  M.D.  Ph.D.  David S. Gottesman Professor of Immunology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York  said:""It is great news that leniolisib has achieved such positive results in this Phase III study in APDS. It is extremely encouraging to see that this medication is capable of targeting the cause of this difficult disease  both improving care and reducing patients' symptoms. Progress toward a treatment that is tailor-made for our patients with APDS is a milestone we have long awaited.""Pharming plans to begin submitting global regulatory filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""Pharming is delighted that leniolisib achieved significance in both co-primary endpoints and was well tolerated in these APDS patients  as the product's approval would address an unmet need for those with this rare disease  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. In addition to working closely with regulatory authorities across the globe to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients  we will continue to develop this treatment through our open-label extension study and two additional studies that will enroll children under the age of 12  as well as potentially extending the geographic reach of the product.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. is a global  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative protein replacement therapies and precision medicines for the treatment of rare diseases and unmet medical needs.The flagship of our portfolio is our recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) franchise. C1INH is a naturally occurring protein that down regulates the complement and contact cascades in order to control inflammation in affected tissues.Our lead product  RUCONEST®  is the first and only plasma-free rhC1INH protein replacement therapy. It is approved for the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks. We are commercializing RUCONEST® in the United States  the European Union and the United Kingdom through our own sales and marketing organization  and the rest of the world through our distribution network.In addition  we are investigating the clinical efficacy of rhC1INH in the treatment of further indications  including pre-eclampsia  acute kidney injury and severe pneumonia as a result of COVID-19 infections.We are also studying our oral precision medicine  leniolisib (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta  or PI3K delta  inhibitor)  for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome  or APDS. World-wide rights for leniolisib were licensed from Novartis AG in 2019. Leniolisib met both of its primary end points in a registration enabling Phase 2/3 study in the United States and Europe. We are targeting global regulatory filings for leniolisib from Q2 2022 onwards.Additionally  we entered into a strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex-vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of HAE.Furthermore  we are leveraging our transgenic manufacturing technology to develop next-generation protein replacement therapies  most notably for Pompe disease  which is currently in preclinical development.Forward-looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements  including with respect to timing and progress of Pharming's preclinical studies and clinical trials of its product candidates  Pharming's clinical and commercial prospects  Pharming's ability to overcome the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the conduct of its business  and Pharming's expectations regarding its projected working capital requirements and cash resources.

L’Oréal  Sanofi’s largest shareholder  has committed to a lock-up period of 1 year following the settlement of the Distribution  i.e.  May 10  2022Paris  April 1  2022. Sanofi announced today that the French Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) has approved the listing prospectus prepared by EUROAPI in connection with the intended listing of its shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris.On March 17th  2022  Sanofi’s Board of Directors unanimously decided to submit for approval to its shareholders the proposed distribution in kind (the “Distribution”) of EUROAPI shares  via an additional extraordinary dividend  exclusively in kind  in addition to the previously proposed €3.33 cash dividend per Sanofi share. The Distribution relates to circa 58% of the share capital and voting rights of EUROAPI. In connection with the proposed Distribution  EPIC Bpifrance has agreed to purchase 12% of EUROAPI shares1 from Sanofi  which confirmed its intention to hold circa 30% of the share capital and voting rights of the company after the Distribution.The Distribution by Sanofi to its shareholders of EUROAPI shares in the form of an additional extraordinary dividend  exclusively in kind  is subject to the shareholders’ approval at Sanofi’s May 3  2022 Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting.Subject to certain customary exceptions  the following lock-up periods have been agreed:2 years for Sanofi and EPIC Bpifrance following the settlement and delivery of the EUROAPI shares to be sold to EPIC Bpifrance; and1 year for L’Oréal  Sanofi’s largest shareholder and for Karl Rotthier  CEO of the Company  following the settlement of the Distribution.Main features of the Distribution are as follows:The Distribution ratio will be one (1) EUROAPI share per twenty three (23) Sanofi shares.No fractional EUROAPI shares will be issued. Any right to receive a fractional share will not be tradable or transferable. Consequently  when the amount of the Distribution to which a Sanofi shareholder is entitled does not correspond to a whole number of EUROAPI shares (i.e.  less than twenty three (23) or a multiple of twenty three (23) Sanofi shares)  the shareholder will receive the immediately lower number of EUROAPI shares  plus a cash payment for the whole of the balance arising from the price at which EUROAPI shares corresponding to fractional shares were sold. Each financial intermediary will sell the shares corresponding to the fractional shares of its entitled clients. As a result  the amount of the cash balance may vary depending on the shareholder’s financial intermediary;The technical reference price of EUROAPI shares is expected to be announced on May 5  2022 by Euronext Paris after market close;The admission to trading of the EUROAPI shares and the ex-date (détachement) of the Distribution will occur at 9.00 am (CET) on May 6  2022;The record date (the date on which positions are closed) for Sanofi shares to be eligible to the Distribution is scheduled on May 9  2022;Payment of the Distribution (delivery and book-entry of the allocated EUROAPI shares) will take place on May 10  2022.Following the Distribution and the purchase of 12% of EUROAPI shares by EPIC Bpifrance  the Sanofi group will no longer control EUROAPI  resulting in a slightly accretive impact on Sanofi 2022 business operating income (BOI) margin2.Documents related to Sanofi shareholders’ meeting will be made available on April 11  2022 on the Sanofi dedicated web page.Investors are invited to read EUROAPI’s press release  issued concurrently and available on EUROAPI’s website announcing the AMF’s approval of its prospectus  and the listing prospectus in order to fully understand the potential risks and rewards associated with any decision to invest in EUROAPI shares.

Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts. These statements include projections and estimates and their underlying assumptions  statements regarding plans  objectives  intentions and expectations with respect to future financial results  events  operations  services  product development and potential  and statements regarding future performance. Forward-looking statements are generally identified by the words “expects”  “anticipates”  “believes”  “intends”  “estimates”  “plans” and similar expressions. Although Sanofi’s management believes that the expectations reflected in such forward-looking statements are reasonable  investors are cautioned that forward-looking information and statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  many of which are difficult to predict and generally beyond the control of Sanofi  that could cause actual results and developments to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied or projected by  the forward-looking information and statements. These risks and uncertainties include among other things Sanofi’s and EUROAPI’s ability to benefit from external growth opportunities  to complete related transactions (notably the planned distribution of 58% of EUROAPI share capital and its listing on the regulated market of Euronext Paris) and/or obtain regulatory clearances  trends in exchange rates and prevailing interest rates  volatile economic and market conditions  cost containment initiatives and subsequent changes thereto  and the impact that COVID-19 and recent armed conflicts will have on us  our customers  suppliers  vendors  and other business partners  and the financial condition of any one of them  as well as on our employees and on the global economy as a whole. Any material effect of COVID-19 or recent armed conflicts on any of the foregoing could also adversely impact us. This situation is changing rapidly and additional impacts may arise of which we are not currently aware and may exacerbate other previously identified risks. The risks and uncertainties also include the uncertainties discussed or identified in the public filings with the SEC and the AMF made by Sanofi  including those listed under “Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” in Sanofi’s annual report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2021. Other than as required by applicable law  Sanofi does not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking information or statementsRoundingCertain calculated figures (including data expressed in thousands or millions) and percentages presented in this press release have been rounded. Where applicable  the totals presented in this this press release may slightly differ from the totals that would have been obtained by adding the exact amounts (not rounded) for these calculated figures.

It measures the total costs associated with operating a certain investment fund.According to Eric Balchunas  Bloomberg’s senior ETF analyst  the offering is poised to severely undercut Switzerland-based crypto ETP issuer 21Shares  which charges its investors a 2.5% management fee.Earlier this week  the Solana  Cardano and Polkadot ETPs were also launched on Zurich-based SIX Swiss Exchange and Frankfurt-based Xetra.Cryptocurrency ETPs provide investors with exposure to a slew of cryptocurrencies in a secure and cost-efficient manner. Such products are typically popular in Europe  where regulators have shown a willingness to list such products. As reported by U.Today  21Shares recently launched ETPs for such exotic cryptocurrencies as Decentraland (MANA) and Aave (AAVE).Crypto investment firms are getting more creative. Earlier this month  Bloomberg reported that CoinShares had joined forces with crypto exchange FTX in order to launch a Solana-based ETP that would offer staking rewards in order to reduce management costs for investors.No Bitcoin ETF in the U.S.While there is already stiff competition among ETP issuers that offer exposure to esoteric altcoins  the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is yet to greenlight a physically backed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund.Leading cryptocurrency asset management Grayscale Investments  which is vying to be the first to launch a spot-based Bitcoin ETF  recently warned that its quest to launch such a product could result in a lawsuit against the formidable regulator.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.01,0.11,0.89,True,English,"['Polkadot ETPs', 'Euronext Exchanges', 'WisdomTree', 'Solana', 'Cardano', 'New York-based exchange-traded product sponsor', 'Zurich-based SIX Swiss Exchange', 'Switzerland-based crypto ETP issuer', 'Leading cryptocurrency asset management', 'crypto exchange FTX', 'Crypto investment firms', 'senior ETF analyst', 'total expense ratio', 'Bitcoin exchange-traded fund', 'spot-based Bitcoin ETF', 'U.S. Securities', 'Polkadot exchange-traded products', 'investment fund', 'Exchange Commission', 'Cryptocurrency ETPs', '2.5% management fee', 'Solana-based ETP', 'management costs', 'ETP issuers', 'total costs', 'U.Today', 'Euronext exchanges', 'Eric Balchunas', 'Frankfurt-based Xetra', 'cost-efficient manner', 'staking rewards', 'stiff competition', 'esoteric altcoins', 'Grayscale Investments', 'formidable regulator', 'Such products', 'two ETPs', 'Polkadot ETPs', 'exotic cryptocurrencies', 'WisdomTree', 'Cardano', 'France', 'Netherlands', 'Germany', 'Amsterdam', 'Paris', 'Bloomberg', 'offering', '21Shares', 'investors', 'exposure', 'slew', 'secure', 'Europe', 'regulators', 'willingness', 'Decentraland', 'Aave', 'CoinShares', 'forces', 'order', 'quest', 'lawsuit']",2022-04-01,2022-04-01,cardanofeed.com

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces new data from the pivotal Phase II/III trial of leniolisib for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS)  a primary immunodeficiency. Principal Investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  shared the findings in a presentation at the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) 2022 Annual Meeting.As announced on February 2  2022  the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized  Phase III portion of the clinical trial  conducted by Novartis  met its co-primary endpoints  which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of naïve B cells are important in this population  as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers. Presented for the first time at CIS  the co-primary endpoints at day 85 after baseline demonstrated:In the index lymphadenopathy lesions  a statistically significant adjusted mean change in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) of -0.30 among patients who received leniolisib compared with -0.06 among patients who received placebo (95% CI: -0.37  -0.11; p=0.0012).From a baseline level of ˂48%  an increase of 34.76% in the proportion of naïve B cells in patients who received leniolisib versus a -5.37% decrease in patients who received placebo (95% CI: 28.51  51.75; p˂0.0001).The study drug was well-tolerated. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Charlotte Cunningham-Rundles  M.D.  Ph.D.  David S. Gottesman Professor of Immunology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York  said:""It is great news that leniolisib has achieved such positive results in this Phase III study in APDS. It is extremely encouraging to see that this medication is capable of targeting the cause of this difficult disease  both improving care and reducing patients' symptoms. Progress toward a treatment that is tailor-made for our patients with APDS is a milestone we have long awaited.""Pharming plans to begin submitting global regulatory filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""Pharming is delighted that leniolisib achieved significance in both co-primary endpoints and was well tolerated in these APDS patients  as the product's approval would address an unmet need for those with this rare disease  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. In addition to working closely with regulatory authorities across the globe to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients  we will continue to develop this treatment through our open-label extension study and two additional studies that will enroll children under the age of 12  as well as potentially extending the geographic reach of the product.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. is a global  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative protein replacement therapies and precision medicines for the treatment of rare diseases and unmet medical needs.The flagship of our portfolio is our recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) franchise.

VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infectionHave received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases. Efgartigimod is currently approved in the United States as VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.
