2092,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/a-controversial-russian-bond-arbitrage-is-minting-near-guaranteed-profits-1.1746481,A Controversial Russian Bond Arbitrage Is Minting Near-Guaranteed Profits,1 day ago,(Bloomberg) -- The pitch from Wall Street sales desks to clients goes something like this: Block out the horrors of the war in Ukraine  and focus on the trading opportunity it has created. Years  even decades could go by  one hedge-fund firm recalls being told  before another relative-value trade this attractive comes along.For those comfortable with step one  the bet has indeed racked up quick gains. Known as a negative-basis trade  at its core it takes advantage of the near-unprecedented selloff in Russian debt since Vladimir Putin‚Äôs widely-condemned invasion. It involves buying beaten down government or corporate bonds along with corresponding credit-default swaps  which insure the debtholder in the event of non-payment.In normal times  the economics of such a transaction don‚Äôt make much sense. The cost of the debt and the hedges move inversely  typically offsetting each other. But for much of the past month  as institutional investors were rushing to offload their stakes in Russian assets amid mounting public outrage  bond prices were falling faster than the cost to hedge was rising.‚ÄúIt seems like a quasi-guaranteed trade ‚Äù said Jochen Felsenheimer  a managing director at XAIA Investment in Munich  where he trades both CDS and bonds. Felsenheimer said he‚Äôs observed ‚Äúvery active‚Äù buying and selling of negative basis  with packages seemingly assured to pay out at par quoted recently at 80 cents on the dollar.Rob Citrone‚Äôs $2.6 billion Discovery Capital Management is one of the firms taking advantage of the kink in the market. Discovery bought long-dated Russian government bonds at about 20 cents on the dollar  while also hedging with one-year CDS at a price of around 60 cents  according to a person with knowledge of the trade.In essence  if the country defaults  the firm can convert the near-worthless bonds into cash and pocket a substantial profit. And if it doesn‚Äôt  the notes could quadruple in value  or more. The arbitrage position accounts for a couple percentage points of Discovery‚Äôs portfolio  the person said.Other firms including Aurelius Capital Management  GoldenTree Asset Management and Silver Point Capital have been piling into Russian markets  primarily by snapping up corporate bonds  the Financial Times reported last week. And H2O Asset Management has told investors that it‚Äôs been adding to its Russian debt holdings  according to a client letter seen by Bloomberg.But ask around hedge fund circles and  beyond H2O  few will admit publicly or even privately that they‚Äôre getting into Russia. Discovery  Aurelius  GoldenTree and Silver Point all declined to comment for this story.Rarely has a trade elicited such fierce industry debate  according to distressed-debt veterans  a group known for its combative personalities and aggressive tactics. Not only about the moral and ethical repercussions but even more so over the inherent financial  legal and reputational risks that come with investing in the country.As much as firms are trying to cover their tracks  signs of their involvement are all over global debt markets.Volumes in Russian corporate bonds soared to their highest levels in two years last month  according to data from MarketAxess. Moreover trading of Russian credit-default swaps has surged  dwarfing other single-name contracts  Bloomberg data show.At the same time  the nation‚Äôs government bonds have almost tripled in value over the past three weeks  with dip buyers bidding up prices as the Kremlin manages to navigate a complex web of international roadblocks to ensure foreign creditors still get paid.‚ÄúThe appealing part for investors is the asymmetric payoff -- how much money you could make ‚Äù said Jean-Dominique Butikofer  head of emerging-markets fixed income at Voya Investment Management  which isn‚Äôt involved in the trade. He noted that some hedge funds did very well wagering on Russia in the aftermath of the country‚Äôs 1998 ruble devaluation and default. ‚ÄúThat may be on their minds.‚ÄùThe steady climb in Russian bond prices in recent weeks has eroded some of the arbitrage opportunity in the negative-basis trade already. Bond and CDS packages more recently were being offered by sales desks for as much as 95 cents on the dollar  traders said. Others say they can still be had in the 70 cent range.‚ÄòUninvestible‚ÄôYet for many  there‚Äôs seemingly no price that could compel them to get involved.The country ‚Äúhas become uninvestible for most in the West ‚Äù Marathon Asset Management‚Äôs Bruce Richards said in an interview. He noted that the firm doesn‚Äôt have any exposure to Russia outside of index products that will soon remove the country. ‚ÄúRussia may have the willingness and ability to pay its debts ‚Äù he said  but ‚Äúthis unimaginable aggression Putin and Russia have embarked upon will ultimately lead to a collapse of the Russian economy.‚ÄùWhile an economic collapse may sound hyperbolic  mounting sanctions on Moscow are already beginning to take their toll. With half the nation‚Äôs foreign-exchange reserves frozen  the ruble plunged in early March. Inflation will surge to 18% over the course of the year  according to Bloomberg Economics  while the country‚Äôs GDP is expected to contract almost 10% in 2022.Even if Russia wants to pay its creditors  there remains the question of mechanics. While the Kremlin has managed to make interest payments on a handful of bonds over the past month  last week the country said operations via Clearstream  one of the biggest clearinghouses in the world  haven‚Äôt been going through after its account was blocked  raising questions over how easy it will be to send cash to creditors in the future.Settlement RiskThe negative-basis trade seemingly insulates investors from such risks. Still  some say the unorthodox language in certain Russia bond documents  along with uncertainty over sanctions  could raise issues about when default swap contracts are triggered and how they are settled.Future U.S. Treasury restrictions on Russian bonds  for example  could make the debt non-deliverable at CDS auctions  complicating the ability of holders to get paid.Jay Newman  the hedge fund veteran behind Elliott Management‚Äôs 15-year battle with Argentina following that nation‚Äôs default  said in an interview with Bloomberg that even experts in sovereign debt can‚Äôt make reasonable bets on Russia given the extreme variables at play.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something no one in the distressed sovereign or corporate market has ever seen before ‚Äù he said of Russia‚Äôs default prospects  noting in particular the atypical immunity clauses the government has maintained in its debt documents  protecting it from foreign lawsuits. ‚ÄúSpecialist investors have never faced something like this  and crossover investors have certainly never faced it.‚ÄùThere‚Äôs another  less tangible risk that fund managers must consider  warned Newman. Firms face long-term reputational damage by linking their names to Russia. That‚Äôs why many public institutions and pensions were quick dump Russian assets at the outset of the war. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a lot of pressure being brought to bear on managers to not have Russia on their books ‚Äù Newman said.To avoid backlash  some fund managers have created private side accounts for clients seeking Russian investments  according to people with familiar with the matter. The vehicles are meant to keep securities out of primary funds where they could attract criticism from other clients.Julian Brigden  a managing partner at hedge-fund consultant Macro Intelligence 2 Partners  said some U.S. money managers have been weighing the merits of setting up offshore structures in order to buy Russian assets.Others  he said  ‚Äúwould never in a million years‚Äù expose themselves to such a high level of scrutiny.¬©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.01,0.08,0.91,mixed,0.06,0.14,0.8,True,English,"['Controversial Russian Bond Arbitrage', 'Guaranteed Profits', 'Wall Street sales desks', 'one hedge-fund firm recalls', '$2.6 billion Discovery Capital Management', 'dated Russian government bonds', 'Marathon Asset Management', 'corresponding credit-default swaps', 'couple percentage points', 'fierce industry debate', 'emerging-markets fixed income', 'Russian credit-default swaps', 'Voya Investment Management', 'mounting public outrage', 'Aurelius Capital Management', 'inherent financial, legal', 'other single-name contracts', 'Silver Point Capital', 'GoldenTree Asset Management', 'H2O Asset Management', 'hedge fund circles', 'past three weeks', 'Russian debt holdings', 'global debt markets', 'Russian corporate bonds', 'Russian bond prices', 'Russian markets', 'Russian assets', 'Russian economy', 'past month', 'XAIA Investment', 'Financial Times', 'recent weeks', 'mounting sanctions', 'worthless bonds', 'quick gains', 'unprecedented selloff', 'normal times', 'managing director', 'negative basis', 'Rob Citrone', 'substantial profit', 'arbitrage position', 'client letter', 'distressed-debt veterans', 'combative personalities', 'aggressive tactics', 'ethical repercussions', 'reputational risks', 'highest levels', 'same time', 'dip buyers', 'complex web', 'international roadblocks', 'foreign creditors', 'appealing part', 'asymmetric payoff', 'Jean-Dominique Butikofer', 'hedge funds', 'steady climb', 'arbitrage opportunity', '70 cent range', 'Bruce Richards', 'index products', 'unimaginable aggression', 'foreign-exchange reserves', 'early March', 'Other firms', 'one-year CDS', 'trading opportunity', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Jochen Felsenheimer', 'two years', '1998 ruble devaluation', 'economic collapse', 'relative-value trade', 'negative-basis trade', 'institutional investors', 'CDS packages', 'Bloomberg data', 'pitch', 'clients', 'something', 'horrors', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'decades', 'attractive', 'step', 'bet', 'core', 'advantage', 'invasion', 'debtholder', 'event', 'non', 'payment', 'economics', 'transaction', 'sense', 'cost', 'hedges', 'stakes', 'guaranteed', 'Munich', '80 cents', 'dollar', 'kink', '20 cents', '60 cents', 'knowledge', 'essence', 'country', 'cash', 'notes', 'portfolio', 'story', 'group', 'moral', 'investing', 'tracks', 'signs', 'involvement', 'Volumes', 'MarketAxess', 'Kremlin', 'money', 'head', 'aftermath', 'minds', '95 cents', 'traders', 'Others', 'West', 'interview', 'exposure', 'willingness', 'ability', 'debts', 'Moscow', 'toll', 'half', 'Inflation', 'course']",2022-04-01,2022-04-02,bnnbloomberg.ca

L‚ÄôOr√©al  Sanofi‚Äôs largest shareholder  has committed to a lock-up period of 1 year following the settlement of the Distribution  i.e.  May 10  2022Paris  April 1  2022. Sanofi announced today that the French Autorit√© des march√©s financiers (AMF) has approved the listing prospectus prepared by EUROAPI in connection with the intended listing of its shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris.On March 17th  2022  Sanofi‚Äôs Board of Directors unanimously decided to submit for approval to its shareholders the proposed distribution in kind (the ‚ÄúDistribution‚Äù) of EUROAPI shares  via an additional extraordinary dividend  exclusively in kind  in addition to the previously proposed ‚Ç¨3.33 cash dividend per Sanofi share. The Distribution relates to circa 58% of the share capital and voting rights of EUROAPI. In connection with the proposed Distribution  EPIC Bpifrance has agreed to purchase 12% of EUROAPI shares1 from Sanofi  which confirmed its intention to hold circa 30% of the share capital and voting rights of the company after the Distribution.Story continuesThe Distribution by Sanofi to its shareholders of EUROAPI shares in the form of an additional extraordinary dividend  exclusively in kind  is subject to the shareholders‚Äô approval at Sanofi‚Äôs May 3  2022 Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders‚Äô Meeting.Subject to certain customary exceptions  the following lock-up periods have been agreed:2 years for Sanofi and EPIC Bpifrance following the settlement and delivery of the EUROAPI shares to be sold to EPIC Bpifrance; and1 year for L‚ÄôOr√©al  Sanofi‚Äôs largest shareholder and for Karl Rotthier  CEO of the Company  following the settlement of the Distribution.Main features of the Distribution are as follows:The Distribution ratio will be one (1) EUROAPI share per twenty three (23) Sanofi shares.No fractional EUROAPI shares will be issued. Any right to receive a fractional share will not be tradable or transferable. Consequently  when the amount of the Distribution to which a Sanofi shareholder is entitled does not correspond to a whole number of EUROAPI shares (i.e.  less than twenty three (23) or a multiple of twenty three (23) Sanofi shares)  the shareholder will receive the immediately lower number of EUROAPI shares  plus a cash payment for the whole of the balance arising from the price at which EUROAPI shares corresponding to fractional shares were sold. Each financial intermediary will sell the shares corresponding to the fractional shares of its entitled clients. As a result  the amount of the cash balance may vary depending on the shareholder‚Äôs financial intermediary;The technical reference price of EUROAPI shares is expected to be announced on May 5  2022 by Euronext Paris after market close;The admission to trading of the EUROAPI shares and the ex-date (d√©tachement) of the Distribution will occur at 9.00 am (CET) on May 6  2022;The record date (the date on which positions are closed) for Sanofi shares to be eligible to the Distribution is scheduled on May 9  2022;Payment of the Distribution (delivery and book-entry of the allocated EUROAPI shares) will take place on May 10  2022.Following the Distribution and the purchase of 12% of EUROAPI shares by EPIC Bpifrance  the Sanofi group will no longer control EUROAPI  resulting in a slightly accretive impact on Sanofi 2022 business operating income (BOI) margin2.Documents related to Sanofi shareholders‚Äô meeting will be made available on April 11  2022 on the Sanofi dedicated web page.Investors are invited to read EUROAPI‚Äôs press release  issued concurrently and available on EUROAPI‚Äôs website announcing the AMF‚Äôs approval of its prospectus  and the listing prospectus in order to fully understand the potential risks and rewards associated with any decision to invest in EUROAPI shares.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces new data from the pivotal Phase II/III trial of leniolisib for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) syndrome (APDS)  a primary immunodeficiency. Principal Investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  shared the findings in a presentation at the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) 2022 Annual Meeting.Pharming Group N.V. logoAs announced on February 2  2022  the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized  Phase III portion of the clinical trial  conducted by Novartis  met its co-primary endpoints  which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of na√Øve B cells are important in this population  as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers. Presented for the first time at CIS  the co-primary endpoints at day 85 after baseline demonstrated:In the index lymphadenopathy lesions  a statistically significant adjusted mean change in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) of -0.30 among patients who received leniolisib compared with -0.06 among patients who received placebo (95% CI: -0.37  -0.11; p=0.0012).From a baseline level of ÀÇ48%  an increase of 34.76% in the proportion of na√Øve B cells in patients who received leniolisib versus a -5.37% decrease in patients who received placebo (95% CI: 28.51  51.75; pÀÇ0.0001).The study drug was well-tolerated. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Story continuesCharlotte Cunningham-Rundles  M.D.  Ph.D.  David S. Gottesman Professor of Immunology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York  said:""It is great news that leniolisib has achieved such positive results in this Phase III study in APDS. It is extremely encouraging to see that this medication is capable of targeting the cause of this difficult disease  both improving care and reducing patients' symptoms. Progress toward a treatment that is tailor-made for our patients with APDS is a milestone we have long awaited.""Pharming plans to begin submitting global regulatory filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""Pharming is delighted that leniolisib achieved significance in both co-primary endpoints and was well tolerated in these APDS patients  as the product's approval would address an unmet need for those with this rare disease  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. In addition to working closely with regulatory authorities across the globe to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients  we will continue to develop this treatment through our open-label extension study and two additional studies that will enroll children under the age of 12  as well as potentially extending the geographic reach of the product.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. is a global  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative protein replacement therapies and precision medicines for the treatment of rare diseases and unmet medical needs.The flagship of our portfolio is our recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) franchise. C1INH is a naturally occurring protein that down regulates the complement and contact cascades in order to control inflammation in affected tissues.Our lead product  RUCONEST¬Æ  is the first and only plasma-free rhC1INH protein replacement therapy. It is approved for the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks. We are commercializing RUCONEST¬Æ in the United States  the European Union and the United Kingdom through our own sales and marketing organization  and the rest of the world through our distribution network.In addition  we are investigating the clinical efficacy of rhC1INH in the treatment of further indications  including pre-eclampsia  acute kidney injury and severe pneumonia as a result of COVID-19 infections.We are also studying our oral precision medicine  leniolisib (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta  or PI3K delta  inhibitor)  for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome  or APDS. World-wide rights for leniolisib were licensed from Novartis AG in 2019. Leniolisib met both of its primary end points in a registration enabling Phase 2/3 study in the United States and Europe. We are targeting global regulatory filings for leniolisib from Q2 2022 onwards.Additionally  we entered into a strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex-vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of HAE.Furthermore  we are leveraging our transgenic manufacturing technology to develop next-generation protein replacement therapies  most notably for Pompe disease  which is currently in preclinical development.Forward-looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements  including with respect to timing and progress of Pharming's preclinical studies and clinical trials of its product candidates  Pharming's clinical and commercial prospects  Pharming's ability to overcome the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the conduct of its business  and Pharming's expectations regarding its projected working capital requirements and cash resources.

Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infectionHave received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases. Efgartigimod is currently approved in the United States as VYVGART¬Æ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About Generalized Myasthenia GravisGeneralized myasthenia gravis (gMG) is a rare and chronic autoimmune disease where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies disrupt communication between nerves and muscles  causing debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of na√Øve B cells are important in this population  as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers. Presented for the first time at CIS  the co-primary endpoints at day 85 after baseline demonstrated:In the index lymphadenopathy lesions  a statistically significant adjusted mean change in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) of -0.30 among patients who received leniolisib compared with -0.06 among patients who received placebo (95% CI: -0.37  -0.11; p=0.0012).From a baseline level of ÀÇ48%  an increase of 34.76% in the proportion of na√Øve B cells in patients who received leniolisib versus a -5.37% decrease in patients who received placebo (95% CI: 28.51  51.75; pÀÇ0.0001).The study drug was well-tolerated. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Charlotte Cunningham-Rundles  M.D.  Ph.D.  David S. Gottesman Professor of Immunology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York  said:""It is great news that leniolisib has achieved such positive results in this Phase III study in APDS. It is extremely encouraging to see that this medication is capable of targeting the cause of this difficult disease  both improving care and reducing patients' symptoms. Progress toward a treatment that is tailor-made for our patients with APDS is a milestone we have long awaited.""Pharming plans to begin submitting global regulatory filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""Pharming is delighted that leniolisib achieved significance in both co-primary endpoints and was well tolerated in these APDS patients  as the product's approval would address an unmet need for those with this rare disease  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. In addition to working closely with regulatory authorities across the globe to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients  we will continue to develop this treatment through our open-label extension study and two additional studies that will enroll children under the age of 12  as well as potentially extending the geographic reach of the product.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. is a global  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative protein replacement therapies and precision medicines for the treatment of rare diseases and unmet medical needs.The flagship of our portfolio is our recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) franchise. C1INH is a naturally occurring protein that down regulates the complement and contact cascades in order to control inflammation in affected tissues.Our lead product  RUCONEST¬Æ  is the first and only plasma-free rhC1INH protein replacement therapy. It is approved for the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks. We are commercializing RUCONEST¬Æ in the United States  the European Union and the United Kingdom through our own sales and marketing organization  and the rest of the world through our distribution network.In addition  we are investigating the clinical efficacy of rhC1INH in the treatment of further indications  including pre-eclampsia  acute kidney injury and severe pneumonia as a result of COVID-19 infections.We are also studying our oral precision medicine  leniolisib (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta  or PI3K delta  inhibitor)  for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome  or APDS. World-wide rights for leniolisib were licensed from Novartis AG in 2019. Leniolisib met both of its primary end points in a registration enabling Phase 2/3 study in the United States and Europe. We are targeting global regulatory filings for leniolisib from Q2 2022 onwards.Additionally  we entered into a strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex-vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of HAE.Furthermore  we are leveraging our transgenic manufacturing technology to develop next-generation protein replacement therapies  most notably for Pompe disease  which is currently in preclinical development.Forward-looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements  including with respect to timing and progress of Pharming's preclinical studies and clinical trials of its product candidates  Pharming's clinical and commercial prospects  Pharming's ability to overcome the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the conduct of its business  and Pharming's expectations regarding its projected working capital requirements and cash resources.

Omicron did have an impact on the recovery in the second quarter  but we are seeing a pick-up since the end of February.We have closed the GET efficiency program  with better results than anticipated. The teams mobilized actively to implement measures to mitigate rising cost inflation: indexation  client negotiations  productivity  product substitution. These actions resulted in a +210 bps improvement of our Underlying operating profit margin to 5.2%.Since October 2021  we have made significant progress on our strategic priorities. Operational execution and sales development are improving in the United States. More new food model offers are being deployed in our major geographies. Our disposals and acquisitions are fully aligned with our portfolio strategy. The transfer of the management of Schools and Government & Agencies to the regions is a first step in the simplification of our organization.Story continuesIn the second half of the year  we are confident that the return to the workplace and Sports & Leisure events will continue to recover. However  the environment remains uncertain with intermittent local outbreaks of Covid-19  and the war in Ukraine. We are confident that we can manage the year end inflationary pressure on margins. Currencies should give us a nice tailwind  but we expect organic revenue growth to be around the bottom of the range we had given in October 2021.Our teams are mobilized to meet the challenges and I warmly thank them for their impressive engagement in the field with our clients and our suppliers. We remain confident in our capacity to continue to grow our business.‚ÄùHighlights of the periodFirst half Fiscal 2022 Group revenue was 10 262 million euro  up +19.4%  with strong recovery coming through in all segments that were severely impacted by Covid. The currency effect was strong at +3.5%  resulting from the strength of all our major currencies against the euro. The net M&A contribution was -0.8% due to the exit of businesses  sold as part of the portfolio management program. As a result  Group organic revenue growth was +16.7%  back up to 95% of pre-Covid levels.On-site Services organic revenue growth was +17.0%   with a particularly strong first quarter up +17.9% and a second quarter at +16.1%  impacted by Omicron. The recovery was solid with the first quarter ending at 95 % of pre-Covid levels but falling back slightly to 94% in the second quarter due to Omicron. The key elements of the half-year were: In Business & Administrations   organic growth was +19.5% . It reflects a strong recovery in Corporate Services  back up to 89% of pre-Covid levels in Q2  due to a gradual but regular return to the workplace. Sports & Leisure is back up to 61%  as the number of events has picked up significantly. Energy & Resources and Government & Agencies remained solid. In Healthcare & Seniors   organic growth was +5.0%   with the first quarter up +7.4% and the second quarter up +2.5% reflecting a much tougher comparative base in Europe  including a high level of activities at the Testing Centers contract in the United Kingdom last year. In Education   organic growth was +29.5% . While the recovery in activity in Universities in North America was very strong during the period  Omicron did have an impact on the growth in the second quarter in Schools in North America and Europe. Relative to pre-Covid levels  Education was at 88% in the second quarter  back down from 92% in the first quarter  impacted also by the full effect of the Chicago Public Schools contract termination.Key Performance Indicators for the First half Fiscal 2022: Client retention was up +60 bps to 98.1%  improving in all regions and segments. New sales development was up +90 bps at 3.7%  with improvements in many regions  including North America. The higher levels of signings were combined with continued signing discipline  particularly regarding the average projected gross margin which is up +80 bps. Same site sales growth recovered strongly at +19.8%  as volume recovery came through  helped by some solid cross-selling in many segments and regions.Benefits & Rewards Services organic growth was +9.3%   with Employee benefits up a strong +14.5%. There was an acceleration in the second quarter in both the Europe  USA and Asia region and Latin America  where Brazil is also back to double digit growth.Underlying operating margin was 5.2%  up +210 bps versus First half Fiscal 2021. This significant improvement in performance is the result of the strong recovery in volumes  the successful completion of the GET efficiency program  and strong actions to mitigate inflation through indexation  contract renegotiations and productivity.Other operating expenses (net) amounted to only 1 million euros in First half Fiscal 2022  with restructuring costs falling to 3 million euros and gains on the sale of assets more or less off-setting losses. This compares to 128 million euros in the previous year.The Effective tax rate at 28.3% fell below 30%  back to a more regular rate.Group net profit recovered significantly at 337 million euros against 33 million euros in the previous year. Basic EPS was thus multiplied by 10 at ‚Ç¨2.30 against ‚Ç¨0.23 in the previous year. Underlying Net profit increased +164.8% to 339 million euros against 128 million euros in the previous year.First half Fiscal 2022 Free cash outflow was 75 million euros against the cash inflow of 237 million euros in the previous period. The previous year was boosted by delayed restructuring costs and government payment delays. This year performance was marred by the unwinding of these same government payment delays and restructuring costs combined with the reimbursement of Tokyo Olympics ticketing and an exceptional contribution to the United Kingdom pension funds. Recurring free cash flow was 182 million euros  after a significant increase in capex to 159 million euros  or 1.5% of revenues  relative to the exceptionally low level of 86 million euros  or 0.9% of revenues in the previous year.Net debt has risen year on year to 2.0 billion euros from 1.7 billion euros. However  gearing 2 is stable at 56% and as a result of the significant improvement in EBITDA  the net debt ratio 2 has fallen back down to 1.8x compared to 3.8x at the end of First half Fiscal 2021.Once again  our Corporate Responsibility achievements have been externally recognized: Sodexo earns its 15 th consecutive 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundation‚Äôs annual assessment of LGBTQ+ workplace equality.

First time outsourcing contract signings are increasing and currently represent circa 40% of signatures in the First half. Investment in the Marketing & Sales resources is continuing with additions of new sales executives and managers and the recent launching of a new digital training program. A specific long-term incentive scheme for the North America leadership team has been launched to strengthen collective and individual accountability. Accelerate the food model transformation:The deployment of On-site brands & offers is accelerating with the scale-up of The Good Eating Company in the United States and new contracts signatures in the tech and finance sectors for Nourish  Fooditude and The Good Eating Company. We are developing partnerships with high-end brands such as an exclusive 10-year partnership with ForFive Coffee  a premium coffee and food company based in New York. The digitalization of the consumer experience is also progressing. In China  we are leveraging the Meican digital online ordering  mobile apps  smart waiter‚Ä¶ to enhance the food offer and develop new smaller clients. We have signed an agreement to expand the Kiwibot fleet in 50 US universities by the end of the year.

Manage more actively our portfolio:A number of strategic acquisitions & investments have been completed during the period: To expand the New Food Model offerings  we have acquired Frontline Food Services in North America and increased our participation in Meican in China. To strengthen our European GPO (Group purchasing organization)  two investments have been made in Europe.

Divestment of non-core activities and geographies have also accelerated in the First half. In On-site Services  subsidiaries in Morocco  non-strategic account portfolios in Australia and Czech Republic and The Lido in France have all been sold. Benefits & Rewards Services disposed of its Russian activity and also the sports-cards in Romania and Spain. The Global Childcare activities and On-site Services in the Congo were closed in March.

Enhance the effectiveness of our organization:The GET efficiency program closed ahead of plan with 382 million euros of savings against the target of 350 million euros and a savings/cost ratio of 117% versus 100%.

Since the end of February  momentum is picking back up. However  the current environment remains full of uncertainties. There is a resurgence of localized Covid outbreaks  several mobilizations in Russia will not happen  and the Testing Centers in the United Kingdom are closing earlier than expected.As a result  we expectFiscal 2022 organic growth to be around the bottom of the range of +15% to +18% given in October 2021.The currencies provided a strong tailwind in the First half and  at today‚Äôs rates  should continue to do so.Our teams have successfully managed the margins in the First half and are highly mobilized to mitigate all these uncertainties and in particular the additional inflation resulting from the disruption to the supply chain due to the Ukraine war.As a result  we maintain our expectations forFiscal 2022 Underlying Operating Profit margin close to 5%3  at constant rates.Conference callSodexo will hold a conference call in (English) today at 9:00 a.m. (Paris time)  8:00 a.m. (London time) to comment on its H1 Fiscal 2022 results.Those who wish to connect:From the United Kingdom: +44 2071 928 338  orFrom France: +33 1 70 70 07 81  orFrom the US: +1 646-741-3167 Following by the access code 92 69 446A live audio webcast is also available on www.sodexo.com.The press release  presentation and webcast will be available on the Group website www.sodexo.com in both the ¬´ Latest News ¬ª section and the ¬´ Finance ‚Äì Financial Results ¬ª section.Fiscal 2022 financial calendarFiscal 2022 Third quarter Revenues July 1  2022 Fiscal 2022 Annual Results October 26  2022 Fiscal 2022 Annual Shareholders Meeting December 19  2022Please note that the date of the Annual Shareholders Meeting has changed.These dates are indicative and may be subject to change without notice.Regular updates are available in the calendar on our website www.sodexo.comAbout SodexoFounded in Marseille in 1966 by Pierre Bellon  Sodexo is the global leader in Quality of Life Services  an essential factor in individual and organizational performance.

However  given the weight of the Benefit & Rewards activity in Brazil  and the high level of its margins relative to the Group  when the Brazilian real declines against the euro  it has a negative effect on the Underlying Operating Profit margin due to a change in the mix of margins. Conversely  when the Brazilian real strengthens Group margins increase.1‚Ç¨= AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2022 AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2021 AVERAGE RATEH1 FY 2022 VS.

The Underlying operating margin was up +210 bps to 5.2%  reflecting the solid recovery in activity.The significant step-up in the Underlying operating margin semester after semester  since the low in Second half Fiscal 2020 of -1.5%  reflects the improvement in activity levels  very tight cost control  numerous contract renegotiations in the On-site activities  more active portfolio management  and the contribution from the GET efficiency program.The GET efficiency program was aimed at protecting the gross profit margin as government aid receded and structurally reducing SG&A for the long-term by simplifying the structures in the Group  to free up capacity to invest in growth and to enhance margins. The program has now been closed.GET PROGRAM FISCAL 2020 FISCAL 2021 FISCAL 2022 TARGET (in millions of euros) CUMULATED NUMBERS Total exceptional costs 158 312 327 350 Cash impact (75) (217) (305) (315) SG&A savings ‚Äî 91 157 175 Gross profit cost avoidance ‚Äî 127 225 175 Total savings ‚Äî 218 382 350 Savings/Costs 117% 100%Cumulated up to the end of First half Fiscal 2022  the GET program has cost 327 million euros  generated 382 million euros of annual savings  with a cash impact of 305 million euros  of which of 37 million euros in First half Fiscal 2022.

The currency impact during the First half was limited.The performance by segment at constant rates is as follows:Business & Administrations Underlying Operating profit increased seven-fold from a very low level in Fiscal 2021. As a result  the Underlying operating margin was up +230 bps to 2.7%. Progress is solid  linked to the recovery in revenues  even though the margin is still some way off the Fiscal 2020 first half margin of 4%. It also represents a significant improvement in margins since the beginning of the pandemic  from -3.3% in Second half Fiscal 2020  to 0.4% in First half 2021 and 1.9% in the Second half. While the margin has recovered significantly in Corporate Services and is back to breakeven in Sports & Leisure  the margin in Energy & Resources has been temporarily impacted by high levels of Omicron-linked absenteeism  particularly in the mining sector  and some major contract ramp-ups.in Healthcare & Seniors  the Underlying Operating Profit margin is flat year on year at 6.4% but higher than in the First half Fiscal 2020  pre-Covid  at 6.3%. Net new business is positive for margins and inflation is being passed on either through indexation clauses  contract negotiations or productivity measures.in Education  Underlying Operating Profit more than doubled and the margin was up by +410 bps at 8.5%  compared to a margin of 8.4% in First half Fiscal 2020. This performance reflects strong volume recovery in North America and Asia  productivity in Europe and strict cost management throughout. Inflation has been passed on to clients or compensated by productivity.In Benefits & Rewards Services  excluding negligible currency impacts  Underlying Operating Profit was up +25.2% and the margin was 26.7%  up +330 bps. This represents a progressive pick-up in the margin over the last few semesters  as the business has recovered from the negative effects of the Covid confinements. While cost reduction has continued  spending on enhanced digitalization and new offerings has also continued. The recovery in financial revenues is also feeding through into enhanced margins.2.5 Group net profitOther net operating expenses amounted to 1 million euros compared to 128 million euros in the previous year.With the closing of the GET program  in First half Fiscal 2022  restructuring costs fell to only 3 million euros. Gains related to the sale of assets were more or less offset by the losses.As a result  the Operating Profit was up strongly at 537 million euros compared to 136 million euros in the previous year.(in millions of euros) H1 FISCAL 2022 H1 FISCAL 2021 UNDERLYING OPERATING PROFIT 538 265 OTHER OPERATING INCOME 67 8 Gains related to consolidation scope changes 33 3 Gain on disposals of non-current assets ‚Äî ‚Äî Gains on changes of post-employment benefits ‚Äî 4 Other 34 ‚Äî OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES (68) (136) Restructuring and rationalization costs (3) (107) Losses related to consolidation scope changes (34) (1) Amortization of purchased intangible assets (20) (21) Impairment of goodwill and non-current assets ‚Äî ‚Äî Acquisition-related costs (2) (2) Losses on changes of post-employment benefits (1) (1) Losses related to the disposal of non-current assets ‚Äî ‚Äî Other (8) (3) OTHER OPERATING INCOME AND EXPENSES (NET) (1) (128) OPERATING PROFIT 537 136First half Fiscal 2022 Net financial expense was up at 53 million euros against 50 million euros in the previous year. The increase is attributable to the increased gross debt resulting from the US Dollar bond issue in April 2021 somewhat offset by the 600 million euros reimbursement of a euro bond in October 2021. The blended cost of gross debt was 1.5% as at February 28  2022  which is slightly lower than the rate at the end of February and August 2021 of 1.6%.The tax charge was up strongly at 136 million euros due to the very significant increase in the pre-tax profit. However  the effective tax rate fell below 30%  back to a more regular rate at 28.3%  compared to 63% in the previous year.The share of profit of other companies accounted for using the equity method was 2 million euros in First half Fiscal 2022  compared to 2 million euros in the preceding year. Profit attributed to non-controlling interests was 11 million euros compared to the previous year amount of 2 million euros.As a result  First half Fiscal 2022 Group Net Profit was multiplied by 10 to 337 million euros  compared to 33 million euros in the previous year. Underlying Net Profit adjusted for Other Operating income and expenses net of tax amounted to 339 million euros  compared to 128 million euros in the previous year  up +164.8%.2.6 Earnings per sharePublished First half Fiscal 2022 EPS was 2.30 euros against 0.23 euro in the previous year. The weighted average number of shares for Fiscal 2022 was more or less stable at 146 292 627 compared to 146 001 603 shares for First half Fiscal 2021.Underlying EPS amounted to 2.32 euros  up +165.3% compared to the previous year.3 Consolidated financial position3.1 Cash flowsCash flows for the period were as follows:(in millions of euros) H1 Fiscal 2022 H2 Fiscal 2021 Operating cash flow 674 405 Change in working capital excluding change in BRS financial assets (1) (481) 41 IFRS 16 outflow (109) (123) Net capital expenditure (159) (86) Free cash flow (2) (75) 237 Net acquisitions (26) (10) Share buy-backs (13) (11) Dividends paid to shareholders (294) ‚Äî Other changes (including scope and exchange rates) (156) (28) (Increase)/decrease in net debt (564) 187(1) Excluding change in financial assets related to the Benefits & Rewards Services activity of 67 million euros in Fiscal 2022 versus -42 million euros in Fiscal 2021. Total change in working capital as reported in consolidated accounts: in Fiscal 2022: -414 million euros = -481 million euros + 67million euros and in Fiscal 2021: -1 million euros = 41 million euros - 42 million euros.(2) The Group does not believe the accounting treatment introduced by IFRS 16 modifies the operating nature of its lease transactions. Accordingly  to ensure the Group‚Äôs performance measures continue to best reflect its operating performance  the Group considers repayments of lease liabilities as operating items impacting the Free cash flow  which integrates all lease payments (fixed or variable). To be consistent  the lease liabilities are not included in Net debt (treated as operating items).First half Fiscal 2022 Free cash outflow was 75 million euros against an inflow of 237 million euros in the previous period.First half Fiscal 2022 Operating cash flow improved to 674 million euros against 405 million euros in the previous period as a result of the significant improvement in the operating profit of the Group. On the other hand  working capital deteriorated significantly with an outflow of cash of 481 million euros during the First half Fiscal 2022. This was exceptionally high due to the 37 million euros cash effect of the restructuring costs  the unwinding of the government Covid-linked payment delays for 100 million euros  reimbursement of the Tokyo Olympics hospitality packages for 55 million euros  an exceptional cash contribution to the UK pension fund for 71 million euros and a 7 million euros net cash inflow for Benefits & Rewards Services resulting from the Hungarian indemnity related to closing the business  which is offset by the fine related to the dispute with the French competition authorities which is being paid monthly.Net capital expenditure  including client investments  at 159 million euro  or 1.5% of revenues  increased year on year from the exceptionally low level of 86 million euros in the previous year.While contract-linked capital expenditure in some segments has continued to be delayed due to the effect of the pandemic  IT investment is maintained  and the digitization of Benefits & Rewards Services continues. Given the Group's mix of segments and geographies  and in a normal environment  this rate should be running at around 2.5% of annual revenues.Given the number of completed disposals since the beginning of the year  the cash impact of acquisitions net of disposals amounted to 26 million euros.The resumption of the payment of a dividend on Fiscal 2021 earnings resulted in an outflow of 294 million euros.After taking into account Other changes  consolidated net debt increased by 564 million euros during the First half to 2 042 million euros at February 28  2022.3.2 Acquisitions and disposals for the periodFirst half Fiscal 2022 has been an active period for closing numerous disposals of non-core activities and geographies:The On-site Services activities in MoroccoThe Lido in FranceNon-strategic account portfolios in Australia  Czech RepublicBenefits & Rewards Services in RussiaBenefits & Rewards Services sports cards in Romania and SpainThe Global Childcare activities and the Onsite Services business in the Congo were completed mid-March.On the other hand  further strategic acquisitions & investments have also been made:In the New Food Model  we have acquired Frontline Food Services  North America  and increased our participation in the digital food services company  Meican  ChinaIn the GPO space  we have made two investments to strengthen the position of Entegra in EuropeIn the Healthcare segment  we have a acquired a technical equipment management activity in China.3.3 Condensed consolidated statement of financial position at February 28  2022(in millions of euros) FEBRUARY 28  2022 FEBRUARY 28  2021 (in millions of euros) FEBRUARY 28  2022 FEBRUARY 28  2021 Non-current assets 10 063 9 766 Shareholders‚Äô equity 3 615 2 917 Current assets excluding cash 5 980 4 943 Non-controlling interests 10 15 Restricted cash Benefits & Rewards 782 795 Non-current liabilities 7 129 6 238 Financial assetsBenefits & Rewards 221 342 Current liabilities 8 899 8 886 Cash 2 607 2 210 TOTAL ASSETS 19 653 18 056 TOTAL LIABILITIESAND SHAREHOLDERS‚Äô EQUITY 19 653 18 056 Borrowings 5 647 5 005 Net debt 2 042 1 681 Gearing 56% 57% Net debt ratio 1.8x 3.8xThe increase in shareholders‚Äô equity was due to several factors: the currency translation adjustment of some currencies such as US Dollar  UK Sterling and the Brazilian real  as well as the revaluation of financial assets under IFRS 9.As of February 28  2022  net debt was 2 042 million euros  representing a gearing of 56%  and a net debt ratio of 1.8x  firmly within the target range of between 1 and 2x.In October 2021  Sodexo reimbursed by anticipation a 600 million euros bond due to mature in January 2022.As a result  at February 28  2022  the Group's gross debt amounted to 5.6 billion euros  of which 94% is at fixed rates and 21% is dollar-denominated  with an average maturity of 5.2 years and 100% covenant-free.Operating cash reached a total of 3 605 million euros  including 782 million euros of restricted cash and 221 million euros of financial assets of Benefits & Rewards Services.The Benefits & Rewards Services activity asset to liability coverage is at 114% compared to 113% as at February 28  2021  with operating cash of 2 442 million euros and client receivables of 1 600 million euros  compared to voucher liabilities payable of 3 556 million euros.The rest of the Group also had a significant operating cash position of 1 163 million euros.At the end of the First half  the Group had unused credit lines totaled 1.7 billion euros and total liquidity was 5.3 billion euros.3.4 Subsequent eventsThe operation to combine the Group's Childcare activities with those of the Grandir group  announced in July 2021  has been approved by the competition authorities.

registered in France  with its headquarters located in Issy-les-Moulineaux.Sodexo‚Äôs condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six-month period from September 1  2021  to February 28  2022  were approved by the Board of Directors on March 31  2022.The numbers shown in the tables were prepared in thousands of euros and are presented in millions of euros (unless otherwise indicated).Note 1.Significant events1 Impact of the Covid-19 pandemicAfter a strong recovery in the first quarter of the year in Sports & Leisure  Business Services and Education  the trend reversed slightly in January due to Omicron  particularly in Business Services due to a return to full teleworking in many countries and the number of sick students and teachers in schools and universities. The spread of the Omicron variant has also led to increased absenteeism in some countries  necessitating additional costs to ensure continuity of service. However  profitability continued to improve across all segments and regions.Management of liquidityWith sufficient cash flows provided by operating activities for investments and acquisitions  the Group‚Äôs financial situation remains solid.In addition  as mentioned in note 8.4  the Group has access to credit facilities that can be utilized at any time as needed for 1.7 billion euros (the confirmed credit facilities are undrawn as of February 28  2022). Furthermore  with operating cash of 3.6 billion euros  the Group has access to 5.3 billion euros of liquidity as of February 28  2022.Therefore  as of the date of approval of the consolidated financial statements by the Board of Directors  the Group considers there is no risk of going concern.2 Impacts of the Ukraine warThe Sodexo Group has no subsidiary in Ukraine. The Group operates in Russia but given the limited size of its operations (less than 1% of Group revenue and Underlying operating profit)  the Group does not expect material impacts in its consolidated financial statements.Note 2.Accounting policies1 Basis of preparation of the financial statements1.1 Basis of preparation of financial information for Fiscal 2022The condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended February 28  2022  have been prepared in accordance with IAS 34 ""Interim Financial Reporting""  as published by the IASB and endorsed by the European Union. They do not include all the disclosures required for a complete set of annual financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Sodexo Group for the fiscal year ended August 31  2021.The accounting policies applied by the Group in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the six months ended February 28  2022 are the same as those used in the annual consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended August 31  2021  with the exception of the specific requirements of IAS 34 (see note 2.2) and of the accounting principles impacted by the IFRS Interpretation Committee relating to IAS 19 ""Employee benefits"" (see note 2.1.2). The other texts effective as of September 1  2021  did not have a material impact on interim consolidated financial statements of the Group.The Group has not applied any IFRSs that had not yet been approved by the European Union as of February 28  2022. The Group has not elected to early adopt any standards or interpretations whose application is not mandatory in Fiscal 2022.1.2 New accounting standards and interpretations required to be appliedThe application of the IFRS Interpretation Committee decision issued in April 2021 clarifying the calculation methods  in application of IAS 19 ""Employee benefits""  for certain commitments relating to defined benefit plans impacted the consolidated shareholder's equity as of September 1  2021  for 10 million euros after tax.In March 2021  the IFRS Interpretation Committee made final its decision providing details on the accounting for configuration and customization costs of SaaS (Software as a Service) type software. The impacts on consolidated financial statements of the Group of this decision is currently being analyzed.2 Specific interim reporting requirementsIncome tax expenseIncome tax expense (current and deferred) in the condensed interim consolidated financial statements is computed by applying an estimated average annual tax rate for the current fiscal year to each tax reporting entity's pre-tax profit for the first half of the year as adjusted  where applicable  for the tax effect of any specific events that may have occurred during the period. The resulting deferred tax charge or benefit is recognized in deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities in the consolidated statement of financial position.Post-employment and other long-term employee benefitsThe expense for post-employment and other long-term employee benefits is computed as one half of the annual charge estimated as of August 31  2021. The actuarial projections are updated to take into account any material changes to assumptions or one-off impacts (discount rates  applicable legislation...) during the six-month period.3 Use of estimatesThe preparation of the condensed interim consolidated financial statements requires the management of Sodexo and its subsidiaries to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the amounts reported for assets  liabilities and contingent liabilities as of the date of preparation of the financial statements  and of revenues and expenses for the period.These estimates and judgments are updated continuously based on past experience and on various other factors considered reasonable in view of the situation prevailing as of February 28  2022 and are the basis for the assessments of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities. Unpredictability generated by Covid-19 pandemic made the use of estimations and hypothesis a key factor in the establishment of the consolidated financial statements.Final amounts may differ substantially from these estimates if assumptions or circumstances change.Significant items subject to such estimates and assumptions are the same as those described in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended August 31  2021 (valuation of current and non-current assets  assessment of deferred tax assets recoverability  valuation of financial assets measured at fair value  provisions ‚Äì including uncertain tax treatments ‚Äì and litigations  assessment of the lease term in measuring the lease liabilities and related right-of-use assets  post-employment defined benefit plan assets and liabilities  and share-based payments).Note 3.Main changes in scope of consolidation1 Business combinationsDuring the First Half Fiscal 2022  goodwill totaling 129 million euros was recognized  mainly on the acquisition of Frontline Food Services in the United States of America in February 2022 for On-site Services and Wedoogift goodwill adjustment in France for Benefits & Rewards Services.The remaining goodwill change corresponds to exchange rates differences.The table below shows the impact of newly consolidated entities. It includes the values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as provisionally estimated as of February 28  2022:(in millions of euros) FEBRUARY 28  2022 Intangible assets 1 Property  plant and equipment 33 Financial assets 2 Trade receivables 39 Cash and cash equivalents 67 Income tax payable ‚Äî Trade and other payables (110) Net deferred tax ‚Äî TOTAL IDENTIFIABLE NET ASSETS 34 CONSIDERATION TRANSFERRED (1) 163 GOODWILL (2) 129(1) Including 55 million euros increase during corresponding to the increase of liabilities recognized in connection with written put options over non-controlling interests in certain subsidiaries.(2) Goodwill is recognized as the difference between acquisition price and identifiable net assets at fair value. It principally represents the savoir-faire and expertise of employees and synergies expected from acquired companies.Business combinations impacts the Cash flow statement as follows:Price paid during the period (109) Cash acquired 68 Business combinations (41)Companies consolidated during the First Half Fiscal 2022 were integrated from the date of acquisition and contributed for 6 million euros to consolidated revenue and for 1 million euros to the consolidated underlying operating profit of the period.2 Disposed or held for sales activitiesThe Group continued its portfolio rationalization by disposing a certain number of activities  resulting in a net loss on disposal of 1 million euros recognized in ""Other operating income and expenses"" during the First Half Fiscal 2022 (see note 4.2.2 ""Other operating income and expenses"").Assets and liabilities classified as ‚ÄúAssets held for sale‚Äù for 331 million euros and ‚ÄúLiabilities directly associated with assets held for sale‚Äù for 177 million euros mainly concern Childcare activities in France and in Spain  for which the Group has announced on July 27  2021  to have entered exclusive negotiations in relation with their disposal with the group Grandir. The transaction closed in March 2022 (see note 9.5 ""Subsequent events""). As the fair value of the assets held for sale is higher than the carrying value  no impairment has been recorded for these assets in the consolidated financial statements as of February 28  2022.Note 4.Segment information and other operating items1 Segment informationThe segment information presented below has been prepared based on internal management data as monitored by the Group Executive Committee  which is Sodexo‚Äôs chief operating decision-maker: On-site Services and Benefits & Rewards Services.For On-site Services  Revenue and Underlying operating profit are followed by global client segments. These global client segments meet the definition of operating segments in IFRS 8.Sodexo‚Äôs operating segments and groups of operating segments are as follows:On-site Services: Business & Administrations  which includes Corporate Services  Energy & Resources  Government & Agencies  Sports & Leisure and other non-segmented activities  Healthcare  combined with Seniors  Education  comprising Schools and Universities;Benefits & Rewards Services.The operating segments that have been aggregated carry out similar operations ‚Äì both in terms of type of services rendered and the processes and methods used to deliver the services ‚Äì and have similar economic characteristics (notably in terms of the margins they generate).Segment assets and liabilities are not presented as they are not included in the chief operating decision-maker‚Äôs measurement of segment performance.No single Group client or contract accounts contribute for more than 2% of the consolidated revenues.1.1 By business segmentFIRST HALF FISCAL 2022(in millions of euros) ON-SITE SERVICES BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATIONS HEALTHCARE & SENIORS EDUCATION BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES ELIMINATIONSAND CORPORATE EXPENSES GROUP TOTAL Revenues (third-party) 9 865 5 160 2 675 2 030 397 ‚Äî 10 262 Inter-segment sales (Group) ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî 1 (1) ‚Äî TOTAL REVENUES 9 865 5 160 2 675 2 030 398 (1) 10 262 Underlying operating profit* 481 138 171 172 106 (50) 538* Including Group‚Äôs share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method that directly contribute to the Group‚Äôs business and excluding other operating income and expenses.FIRST HALF FISCAL 2021(in millions of euros) ON-SITE SERVICES BUSINESS & ADMINISTRATIONS HEALTHCARE & SENIORS EDUCATION BENEFITS & REWARDS SERVICES ELIMINATIONSAND CORPORATE EXPENSES GROUP TOTAL Revenues (third-party) 8 238 4 280 2 338 1 620 357 ‚Äî 8 595 Inter-segment sales (Group) ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî 2 (2) ‚Äî TOTAL REVENUES 8 238 4 280 2 338 1 620 359 (2) 8 595 Underlying operating profit* 235 16 149 69 85 (55) 265* Including Group‚Äôs share of profit of companies accounted for using the equity method that directly contribute to the Group‚Äôs business and excluding other operating income and expenses.1.2 By significant countryThe Group‚Äôs operations are spread across 55 countries  including three that each represent over 10% of consolidated revenues in First Half Fiscal 2022: France (the Group‚Äôs registration country)  the United States and the United Kingdom.

The Group has also analyzed the evolution since August 31  2021  of the main financial parameters (discount rate and long-term growth rate).Despite the uncertainty around the evolution of the pandemic  the Group‚Äôs management has concluded that there was no evidence of triggers indicating a decrease in the recoverable value of its operating segments as of February 28  2022  compared to August 31  2021. The annual review of the carrying amount of goodwill and other intangible assets will be realized during the Second Half Fiscal 2022.Note 6.Provisions  litigation  and contingent liabilities1 Provisions(in millions of euros) AUGUST 31  2021 INCREASES/CHARGES REVERSALS WITH UTILIZATION REVERSALS WITHOUT UTILIZATION CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT AND OTHER CHANGES IN SCOPE OF CONSOLIDATION FEBRUARY 28  2022 Reorganization costs 67 2 (31) (4) ‚Äî 0 34 Employee claims and litigation 56 7 (6) (6) 1 0 53 Tax and social security exposures 30 1 (1) ‚Äî 1 ‚Äî 32 Contract termination and loss-making contracts 27 3 (7) (4) 1 ‚Äî 20 Client/supplier claims and litigation 23 16 (6) ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî 33 Negative net assets of associates (1) 6 ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî 0 ‚Äî 7 Other provisions 45 3 (1) (2) 1 0 46 TOTAL PROVISIONS 254 34 (51) (17) 5 ‚Äî 225(1) Investments in companies accounted for using the equity method that have negative net assets.Provisions for exposures and litigation are determined on a case-by-case basis and rely on management‚Äôs best estimate of the outflows deemed likely to satisfy legal or implicit obligations to which the Group is exposed as of the end of the fiscal year.2 Litigation and contingent liabilitiesDisputes with the Brazilian tax authoritiesThe Group is in dispute with the Brazilian tax authorities regarding the tax deductibility of the amortization of goodwill recognized on the purchase of VR in March 2008. For the record  in Fiscal year 2017  Sodexo Pass do Brasil received a tax reassessment notice from the Brazilian tax authorities for fiscal years 2010  2011 and 2012 relating to the deductibility for tax purposes of the amortization of goodwill recognized on the purchase of VR in March 2008. The reassessment amounted to 93 million euros (breaking down as 25 million euros in principal and 68 million euros in penalties and late payment interest).Sodexo Pass do Brasil is firmly disputing this reassessment  which the Brazilian tax authorities originally envisaged during a previous tax audit covering fiscal years 2008 and 2009 but then abandoned. The Group considers that the goodwill amortization was valid  both in terms of its underlying reasons and the way it has been recorded. Therefore  the Group considers that there is a strong probability of winning the dispute with the tax authorities  and this has been confirmed by its tax advisors. Consequently  no provision was recorded for this dispute in the statement of financial position as of August 31  2017.This dispute was presented on August 14  2018  for a judgment of the competent administrative court. The court ruled in favor of Sodexo Pass do Brasil as it considered that the goodwill and corresponding tax amortization were legitimately recognized on the acquisition of VR. The judgment therefore confirms that Sodexo Pass do Brasil acquired a full business structure when it purchased VR.This judgment can be reversed on appeal. The Group believes  after consulting its advisors  that the risk of change in this judgement is low.The tax savings generated by this tax depreciation were offset in the combined accounts of the Group by a deferred tax expense of the same amount for each of the financial periods concerned  in accordance with the IFRS rules. The deferred tax liability related to the reassessed periods amounts to 25 million euros as of First Half Fiscal 2022 (24 million euros as of August 31  2021).Dispute with the French competition authorityOn October 9  2015  the company Octoplus filed a complaint with the French Competition Authority (Autorit√© de la concurrence) concerning several French meal voucher issuers  including Sodexo Pass France. Following the hearing of the parties concerned in April and July 2016  the Competition Authority decided on October 6  2016  to continue the proceedings  without ordering interim measures against Sodexo Pass France.On February 27  2019  the prosecution services sent their final investigation report to Sodexo Pass France. In its response filed on April 29  2019  the Group contested both of the grievances notified by the Authority (exchange of information and foreclosure of the meal voucher market through the Centrale de R√®glement des Titres). On December 17  2019  the French Competition Authority ruled against the meal voucher issuers and fined Sodexo Pass France  jointly and severally with Sodexo S.A.  126 million euros. This decision was formally notified to Sodexo Pass France and Sodexo S.A. on February 6  2020. Sodexo vigorously contests this decision considering that it demonstrates a flawed understanding of the practices in question and of the way in which the market operates. Sodexo has therefore lodged an appeal against the decision with the Paris Court of Appeal. The hearing was held on November 18  2021  and the Court of Appeal is expected to render its decision on November 24  2022. Given the significant impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the Group's activities and performance  Sodexo obtained a decision from the State collection services allowing it to defer payment of the fine until December 15  2021  without any penalty being due  subject to providing a bank guarantee  and from that date a monthly settlement plan until the decision of the Court of Appeal.Dispute in HungaryFollowing legislative and regulatory changes to the issuance of food and meal voucher market in Hungary  Sodexo made an application to the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) in July 2014 for arbitration proceedings to be commenced against the Hungarian state.The ICSID issued its decision on January 28  2019  ordering the Hungarian State to pay compensation in an amount of 73 million euros to Sodexo  together with accrued interest from December 31  2011.On May 27  2019  the Hungarian State lodged an appeal against this decision  which was rejected by the ICSID on May 7  2021  thereby definitively confirming its decision of January 28  2019  and the obligation of the Hungarian state to compensate Sodexo in accordance with international law.The Hungarian State paid an indemnity in an amount of 33.5 million euros to Sodexo Pass International on December 31  2021  in consideration of the prejudice caused as a result of the expropriation by the Hungarian state of Sodexo Pass International‚Äôs investment in Hungary further to the legislative and regulatory changes implemented by the Hungarian State in the issuance of food and meal voucher market in Hungary.This payment definitively puts an end to the dispute between them with regard to the ICSID arbitration award. An income of 33.5 million euros has been recognized accordingly in other operating income in First Half Fiscal 2022 (see note 4.2.2 Other operating income and expenses)French tax reassessmentSodexo S.A. received in December 2021 a notification for proposed tax reassessments concerning Fiscal 2016  Fiscal 2017 and Fiscal 2018. After review with its tax advisors  the Company considers that it has strong arguments to contest the major part of the proposed reassessments.Other disputesGroup subsidiaries can also be subject to tax audits certain of which may result in reassessments.

April 1  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- UCB today announced that new data from its expansive and innovative neurology portfolio will be presented at the 74th American Academy of Neurology (AAN) Annual Meeting  from April 2-7  2022.Twelve scientific abstracts have been accepted including data from UCB's epilepsy portfolio and Parkinson's disease development program.""At UCB  we are inspired to develop new solutions that help transform the lives of people living with severe neurological disorders. Our world-class scientists make this ambition possible  advancing our understanding of human biology and driving breakthroughs in areas of science "" said Charl van Zyl  Executive Vice President Neurology & Head of Europe/International Markets at UCB. ""We are excited to showcase the scale and passion of our commitment at AAN  building on our legacy and expertise in epilepsy  myasthenia gravis  and Parkinson's disease.""EpilepsyAt the congress  UCB will be reporting data from several significant clinical epilepsy studies from its broad epilepsy portfolio. Notably  these data include real-world  retrospective  interim evidence evaluating the effectiveness and tolerability of brivaracetam for adult patients with partial-onset seizures  in routine clinical practice in a large multicenter international patient population as well as prospective U.S. RWE data. In the U.S.  brivaracetam is approved for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older.2Additionally  presented data will evaluate dose-response relationships for the impact of fenfluramine on everyday executive function in patients  as captured using the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF¬Æ). In the U.S.  fenfluramine is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.1Data will also summarize the early use of midazolam nasal spray in patients with seizure clusters. In the U.S.  midazolam nasal spray is indicated for the acute treatment of intermittent  stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e.  seizure clusters  acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient's usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older.5 Please see IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION  including Boxed Warning  below.Two podium presentations will also be taking place during the congress  highlighting the long-term evidence of the cardiovascular safety profile of fenfluramine. Please note that fenfluramine is available only through the REMS Program due to the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.

BRIVIACT was approved as monotherapy for adults in September 2017   and as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in patients four years of age and older with partial-onset seizures in 2018. In August 2021   BRIVIACT was approved for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients as young as one month of age. BRIVIACT is available in three formulations: oral tablets  oral solution  and intravenous (IV) injection. More information is available at [email protected] : FDA-Approved Drugs.BRIVIACT IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSSuicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs  including BRIVIACT  increase the risk of suicidal behavior and ideation.

BRIVIACT is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to brivaracetam or any of the inactive ingredients. Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with all antiepileptic drugs  BRIVIACT should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn adult adjunctive therapy placebo-controlled clinical trials  the most common adverse reactions (at least 5% for BRIVIACT and at least 2% more frequently than placebo) were somnolence and sedation  dizziness  fatigue  and nausea and vomiting symptoms. Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies of pediatric patients were generally similar to those in adult patients. Adverse reactions with BRIVIACT injection in adult and pediatric patients were generally similar to those observed with BRIVIACT tablets. Other adverse events that occurred in adult patients who received BRIVIACT injection included dysgeusia  euphoric mood  feeling drunk  and infusion site pain.BRIVIACT is a Schedule V controlled substance.Please refer to the full U.S. Prescribing Information and visit www.BRIVIACThcp.com.Important Safety Information about BRIVIACT¬Æ in the EU and EEA3BRIVIACT¬Æ (brivaracetam) is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy. Contraindications Hypersensitivity to the active substance  other pyrrolidone derivatives or any of the excipients. Special warnings and precautions for use Suicidal ideation and behaviour have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in several indications  including BRIVIACT¬Æ. Patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviour and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers) should be advised to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal ideation or behaviour emerge. BRIVIACT¬Æ film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance  total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take BRIVIACT¬Æ. Brivaracetam film-coated tablets  solution for injection/infusion and oral solution contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per tablet/vial/ml respectively  that is to say essentially 'sodium free'. The oral solution contains 168 mg sorbitol (E420) in each ml. Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take this medicinal product. The oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218)  which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). Brivaracetam oral solution contains propylene glycol (E1520). Posology No dose adjustment is needed in adults with impaired renal function. Based on data in adults  no dose adjustment is necessary neither in paediatric patients with impaired renal function. No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with renal impairment. In patients with hepatic impairment  the following adjusted doses  administered in 2 divided doses  approximately 12 hours apart  are recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment: In adults  adolescents and children weighing ‚â•50 kg  a 50 mg/day starting dose is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 150 mg/day. For adolescents and children weighing from 20 kg to <50 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day starting dose is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 3 mg/kg/day. For children weighing from 10 kg to <20 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day starting dose is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 4 mg/kg/day. No clinical data are available in paediatric patients with hepatic impairment.Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction. With co-administration of BRIVIACT¬Æ 200 mg single dose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy subjects there was no pharmacokinetic interaction  but the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function  attention and memory was doubled. Intake of BRIVIACT¬Æ with alcohol is not recommended. Limited clinical data are available implying that coadministration of cannabidiol may increase the plasma exposure of brivaracetam  possibly through CYP2C19 inhibition  but the clinical relevance is uncertain. In healthy subjects  co-administration with rifampicin  a strong enzyme-inducer (600 mg/day for 5 days)  decreased BRIVIACT¬Æ area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by 45%. Prescribers should consider adjusting the dose of BRIVIACT¬Æ for patients starting or ending treatment with rifampicin. Other strong enzyme-inducers (such as St John¬¥s wort [Hypericum perforatum]) may also decrease the systemic exposure of BRIVIACT¬Æ. Therefore  starting or ending treatment with St John's wort should be done with caution. In vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms except for CYP2C19. Brivaracetam may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g.  lansoprazole  omeprazole  diazepam). CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and BRIVIACT¬Æ may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 (e.g. efavirenz). In vitro studies have also shown that BRIVIACT¬Æ has inhibitory effects on OAT3. BRIVIACT¬Æ 200 mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products transported by OAT3. BRIVIACT¬Æ plasma concentrations are decreased when co-administered with strong enzyme inducing antiepileptic drugs (carbamazepine  phenobarbital  phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required. Effects on ability to drive and use machines BRIVIACT¬Æ  has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of BRIVIACT¬Æ  on their ability to perform such activities. Undesirable effects. The most frequently reported adverse reactions with BRIVIACT¬Æ (reported by >10% of patients) were somnolence (14.3%) and dizziness (11.0%). They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Somnolence and fatigue were reported at higher incidences with increasing dose. Very common adverse reactions (‚â•1% to <10%) were influenza  decreased appetite  depression  anxiety  insomnia  irritability  convulsion  vertigo  upper respiratory tract infections  cough  nausea  vomiting  constipation and fatigue. Neutropenia has been reported in 0.5% (6/1 099) BRIVIACT¬Æ patients and 0% (0/459) placebo-treated patients. Four of these patients had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline  and experienced additional decrease in neutrophil counts after initiation of BRIVIACT¬Æ. None of the six cases were severe  required any specific treatment  led to BRIVIACT¬Æ discontinuation or had associated infections. Suicidal ideation was reported in 0.3 % (3/1099) of BRIVIACT¬Æ treated patients and 0.7 % (3/459) of placebo-treated patients. In short-term clinical studies of BRIVIACT¬Æ in patients with epilepsy  there were no cases of completed suicide and suicide attempt  however both were reported in the long-term open-label extension studies. Reactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of BRIVIACT¬Æ patients (9/3022) during clinical development. The safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children from 1 month of age was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. In the open label  uncontrolled  long-term studies suicidal ideation was reported in 4.7 % of paediatric patients assessed from 6 years onwards (more common in adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioural disorders were reported in 24.8 % of paediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority of events were mild or moderate in intensity  were non-serious  and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. An additional adverse reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity (4.7 %). No specific pattern of adverse event (AE) was identified in children from 1 month to < 4 years of age when compared to older paediatric age groups. No significant safety information was identified indicating the increasing incidence of a particular AE in this age group. As data available in children younger than 2 years of age are limited  brivaracetam is not indicated in this age range. No clinical data are available in neonates. Overdose There is limited clinical experience with BRIVIACT¬Æ overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness were reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1 400 mg of BRIVIACT¬Æ. The following adverse reactions were reported with brivaracetam overdose: nausea  vertigo  balance disorder  anxiety  fatigue  irritability  aggression  insomnia  depression  and suicidal ideation in the post-marketing experience. In general  the adverse reactions associated with brivaracetam overdose were consistent with the known adverse reactions. There is no specific antidote. Treatment of an overdose should include general supportive measures. Since less than 10% of BRIVIACT¬Æ is excreted in urine  haemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance BRIVIACT¬Æ clearance.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information. Date of revision: 24 February 2022http://www.ema.europa.eu/About FINTEPLA¬Æ (fenfluramine)Important Safety Information about FINTEPLA¬Æ (fenfluramine) oral solution  CIV in the U.S.1INDICATIONS AND USAGEFINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5‚ÄìHT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSAdministration to patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact Zogenix Inc. at 1-866-964-3649 (1-866-Zogenix) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.Important Safety Information about FINTEPLA¬Æ in the EU and EEA4ContraindicationsHypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.

Pulmonary arterial hypertension. 4 Within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to an increased risk of serotonin syndromeSpecial warnings and precautions for useAortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertensionBecause of reported cases of valvular heart disease that may have been caused by fenfluramine at higher doses used to treat adult obesity  cardiac monitoring must be performed using echocardiography. In the controlled clinical studies of fenfluramine for the treatment of Dravet syndrome  no valvular heart disease was observed.Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to establish a baseline prior to initiating treatment (see section 4.3) and exclude any pre-existing valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension.Echocardiogram monitoring should be conducted every 6 months for the first 2 years and annually thereafter. If an echocardiogram indicates pathological valvular changes  a follow-up echocardiogram should be considered at an earlier timeframe to evaluate whether the abnormality is persistent. If pathological abnormalities on the echocardiogram are observed  it is recommended to evaluate the benefit versus risk of continuing fenfluramine treatment with the prescriber  caregiver  and cardiologist.If treatment is stopped because of aortic or mitral valvular heart disease  appropriate monitoring and follow-up should be provided in accordance with local guidelines for the treatment of aortic or mitral valvular heart disease.With past use in higher doses to treat adult obesity  fenfluramine was reported to be associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension. Pulmonary arterial hypertension was not observed in the clinical programme  but because of the low incidence of this disease  the clinical trial experience with fenfluramine is inadequate to determine if fenfluramine increases the risk for pulmonary arterial hypertension in patients with Dravet syndrome.If echocardiogram findings are suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension  a repeat echocardiogram should be performed as soon as possible and within 3 months to confirm these findings. If the echocardiogram finding is confirmed suggestive of an increased probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension defined as ""intermediate probability"" by the 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Respiratory Society (ERS) Guidelines  it should lead to a benefit-risk evaluation of continuation of Fintepla by the prescriber  carer  and cardiologist. If the echocardiogram finding  after confirmation  suggests of a high probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension  as defined by the 2015 ESC and ERS Guidelines  it is recommended fenfluramine treatment should be stopped.Decreased appetite and weight lossFenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss (see section 4.8). An additive effect on decreased appetite can occur when fenfluramine is combined with other anti-epileptic medicines  for example stiripentol. The decrease in weight appears to be dose related. Most subjects resumed weight gain over time while continuing treatment. The patient's weight should be monitored. A benefit risk evaluation should be undertaken prior to commencing treatment with fenfluramine in patients with a history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa.Fintepla controlled access programmeA controlled access programme has been created to 1) prevent off-label use in weight management in obese patients and 2) confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla.SomnolenceFenfluramine can cause somnolence.Other central nervous system depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate the somnolence effect of fenfluramine (see sections 4.5 and 4.7).Suicidal behaviour and ideationSuicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicines in several indications. A meta-analysis of randomised placebo-controlled trials with anti-epileptic medicines that did not include fenfluramine has shown a small increased risk of suicidal behaviour and ideation. The mechanism of this risk is not known  and the available data do not exclude the possibility of an increased risk for fenfluramine. Patients and caregivers of patients should be advised to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation emerge.Serotonin syndromeAs with other serotonergic agents  serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with fenfluramine treatment  particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents (including SSRIs  SNRIs  tricyclic antidepressants  or triptans); with agents that impair metabolism of serotonin such as MAOIs; or with antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).Serotonin syndrome symptoms may include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular aberrations (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhoea).If concomitant treatment with fenfluramine and other serotonergic agents that may affect the serotonergic systems is clinically warranted  careful observation of the patient is advised  particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases.Increased seizure frequencyAs with other anti-epileptic medicines  a clinically relevant increase in seizure frequency may occur during treatment with fenfluramine  which may require adjustment in the dose of fenfluramine and/or concomitant anti-epileptic medicines  or discontinuation of fenfluramine  should the benefit-risk be negative.CyproheptadineCyproheptadine is a potent serotonin receptor antagonist and may therefore decrease the efficacy of fenfluramine. If cyproheptadine is added to treatment with fenfluramine  patients should be monitored for worsening of seizures. If fenfluramine treatment is initiated in a patient taking cyproheptadine  fenfluramine's efficacy may be reduced.GlaucomaFenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Discontinue therapy in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity. Consider discontinuation if there is ocular pain and another cause cannot be determined.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducersCo-administration with strong CYP1A2 inducers or CYP2B6 inducers may decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations (see section 4.5).An increase in fenfluramine dosage should be considered when co-administered with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer; the maximum daily dose should not be exceeded.ExcipientsThis medicinal product contains sodium ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 219) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed).It also contains sulfur dioxide (E 220) which may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm.Patients with rare glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product.This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per the maximum daily dose of 12 mL  that is to say essentially 'sodium-free'.This medicinal product contains glucose which may be harmful to the teeth.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information. Date of revision: 04 Nov 2021.https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/fintepla-epar-product-information_en.pdfThis medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.About NAYZILAM¬Æ (midazolam) nasal spray  CIV in the U.S.5NAYZILAM is a benzodiazepine indicated for the acute treatment of intermittent  stereotypic episodes of frequent seizure activity (i.e.  seizure clusters  acute repetitive seizures) that are distinct from a patient's usual seizure pattern in patients with epilepsy 12 years of age and older.NAYZILAM IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSNAYZILAM is contraindicated in patients with acute narrow-angle glaucoma.RISKS FROM CONCOMITANT USE WITH OPIOIDSConcomitant use of benzodiazepines  including NAYZILAM  and opioids may result in profound sedation  respiratory depression  coma  and death. Reserve concomitant prescribing of these drugs for patients for whom alternative treatment options are inadequate. Limit dosages and durations to the minimum required. Follow patients for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and sedation.ABUSE  MISUSE  AND ADDICTIONThe use of benzodiazepines  including NAYZILAM  exposes users to risks of abuse  misuse  and addiction  which can lead to overdose or death. Abuse and misuse of benzodiazepines commonly involve concomitant use of other medications  alcohol  and/or illicit substances  which is associated with an increased frequency of serious adverse outcomes. Before prescribing NAYZILAM and throughout treatment  assess each patient's risk for abuse  misuse  and addiction.DEPENDENCE AND WITHDRAWAL REACTIONS AFTER USE OF NAYZILAM MORE FREQUENTLY THAN RECOMMENDEDThe continued use of benzodiazepines may lead to clinically significant physical dependence. The risks of dependence and withdrawal increase with longer treatment duration and higher daily dose. Although NAYZILAM is indicated only for intermittent use  if used more frequently than recommended  abrupt discontinuation or rapid dosage reduction of NAYZILAM may precipitate acute withdrawal reactions  which can be life-threatening. For patients using NAYZILAM more frequently than recommended  to reduce the risk of withdrawal reactions  use a gradual taper to discontinue NAYZILAM.Risks of Cardiorespiratory Adverse ReactionsSerious cardiorespiratory adverse reactions have occurred after administration of midazolam. Warn patients and caregivers about the risks of respiratory depression  cardiac and respiratory arrest.Respiratory depression was observed with the administration of NAYZILAM during clinical trials. Cardiac or respiratory arrest caused by NAYZILAM was not reported during clinical trials.Central Nervous System Depression from Concomitant Use with Other Central Nervous System Depressants  or Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 InhibitorsDrug products containing midazolam  including NAYZILAM  have a central nervous system (CNS) depressant effect.Risks from Concomitant Use with Other CNS DepressantsNAYZILAM may cause an increased CNS-depressant effect when used with alcohol or other CNS depressants (e.g.  opioids). Warn patients and caregivers that the use of NAYZILAM in combination with alcohol or other CNS depressant drugs may increase the risk of hypoventilation  airway obstruction  desaturation  or apnea and may contribute to profound and/or prolonged drug effect.Risks from Concomitant Use with Moderate or Strong CYP3A4 InhibitorsConcomitant use of NAYZILAM with moderate or strong CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitors may result in prolonged sedation because of a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam. Caution patients against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring mental alertness  such as operating machinery  driving a motor vehicle or riding a bicycle until they have completely returned to their level of baseline functioning.Suicidal Behavior and IdeationAntiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including NAYZILAM  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behavior in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Monitor patients treated with NAYZILAM for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behavior  and/or any unusual changes in mood or behavior. Advise patients and caregivers to be alert for these behavioral changes and to immediately report them to the healthcare provider.Impaired Cognitive FunctionMidazolam  including NAYZILAM  is associated with a high incidence of partial or complete impairment of recall for several hours following an administered dose. Counsel patients on when they can engage in activities requiring complete mental alertness  operate hazardous machinery  or drive a motor vehicle after taking NAYZILAM.GlaucomaBenzodiazepines  including NAYZILAM  can increase intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. NAYZILAM may be used in patients with open-angle glaucoma only if they are receiving appropriate therapy. NAYZILAM is contraindicated in patients with narrow-angle glaucoma.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn the randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial  the most common adverse reactions (‚â•5% in any NAYZILAM treatment group) were somnolence  headache  nasal discomfort  throat irritation  and rhinorrhea.NAYZILAM is a Schedule IV controlled substance.Please refer to the full Prescribing Information.For additional medical information about NAYZILAM  patient assistance  or any other information please visit our website or call UCBCares¬Æ at 1-844-599-2273.About UCB0599UCB0599 is an orally administered  brain penetrant  small molecule inhibitor of ASYN misfolding under investigation for the potential use as a disease-modifying treatment to slow the progression of PD.6 7 UCB0599 was discovered by NeuroPore and was licenced to UCB in 2014 for further development.6 In 2021  UCB entered into a global co-development and co-commercialization agreement with Novartis covering UCB0599.8For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.9414[email protected]Corporate CommunicationsCorporate CommunicationsLaurent Schots  Media RelationsT+32.2.559.9264[email protected]Nick FrancisT +44 7769 307745[email protected]Allyson Funk (U.S. Media)T +678 365 6321[email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces new data from the pivotal Phase II/III trial of leniolisib for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) syndrome (APDS)  a primary immunodeficiency. Principal Investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  shared the findings in a presentation at the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) 2022 Annual Meeting.As announced on February 2  2022  the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized  Phase III portion of the clinical trial  conducted by Novartis  met its co-primary endpoints  which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of na√Øve B cells are important in this population  as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers. Presented for the first time at CIS  the co-primary endpoints at day 85 after baseline demonstrated:In the index lymphadenopathy lesions  a statistically significant adjusted mean change in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) of -0.30 among patients who received leniolisib compared with -0.06 among patients who received placebo (95% CI: -0.37  -0.11; p=0.0012).From a baseline level of ÀÇ48%  an increase of 34.76% in the proportion of na√Øve B cells in patients who received leniolisib versus a -5.37% decrease in patients who received placebo (95% CI: 28.51  51.75; pÀÇ0.0001).The study drug was well-tolerated. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Charlotte Cunningham-Rundles  M.D.  Ph.D.  David S. Gottesman Professor of Immunology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York  said:""It is great news that leniolisib has achieved such positive results in this Phase III study in APDS. It is extremely encouraging to see that this medication is capable of targeting the cause of this difficult disease  both improving care and reducing patients' symptoms. Progress toward a treatment that is tailor-made for our patients with APDS is a milestone we have long awaited.""Pharming plans to begin submitting global regulatory filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""Pharming is delighted that leniolisib achieved significance in both co-primary endpoints and was well tolerated in these APDS patients  as the product's approval would address an unmet need for those with this rare disease  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. In addition to working closely with regulatory authorities across the globe to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients  we will continue to develop this treatment through our open-label extension study and two additional studies that will enroll children under the age of 12  as well as potentially extending the geographic reach of the product.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. is a global  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative protein replacement therapies and precision medicines for the treatment of rare diseases and unmet medical needs.The flagship of our portfolio is our recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) franchise. C1INH is a naturally occurring protein that down regulates the complement and contact cascades in order to control inflammation in affected tissues.Our lead product  RUCONEST¬Æ  is the first and only plasma-free rhC1INH protein replacement therapy. It is approved for the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks. We are commercializing RUCONEST¬Æ in the United States  the European Union and the United Kingdom through our own sales and marketing organization  and the rest of the world through our distribution network.In addition  we are investigating the clinical efficacy of rhC1INH in the treatment of further indications  including pre-eclampsia  acute kidney injury and severe pneumonia as a result of COVID-19 infections.We are also studying our oral precision medicine  leniolisib (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta  or PI3K delta  inhibitor)  for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome  or APDS. World-wide rights for leniolisib were licensed from Novartis AG in 2019. Leniolisib met both of its primary end points in a registration enabling Phase 2/3 study in the United States and Europe. We are targeting global regulatory filings for leniolisib from Q2 2022 onwards.Additionally  we entered into a strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex-vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of HAE.Furthermore  we are leveraging our transgenic manufacturing technology to develop next-generation protein replacement therapies  most notably for Pompe disease  which is currently in preclinical development.Forward-looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements  including with respect to timing and progress of Pharming's preclinical studies and clinical trials of its product candidates  Pharming's clinical and commercial prospects  Pharming's ability to overcome the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the conduct of its business  and Pharming's expectations regarding its projected working capital requirements and cash resources.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces new data from the pivotal Phase II/III trial of leniolisib for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KŒ¥) syndrome (APDS)  a primary immunodeficiency. Principal Investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  shared the findings in a presentation at the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) 2022 Annual Meeting.As announced on February 2  2022  the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized  Phase III portion of the clinical trial  conducted by Novartis  met its co-primary endpoints  which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of na√Øve B cells are important in this population  as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers. Presented for the first time at CIS  the co-primary endpoints at day 85 after baseline demonstrated:In the index lymphadenopathy lesions  a statistically significant adjusted mean change in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) of -0.30 among patients who received leniolisib compared with -0.06 among patients who received placebo (95% CI: -0.37  -0.11; p=0.0012).From a baseline level of ÀÇ48%  an increase of 34.76% in the proportion of na√Øve B cells in patients who received leniolisib versus a -5.37% decrease in patients who received placebo (95% CI: 28.51  51.75; pÀÇ0.0001).The study drug was well-tolerated. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Charlotte Cunningham-Rundles  M.D.  Ph.D.  David S. Gottesman Professor of Immunology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York  said:""It is great news that leniolisib has achieved such positive results in this Phase III study in APDS. It is extremely encouraging to see that this medication is capable of targeting the cause of this difficult disease  both improving care and reducing patients' symptoms. Progress toward a treatment that is tailor-made for our patients with APDS is a milestone we have long awaited.""Pharming plans to begin submitting global regulatory filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""Pharming is delighted that leniolisib achieved significance in both co-primary endpoints and was well tolerated in these APDS patients  as the product's approval would address an unmet need for those with this rare disease  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. In addition to working closely with regulatory authorities across the globe to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients  we will continue to develop this treatment through our open-label extension study and two additional studies that will enroll children under the age of 12  as well as potentially extending the geographic reach of the product.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Œ¥ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KŒ¥ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KŒ¥ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KŒ± and PI3KŒ≤  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3K·∫ü and PI3KŒ≥ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3K·∫ü in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3K·∫ü is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. is a global  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative protein replacement therapies and precision medicines for the treatment of rare diseases and unmet medical needs.The flagship of our portfolio is our recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) franchise. C1INH is a naturally occurring protein that down regulates the complement and contact cascades in order to control inflammation in affected tissues.Our lead product  RUCONEST¬Æ  is the first and only plasma-free rhC1INH protein replacement therapy. It is approved for the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks. We are commercializing RUCONEST¬Æ in the United States  the European Union and the United Kingdom through our own sales and marketing organization  and the rest of the world through our distribution network.In addition  we are investigating the clinical efficacy of rhC1INH in the treatment of further indications  including pre-eclampsia  acute kidney injury and severe pneumonia as a result of COVID-19 infections.We are also studying our oral precision medicine  leniolisib (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta  or PI3K delta  inhibitor)  for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome  or APDS. World-wide rights for leniolisib were licensed from Novartis AG in 2019. Leniolisib met both of its primary end points in a registration enabling Phase 2/3 study in the United States and Europe. We are targeting global regulatory filings for leniolisib from Q2 2022 onwards.Additionally  we entered into a strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex-vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of HAE.Furthermore  we are leveraging our transgenic manufacturing technology to develop next-generation protein replacement therapies  most notably for Pompe disease  which is currently in preclinical development.Forward-looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements  including with respect to timing and progress of Pharming's preclinical studies and clinical trials of its product candidates  Pharming's clinical and commercial prospects  Pharming's ability to overcome the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the conduct of its business  and Pharming's expectations regarding its projected working capital requirements and cash resources.

The Remuneration Policy aims also to align the interests of the Senior Management with those of the Company's shareholders.In this respect  there must be transparency and alignment to the delivery of strategic objectives  both at the group and individual level. There must also be scope for the reward of exceptional efforts and achievements that deliver value to the group and the shareholders.The remuneration offered by the Company shall be competitive and in line with market practice. It shall be designed to support the Company's strategy and interests  through different mechanisms. In particular  besides the fixed salary and other benefits in kind  it may include the following variable components for those members of the Senior Management who do not sit on the Board of Directors of the Company:‚Ä¢ a possible cash variable component  in connection with the attainment of short-terms business goals (performance criteria will be applied  in connection with associated financial or non-financial goals  sometimes linked to the targets communicated to the market  to be achieved on certain quarters or on a yearly basis);‚Ä¢ a possible share-based incentive scheme  to secure a strong ongoing alignment with the shareholders  through the Company's share price performance  in order to safeguard the Company's long-term interests.The combination of the above components seeks to create a well-balanced remuneration reflecting individual competences  responsibilities and performance  both short-term and long-term  to the benefit of the Company and its shareholders. In particular  the Company aims to balance equity and cash components  so that unnecessary risk-taking is not encouraged.The remuneration is reviewed annually  considering all elements of the remuneration together to ensure that the remuneration package as a whole remains competitive.TYPES OF REMUNERATIONThe total remuneration of the Senior Management may consist of the following components:Fixed base salaryThe Senior Management's fixed salary shall be competitive  in line with market practice and based on the individual member's competence  responsibilities and performance. While the same principles apply to all employees irrespective of their geographic location  but the actual remuneration depends on local market conditions and may therefore vary by country. Senior Management do not receive remuneration for board assignments in any Group Companies.Purpose:‚Ä¢ Provides a sound basis on which to recruit and retain senior management members of appropriate calibre to deliver the strategic objectives of the Company.‚Ä¢ Reflects the market value of the role and the post holder's experience  competency  and performance within the Company.Operation:The fixed salary is paid monthly in cash via payroll and reviewed on an annual basis for each calendar year. The Remuneration Committee reviews the CEO's fixed base salary  and provides the CEO with a budget to review the fixed base salaries of the senior management team.Benefits in kindThe offered benefits (including  for instance  private health  life insurance and more rarely  housing and school allowances) shall be competitive and cost-effective  in line with mandatory rules or established local practice depending on which law the individual is located. No performance metric applies.PensionCompetitive and cost-effective pension benefits may be offered in line with mandatory rules or established local practice depending on the employee's location of employment.The pension benefit for member of the senior management team may amount to up to 15% of the fixed base salary. No performance metric applies.Cash variable compensation (STI)The Senior Management is offered a cash variable compensation  based on predetermined and measurable performance criteria.Operation:‚Ä¢ The on-target bonus for the CEO is up to 70% of his annual base salary and up to 40% for other senior management team members. Depending on the level of performance achieved  the annual variable remuneration can vary from no variable payment to a maximum of the defined on-target bonus.‚Ä¢ The remuneration committee is responsible to set the CEO's performance criteria  whilst the CEO is responsible to set the performance criteria for senior management team members. The performance criteria applied may be financial or non-financial  corporate  divisional  or individual  and in such proportions as considered appropriate.‚Ä¢ Performance criteria shall be defined  documented  and communicated at the beginning of each financial year. New hires shall receive their performance criteria within 4 weeks after their date of employment.‚Ä¢ After the financial year has ended  the remuneration committee is responsible to evaluate the CEO's achievement rate  and the CEO is responsible to evaluate the senior management's achievement rates.‚Ä¢ The payout of the bonus shall be based on the achievement rate  measured against the agreed and documented performance criteria. When more than one performance criteria have been defined  the average achievement rate shall be used to determine the payout.Achievement Rate Percentage Payout >110% target 100% 100% target 50% 95%-99% of target 25% <95% of target 0%‚Ä¢ The performance criteria in 2022 will be based on the revenue and EBITDA of the Company  as per the 2022 budget approved by the Board of Directors of the Company.‚Ä¢ 50% of the achieved bonus amount is paid within four weeks after the assessment has been completed  documented  and communicated to the employee. The remaining 50% shall be deferred for 6 months and only payable if the receiving employee is actively employed with the Company or any of its companies at the date of payout.‚Ä¢ The Remuneration Committee may at any time withdraw or modify the bonus scheme  and any bonus payment is in the full discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The fact that any participating employees may have received a bonus at any time does not give rise to any expectation or entitlement to receive any bonus in the future  or as to the size of any future bonus.Share-based incentive schemesThe Board of Directors may also propose for the general meeting to resolve on long-term share incentive programs.FURTHER RELEVANT ASPECTSNotice of termination and severance paymentThe maximum notice of termination period in any member of Senior Management's contract is 9 months during which time payment of salary will continue. Upon termination by the company  and in addition to their fixed monthly salary during the notice period  the Senior Management is entitled to a maximum of 6 months' base salary as severance pay. If termination is made by the Senior Management member  the period of notice may not exceed 9 months and there is no right to severance pay.ClawbackIn a situation in which a bonus  or another incentive remuneration has been provided to a member of the Senior Management on the basis of data  information  or accounts which subsequently prove to have been incorrect  the Company may reclaim such remuneration component  in full or in part  on the basis of the correct data.Deviations from this Remuneration PolicyThe Board of Directors is entitled to depart from these guidelines in special circumstances  if any part of the Remuneration Policy no longer drives business performance  the achievement of the Company's strategy or employee motivation and retention.

The options can be exercised during a period of twenty-four (24) months commencing from the first anniversary from the date on which the same options were granted and ending within six (6) months from the third anniversary date from the date on which the same options were granted. If the whole (or substantially the whole) of the business of the Company is transferred to a third party  all unvested options will vest  so that the beneficiaries can exercise all options.The vesting is subject to the participant's continuous employment or assignment by the Company. The Directors shall be entitled  in their discretion  to resolve that a participant (or his/her heirs) may still exercise the options  even though the employment or assignment in the Company (or any of its subsidiaries) has ceased.Issuance of sharesThe Company will satisfy its obligations under the 2022 ESIP Program through the issuance of new shares following the exercise of share options by participants in the 2022 ESIP Program. All of the rights attached to the Company's shares are set out in the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association.Exercise priceEach share option entitles the holder to acquire one share in the Company at an exercise price corresponding to 130 per cent of the volume-weighted average price of the Company's share as quoted on Nasdaq First North Growth Market during a period of 10 trading days calculated as from and including 11 May 2022.Recalculation due to split  consolidation  new share issue  etc.The exercise price and the number of shares that each share option entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue  dividend  etc. in accordance with Swedish market practice.The rationale for the proposalThe Company shall offer remuneration in accordance with market practice which enables the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel. Remunerations within the Company shall be based on principles of performance  competitiveness and fairness. Share based incentive programs may be offered as part of the total compensation package. The Directors are of the opinion that the 2022 ESIP Program is in the best interest of both the Company and its shareholders. The rationale for the 2022 ESIP Program is to achieve a greater alignment of interests between the participants and the shareholders  to create conditions for retaining and recruiting competent persons to the Company and to increase the motivation among the participants in order to maintain and sustain the growth of the Company.CostsThe costs for the 2022 ESIP Program are estimated to amount to approximately EUR 650 000 (it should be noted that no social security costs are expected under current Maltese tax rules) calculated in accordance with IFRS 2. The costs have been estimated based on a share price of SEK 24 at the time of the start of the program and that full allocation and maximum outcome will apply. The costs are expected to have a limited effect on the Company's key ratios.Dilution and information about current outstanding incentive programsUpon maximum exercise of the options under the 2022 ESIP Program  the share capital of the Company will increase by EUR 2 160  1 080 000 new shares will be issued  meaning a dilution of approximately 2.55 per cent of the number of shares and votes in the Company. Currently  the Company has three active incentive programs to certain key employees outstanding which was adopted in 2019  2020 and 2021. Considering the shares which may be issued pursuant to the outstanding incentive programs in the Company  the maximum dilution  including all three programs  if ESIP 2022 is decided at the Meeting and fully allotted  can amount to 5.6 per cent.For more information regarding the Company's current outstanding incentive programs  please see the Company's Annual Report for 2021  which will be made available on the Company's website  www.raketech.com.Preparations of the proposalThe Directors of the Company and the Remuneration Committee have prepared the 2022 ESIP Program. The 2022 ESIP Program has been reviewed by the Directors and by the Remuneration Committee at meetings in March 2022.Majority RequirementA resolution to approve the 2022 ESIP Program is valid only where supported by shareholders holding more than 50 per cent of the voting rights attached to shares represented and entitled to vote at the Meeting.Agenda Item 17; Extraordinary resolution on certain changes to the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of the Company for the purpose of forming a fiscal unit in accordance with the Consolidated Group (Income Tax) Rules (Subsidiary Legislation 123.189 of the laws of MaltaThe Board is proposing the introduction of a new Clause 5(z) to the Memorandum for the purpose of forming a fiscal unit composed of the Company and its subsidiaries  Raketech Group Limited (C 48831) and Casumba Media Limited (C 76055)  in accordance with the Consolidated Group (Income Tax) Rules (Subsidiary Legislation 123.189 of the laws of Malta). On this basis  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves to adopt the following Extraordinary Resolution:""(1) That a new Clause 5(z) be added to the Memorandum of Association of the Company which shall read as follows:""(z) To consolidate the Company's results pursuant to any requirement or right in terms of Maltese law  including but not limited to the Companies Act (Cap. 386  Laws of Malta) and the Income Tax Acts (Cap. 123 and Cap. 372  Laws of Malta).""(2) That the Company's Memorandum and Articles of Association (""M&A"") be updated to reflect the foregoing extraordinary resolution and any other changes that are required in terms of law to reflect any changes that may have taken place since the current version of the M&A was last approved and registered by the Registrar of Companies.(3) That any one director and/or the company secretary  acting singly  be and hereby is  authorised to: (i) issue a certified extract of these resolutions  (ii) sign and file the updated M&A on the Company's behalf with the Registrar of Companies  and (iii) do all things as may be necessary to give effect to these resolutions including inter alia submit any notifications and/or documents as may be necessary to the Commissioner for Inland Revenue and/or any other relevant authorities.Agenda Item 18; Extraordinary Resolution on certain changes to the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of the Company to alter the number of Equity Securities available for issuance by the Directors under Articles 4(b) and 4(c) of the Articles.The Board is proposing an amendment to article 4 of the Articles to: (a) alter the maximum number of Equity Securities which may be issued by the Directors subject to the provisions of article 85 of the Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) (""CA"") as payment for an acquisition of assets by the Company or by any of its subsidiaries after the date of the Meeting and/or as payment to a creditor in settlement of a debt owed by the Company or its subsidiaries after the date of the Meeting; and (b) extend the validity of the authorisation period set out therein until the end of the Company's Annual General Meeting for 2023  subject to the Company's ability in general meeting to renew this permission by ordinary resolution for further maximum periods of 5 years each thereafter.The rationale for these amendments is to ensure that the Company has sufficient flexibility to be able to meet its various obligations to third party investors  sellers and/or creditors. On this basis  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves to adopt the following Extraordinary Resolution:(1) That Article 4 of the Company's Articles be deleted and substituted in its entirety by the following:""4. Subject to the provisions of article 85 of the Act and  in the case of sub-articles (b) and (c) hereunder with effect from the 15 May 2022  the Directors are authorised to issue Equity Securities of the Company in any of the following cases:(a) an issuance of Equity Securities in relation to employee or director incentive programmes  up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital (or Equity Securities convertible into the maximum value of the authorised share capital) in respect of one or more issuances  provided that the Directors shall only be authorised to issue Equity Securities in relation to incentive programmes that are first approved and authorised by the Company in general meeting;(b) an issuance of Equity Securities as payment for an acquisition of assets (including shares) by the Company or by any of its subsidiaries; and/or(c) an issuance of convertible debt securities or an issuance of Equity Securities as payment to a creditor in settlement of a debt owed by the Company or its subsidiaries to such creditor.Provided that in the case of sub-articles (b) and (c) above  the Directors shall be authorised to issue Equity Securities up to an aggregate maximum of 20% of the issued Shares of the Company (or Equity Securities convertible into 20% of the issued Shares) on a rolling 12-month basis.The foregoing authorisation is valid until the end of the Company's annual general meeting for 2023 and the Company in general meeting may by ordinary resolution renew this permission for further periods of one (1) to five (5) years each.(2) That the Company's M&A be updated to reflect the foregoing extraordinary resolution and any other changes that are required in terms of law to reflect any changes that may have taken place since the current version of the memorandum and articles of association was last approved and registered by the Registrar of Companies.(3) That any one director and/or the company secretary  acting singly  be and hereby is  authorised to: (i) issue a certified extract of these resolutions  (ii) sign and file the updated M&A on the Company's behalf with the Registrar of Companies  and (iii) do all things as may be necessary to give effect to these resolutions.""Agenda Item 19; Extraordinary Resolution on certain changes to the Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association of the Company to authorise the Directors to issue Shares up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital of the CompanyThe Board is proposing the introduction of a new article 4A to the Articles for the purpose of authorising the Directors of the Company to issue Shares up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital of the Company. The rationale behind this proposed amendment is to grant the Directors of the Company (subject to prior shareholder approval in general meeting) the flexibility to issue Shares other than for the reasons already set out in article 4 subject to the provisions of article 85 CA.The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Meeting adopts the following Extraordinary Resolution:(1) That a new article 4A be added to the Company's Articles  which shall read as follows:""4A. Subject to the provisions of article 85 of the Act  the shareholders in general meeting may  by ordinary resolution  authorise the Directors to issue Shares up to the maximum value of the authorised share capital of the Company as provided by the Memorandum  which authorisation shall be for a maximum period of 5 years renewable for further maximum periods of 5 years each.(2) That the Company's M&A be updated to reflect the foregoing extraordinary resolution and any other changes that are required in terms of law to reflect any changes that may have taken place since the current version of the memorandum and articles of association was last approved and registered by the Registrar of Companies.(3) That any one director and/or the company secretary  acting singly  be and hereby is  authorised to: (i) issue a certified extract of these resolutions  (ii) sign and file the updated M&A on the Company's behalf with the Registrar of Companies  and (iii) do all things as may be necessary to give effect to these resolutions.""OtherThe Company has 41 295 601 shares issued as of the date of this notice (one vote per share).Except as otherwise provided in this Notice  all supporting documentation mentioned in this Notice and a copy of the Company's proposed amendments to its Memorandum and Articles of Association are available at the Company's website (www.raketech.com) as at the date of this Notice.

2148,Euroclear,Google API,https://tdpelmedia.com/rouble-firms-for-ninth-session-in-moscow-stocks-jump-eyeing-gas-saga,Rouble firms for ninth session in Moscow  stocks jump eyeing gas saga,1 day ago,The Russian rouble strengthened for a ninth straight session in Moscow  ending near 83 per dollar on Thursday  and stocks jumped higher as some curbs on short selling were lifted  with the market focused on the effects of Moscow‚Äôs demand that its gas exports be paid for in roubles.The rouble ended 1.6% stronger against the dollar at 83.20  its strongest close since February 25  and gained 1.8% to close at 92.50 versus the euro.The currency lost nearly 40% of its value from the 2021 close as global curbs and sanctions kicked in in retaliation of Moscow‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine late last month.Dynamics driving the rouble are to some extent artificial.The currency  which had been free-floating until late February  is now steered by capital controls  a ban on buying cash dollars and euros and other administrative measures.In Moscow trading  the rouble has risen in 15 of the last 16 sessions.The Russian currency is extending gains made last week after President Vladimir Putin demanded that natural gas exported to Europe be paid for in roubles  a move that has galvanised European countries into action.Putin is demanding foreign buyers pay for Russian gas in roubles from Friday or else have their supplies cut.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs not much chance of Europe directly paying in roubles ‚Äù said Christian Lawrence  senior market strategist at Rabobank.‚ÄúPutin has been quite clear that he needs roubles for that gas. So  if it does happen  I think he goes via a third party. But we will have to wait and see how it pans out.‚ÄùOn Wednesday  two sources told Reuters that Russia planned to keep the contract currency for gas exports to Europe unchanged but would seek final payment in roubles as one of the options to switch the currency of gas trade  moves that may ease some traders‚Äô concerns.Russia‚Äôs Gazprombank said on Thursday it would provide conditions to allow convenient payments for Russian gas in roubles  Tass news agency said.On the interbank market  rouble bids reached as strong as 75 against the dollar in the previous session and were hovering around 79 on Thursday.The rouble was at 81 to the dollar on the EBS electronic platform  below levels last seen prior to the invasion.STOCKS SURGE HIGHERRussian stock indexes were higher. The central bank from Thursday lifted a ban on some short selling  but limited it to shares in 83 enterprises and only to banks and brokers.On Thursday  the bank told Reuters a ban on the buying and selling of any securities between Russians and foreigners of‚Äùunfriendly‚Äù countries  imposed on March 1  was indefinite.Moscow Exchange said trading in foreign securities would be relaunched once transfers between Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository (NSD) and international clearing houses Euroclear and Clearstream  which are currently blocked  had been resolved.‚ÄúForeign securities purchased by investors on the exchange are in safekeeping in the Russian jurisdiction ‚Äù Moscow Exchange said.The dollar-denominated RTS index was up 7.6% at 1 021.28 points  its highest close since February 23  the day before Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine.The rouble-based MOEX Russian index rose 7.6% to 2 703.51 points. Shares of energy giant Gazprom leapt 12.3%.Shares in sanctioned lender VTB were 15.4% higher. SPB Exchange  Russia‚Äôs second-largest bourse  said it planned to resume trading in several securities of Russian companies with foreign primary listings  but not earlier than April 7.Russia has spent 50.2 billion roubles ($613 million) in coupons on seven OFZ treasury bond issues  data on its website showed.Yields on Russia‚Äôs benchmark 10-year OFZ treasury bonds  which move inversely to prices  fell to 11.1%  their lowest since February 2.See Something Say Something  Share The News WhatsAppFacebookTwitterLinkedInRedditTelegramPinterestEmailSkypePrintTumblrPocket,neutral,0.04,0.78,0.17,negative,0.02,0.29,0.7,True,English,"['Rouble firms', 'ninth session', 'gas saga', 'Moscow', 'stocks', 'seven OFZ treasury bond issues', 'benchmark 10-year OFZ treasury bonds', 'rouble-based MOEX Russian index', 'dollar-denominated RTS index', 'other administrative measures', 'Tass news agency', 'EBS electronic platform', 'National Settlement Depository', 'international clearing houses', 'energy giant Gazprom', 'The News WhatsApp', 'ninth straight session', 'Russian stock indexes', 'foreign primary listings', 'senior market strategist', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'previous session', 'Russian jurisdiction', 'Russian companies', 'foreign buyers', 'Russian gas', 'capital controls', 'cash dollars', 'last 16 sessions', 'European countries', 'Christian Lawrence', 'third party', 'two sources', 'final payment', 'traders‚Äô concerns', 'convenient payments', 'interbank market', 'unfriendly‚Äù countries', 'foreign securities', 'lender VTB', 'largest bourse', 'Skype Print', 'Tumblr Pocket', 'gas exports', 'natural gas', 'gas trade', 'Russian currency', 'SPB Exchange', 'several securities', 'Russian rouble', 'short selling', 'global curbs', 'STOCKS SURGE', 'central bank', 'contract currency', 'rouble bids', 'late February', 'Moscow Exchange', '50.2 billion roubles', 'Moscow trading', 'Thursday', 'effects', 'demand', 'value', 'sanctions', 'retaliation', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'Dynamics', 'extent', 'euros', 'gains', 'move', 'action', 'Friday', 'supplies', 'chance', 'Rabobank', 'Wednesday', 'Reuters', 'options', 'Gazprombank', 'conditions', 'levels', 'HIGHER', 'shares', '83 enterprises', 'banks', 'brokers', 'buying', 'Russians', 'foreigners', 'March', 'transfers', 'NSD', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'investors', 'safekeeping', '1,021.28 points', 'tens', 'thousands', 'troops', '2,703.51 points', 'April', 'coupons', 'data', 'website', 'Yields', 'prices', 'Something', 'Facebook', 'Twitter', 'LinkedIn', 'Reddit', 'Telegram', 'Pinterest', 'Email']",2022-04-01,2022-04-02,tdpelmedia.com

If the Percentage Change is negative  by more than the Buffer Percentage (that is  the Percentage Change is between -20.01% and -100%)  then the investor will receive a cash payment equal to: Principal Amount + [Principal Amount x (Percentage Change + Buffer Percentage) x Downside Multiplier] In this case  you will lose all or a portion of the principal amount of the Notes. Percentage Change: The Percentage Change  expressed as a percentage  is calculated using the following formula:Initial Level: 2 204.09  which was the closing level of the Reference Asset on the Trade Date. Final Level: The closing level of the Reference Asset on the Valuation Date. Leverage Factor: 150% (subject to the Maximum Redemption Amount) Maximum Redemption Amount: $1 232.50 per $1 000 in principal amount. Buffer Percentage: 20.00% Buffer Level: 1 763.27  which is 80.00% of the Initial Level (rounded to two decimal places). Downside Multiplier: 100/80.00  which is 1.25Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ IndexPrincipal at Risk: The Notes are NOT principal protected. You may lose all or a substantial portion of your principal amount at maturity if the Final Level is less than the Buffer Level. Calculation Agent: RBCCM U.S. Tax Treatment: By purchasing a Note  each holder agrees (in the absence of a change in law  an administrative determination or a judicial ruling to the contrary) to treat the Notes as a pre-paid cash-settled derivative contract for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However  the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in the Notes are uncertain and the Internal Revenue Service could assert that the Notes should be taxed in a manner that is different from that described in the preceding sentence. Please see the section below  ‚ÄúSupplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences ‚Äù and the discussion (including the opinion of Ashurst LLP  our special U.S. tax counsel) in the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021 under ‚ÄúSupplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences ‚Äù which apply to the Notes. Secondary Market: RBCCM (or one of its affiliates)  though not obligated to do so  may maintain a secondary market in the Notes after the issue date. The amount that you may receive upon sale of your Notes prior to maturity may be less than the principal amount of your Notes. Listing: The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Clearance and Settlement: DTC global (including through its indirect participants Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg as described under ‚ÄúOwnership and Book-Entry Issuance‚Äù in the prospectus).

The hypothetical Percentage Changes of the Reference Asset used to illustrate the calculation of the Payment at Maturity (rounded to two decimal places) are not estimates or forecasts of the Final Level or the level of the Reference Asset on any trading day prior to the Maturity Date. All examples are based on a Buffer Percentage of 20.00% (the Buffer Level is 80.00% of the Initial Level)  the Leverage Factor of 150%  the Maximum Redemption Amount of $1 232.50  and the Downside Multiplier of 1.25  and that a holder purchased Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1 000 and that no market disruption event occurs on the Valuation Date.Example 1 ‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is positive.Percentage Change: 5% Payment at Maturity: $1 000 + [$1 000 x (5% x 150%)] = $1 000 + $75 = $1 075 On a $1 000 investment  a 5% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 075  a 7.50% return on the Notes.Example 2 ‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is positive (and the Payment at Maturity is subject to the Maximum Redemption Amount).Percentage Change: 30%Payment at Maturity: $1 000 + [$1 000 x (30% x 150%)] = $1 000 + $450 = $1 450 However  the Maximum Redemption Amount is $1 232.50. On a $1 000 investment  a 30% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 232.50  a 23.25% return on the Notes.Example 3 ‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is negative (but not by more than the Buffer Percentage). Percentage Change: -8% Payment at Maturity: At maturity  if the Percentage Change is negative BUT not by more than the Buffer Percentage  then the Payment at Maturity will equal the principal amount. On a $1 000 investment  a -8% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 000  a 0% return on the Notes.Example 4 ‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is negative (by more than the Buffer Percentage). Percentage Change: -35% Payment at Maturity: $1 000 + [$1 000 x (-35% + 20.00%) x 1.25] = $1 000 - $187.50 = $812.50 On a $1 000 investment  a -35% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $812.50  a -18.75% return on the Notes.Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ IndexSELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONSAn investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Asset. These risks are explained in more detail in the section ‚ÄúAdditional Risk Factors Specific to the Notes‚Äù in the product prospectus supplement. In addition to the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the product prospectus supplement  you should consider the following:Risks Relating to the Terms of the Notes‚Ä¢ You May Not Receive the Full Principal Amount at Maturity ‚Äî Investors in the Notes could lose all or a substantial portion of their principal amount if there is a decline in the level of the Reference Asset. You will lose 1.25% of the principal amount of the Notes for each 1% that the Final Level is less than the Buffer Level.‚Ä¢ The Notes Do Not Pay Interest and Your Return May Be Lower than the Return on a Conventional Debt Security of Comparable Maturity ‚Äî There will be no periodic interest payments on the Notes as there would be on a conventional fixed-rate or floating-rate debt security having the same maturity. The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased one of our conventional senior interest bearing debt securities.‚Ä¢ Your Potential Payment at Maturity Is Limited ‚Äî The Notes will provide less opportunity to participate in the appreciation of the Reference Asset than an investment in a security linked to the Reference Asset providing full participation in the appreciation  because the payment at maturity will not exceed the Maximum Redemption Amount. Accordingly  your return on the Notes may be less than your return would be if you made an investment in a security directly linked to the positive performance of the Reference Asset.‚Ä¢ Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Changes in Our Credit Ratings Are Expected to Affect the Market Value of the Notes ‚Äî The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result  your receipt of the amount due on the maturity date is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations at that time. This will be the case even if the level of the Reference Asset increases after the Trade Date. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be at the maturity of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Secondary Market for the Notes‚Ä¢ There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes‚ÄîSales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses ‚Äî There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. RBCCM and our other affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. RBCCM or any of our other affiliates may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and asked prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.Risks Relating to the Initial Estimated Value of the Notes‚Ä¢ The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes on the Cover Page of this Pricing Supplement Is an Estimate Only  Calculated as of the Time the Terms of the Notes Were Set ‚Äî The initial estimated value of the Notes is based on the value of our obligation to make the payments on the Notes  together with the mid-market value of the derivative embedded in the terms of the Notes. See ‚ÄúStructuring the Notes‚Äù below. Our estimate is based on a variety of assumptions  including our credit spreads  expectations as to dividends  interest rates and volatility  and the expected term of the Notes. These assumptions are based on certain forecasts about future events  which may prove to be incorrect. Other entities may value the Notes or similar securities at a price that is significantly different than we do.Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ IndexThe value of the Notes at any time after the Trade Date will vary based on many factors  including changes in market conditions  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result  the actual value you would receive if you sold the Notes in any secondary market  if any  should be expected to differ materially from the initial estimated value of your Notes.Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest and Our Trading Activities‚Ä¢ Our Business Activities May Create Conflicts of Interest ‚Äî We and our affiliates expect to engage in trading activities related to the Reference Asset that are not for the account of holders of the Notes or on their behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders‚Äô interests in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for their customers and in accounts under their management. These trading activities  if they influence the level of the Reference Asset  could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. We and one or more of our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with companies included in the Reference Asset  including making loans to or providing advisory services. These services could include investment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These activities may present a conflict between our or one or more of our affiliates‚Äô obligations and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to the Reference Asset. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the level of the Reference Asset  and  therefore  the market value of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Reference Asset‚Ä¢ An Investment in the Notes Is Subject to Risks Relating to Non-U.S. Securities Markets ‚Äî Because foreign companies or foreign equity securities included in the Reference Asset are publicly traded in the applicable foreign countries and are denominated in non-U.S. currencies  an investment in the Notes involves particular risks. For example  the non-U.S. securities markets may be more volatile than the U.S. securities markets  and market developments may affect these markets differently from the U.S. or other securities markets. Direct or indirect government intervention to stabilize the securities markets outside the U.S.  as well as cross-shareholdings in certain companies  may affect trading prices and trading volumes in those markets. Also  the public availability of information concerning the foreign issuers may vary depending on their home jurisdiction and the reporting requirements imposed by their respective regulators. In addition  the foreign issuers may be subject to accounting  auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements that differ from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies.Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ Index‚Ä¢ Notes Linked to the Reference Asset Are Subject to Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk ‚Äî The payment amount on the Notes will be calculated based on the Reference Asset  and the prices of the applicable stocks are converted into U.S. dollars for purposes of calculating the level of the Reference Asset. As a result  investors in the Notes will be exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to each of the currencies represented by the Reference Asset. An investor‚Äôs net exposure will depend on the extent to which the currencies represented by the Reference Asset strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar and the relative weight of each relevant currency represented by the Reference Asset. If  taking into account such weight  the dollar strengthens against such currencies  the level of the Reference Asset will be adversely affected and the amount payable  if any  at maturity of the Notes may be reduced.‚Ä¢ You Will Not Have Any Rights to the Securities Included in the Reference Asset ‚Äî As a holder of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of securities included in the Reference Asset would have. The Final Level will not reflect any dividends paid on the securities included in the Reference Asset  and accordingly  any positive return on the Notes may be less than the potential positive return on those securities.‚Ä¢ The Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Postponement Due to Market Disruption Events and Adjustments ‚Äî The payment at maturity and the Valuation Date are subject to adjustment as described in the product prospectus supplement. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see ‚ÄúGeneral Terms of the Notes‚ÄîMarket Disruption Events‚Äù in the product prospectus supplement.Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ IndexINFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE ASSETAll disclosures contained in this document regarding the Reference Asset  including  without limitation  its make-up  method of calculation  and changes in its components  have been derived from publicly available sources. The information reflects the policies of  and is subject to change by  MSCI Inc. (‚ÄúMSCI‚Äù). MSCI  which owns the copyright and all other rights to the Reference Asset  has no obligation to continue to publish  and may discontinue publication of  the Reference Asset. The consequences of MSCI discontinuing publication of the Reference Asset are discussed in the section of the product prospectus supplement entitled ‚ÄúGeneral Terms of the Notes‚Äî Unavailability of the Level of the Reference Asset.‚Äù Neither we nor RBCCM accepts any responsibility for the calculation  maintenance or publication of the Reference Asset or any successor index.The MSCI EAFE¬Æ IndexThe Reference Asset is intended to measure equity market performance in developed market countries  excluding the United States and Canada. The Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization equity index with a base date of December 31  1969 and an initial value of 100. The Index is calculated daily in U.S. dollars and published in real time every 60 seconds during market trading hours. The Index currently consists of companies from the following developed countries: Australia  Austria  Belgium  Denmark  Finland  France  Germany  Hong Kong  Ireland  Israel  Italy  Japan  the Netherlands  New Zealand  Norway  Portugal  Singapore  Spain  Sweden  Switzerland and the U.K.Constructing the MSCI Global Investable Market Indices. MSCI undertakes an index construction process  which involves:‚óæ defining the equity universe;‚óæ determining the market investable equity universe for each market;‚óæ determining market capitalization size segments for each market;‚óæ applying index continuity rules for the MSCI Standard Index;‚óæ creating style segments within each size segment within each market; and‚óæ classifying securities under the Global Industry Classification Standard (the ‚ÄúGICS‚Äù).Defining the Equity Universe . The equity universe is defined by:‚óæ Identifying Eligible Equity Securities: the equity universe initially looks at securities listed in any of the countries in the MSCI Global Index Series  which will be classified as either Developed Markets (‚ÄúDM‚Äù) or Emerging Markets (‚ÄúEM‚Äù). All listed equity securities  including Real Estate Investment Trusts and certain income trusts in Canada  are eligible for inclusion in the equity universe. Conversely  mutual funds  ETFs  equity derivatives  and most investment trusts  are not eligible for inclusion  are eligible for inclusion in the equity universe. Conversely  mutual funds  ETFs  equity derivatives  and most investment trusts  are not.‚óæ Classifying Eligible Securities into the Appropriate Country: each company and its securities (i.e.  share classes) are classified in only one country.‚óæ Effective with the November 2015 semi-annual index review  companies traded outside of their country of classification (i.e.  ‚Äúforeign listed companies‚Äù) will become eligible for inclusion in the MSCI Country Investable Market Indexes along with the applicable MSCI Global Index. In order for a MSCI Country Investable Market Index to be eligible to include foreign listed companies  it must meet the Foreign Listing Materiality Requirement. To meet the Foreign Listing Materiality Requirement  the aggregate market capitalization of all securities represented by foreign listings should represent at least (i) 5% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization of the relevant MSCI Country Investable Market Index and (ii) 0.05% of the free-float adjusted market capitalization of the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index.Determining the Market Investable Equity Universes . A market investable equity universe for a market is derived by identifying eligible listings for each security in the equity universe  and by applying investability screens to individual companies and securities in the equity universe that are classified in that market. A market is equivalent to a single country  except in DM Europe  where all DM countries in Europe are aggregated into a single market for index construction purposes. Subsequently  individual DM Europe country indices within the MSCI Europe Index are derived from the constituents of the MSCI Europe Index under the global investable market indices methodology.Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ IndexA security may be listed in the country where it is classified (i.e. local listing) and/or in a different country (i.e. ‚Äúforeign listing‚Äù). Securities may be represented by either a local or foreign listing. A security may be represented by a foreign listing only if:‚Ä¢ The security is classified in a country that meets the Foreign Listing Materiality Requirement  and‚Ä¢ The security‚Äôs foreign listing is traded on an eligible stock exchange of: a DM country if the security is classified in a DM country  a DM or an EM country if the security is classified in an EM country  or a DM or an EM or a FM country if the security is classified in a FM country. Securities in that country may not be represented by a foreign listing in the global investable equity universe if a country does not meet the requirement.The investability screens used to determine the investable equity universe in each market are as follows:‚Ä¢ Equity Universe Minimum Size Requirement : this investability screen is applied at the company level. In order to be included in a market investable equity universe  a company must have the required minimum full market capitalization. The size requirement also applies to companies in all developed and emerging markets.‚Ä¢ Equity Universe Minimum Free Float-Adjusted Market Capitalization Requirement : this investability screen is applied at the individual security level. To be eligible for inclusion in a market investable equity universe  a security must have a free float-adjusted market capitalization equal to or higher than 50% of the equity universe minimum size requirement.‚Ä¢ DM and EM Minimum Liquidity Requirement : this investability screen is applied at the individual security level. To be eligible for inclusion in a market investable equity universe  a security must have adequate liquidity. The twelve-month and three-month Annual Traded Value Ratio (‚ÄúATVR‚Äù)  a measure that screens out extreme daily trading volumes and takes into account the free float-adjusted market capitalization size of securities  together with the three-month frequency of trading are used to measure liquidity. A minimum liquidity level of 20% of three- and twelve-month ATVR and 90% of three-month frequency of trading over the last four consecutive quarters are required for inclusion of a security in a market investable equity universe of a DM  and a minimum liquidity level of 15% of three- and twelve-month ATVR and 80% of three-month frequency of trading over the last four consecutive quarters are required for inclusion of a security in a market investable equity universe of an EM.‚Ä¢ Global Minimum Foreign Inclusion Factor Requirement : this investability screen is applied at the individual security level. To be eligible for inclusion in a market investable equity universe  a security‚Äôs Foreign Inclusion Factor (‚ÄúFIF‚Äù) must reach a certain threshold. The FIF of a security is defined as the proportion of shares outstanding that is available for purchase in the public equity markets by international investors. This proportion accounts for the available free float of and/or the foreign ownership limits applicable to a specific security (or company). In general  a security must have an FIF equal to or larger than 0.15 to be eligible for inclusion in a market investable equity universe.‚Ä¢ Minimum Length of Trading Requirement : this investability screen is applied at the individual security level. For an initial public offering (‚ÄúIPO‚Äù) to be eligible for inclusion in a market investable equity universe  the new issue must have started trading at least three months before the implementation of a semi-annual index review (as described below). This requirement is applicable to small new issues in all markets. Large IPOs are not subject to the minimum length of trading requirement and may be included in a market investable equity universe and the Standard Index outside of a Quarterly or Semi-Annual Index Review.‚Ä¢ Minimum Foreign Room Requirement : this investability screen is applied at the individual security level. For a security that is subject to a foreign ownership limit to be eligible for inclusion in a market investable equity universe  the proportion of shares still available to foreign investors relative to the maximum allowed (referred to as ‚Äúforeign room‚Äù) must be at least 15%.Defining Market Capitalization Size Segments for Each Market. Once a market investable equity universe is defined  it is segmented into the following size-based indices:‚Ä¢ Investable Market Index (Large + Mid + Small);‚Ä¢ Standard Index (Large + Mid);‚Ä¢ Large Cap Index;‚Ä¢ Mid Cap Index; or‚Ä¢ Small Cap Index.Creating the size segment indices in each market involves the following steps:Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ Index‚Ä¢ defining the market coverage target range for each size segment;‚Ä¢ determining the global minimum size range for each size segment;‚Ä¢ determining the market size-segment cutoffs and associated segment number of companies;‚Ä¢ assigning companies to the size segments; and‚Ä¢ applying final size-segment investability requirements.Index Continuity Rules for the Standard Indices . In order to achieve index continuity  as well as to provide some basic level of diversification within a market index  and notwithstanding the effect of other index construction rules described in this section  a minimum number of five constituents will be maintained for a DM Standard Index and a minimum number of three constituents will be maintained for an EM Standard Index.Creating Style Indices within Each Size Segment. All securities in the investable equity universe are classified into value or growth segments using the MSCI Global Value and Growth methodology. Classifying Securities under the Global Industry Classification Standard. All securities in the global investable equity universe are assigned to the industry that best describes their business activities. To this end  MSCI has designed  in conjunction with S&P Dow Jones Indexes  the GICS. Under the GICS  each company is assigned to one sub‚àíindustry according to its principal business activity. Therefore  a company can belong to only one industry grouping at each of the four levels of the GICS.Calculation Methodology for the IndexThe performance of the Index is a free float weighted average of the U.S. dollar values of its component securities.Prices used to calculate the component securities are the official exchange closing prices or prices accepted as such in the relevant market. In the case of a market closure  or if a security does not trade on a specific day or during a specific period  MSCI carries forward the previous day‚Äôs price (or latest available closing price). In the event of a market outage resulting in any component security price to be unavailable  MSCI will generally use the last reported price for such component security for the purpose of performance calculation unless MSCI determines that another price is more appropriate based on the circumstances. Closing prices are converted into U.S. dollars  as applicable  using the closing exchange rates calculated by WM/Reuters at 4:00 P.M. London Time.Index MaintenanceThe MSCI global investable market indices are maintained with the objective of reflecting the evolution of the underlying equity markets and segments on a timely basis  while seeking to achieve index continuity  continuous investability of constituents and replicability of the indices  index stability  and low index turnover. In particular  index maintenance involves:(i) Semi-Annual Index Reviews (‚ÄúSAIRs‚Äù) in May and November of the Size Segment and Global Value and Growth Indices which include:‚óæ updating the indices on the basis of a fully refreshed equity universe;‚óæ taking buffer rules into consideration for migration of securities across size and style segments; and‚óæ updating FIFs and Number of Shares (‚ÄúNOS‚Äù).(ii) Quarterly Index Reviews (‚ÄúQIRs‚Äù) in February and August of the Size Segment Indices aimed at:‚óæ including significant new eligible securities (such as IPOs that were not eligible for earlier inclusion) in the Index;‚óæ allowing for significant moves of companies within the Size Segment Indices  using wider buffers than in the SAIR; and‚óæ reflecting the impact of significant market events on FIFs and updating NOS.(iii) Ongoing Event-Related Changes: changes of this type are generally implemented in the indices as they occur. Significantly large IPOs are included in the indices after the close of the company‚Äôs tenth day of trading.None of us  RBCCM or any of our other affiliates accepts any responsibility for the calculation  maintenance  or publication of  or for any error  omission  or disruption in  the Reference Asset or any successor to the Reference Asset.Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ IndexLicense AgreementWe have entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with MSCI providing for the license to us and certain of our affiliated or subsidiary companies  in exchange for a fee  of the right to use indices owned and published by MSCI (including the Reference Asset) in connection with certain securities  including the Notes offered hereby.The license agreement between us and MSCI requires that the following language be stated in this document:THE NOTES ARE NOT SPONSORED  ENDORSED  SOLD OR PROMOTED BY MSCI INC.

So  if it does happen  I think he goes via a third party. But we will have to wait and see how it pans out.‚ÄùOn Wednesday  two sources told Reuters that Russia planned to keep the contract currency for gas exports to Europe unchanged but would seek final payment in roubles as one of the options to switch the currency of gas trade  moves that may ease some traders‚Äô concerns.Russia‚Äôs Gazprombank said on Thursday it would provide conditions to allow convenient payments for Russian gas in roubles  Tass news agency said.On the interbank market  rouble bids reached as strong as 75 against the dollar in the previous session and were hovering around 79 on Thursday.The rouble was at 81 to the dollar on the EBS electronic platform  below levels last seen prior to the invasion.STOCKS SURGE HIGHERRussian stock indexes were higher. The central bank from Thursday lifted a ban on some short selling  but limited it to shares in 83 enterprises and only to banks and brokers.On Thursday  the bank told Reuters a ban on the buying and selling of any securities between Russians and foreigners of‚Äùunfriendly‚Äù countries  imposed on March 1  was indefinite.Moscow Exchange said trading in foreign securities would be relaunched once transfers between Russia‚Äôs National Settlement Depository (NSD) and international clearing houses Euroclear and Clearstream  which are currently blocked  had been resolved.‚ÄúForeign securities purchased by investors on the exchange are in safekeeping in the Russian jurisdiction ‚Äù Moscow Exchange said.The dollar-denominated RTS index was up 7.6% at 1 021.28 points  its highest close since February 23  the day before Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine.The rouble-based MOEX Russian index rose 7.6% to 2 703.51 points.

All examples are based on a Buffer Percentage of 20.00% (the Buffer Level is 80.00% of the Initial Level)  the Leverage Factor of 150%  the Maximum Redemption Amount of $1 232.50  and the Downside Multiplier of 1.25  and that a holder purchased Notes with an aggregate principal amount of $1 000 and that no market disruption event occurs on the Valuation Date.Example 1 ‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is positive.Percentage Change: 5% Payment at Maturity: $1 000 + [$1 000 x (5% x 150%)] = $1 000 + $75 = $1 075 On a $1 000 investment  a 5% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 075  a 7.50% return on the Notes.Example 2 ‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is positive (and the Payment at Maturity is subject to the Maximum Redemption Amount).Percentage Change: 30%Payment at Maturity: $1 000 + [$1 000 x (30% x 150%)] = $1 000 + $450 = $1 450 However  the Maximum Redemption Amount is $1 232.50. On a $1 000 investment  a 30% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 232.50  a 23.25% return on the Notes.Example 3 ‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is negative (but not by more than the Buffer Percentage). Percentage Change: -8% Payment at Maturity: At maturity  if the Percentage Change is negative BUT not by more than the Buffer Percentage  then the Payment at Maturity will equal the principal amount. On a $1 000 investment  a -8% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 000  a 0% return on the Notes.Example 4 ‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is negative (by more than the Buffer Percentage). Percentage Change: -35% Payment at Maturity: $1 000 + [$1 000 x (-35% + 20.00%) x 1.25] = $1 000 - $187.50 = $812.50 On a $1 000 investment  a -35% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $812.50  a -18.75% return on the Notes.Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ IndexSELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONSAn investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Asset. These risks are explained in more detail in the section ‚ÄúAdditional Risk Factors Specific to the Notes‚Äù in the product prospectus supplement. In addition to the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the product prospectus supplement  you should consider the following:Risks Relating to the Terms of the Notes‚Ä¢ You May Not Receive the Full Principal Amount at Maturity ‚Äî Investors in the Notes could lose all or a substantial portion of their principal amount if there is a decline in the level of the Reference Asset. You will lose 1.25% of the principal amount of the Notes for each 1% that the Final Level is less than the Buffer Level.‚Ä¢ The Notes Do Not Pay Interest and Your Return May Be Lower than the Return on a Conventional Debt Security of Comparable Maturity ‚Äî There will be no periodic interest payments on the Notes as there would be on a conventional fixed-rate or floating-rate debt security having the same maturity. The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased one of our conventional senior interest bearing debt securities.‚Ä¢ Your Potential Payment at Maturity Is Limited ‚Äî The Notes will provide less opportunity to participate in the appreciation of the Reference Asset than an investment in a security linked to the Reference Asset providing full participation in the appreciation  because the payment at maturity will not exceed the Maximum Redemption Amount. Accordingly  your return on the Notes may be less than your return would be if you made an investment in a security directly linked to the positive performance of the Reference Asset.‚Ä¢ Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Changes in Our Credit Ratings Are Expected to Affect the Market Value of the Notes ‚Äî The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result  your receipt of the amount due on the maturity date is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations at that time. This will be the case even if the level of the Reference Asset increases after the Trade Date. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be at the maturity of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Secondary Market for the Notes‚Ä¢ There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes‚ÄîSales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses ‚Äî There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. RBCCM and our other affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. RBCCM or any of our other affiliates may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and asked prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.Risks Relating to the Initial Estimated Value of the Notes‚Ä¢ The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes on the Cover Page of this Pricing Supplement Is an Estimate Only  Calculated as of the Time the Terms of the Notes Were Set ‚Äî The initial estimated value of the Notes is based on the value of our obligation to make the payments on the Notes  together with the mid-market value of the derivative embedded in the terms of the Notes. See ‚ÄúStructuring the Notes‚Äù below. Our estimate is based on a variety of assumptions  including our credit spreads  expectations as to dividends  interest rates and volatility  and the expected term of the Notes. These assumptions are based on certain forecasts about future events  which may prove to be incorrect. Other entities may value the Notes or similar securities at a price that is significantly different than we do.Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ IndexThe value of the Notes at any time after the Trade Date will vary based on many factors  including changes in market conditions  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result  the actual value you would receive if you sold the Notes in any secondary market  if any  should be expected to differ materially from the initial estimated value of your Notes.Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest and Our Trading Activities‚Ä¢ Our Business Activities May Create Conflicts of Interest ‚Äî We and our affiliates expect to engage in trading activities related to the Reference Asset that are not for the account of holders of the Notes or on their behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders‚Äô interests in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for their customers and in accounts under their management. These trading activities  if they influence the level of the Reference Asset  could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. We and one or more of our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with companies included in the Reference Asset  including making loans to or providing advisory services. These services could include investment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These activities may present a conflict between our or one or more of our affiliates‚Äô obligations and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to the Reference Asset. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the level of the Reference Asset  and  therefore  the market value of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Reference Asset‚Ä¢ An Investment in the Notes Is Subject to Risks Relating to Non-U.S. Securities Markets ‚Äî Because foreign companies or foreign equity securities included in the Reference Asset are publicly traded in the applicable foreign countries and are denominated in non-U.S. currencies  an investment in the Notes involves particular risks. For example  the non-U.S. securities markets may be more volatile than the U.S. securities markets  and market developments may affect these markets differently from the U.S. or other securities markets. Direct or indirect government intervention to stabilize the securities markets outside the U.S.  as well as cross-shareholdings in certain companies  may affect trading prices and trading volumes in those markets. Also  the public availability of information concerning the foreign issuers may vary depending on their home jurisdiction and the reporting requirements imposed by their respective regulators. In addition  the foreign issuers may be subject to accounting  auditing and financial reporting standards and requirements that differ from those applicable to U.S. reporting companies.Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ Index‚Ä¢ Notes Linked to the Reference Asset Are Subject to Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk ‚Äî The payment amount on the Notes will be calculated based on the Reference Asset  and the prices of the applicable stocks are converted into U.S. dollars for purposes of calculating the level of the Reference Asset. As a result  investors in the Notes will be exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to each of the currencies represented by the Reference Asset. An investor‚Äôs net exposure will depend on the extent to which the currencies represented by the Reference Asset strengthen or weaken against the U.S. dollar and the relative weight of each relevant currency represented by the Reference Asset. If  taking into account such weight  the dollar strengthens against such currencies  the level of the Reference Asset will be adversely affected and the amount payable  if any  at maturity of the Notes may be reduced.‚Ä¢ You Will Not Have Any Rights to the Securities Included in the Reference Asset ‚Äî As a holder of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of securities included in the Reference Asset would have. The Final Level will not reflect any dividends paid on the securities included in the Reference Asset  and accordingly  any positive return on the Notes may be less than the potential positive return on those securities.‚Ä¢ The Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Postponement Due to Market Disruption Events and Adjustments ‚Äî The payment at maturity and the Valuation Date are subject to adjustment as described in the product prospectus supplement. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see ‚ÄúGeneral Terms of the Notes‚ÄîMarket Disruption Events‚Äù in the product prospectus supplement.Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ IndexINFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE ASSETAll disclosures contained in this document regarding the Reference Asset  including  without limitation  its make-up  method of calculation  and changes in its components  have been derived from publicly available sources. The information reflects the policies of  and is subject to change by  MSCI Inc. (‚ÄúMSCI‚Äù). MSCI  which owns the copyright and all other rights to the Reference Asset  has no obligation to continue to publish  and may discontinue publication of  the Reference Asset. The consequences of MSCI discontinuing publication of the Reference Asset are discussed in the section of the product prospectus supplement entitled ‚ÄúGeneral Terms of the Notes‚Äî Unavailability of the Level of the Reference Asset.‚Äù Neither we nor RBCCM accepts any responsibility for the calculation  maintenance or publication of the Reference Asset or any successor index.The MSCI EAFE¬Æ IndexThe Reference Asset is intended to measure equity market performance in developed market countries  excluding the United States and Canada. The Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalization equity index with a base date of December 31  1969 and an initial value of 100. The Index is calculated daily in U.S. dollars and published in real time every 60 seconds during market trading hours. The Index currently consists of companies from the following developed countries: Australia  Austria  Belgium  Denmark  Finland  France  Germany  Hong Kong  Ireland  Israel  Italy  Japan  the Netherlands  New Zealand  Norway  Portugal  Singapore  Spain  Sweden  Switzerland and the U.K.Constructing the MSCI Global Investable Market Indices. MSCI undertakes an index construction process  which involves:‚óæ defining the equity universe;‚óæ determining the market investable equity universe for each market;‚óæ determining market capitalization size segments for each market;‚óæ applying index continuity rules for the MSCI Standard Index;‚óæ creating style segments within each size segment within each market; and‚óæ classifying securities under the Global Industry Classification Standard (the ‚ÄúGICS‚Äù).Defining the Equity Universe . The equity universe is defined by:‚óæ Identifying Eligible Equity Securities: the equity universe initially looks at securities listed in any of the countries in the MSCI Global Index Series  which will be classified as either Developed Markets (‚ÄúDM‚Äù) or Emerging Markets (‚ÄúEM‚Äù). All listed equity securities  including Real Estate Investment Trusts and certain income trusts in Canada  are eligible for inclusion in the equity universe. Conversely  mutual funds  ETFs  equity derivatives  and most investment trusts  are not eligible for inclusion  are eligible for inclusion in the equity universe. Conversely  mutual funds  ETFs  equity derivatives  and most investment trusts  are not.‚óæ Classifying Eligible Securities into the Appropriate Country: each company and its securities (i.e.  share classes) are classified in only one country.‚óæ Effective with the November 2015 semi-annual index review  companies traded outside of their country of classification (i.e.  ‚Äúforeign listed companies‚Äù) will become eligible for inclusion in the MSCI Country Investable Market Indexes along with the applicable MSCI Global Index. In order for a MSCI Country Investable Market Index to be eligible to include foreign listed companies  it must meet the Foreign Listing Materiality Requirement. To meet the Foreign Listing Materiality Requirement  the aggregate market capitalization of all securities represented by foreign listings should represent at least (i) 5% of the free float-adjusted market capitalization of the relevant MSCI Country Investable Market Index and (ii) 0.05% of the free-float adjusted market capitalization of the MSCI ACWI Investable Market Index.Determining the Market Investable Equity Universes . A market investable equity universe for a market is derived by identifying eligible listings for each security in the equity universe  and by applying investability screens to individual companies and securities in the equity universe that are classified in that market. A market is equivalent to a single country  except in DM Europe  where all DM countries in Europe are aggregated into a single market for index construction purposes. Subsequently  individual DM Europe country indices within the MSCI Europe Index are derived from the constituents of the MSCI Europe Index under the global investable market indices methodology.Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ IndexA security may be listed in the country where it is classified (i.e. local listing) and/or in a different country (i.e. ‚Äúforeign listing‚Äù). Securities may be represented by either a local or foreign listing. A security may be represented by a foreign listing only if:‚Ä¢ The security is classified in a country that meets the Foreign Listing Materiality Requirement  and‚Ä¢ The security‚Äôs foreign listing is traded on an eligible stock exchange of: a DM country if the security is classified in a DM country  a DM or an EM country if the security is classified in an EM country  or a DM or an EM or a FM country if the security is classified in a FM country. Securities in that country may not be represented by a foreign listing in the global investable equity universe if a country does not meet the requirement.The investability screens used to determine the investable equity universe in each market are as follows:‚Ä¢ Equity Universe Minimum Size Requirement : this investability screen is applied at the company level. In order to be included in a market investable equity universe  a company must have the required minimum full market capitalization. The size requirement also applies to companies in all developed and emerging markets.‚Ä¢ Equity Universe Minimum Free Float-Adjusted Market Capitalization Requirement : this investability screen is applied at the individual security level. To be eligible for inclusion in a market investable equity universe  a security must have a free float-adjusted market capitalization equal to or higher than 50% of the equity universe minimum size requirement.‚Ä¢ DM and EM Minimum Liquidity Requirement : this investability screen is applied at the individual security level. To be eligible for inclusion in a market investable equity universe  a security must have adequate liquidity. The twelve-month and three-month Annual Traded Value Ratio (‚ÄúATVR‚Äù)  a measure that screens out extreme daily trading volumes and takes into account the free float-adjusted market capitalization size of securities  together with the three-month frequency of trading are used to measure liquidity. A minimum liquidity level of 20% of three- and twelve-month ATVR and 90% of three-month frequency of trading over the last four consecutive quarters are required for inclusion of a security in a market investable equity universe of a DM  and a minimum liquidity level of 15% of three- and twelve-month ATVR and 80% of three-month frequency of trading over the last four consecutive quarters are required for inclusion of a security in a market investable equity universe of an EM.‚Ä¢ Global Minimum Foreign Inclusion Factor Requirement : this investability screen is applied at the individual security level. To be eligible for inclusion in a market investable equity universe  a security‚Äôs Foreign Inclusion Factor (‚ÄúFIF‚Äù) must reach a certain threshold. The FIF of a security is defined as the proportion of shares outstanding that is available for purchase in the public equity markets by international investors. This proportion accounts for the available free float of and/or the foreign ownership limits applicable to a specific security (or company). In general  a security must have an FIF equal to or larger than 0.15 to be eligible for inclusion in a market investable equity universe.‚Ä¢ Minimum Length of Trading Requirement : this investability screen is applied at the individual security level. For an initial public offering (‚ÄúIPO‚Äù) to be eligible for inclusion in a market investable equity universe  the new issue must have started trading at least three months before the implementation of a semi-annual index review (as described below). This requirement is applicable to small new issues in all markets. Large IPOs are not subject to the minimum length of trading requirement and may be included in a market investable equity universe and the Standard Index outside of a Quarterly or Semi-Annual Index Review.‚Ä¢ Minimum Foreign Room Requirement : this investability screen is applied at the individual security level. For a security that is subject to a foreign ownership limit to be eligible for inclusion in a market investable equity universe  the proportion of shares still available to foreign investors relative to the maximum allowed (referred to as ‚Äúforeign room‚Äù) must be at least 15%.Defining Market Capitalization Size Segments for Each Market. Once a market investable equity universe is defined  it is segmented into the following size-based indices:‚Ä¢ Investable Market Index (Large + Mid + Small);‚Ä¢ Standard Index (Large + Mid);‚Ä¢ Large Cap Index;‚Ä¢ Mid Cap Index; or‚Ä¢ Small Cap Index.Creating the size segment indices in each market involves the following steps:Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ Index‚Ä¢ defining the market coverage target range for each size segment;‚Ä¢ determining the global minimum size range for each size segment;‚Ä¢ determining the market size-segment cutoffs and associated segment number of companies;‚Ä¢ assigning companies to the size segments; and‚Ä¢ applying final size-segment investability requirements.Index Continuity Rules for the Standard Indices . In order to achieve index continuity  as well as to provide some basic level of diversification within a market index  and notwithstanding the effect of other index construction rules described in this section  a minimum number of five constituents will be maintained for a DM Standard Index and a minimum number of three constituents will be maintained for an EM Standard Index.Creating Style Indices within Each Size Segment. All securities in the investable equity universe are classified into value or growth segments using the MSCI Global Value and Growth methodology. Classifying Securities under the Global Industry Classification Standard. All securities in the global investable equity universe are assigned to the industry that best describes their business activities. To this end  MSCI has designed  in conjunction with S&P Dow Jones Indexes  the GICS. Under the GICS  each company is assigned to one sub‚àíindustry according to its principal business activity. Therefore  a company can belong to only one industry grouping at each of the four levels of the GICS.Calculation Methodology for the IndexThe performance of the Index is a free float weighted average of the U.S. dollar values of its component securities.Prices used to calculate the component securities are the official exchange closing prices or prices accepted as such in the relevant market. In the case of a market closure  or if a security does not trade on a specific day or during a specific period  MSCI carries forward the previous day‚Äôs price (or latest available closing price). In the event of a market outage resulting in any component security price to be unavailable  MSCI will generally use the last reported price for such component security for the purpose of performance calculation unless MSCI determines that another price is more appropriate based on the circumstances. Closing prices are converted into U.S. dollars  as applicable  using the closing exchange rates calculated by WM/Reuters at 4:00 P.M. London Time.Index MaintenanceThe MSCI global investable market indices are maintained with the objective of reflecting the evolution of the underlying equity markets and segments on a timely basis  while seeking to achieve index continuity  continuous investability of constituents and replicability of the indices  index stability  and low index turnover. In particular  index maintenance involves:(i) Semi-Annual Index Reviews (‚ÄúSAIRs‚Äù) in May and November of the Size Segment and Global Value and Growth Indices which include:‚óæ updating the indices on the basis of a fully refreshed equity universe;‚óæ taking buffer rules into consideration for migration of securities across size and style segments; and‚óæ updating FIFs and Number of Shares (‚ÄúNOS‚Äù).(ii) Quarterly Index Reviews (‚ÄúQIRs‚Äù) in February and August of the Size Segment Indices aimed at:‚óæ including significant new eligible securities (such as IPOs that were not eligible for earlier inclusion) in the Index;‚óæ allowing for significant moves of companies within the Size Segment Indices  using wider buffers than in the SAIR; and‚óæ reflecting the impact of significant market events on FIFs and updating NOS.(iii) Ongoing Event-Related Changes: changes of this type are generally implemented in the indices as they occur. Significantly large IPOs are included in the indices after the close of the company‚Äôs tenth day of trading.None of us  RBCCM or any of our other affiliates accepts any responsibility for the calculation  maintenance  or publication of  or for any error  omission  or disruption in  the Reference Asset or any successor to the Reference Asset.Geared Buffered Enhanced Return Notes Linked to the MSCI EAFE¬Æ IndexLicense AgreementWe have entered into a non-exclusive license agreement with MSCI providing for the license to us and certain of our affiliated or subsidiary companies  in exchange for a fee  of the right to use indices owned and published by MSCI (including the Reference Asset) in connection with certain securities  including the Notes offered hereby.The license agreement between us and MSCI requires that the following language be stated in this document:THE NOTES ARE NOT SPONSORED  ENDORSED  SOLD OR PROMOTED BY MSCI INC.

2159,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/the-advisors-guide-to-global-dividend-growth,The Advisor‚Äôs Guide to Global Dividend Growth,16 hours ago,Advisors looking to learn how global dividends are positioned should look at their notable rebound in 2021  momentum that is expected to continue through this year.There are many dividend ETFs currently available to investors  with each one offering different exposure  income generation  and total return. Finding standouts in the group is difficult  but by focusing on some key metrics  investors can unearth compelling products  including the SmartETFs Dividend Builder ETF (DIVS).DIVS has 35 holdings in its portfolio  31 of which grew their dividends in 2021. Three companies kept their dividends flat  and just one company cut its dividend. This follows the momentum from 2020  which saw 28 companies grow their dividends  six keep their dividends flat  and one company cut  according to the firm.The average dividend growth across all 35 companies included in the fund was 6.3%  and the firm generally saw dividend payments surprise to the upside.The largest dividend growth in 2021 came from Otis Worldwide  which increased its dividend by 20% year-on-year.

2164,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4499331-unibail-rodamco-westfield-counting-down-to-the-dividend-reinstatement,Unibail Stock: Counting Down To The Dividend Reinstatement (OTCMKTS:UNBLF),The dividend suspension by Unibail will retain cash to strengthen its balance sheet. Read why investors should consider UNBLF stock if the price drops.,"William Barton/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroduction2020 and the first semester of 2021 haven‚Äôt been easy for commercial REITs. But in Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield (OTC:URMCY) (OTCPK:UNBLF) (here after ""Unibail"" for simplicity sake)  its issues started about five years ago when it acquired Westfield in a multi-billion transaction. This happened right before the COVID crisis  and Unibail was never able to fully integrate the newly acquired malls and generate the synergy benefits before COVID hit. Now  in 2022  the REIT plans to sell its US assets within the next two years and fall back on the European market. Back to square one  but that doesn‚Äôt mean the ""cleaned-up version"" of Unibail couldn‚Äôt be an interesting investment option.Yahoo FinanceUnibail has its primary listing on Euronext Amsterdam where it‚Äôs trading with URW as its ticker symbol. The average daily volume in Amsterdam exceeds 750 000 shares  making it the most liquid trading venue. On top of that  the Amsterdam listing offers options which could help in a scenario where one writes out of the money put options.The REIT kept the damage limited in 2021I was looking forward to seeing how the REIT performed in 2021. The first semester was rather weak as the malls owned and operated by Unibail were still facing mandatory closures. As the vaccination ratio increased throughout the second quarter of 2021  malls were allowed to reopen and the financial performance of the REIT improved.As of the end of Q2 2021  the adjusted recurring EPS (comparable to the FFO) was 3.24 EUR per share  down from 4.65 EUR per share in H1 2020 as the first quarter of 2020 was still pretty normal  and Unibail had more income-generating assets. The majority of the COVID-related impact in 2020 was recorded in the second half of the year as Unibail‚Äôs adjusted recurring EPS was just 2.63 EUR per share. So looking at that weak result in H2 2020  the recurring EPS of 3.24 EUR in H1 wasn‚Äôt too bad as it represented a 20% increase compared to the preceding semester.Unibail‚Äôs full-year recurring EPS in 2021 came in at 6.91 EUR per share. Deducting the 3.24 EUR per share generated in H1 2021  the H2 EPS was approximately 3.67 EUR or in excess of 7.25 EUR on an annualized basis  and that‚Äôs quite encouraging.Unibail Investor RelationsIt‚Äôs still lower than FY 2020 but keep in mind throughout 2020 and 2021 Unibail continued to sell assets to the tune of 3.3B EUR (with for instance the sale of office properties for in excess of 200M EUR and 620M EUR) and that obviously had a negative impact on the recurring EPS as Unibail is repositioning itself.For 2022  Unibail is now aiming to generate 8.2-8.4 EUR in adjusted recurring earnings per share which would be another major step forward. Of course  effectively realizing this result will depend on the timing of the sale of the US-based assets.Although Unibail has posted okay results in 2020  good results in 2021 and a very positive guidance for 2022  the REIT is still foregoing paying a dividend as it first wants to get its balance sheet back into a much stronger position.Its plans for 2024 are encouraging  but Unibail will have lost a decadeIt wasn‚Äôt a secret Unibail wanted to sell its US assets and although it's taking a bit longer than expected  Unibail now wants to complete the sale of its US portfolio by the end of 2023. This will result in Unibail becoming a pure European commercial REIT with a stronger balance sheet than it currently has as Unibail is aiming to achieve a 40% LTV ratio by the time the US portfolio has been sold.Unibail Investor RelationsIt looks like Unibail is already preparing the market for a disappointing sales price for the US assets as the REIT provided a sensitivity analysis on how the LTV ratio will evolve depending on the discount it needs to apply to the book value of the US assets to get rid of them. As you can see below  the REIT‚Äôs most optimistic scenario appears to be a ""sell at book value"" as there‚Äôs zero data on what would happen if the assets would be sold above book value.Unibail Investor RelationsAs you can see above  if the US assets would be sold at a discount of 30% to the book value  the total LTV ratio would fall to just 37.6% (including the deeply subordinated hybrid securities). The financial health of Unibail depends on selling the US assets at a valuation that‚Äôs as high as possible. The lower LTV ratio also will help Unibail to self fund its own development pipeline where it has identified over 3B EUR in projects.Unibail also provided a guidance for 2024 on a Europe-only basis. The REIT expects its net rental income to get back to the pre-COVID level.Unibail Investor RelationsThis allows us to calculate the recurring EPS for 2024 as we can apply some assumptions for the G&A expenses (175M EUR  down from 212M EUR in 2021 as the overhead expenses will decrease upon closing the sale of the US assets) and the interest expenses (250M EUR). We also should deduct the payments on the hybrid securities and the stake of the non-controlling interests making it realistic to see a direct result of around 1B EUR per share. Note: A lot will depend on the sale of the US assets which have a current book value of approximately 12B EUR. And the real sales price will determine how much debt Unibail can repay and by how much the interest expenses will decrease.Unibail Investor RelationsThe bottom line is  however  that Unibail will have spent 2018-2024 only to end back on square one. It spread itself too thin when it acquired Westfield and I hope the REIT will have learned its lesson.Investment thesisCanceling the dividend due to the COVID pandemic likely was a blessing in disguise. As COVID has hit all commercial REITs pretty hard  Unibail‚Äôs dividend cancellation got lost in a myriad of other REITs doing the same thing. I also think the decision to forego dividend payments in 2021 and 2022 as well was the smartest thing to do. This allowed Unibail to retain approximately 22 EUR per share in earnings and with just under 139M shares outstanding. This basically means Unibail will have hoarded about 3B EUR in cash flow to reduce the balance sheet risk.That‚Äôs tough for income investors  but I like the drastic approach. Save 3B EUR  dispose of the assets you no longer want and start rebuilding from there. The unknown factor in the Unibail story is the sale of the US assets as the higher the discount on the book value  the lower the impact on the LTV ratio of the REIT.2022 will be a good year with a recurring EPS of in excess of 8 EUR per share  but I think the sale of the US portfolio may have a negative impact on the anticipated EPS but the positive consequence will be the safer balance sheet.The dividend will return from FY 2023 on (payable in CY 2024) so there‚Äôs no rush for dividend investors to pick up the stock. But the next 12-18 months will likely offer some interesting opportunities to pick up the stock ahead of the dividend reinstatement (a payout ratio of 75% on a recurring EPS of 7.5 EUR would indicate a dividend of just over 5 EUR per share  subject to the 12.8% dividend withholding tax in France). I currently have no position in Unibail but I have written some put options. Those put options are currently all out of the money  and I will likely continue to write put options to take advantage from the high volatility levels. An investment in Unibail is a waiting game.",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.22,0.09,0.69,True,English,"['Unibail Stock', 'Dividend Reinstatement', 'The', 'OTCMKTS', 'UNBLF', 'pure European commercial REIT', 'next two years', 'interesting investment option', 'average daily volume', 'disappointing sales price', 'net rental income', 'G&A expenses', 'total LTV ratio', 'lower LTV ratio', 'stronger balance sheet', 'Unibail Investor Relations', 'full-year recurring EPS', 'commercial REITs', '40% LTV ratio', 'European market', 'stronger position', 'vaccination ratio', 'overhead expenses', 'interest expenses', 'recurring earnings', 'William Barton', 'iStock Editorial', 'Getty Images', 'first semester', 'OTCPK:UNBLF', 'simplicity sake', 'multi-billion transaction', 'synergy benefits', 'up version', 'Yahoo Finance', 'primary listing', 'ticker symbol', 'trading venue', 'mandatory closures', 'second quarter', 'financial performance', 'first quarter', 'COVID-related impact', 'second half', 'preceding semester', 'office properties', 'negative impact', 'major step', 'okay results', 'good results', 'US portfolio', 'sensitivity analysis', 'book value', 'zero data', 'hybrid securities', 'financial health', 'development pipeline', 'controlling interests', 'US assets', 'income-generating assets', 'US-based assets', 'COVID crisis', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Amsterdam listing', 'COVID level', 'H2 EPS', 'The REIT', 'weak result', 'annualized basis', 'positive guidance', 'optimistic scenario', '8.2-8.4 EUR', '3B EUR', '3.3B', '24 EUR', '6.91 EUR', 'Introduction', 'Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield', 'URMCY', 'issues', 'malls', 'square', 'URW', '750,000 shares', 'top', 'options', 'money', 'damage', 'end', 'Q2', 'FFO', 'H1', 'majority', '20% increase', 'excess', 'FY', 'mind', 'tune', 'instance', '200M', '620M', 'timing', 'plans', 'decade', 'secret', 'time', 'discount', 'sell', 'valuation', 'projects', 'assumptions', '212M', '250M', 'payments', 'stake', '4.65', '2.63', '7.25', '2022', '2024', '37']",2022-04-02,2022-04-02,seekingalpha.com

L‚ÄôOr√©al  Sanofi‚Äôs largest shareholder  has committed to a lock-up period of 1 year following the settlement of the Distribution  i.e.  May 10  2022Paris  April 1  2022. Sanofi announced today that the French Autorit√© des march√©s financiers (AMF) has approved the listing prospectus prepared by EUROAPI in connection with the intended listing of its shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris.On March 17th  2022  Sanofi‚Äôs Board of Directors unanimously decided to submit for approval to its shareholders the proposed distribution in kind (the ‚ÄúDistribution‚Äù) of EUROAPI shares  via an additional extraordinary dividend  exclusively in kind  in addition to the previously proposed ‚Ç¨3.33 cash dividend per Sanofi share. The Distribution relates to circa 58% of the share capital and voting rights of EUROAPI. In connection with the proposed Distribution  EPIC Bpifrance has agreed to purchase 12% of EUROAPI shares1 from Sanofi  which confirmed its intention to hold circa 30% of the share capital and voting rights of the company after the Distribution.The Distribution by Sanofi to its shareholders of EUROAPI shares in the form of an additional extraordinary dividend  exclusively in kind  is subject to the shareholders‚Äô approval at Sanofi‚Äôs May 3  2022 Ordinary and Extraordinary Shareholders‚Äô Meeting.Subject to certain customary exceptions  the following lock-up periods have been agreed:2 years for Sanofi and EPIC Bpifrance following the settlement and delivery of the EUROAPI shares to be sold to EPIC Bpifrance; and1 year for L‚ÄôOr√©al  Sanofi‚Äôs largest shareholder and for Karl Rotthier  CEO of the Company  following the settlement of the Distribution.Main features of the Distribution are as follows:The Distribution ratio will be one (1) EUROAPI share per twenty three (23) Sanofi shares.No fractional EUROAPI shares will be issued. Any right to receive a fractional share will not be tradable or transferable. Consequently  when the amount of the Distribution to which a Sanofi shareholder is entitled does not correspond to a whole number of EUROAPI shares (i.e.  less than twenty three (23) or a multiple of twenty three (23) Sanofi shares)  the shareholder will receive the immediately lower number of EUROAPI shares  plus a cash payment for the whole of the balance arising from the price at which EUROAPI shares corresponding to fractional shares were sold. Each financial intermediary will sell the shares corresponding to the fractional shares of its entitled clients. As a result  the amount of the cash balance may vary depending on the shareholder‚Äôs financial intermediary;The technical reference price of EUROAPI shares is expected to be announced on May 5  2022 by Euronext Paris after market close;The admission to trading of the EUROAPI shares and the ex-date (d√©tachement) of the Distribution will occur at 9.00 am (CET) on May 6  2022;The record date (the date on which positions are closed) for Sanofi shares to be eligible to the Distribution is scheduled on May 9  2022;Payment of the Distribution (delivery and book-entry of the allocated EUROAPI shares) will take place on May 10  2022.Following the Distribution and the purchase of 12% of EUROAPI shares by EPIC Bpifrance  the Sanofi group will no longer control EUROAPI  resulting in a slightly accretive impact on Sanofi 2022 business operating income (BOI) margin2.Documents related to Sanofi shareholders‚Äô meeting will be made available on April 11  2022 on the Sanofi dedicated web page.Investors are invited to read EUROAPI‚Äôs press release  issued concurrently and available on EUROAPI‚Äôs website announcing the AMF‚Äôs approval of its prospectus  and the listing prospectus in order to fully understand the potential risks and rewards associated with any decision to invest in EUROAPI shares.

2167,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/oslo-tops-chart-for-shipping-listings/,Oslo tops chart for shipping listings,1 day ago,√òivind Amundsen  CEO of the Oslo B√∏rs  the Norwegian Stock Exchange  part of the Euronext Group  ‚Äòshares‚Äô his thoughts on why Norway offers an unmatched infrastructure for raising capital amid a market uptick in new listing sectors like containers and car carriers.Oslo B√∏rs has firmly cemented its position as the world‚Äôs leading maritime and shipping exchange. It now hosts around 40 top maritime companies that boast a combined market cap of close to ‚Ç¨20bn. Up from less than 30 companies just a few years ago  these entities also raise large amounts of money through follow-on offerings and the Oslo B√∏rs bond markets.Just in the past 12 months  five new shipping companies have joined the roster despite ongoing pandemic challenges. The latest to ring the bell were Gram Car Carriers and LNG carrier Cool Company in January  H√∂egh Autoliners and dry-bulk newcomer Himalaya Shipping just before Christmas  and Western Bulk Chart and HAV Group in September and March 2021  respectively.Shipping speciality‚ÄúTo my knowledge  no other stock exchange boasts so many shipping companies  making shipping one of our three strongest verticals alongside energy and fisheries ‚Äù says Amundsen.Most are Norwegian-owned  but considered international as they are typically incorporated abroad. Sixteen of the 40 companies are incorporated outside Norway. Wilhelmsen Group is an example of a local stalwart that has been listed for many years. ‚ÄúWe also have fully international companies with little connection to Norway today in principle. BW Group of Singapore  for example  has a strong presence with five listed arms  including BW Epic Kosan and BW LPG ‚Äù says Amundsen.Investors speak shippingThey are attracted by Norway‚Äôs knowledgeable financial ecosystem  including well-informed investors. ‚ÄúComing here you don‚Äôt have to explain what a VLCC or a supramax is. They might be arcane terms anywhere else  but in Oslo most investors know what you‚Äôre talking about immediately ‚Äù says Amundsen.He highlights MPC Container Ships to illustrate the user benefits of Norway‚Äôs savvy investor base  as well as how a company can mature from the Oslo B√∏rs‚Äô junior to senior markets. ‚ÄúBased in Germany  they first listed on our OTC platform a few years ago when the box market was at rock bottom. They soon progressed to our Growth then Expand markets  and within the past 12 months to our main market and main index. I doubt that journey could be replicated as smoothly elsewhere.‚ÄùThe shipping capital markets are emerging from a multiyear lull  with significant pick-up in new sectors like containers and car carriers. ‚ÄúI hope that continues  but I have no crystal ball regarding future developments. Macro events have an impact on shipping of course  with tanker and gas rates likely to rise given the need for more energy shipments in the wake of war in Ukraine  for example. But everything changes over time  which explains the cyclical nature of shipping ‚Äù Amundsen says.Increased liquidity and solid returnsLiquidity in shipping shares has also surged  with larger companies like Wallenius Wilhelmsen  Stolt-Nielsen  Golden Ocean and FLEX LNG now qualifying for blue-chip indices such as the benchmark OSEBX. ‚ÄúOur Oslo Shipping Index with component companies in many segments has increased in value by just north of 50% in the last 12 months  on the back of solid earnings and increased interest. It maybe doesn‚Äôt quite mirror the good times before 2008 when the offshore focus was greater  but it‚Äôs very encouraging ‚Äù says Amundsen.Decarbonisation tops agendaMeanwhile  the industry faces an unprecedented paradigm shift given the IM0‚Äôs target to achieve a 50% reduction in emissions by 2050  upcoming EEXI and CII regulations and the Fit for 55 package of legislative proposals in Europe.‚ÄúMost shipping companies will have to go through a decarbonization process that will require enormous capital in the coming years. Many new entrants and existing issuers have already committed significant CAPEX to upgrade existing tonnage  order environmentally friendly vessels  energy-efficient propulsion technologies  and  not least  digitalize. They are increasingly highlighting these efforts in their investor pitches  and Oslo B√∏rs will be a key enabler ‚Äù Amundsen says. ‚ÄúWe will also continue to champion transparency across the capital markets.‚ÄùShipping companies have also issued green bonds  some with stringent emission reporting requirements and variable interest payments tied to them. ‚ÄúThis trend will continue to develop as companies seek various forms of financing and investors seek instruments with a clear ‚ÄòESG‚Äô link ‚Äù he adds.Staying ahead of the gameThe transition to clean fuels is a big change requiring new thinking across the board. Shipping companies are obliged to comply with mandatory requirements  but many want to future-proof in any case. ‚ÄúIt makes good commercial sense  as those in the front line will be better equipped to win business and good charters in future. If you don‚Äôt move with the times  you lose ground ‚Äù Amundsen says.Institutional investors (such as pension and insurance funds  among others) account for 90% of the market cap on Oslo B√∏rs and have their own ESG imperatives to invest in companies actively participating in the green shift  not just ‚Äògreenwashing‚Äô. ‚ÄúWe will launch the OBX ESG index to help drive investment towards sustainable projects ‚Äù Amundsen says.Door is open for suppliers‚ÄúWe would also like see more technology vendors and service providers execute listings and raise funds ‚Äù he adds  highlighting equipment specialist TECO 2030  which listed on the Euronext Growth in late 2020  as a good example of a supply-side innovator making the most the financial community‚Äôs growing interest in cleantech value creation.Another key selling point is that Norway remains buoyant in analyst coverage  versus Asia and the US where it has reduced in recent years. ‚ÄúWe have the highest number of analysts covering shipping stocks and they always do well in global rankings. High-quality coverage is a big draw ‚Äù he says.Nor-Shipping bolsters networkNor-Shipping is very important for Euronext. ‚ÄúWe opted to become a partner because  as the world‚Äôs pre-eminent industry meeting it‚Äôs the best place to catch up with existing customers and describe what Euronext and the Norwegian market can offer to prospective new issuers. Raising risk capital especially in a cyclical industry like shipping is easier here than many other markets  again because shipping is in Norway‚Äôs DNA ‚Äù Amundsen says.He is very much looking forward to meeting old friends and faces out and about next week. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a hectic few days  but I‚Äôm ready and excited. Being an ambassador for the exchange gives me a lot of energy ‚Äù he concludes.Source: Nor-Shipping,neutral,0.13,0.86,0.02,mixed,0.43,0.19,0.39,True,English,"['Oslo tops chart', 'shipping listings', 'Oslo B√∏rs bond markets', 'stringent emission reporting requirements', 'Oslo B√∏rs‚Äô junior', 'dry-bulk newcomer Himalaya Shipping', 'LNG carrier Cool Company', 'five new shipping companies', 'five listed arms', 'ongoing pandemic challenges', 'H√∂egh Autoliners', 'Western Bulk Chart', 'three strongest verticals', 'knowledgeable financial ecosystem', 'MPC Container Ships', 'unprecedented paradigm shift', 'environmentally friendly vessels', 'energy-efficient propulsion technologies', 'clear ‚ÄòESG‚Äô link', 'Norwegian Stock Exchange', 'other stock exchange', 'savvy investor base', 'BW Epic Kosan', 'good commercial sense', 'new listing sectors', 'Many new entrants', 'variable interest payments', 'Oslo Shipping Index', 'Gram Car Carriers', '40 top maritime companies', 'many shipping companies', 'Most shipping companies', 'shipping capital markets', 'new sectors', 'FLEX LNG', 'mandatory requirements', 'shipping exchange', 'new thinking', 'senior markets', 'leading maritime', 'many years', 'main index', 'many segments', 'investor pitches', 'BW Group', 'BW LPG', 'good charters', 'Shipping speciality', 'shipping shares', 'international companies', 'larger companies', 'component companies', 'Euronext Group', 'unmatched infrastructure', 'market uptick', 'market cap', 'large amounts', 'past 12 months', 'HAV Group', 'Wilhelmsen Group', 'local stalwart', 'little connection', 'strong presence', 'arcane terms', 'user benefits', 'OTC platform', 'box market', 'rock bottom', 'main market', 'multiyear lull', 'significant pick-up', 'crystal ball', 'Macro events', 'gas rates', 'cyclical nature', 'solid returns', 'Wallenius Wilhelmsen', 'Golden Ocean', 'blue-chip indices', 'last 12 months', 'solid earnings', 'offshore focus', 'upcoming EEXI', 'CII regulations', 'legislative proposals', 'decarbonization process', 'enormous capital', 'coming years', 'existing issuers', 'significant CAPEX', 'existing tonnage', 'key enabler', 'green bonds', 'various forms', 'clean fuels', 'big change', 'front line', 'most investors', 'good times', 'future developments', 'energy shipments', 'Increased liquidity', 'Institutional investors', '√òivind Amundsen', '30 companies', '40 companies', 'CEO', 'part', 'thoughts', 'Norway', 'containers', 'position', 'world', 'combined', 'less', 'entities', 'money', 'offerings', 'roster', 'bell', 'January', 'Christmas', 'September', 'March', 'fisheries', 'example', 'principle', 'Singapore', 'VLCC', 'supramax', 'Germany', 'Growth', 'journey', 'impact', 'course', 'tanker', 'need', 'wake', 'Ukraine', 'everything', 'Stolt-Nielsen', 'benchmark', 'OSEBX.', 'value', 'back', 'Decarbonisation', 'agenda', 'industry', 'IM0', 'target', '50% reduction', 'emissions', '55 package', 'Europe', 'efforts', 'transparency', 'trend', 'financing', 'instruments', 'game', 'transition', 'board', 'case', 'business', 'ground', 'pensio', '2050']",2022-04-02,2022-04-02,hellenicshippingnews.com
2168,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.etfstrategy.com/wisdomtree-unveils-cardano-solana-and-polkadot-crypto-etps-10339/,WisdomTree unveils Cardano  Solana  and Polkadot crypto ETPs,1 day ago,ETF STRATEGY NEWS! ETF Strategy is delighted to announce the launch of ETF Strategy Hub (hub.etfstrategy.com)  an on-demand repository of webcasts  videos  podcasts and white papers. Debuting with Special Series on Technology & Innovation in China and the Digital Economy.WisdomTree has added a trio of directly backed altcoin ETPs to its digital assets suite in Europe.The new listings provide exposure to ADA  SOL  and MATIC  the native tokens underpinning the Solana  Cardano  and Polkadot networks  respectively.The WisdomTree Cardano ETP (ADAW)  WisdomTree Solana ETP (SOLW)  and WisdomTree Polkadot ETP (DOTW) have been listed on SIX Swiss Exchange in US dollars and Swiss francs  on Euronext Amsterdam in US dollars  and on Euronext Paris and Deutsche B√∂rse Xetra in euros.The ETPs enable investors to access popular altcoins without the need to hold them directly  store private access keys  or interact with the blockchain or digital currency infrastructure in any way.They use full direct  so-called ‚Äòphysical‚Äô replication with each ETP share being 100% collateralized by a corresponding investment in ADA  SOL  or MATIC. Investors in the ETPs benefit from institutional-grade cold storage solutions without the need to personally set up the arrangement with a custodian.According to WisdomTree  the ETPs also offer the potential to deliver ‚Äòstaking‚Äô rewards to investors. Staking is a way of earning income for holding certain cryptocurrencies that work on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Proof-of-stake mechanisms put their underlying cryptocurrency to work in verifying and securing transactions on the blockchain. Investors who choose to take part in this process ‚Äòstake‚Äô their cryptocurrency holdings and earn rewards for doing so.Each ETP comes with an expense ratio of 0.95% WisdomTree now offers eight directly backed crypto asset ETPs in Europe. Aside from the current listings  the suite also comprises Bitcoin and Ethereum products as well as three ETPs  launched in December 2021  providing exposure to mega-cap  broad market  and altcoin baskets of cryptocurrencies.Jason Guthrie  Head of Digital Assets  Europe  WisdomTree  said: ‚ÄúWe want to provide investors with a range of crypto asset exposures  whether that be through diversified baskets or single trackers. A key component of our approach is launching strategies that will resonate with institutional investors. These need to be crypto assets that are liquid enough for institutional use  are supported by ETP market participants  and have clear use cases. As the crypto asset market evolves  so too will the ETP ecosystem which is needed for more institutional adoption. We will continue to enhance and expand our product range  supporting investors on their journey into crypto assets‚Äù.Alexis Marinof  Head of Europe  WisdomTree  added: ‚ÄúDigital assets are an exciting and growing asset class which is continuing to capture the imagination of investors. Interesting and different use cases for the likes of Cardano  Solana  and Polkadot represent the next stage of evolution for this young asset class. While Bitcoin and Ethereum grab the headlines  altcoins are now viable options for many institutional investors  providing more options to diversify their crypto holdings just like they would with any other asset class.‚ÄùCardanoCardano  developed by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson  is a smart contract platform enabling developers to build decentralized applications.Unlike other leading smart contract platforms such as Ethereum  Cardano powers its transaction settlement using a proof-of-stake algorithm  a structure considered less risky in terms of the potential for miners to attack the network.With a total market capitalization of $38.2 billion  ADA is currently ranked as the eighth-largest cryptocurrency globally.SolanaSolana  launched in March 2020  is a highly functional open-source project providing decentralized finance solutions.Solana‚Äôs main innovation is its proof-of-history consensus which leads to incredibly short validation times of less than half a second (compared to 15 seconds for Ethereum and around 10 minutes for Bitcoin) and allows the blockchain to handle thousands of transactions per second.The protocol is designed in such a way as to have low transaction costs while still guaranteeing speed and scalability.Due to its lightning-fast validation times  Solana has attracted a lot of institutional interest  and SOL is currently the sixth-largest cryptocurrency globally with a total market capitalization of $40.2bn.PolkadotPolkadot is a blockchain of blockchains  allowing otherwise independent blockchains to communicate with each other  share security features  and transfer assets freely amongst themselves.The DOT token serves two vital roles in the system ‚Äì it is designed to participate in governance decisions  including tabling proposals and voting  and it is used as an electronic payment system.With a current market capitalization of $21.0bn  DOT is the eleventh-largest cryptocurrency globally.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.51,0.18,0.31,True,English,"['crypto ETPs', 'WisdomTree', 'Cardano', 'Solana', 'Polkadot', 'other leading smart contract platforms', 'Deutsche B√∂rse Xetra', 'institutional-grade cold storage solutions', 'backed crypto asset ETPs', 'other asset class', 'The WisdomTree Cardano ETP', 'growing asset class', 'young asset class', 'private access keys', 'mega-cap, broad market', 'total market capitalization', 'functional open-source project', 'decentralized finance solutions', 'short validation times', 'lightning-fast validation times', 'two vital roles', 'crypto asset exposures', 'crypto asset market', 'clear use cases', 'different use cases', 'ETP market participants', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'low transaction costs', 'current market capitalization', 'digital currency infrastructure', 'ETF STRATEGY NEWS', 'ETF Strategy Hub', 'The DOT token', 'electronic payment system', 'stake consensus mechanism', 'many institutional investors', 'digital assets suite', 'WisdomTree Polkadot ETP', 'WisdomTree Solana ETP', 'The ETPs', 'institutional use', 'crypto assets', 'crypto holdings', 'ETP share', 'ETP ecosystem', 'Swiss francs', 'current listings', 'decentralized applications', 'transaction settlement', 'history consensus', 'Digital Economy', 'stake mechanisms', 'stake algorithm', 'institutional adoption', 'institutional interest', 'white papers', 'Special Series', 'altcoin ETPs', 'new listings', 'native tokens', 'US dollars', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Euronext Paris', 'physical‚Äô replication', 'corresponding investment', 'underlying cryptocurrency', 'cryptocurrency holdings', 'expense ratio', 'three ETPs', 'altcoin baskets', 'Jason Guthrie', 'diversified baskets', 'single trackers', 'key component', 'Alexis Marinof', 'next stage', 'Charles Hoskinson', 'largest cryptocurrency', 'half a', 'security features', 'governance decisions', 'Cardano Cardano', 'Polkadot networks', 'popular altcoins', 'product range', 'viable options', 'main innovation', 'independent blockchains', 'Ethereum products', 'Solana Solana', 'staking‚Äô rewards', 'launch', 'etfstrategy', 'demand', 'repository', 'webcasts', 'videos', 'podcasts', 'Technology', 'China', 'trio', 'Europe', 'ADA', 'MATIC', 'SOLW', 'DOTW', 'euros', 'need', 'way', 'arrangement', 'custodian', 'potential', 'income', 'cryptocurrencies', 'proof', 'transactions', 'process', 'eight', 'Bitcoin', 'December', 'Head', 'approach', 'strategies', 'journey', 'exciting', 'imagination', 'Interesting', 'likes', 'evolution', 'founder', 'developers', 'terms', 'miners', 'March', 'less', '15 seconds', '10 minutes', 'thousands', 'protocol', 'speed', 'scalability', 'lot', 'sixth', 'proposals', 'voting']",2022-04-01,2022-04-02,etfstrategy.com
