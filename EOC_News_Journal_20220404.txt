Anette is deemed independent in relation to both the company and its management  as well as in relation to the company's major shareholders.Election of the auditor (item 16)The nomination committee proposes re-election of the auditing company √ñhrlings PricewaterhouseCoopers AB (PwC)  as the company's auditor for the period until the end of the Annual General Meeting to be held 2023. Tobias Str√•hle is proposed by PwC as auditor in charge if they are elected. The proposition is in accordance with the board of director's recommendation.The board of directors' proposal on a share issue authorization (item 18)The board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize to the board  up and until the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without pre-emptive rights for shareholders  to resolve on the issue of new shares of series B  comprising a total of not more than 20 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the company after the utilization of the authorization. It shall also be possible to make such an issue resolution stipulating in-kind payment  the right to offset debt or other conditions referred to in Chapter 13 Section 5 first paragraph item 6 in the Swedish Companies Act.The purpose of the authorization is to provide flexibility to the board in its work to ensure that the company can appropriately raise capital for the financing of the business. Issuances of new shares under the authorization shall be made on market terms.The board of directors' proposal for resolution on the issue of warrants of series 2022:1 (item 19)The board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants and to approve of transfer of the warrants in accordance with the following.Issue of warrantsThe board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to carry out a directed issue of not more than 850 000 warrants  entailing an increase in the share capital of not more than SEK 425 000 at full subscription. The resolution shall otherwise be governed by the following terms and conditions.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  be vested in the company's wholly owned subsidiary Medivir Personal AB  Reg. no. 556598-2823 (the ""Subsidiary"")  with the right and obligation for the Subsidiary to transfer the warrants to employees pursuant to the below. Over-subscription is not possible.The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights are to stimulate shareholding in the company by virtue of an incentive program through which employees can take part of and contribute to a positive value increase of the company's share during the period of the proposed program  and that the company shall be able to retain and recruit competent and dedicated staff.The warrants shall be issued at no consideration. Subscription must be completed no later than three weeks after the resolution on issue of warrants. The board shall be entitled to extend the subscription period.Each warrant entitles a right to subscribe for one share of series B in the company. The warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new series B shares during the period from and including 1 December 2025 up to and including 15 December 2025. The new shares which may be issued due to subscription are not subject to any restrictive provisions.The subscription price (strike price) shall be established by the company  or by an independent appraiser or auditor firm retained by the company  and correspond to 175 per cent of the volume weighted average price of the series B share according the official share list of Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days immediately preceding the offer to subscribe for warrants  however not less than the quota value of the shares. The amount of the subscription price exceeding the quota value of the shares shall be contributed to the free share premium reserve.Shares which are newly issued following subscription by virtue of the warrants shall carry an entitlement to participate in dividends for the first time on the next record date for dividends which occurs after subscription for shares by virtue of the utilization of the warrants is effected.The company may  by means of a board resolution and with the consent from the board of directors in the Subsidiary  cancel the Subsidiary's warrants that are not transferred in accordance with the below or that have been re-purchased from participants. Cancellation shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  is authorized to make such minor adjustments to the resolution which may prove necessary in order to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Approval of transfer of warrantsThe board proposes that the general meeting approves of the Subsidiary's transfer of warrants on the following conditions.The right to subscribe for share warrants from the Subsidiary shall vest in the following categories of employees:Category Maximum number of warrants per person Maximum number of warrants per category A. Managing director (not more than 1 person) 300 000 300 000 B. Other members of the executive management(not more than 4 persons) 100 000 400 000 C. Other employees (not more than 6 persons) 25 000 150 000The right to purchase warrants from the Subsidiary shall only vest in employees who  at the end of the application period  have not terminated their employment  have not had their employment terminated or otherwise have given notice  or been notified  of employment termination.Warrants may also be offered to future employees. For such acquisitions  the conditions shall be the same or equivalent to what is stated in this resolution. This means  inter alia  that acquisitions shall be made to the market value at the time of the acquisition.Transfer of warrants to participants is conditional upon it being legally possible to purchase the warrants  and that such transfers can be done using reasonable administrative and financial resources according to the assessment of the board.Application and allotmentApplication for acquisition of warrants shall be made during the period from and including 15 May 2022 up until and including 22 May 2022. The board of the company shall however be entitled to extend the application period for acquisitions and to set a corresponding application period for new employees whose acquisitions are made after the expiration of the initial application period.Medivir shall  in connection with the allocation of the warrants to the participants in the program  and with certain exceptions  reserve a repurchase right regarding the warrants if the participant's employment or assignment within the group is terminated or if the participant wishes to transfer his/her warrants prior to the warrants being exercisable.Should warrants of a certain category remain with the Subsidiary after all applications within the category have been satisfied  the remaining warrants shall be available for allotment to participants in that same or another category whereby the board shall determine the distribution based on participant category  employment category and the number of warrants applied for. However  such distribution must not result in the maximum amount of warrants per person in a certain category being exceeded by more than 50 per cent.The board of the company shall determine the final allotment and the date of the transfer of the warrants. The transfer of warrants may be made up until and including 31 December 2021.Price and payment etc.The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price (premium) established on the basis of a market value of the warrants calculated by an independent valuation institute using the Black & Scholes valuation model. A new market value shall be established in an equivalent way for acquisitions made by new employees after the expiration of the initial application period. The value has preliminary been calculated to be SEK 1.34 per warrant based on a share price of SEK 8.Payment for the allocated warrants shall be made in cash no later than five days following the application for acquisition. The board shall establish a corresponding date of payment for acquisitions made by new employees.Medivir will partly subsidize the participant's acquisition of warrants. The subsidy shall be paid in connection with the allocation of warrants to the participants. The total subsidy granted to the participant shall correspond to half of the participant's investment (after deduction of any income tax of the participant). The total cost for the subsidy  based on the above preliminary value of the warrants  is estimated at SEK 1 740 551 for the entire term of the warrant programme of three years  including any social security contributions.In order to be eligible for the subsidy  the participant must  at the time of the payment of the bonus  not have been dismissed (Sw. avskedad )  terminated his/her employment or given notice of employment termination  remain employed in the company for three years  or the subsidy will  with certain exceptions  be prorated  and must not have transferred his/her warrants.Further information on the warrant programDilutionUpon full exercise of all warrants  850 000 new shares can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.5 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the company  however  subject to any potential adjustment which may occur under the terms and conditions for the warrants. Accordingly  the program offers the employees the possibility to increase their shareholding in the company to the corresponding figure.Impact of financial ratio and costs for the company etc.The company's earnings per share are not affected by the issue of the warrants as the present value of the warrants' strike price exceeds the current market value of the share at the date of issue. Since the warrants are transferred to the participants at market value it is not expected that the company will incur any personnel costs. The warrant program will incur costs in relation to the subsidy that the participants are entitled to. Such costs amount to a maximum of SEK 1 740 551 for the entire term of the warrant program of three years. The warrant program may also incur certain limited costs in terms of external consulting fees and costs relating to the administration of the warrant program.Preparation of the matterThe principles of the warrant program have been prepared by the board of the company and are based on the warrant programs adopted by the annual general meetings 2020 and 2021. The board has thereafter decided to submit this proposal to the annual general meeting. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Other share related incentive programs etc.Except from the current proposal to issue warrants and the warrant programs resolved upon at the annual general meetings 2020 and 2021  the company has no outstanding share related incentive programs. It is the board's intention that the program shall recur annually  albeit in varying sizes.Authorization for the board of directorsThe board proposes that the meeting authorizes the board to execute the resolution in accordance with the above and to ensure that the Subsidiary's board of directors carries out the transfer of the warrants in accordance with the above.Majority requirementsA decision according to the proposal pursuant to item 18 above is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the annual general meeting. A decision according to the proposal pursuant to item 19 above is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the annual general meeting.DocumentationThe annual report  the remuneration report and other supporting documentation for resolutions will be available at the company's offices  Medivir AB  Lunastigen 5  SE-141 22 Huddinge  Sweden no later than three weeks prior to the meeting.

Please see section 11 of the Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting.By order of the BoardThrogmorton Secretaries LLPCompany Secretary4 April 2022Registered Office:6th FloorBastion House140 London WallLondon EC2Y 5DNExplanatory Notes on the resolutionsAn explanation of each of the resolutions is set out below.Resolution 1 ‚Äì To receive and adopt the Annual Report and AccountsThe Directors are required to present the financial statements  Directors‚Äô Report and Auditor‚Äôs Report to the meeting. These are contained in the Company‚Äôs Annual Report and Financial Statements for the period ended 31 December 2021 (the ‚ÄúAnnual Report‚Äù). A resolution to receive and adopt the financial statements  together with the Directors‚Äô Report and the Auditor‚Äôs Report on those accounts  is included as an ordinary resolution.Resolutions 2-5 ‚Äì Re-election of DirectorsIn accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code  all of the Directors will retire and offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.The Company has three non-executive directors  all of whom are determined by the Board to be independent directors in accordance with the criteria set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board considers that their skills  experience  independence and knowledge of the Company enable them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectivelyEach of the Board members‚Äô biographical details are set out on the Company‚Äôs website at https://www.physitrackgroup.com/governance/board-directors.Resolutions 6 and 7 ‚Äì Appointment and Remuneration of AuditorAt each meeting at which the Company‚Äôs financial statements are presented to its members  the Company is required to appoint an auditor to serve until the next such meeting. As part of its review of the continuing appointment of the auditors  the Board considers the length of tenure of the audit firm  its fees and independence along with any matters raised during each audit. Mazars LLP are the appointed auditors of the Company. Following a tender process in 2020 Mazars performed an audit on the 2018  2019 and 2020 figures for the purpose of the IPO prospective. The audit of the period ended 21 December 2021 was the first audit by Mazars since Physitrack PLC became a public company. The Board recommends the re-appointment of Mazars LLP and this will be proposed to the AGM as Resolution 6. Resolution 7 authorises the Directors to determine the remuneration of Mazars LLP as Auditor.Resolution 8 ‚Äì Authority to allot Ordinary SharesThe Directors may only allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  shares if authorised to do so by shareholders. Resolution 8 will  if passed  authorise the Directors to allot the Company‚Äôs Ordinary Shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  Ordinary Shares in the Company up to a maximum nominal amount of ¬£3 252.15 representing 3 252 153 Ordinary Shares and is equivalent to approximately 20 per cent. of the Company‚Äôs existing issued Ordinary Share capital as at 3 April 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of the Notice).Resolution 9 ‚Äì Authority to dis-apply pre-emption rightsResolution 9 is a special resolution which is being proposed to authorise the Directors to disapply the pre-emption rights of existing Shareholders in relation to issues of Ordinary Shares under Resolution 8 (being in respect of ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal value of ¬£3 252.15  representing up to approximately 20 per cent. of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the Notice)  provided that in the case of any Ordinary Shares allotted the issue price is no lower than the nominal value per Ordinary Share.Resolution 10 ‚Äì Share RepurchasesResolution 10 is also a special resolution. The Companies Act 2006 allows companies to hold shares acquired by way of market purchase as treasury shares  rather than having to cancel them. This would give the Company the ability to re-issue Ordinary Shares quickly and cost effectively thereby improving liquidity and providing the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.No Ordinary Shares will be sold from treasury at a price less than the net asset value per existing ordinary share at the time of their sale unless they are first offered pro rata to existing Shareholders.The Company may seek to address any significant discount to net asset value at which its Ordinary Shares may be trading by purchasing its own Ordinary Shares in the market on an ad hoc basis.The Directors currently have the authority to make market purchases of up to 10 per cent. of the Ordinary Shares in issue and are seeking to renew this authority to issue up to 10% of the Company‚Äôs issued share capital  which equates to 1 626 077 at the date of this notice. The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for an ordinary share must not be more than the higher of:(i) 105% of the average of the mid-market values of the Ordinary Shares for the five business days before the purchase is made; or(ii) the price stipulated by the regulatory technical standards adopted by the UK pursuant to the Market Abuse Regulation  being the form of the EU Market Abuse Regulation as incorporated into the law of England and Wales.Ordinary Shares will only be repurchased at prices below the prevailing net asset value per ordinary share  which should have the effect of increasing the net asset value per ordinary share for the remaining Shareholders. The minimum price which may be paid shall be their respective nominal values.It is intended that a renewal of the authority to make market purchases will be sought from Shareholders at each AGM of the Company. Purchases of Ordinary Shares will be made within guidelines established from time to time by the Board. Any purchase of Ordinary Shares would be made only out of the available uncommitted cash resources of the Group.Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company may be held in treasury or cancelled.Investors should note that the repurchase of Ordinary Shares is entirely at the discretion of the Board and no expectation or reliance should be placed on such discretion being exercised on any one or more occasions or as to the proportion of Ordinary Shares that may be repurchased.Settlement of ordinary share transactions in the Company are settled by the CREST share settlement system.The results of the voting on all resolutions will be published on the Company‚Äôs website as soon as practicable following the conclusion of the AGM.Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting1.

Appointment of Proxies Through CrestCREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Meeting and any adjournment(s) of it by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available from https://www.euroclear.com/site/public/EUI). CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & International Limited‚Äôs (EUI) specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer‚Äôs agent (ID: RA10) by the voting deadline of 48 hours (excluding non-working days) before the time of the meeting. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer‚Äôs agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST.CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time.In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.9.

The proposition is in accordance with the board of director's recommendation.The board of directors' proposal on a share issue authorization (item 18)The board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize to the board  up and until the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without pre-emptive rights for shareholders  to resolve on the issue of new shares of series B  comprising a total of not more than 20 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the company after the utilization of the authorization. It shall also be possible to make such an issue resolution stipulating in-kind payment  the right to offset debt or other conditions referred to in Chapter 13 Section 5 first paragraph item 6 in the Swedish Companies Act.The purpose of the authorization is to provide flexibility to the board in its work to ensure that the company can appropriately raise capital for the financing of the business. Issuances of new shares under the authorization shall be made on market terms.The board of directors' proposal for resolution on the issue of warrants of series 2022:1 (item 19)The board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants and to approve of transfer of the warrants in accordance with the following.Issue of warrantsThe board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to carry out a directed issue of not more than 850 000 warrants  entailing an increase in the share capital of not more than SEK 425 000 at full subscription. The resolution shall otherwise be governed by the following terms and conditions.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  be vested in the company's wholly owned subsidiary Medivir Personal AB  Reg. no. 556598-2823 (the ""Subsidiary"")  with the right and obligation for the Subsidiary to transfer the warrants to employees pursuant to the below. Over-subscription is not possible.The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights are to stimulate shareholding in the company by virtue of an incentive program through which employees can take part of and contribute to a positive value increase of the company's share during the period of the proposed program  and that the company shall be able to retain and recruit competent and dedicated staff.The warrants shall be issued at no consideration. Subscription must be completed no later than three weeks after the resolution on issue of warrants. The board shall be entitled to extend the subscription period.Each warrant entitles a right to subscribe for one share of series B in the company. The warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new series B shares during the period from and including 1 December 2025 up to and including 15 December 2025. The new shares which may be issued due to subscription are not subject to any restrictive provisions.The subscription price (strike price) shall be established by the company  or by an independent appraiser or auditor firm retained by the company  and correspond to 175 per cent of the volume weighted average price of the series B share according the official share list of Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days immediately preceding the offer to subscribe for warrants  however not less than the quota value of the shares. The amount of the subscription price exceeding the quota value of the shares shall be contributed to the free share premium reserve.Shares which are newly issued following subscription by virtue of the warrants shall carry an entitlement to participate in dividends for the first time on the next record date for dividends which occurs after subscription for shares by virtue of the utilization of the warrants is effected.The company may  by means of a board resolution and with the consent from the board of directors in the Subsidiary  cancel the Subsidiary's warrants that are not transferred in accordance with the below or that have been re-purchased from participants. Cancellation shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  is authorized to make such minor adjustments to the resolution which may prove necessary in order to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Approval of transfer of warrantsThe board proposes that the general meeting approves of the Subsidiary's transfer of warrants on the following conditions.The right to subscribe for share warrants from the Subsidiary shall vest in the following categories of employees:Category Maximum number of warrants per person Maximum number of warrants per category A. Managing director (not more than 1 person) 300 000 300 000 B. Other members of the executive management (not more than 4 persons) 100 000 400 000 C. Other employees (not more than 6 persons) 25 000 150 000The right to purchase warrants from the Subsidiary shall only vest in employees who  at the end of the application period  have not terminated their employment  have not had their employment terminated or otherwise have given notice  or been notified  of employment termination.Warrants may also be offered to future employees. For such acquisitions  the conditions shall be the same or equivalent to what is stated in this resolution. This means  inter alia  that acquisitions shall be made to the market value at the time of the acquisition.Transfer of warrants to participants is conditional upon it being legally possible to purchase the warrants  and that such transfers can be done using reasonable administrative and financial resources according to the assessment of the board.Application and allotmentApplication for acquisition of warrants shall be made during the period from and including 15 May 2022 up until and including 22 May 2022. The board of the company shall however be entitled to extend the application period for acquisitions and to set a corresponding application period for new employees whose acquisitions are made after the expiration of the initial application period.Medivir shall  in connection with the allocation of the warrants to the participants in the program  and with certain exceptions  reserve a repurchase right regarding the warrants if the participant's employment or assignment within the group is terminated or if the participant wishes to transfer his/her warrants prior to the warrants being exercisable.Should warrants of a certain category remain with the Subsidiary after all applications within the category have been satisfied  the remaining warrants shall be available for allotment to participants in that same or another category whereby the board shall determine the distribution based on participant category  employment category and the number of warrants applied for. However  such distribution must not result in the maximum amount of warrants per person in a certain category being exceeded by more than 50 per cent.The board of the company shall determine the final allotment and the date of the transfer of the warrants. The transfer of warrants may be made up until and including 31 December 2021.Price and payment etc.The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price (premium) established on the basis of a market value of the warrants calculated by an independent valuation institute using the Black & Scholes valuation model. A new market value shall be established in an equivalent way for acquisitions made by new employees after the expiration of the initial application period. The value has preliminary been calculated to be SEK 1.34 per warrant based on a share price of SEK 8.Payment for the allocated warrants shall be made in cash no later than five days following the application for acquisition. The board shall establish a corresponding date of payment for acquisitions made by new employees.Medivir will partly subsidize the participant's acquisition of warrants. The subsidy shall be paid in connection with the allocation of warrants to the participants. The total subsidy granted to the participant shall correspond to half of the participant's investment (after deduction of any income tax of the participant). The total cost for the subsidy  based on the above preliminary value of the warrants  is estimated at SEK 1 740 551 for the entire term of the warrant programme of three years  including any social security contributions.In order to be eligible for the subsidy  the participant must  at the time of the payment of the bonus  not have been dismissed (Sw. avskedad)  terminated his/her employment or given notice of employment termination  remain employed in the company for three years  or the subsidy will  with certain exceptions  be prorated  and must not have transferred his/her warrants.Further information on the warrant programDilutionUpon full exercise of all warrants  850 000 new shares can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.5 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the company  however  subject to any potential adjustment which may occur under the terms and conditions for the warrants. Accordingly  the program offers the employees the possibility to increase their shareholding in the company to the corresponding figure.Impact of financial ratio and costs for the company etc.The company's earnings per share are not affected by the issue of the warrants as the present value of the warrants' strike price exceeds the current market value of the share at the date of issue. Since the warrants are transferred to the participants at market value it is not expected that the company will incur any personnel costs. The warrant program will incur costs in relation to the subsidy that the participants are entitled to. Such costs amount to a maximum of SEK 1 740 551 for the entire term of the warrant program of three years. The warrant program may also incur certain limited costs in terms of external consulting fees and costs relating to the administration of the warrant program.Preparation of the matterThe principles of the warrant program have been prepared by the board of the company and are based on the warrant programs adopted by the annual general meetings 2020 and 2021. The board has thereafter decided to submit this proposal to the annual general meeting. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Other share related incentive programs etc.Except from the current proposal to issue warrants and the warrant programs resolved upon at the annual general meetings 2020 and 2021  the company has no outstanding share related incentive programs. It is the board's intention that the program shall recur annually  albeit in varying sizes.Authorization for the board of directorsThe board proposes that the meeting authorizes the board to execute the resolution in accordance with the above and to ensure that the Subsidiary's board of directors carries out the transfer of the warrants in accordance with the above.Majority requirementsA decision according to the proposal pursuant to item 18 above is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the annual general meeting. A decision according to the proposal pursuant to item 19 above is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the annual general meeting.DocumentationThe annual report  the remuneration report and other supporting documentation for resolutions will be available at the company's offices  Medivir AB  Lunastigen 5  SE-141 22 Huddinge  Sweden no later than three weeks prior to the meeting.

Is there a particular regulatory body that reviews or approves such disclosure requirements?Disclosure for a high-yield bond offering tends to be driven by international (in particular US) law and practice. Swiss law does not affect the usual practice for marketing high-yield bonds. The Swiss Financial Services Act is intended to align with the EU prospectus regulation and recognises the ‚Äòwholesale debt exemption‚Äô (for bonds with a denomination of at least 100 000 Swiss francs).In addition  high-yield bonds tend to be listed outside Switzerland  with the effect that no listing prospectus will be required in Switzerland.Use of proceedsAre there any limitations on the use of proceeds from an issuance of high-yield securities by an issuer?The Use of Proceeds section will usually contemplate that the proceeds will be used outside Switzerland except to the extent use in Switzerland is permitted under the Swiss taxation laws without payments in respect of the high-yield bonds becoming subject to withholding or deduction for Swiss withholding tax as a consequence of such use of proceeds in Switzerland.Restrictions on investmentOn what grounds  if any  could an investor be precluded from investing in high-yield securities?Many European-based investors can only invest in listed securities. Accordingly  listing is sought to accommodate these investors even if the offering of high-yield bonds is made on a private placement basis and secondary market is essentially ‚Äòover-the-counter‚Äô.The distribution of high-yield bonds will typically target large institutional investors  as supported by the high minimum denomination and selling restrictions.Certain classes of potential investors  such as Swiss insurance companies and pension funds  may be subject to restrictions in the composition of their assets that can be used to cover their contingent commitments and may drive their investment decision.Closing mechanicsAre there any particular closing mechanics in your jurisdiction that an issuer of high-yield debt securities should be aware of?The closing of a high-yield bond offering by a Swiss group typically occurs in the normal way.Bonds or notes are issued in the form of global certificates deposited with a common depositary on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream.In acquisition finance  the structural security package (eg  pledge over shares and any intercompany loans; pledge over claims under the SPA) is put in place at closing while the ‚Äòhard‚Äô security package (at the target level) will be implemented post-closing (eg  assignment of trade accounts receivable  control agreement over bank accounts  IP and ‚Äì subject to tax considerations ‚Äì real estate).,neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,negative,0.01,0.32,0.67,True,English,"['high-yield debt', 'Snapshot', 'Switzerland', 'The Swiss Financial Services Act', 'high-yield debt securities financings', 'wholesale debt exemption', 'particular regulatory body', 'private placement basis', 'structural security package', 'hard‚Äô security package', 'Swiss taxation laws', 'Swiss insurance companies', 'trade accounts receivable', 'Many European-based investors', 'large institutional investors', 'high minimum denomination', 'high-yield bond offering', 'EU prospectus regulation', 'Swiss withholding tax', 'particular closing mechanics', 'high-yield securities', 'Swiss law', '100,000 Swiss francs', 'Swiss group', 'listed securities', 'bank accounts', 'tax considerations', 'potential investors', 'high-yield bonds', 'US) law', 'listing prospectus', 'secondary market', 'Certain classes', 'pension funds', 'contingent commitments', 'normal way', 'global certificates', 'common depositary', 'acquisition finance', 'intercompany loans', 'target level', 'control agreement', 'real estate', 'Disclosure requirements', 'usual practice', 'investment decision', 'selling restrictions', 'Proceeds section', 'international', 'addition', 'Switzerland', 'effect', 'Use', 'limitations', 'issuance', 'issuer', 'extent', 'payments', 'respect', 'deduction', 'consequence', 'grounds', 'counter', 'distribution', 'composition', 'assets', 'jurisdiction', 'notes', 'form', 'behalf', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'pledge', 'shares', 'claims', 'SPA', 'assignment', 'IP']",2022-04-04,2022-04-04,lexology.com

Is there a particular regulatory body that reviews or approves such disclosure requirements?Most high-yield bond offerings of German issuers are sold on the basis of Rule 144A / Reg S exemptions and based on the minimum denomination exemption (‚Ç¨100 000) of the Prospectus Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017). As a result  there are no directly applying legal disclosure requirements in the offering memorandum.High-yield bonds of German issuers are typically sold to investors in the US in compliance with Rule 144A to increase demand for the notes and optimise the achievable yield. For such bond offerings that involve private placements into the US in accordance with Rule 144A  it is market practice to put together an offering memorandum that in terms of disclosure is broadly in line with a US registered bond transaction. As a result  the standard for disclosure is substantially higher than for an investment-grade Reg S bond offering in which notes are only sold outside of the United States. High disclosure standards are  on the one hand  the result of different liability regimes in the US and  on the other hand  a result of investor demands as such offering memoranda are the market standard for high-yield bond transactions across Europe.The German regulator  BaFin  is not required to approve high-yield bond offering memoranda because  as set out above  such offerings rely on private placement exemptions under the Prospectus Regulation and do not include retail offerings.Typically  high-yield bond offerings of German issuers are listed on an exchange in Europe  most notably the Luxembourg Stock Exchange  the Irish Stock Exchange or ‚Äì which has been the standard more recently ‚Äì The International Stock Exchange (TISE) in the Channel Islands. Each stock exchange reviews the offer document for requirements for listing  but usually has only comments as to the inclusion of all required form elements. The benefit of listing on TISE is that many onerous provisions of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) are not applicable to a listing of a bond outside the European Economic Area (EEA).Use of proceedsAre there any limitations on the use of proceeds from an issuance of high-yield securities by an issuer?German issuers are subject to German and European sanctions laws and anti-money laundering provisions that limit the use of proceeds in certain regions and countries globally. Section 7 of the German Foreign Trade Regulation limits the representations that German issuers and guarantors can provide in relation to sanctions. German issuers may not take part in anti-boycotts that are not authorised by Germany  the EU or the Securities Counsel of the UN and  as a result  representations are typically expressly limited by the German Foreign Trade Regulation.If a high-yield bond is issued by a special purpose vehicle or holding company and the proceeds should be on-lent to operating companies  the terms of such loan will need to be on an arm‚Äôs-length basis to avoid a hidden contribution in kind (verdeckte Einlage). Similarly  if legal or other costs were incurred on the shareholder or holding company level as well as on the operating company level  the benefit of the issuance and incurrence of costs are required to be clearly separated.Restrictions on investmentOn what grounds  if any  could an investor be precluded from investing in high-yield securities?There are no specific German laws or regulations that could prevent an investor to invest in a high-yield bond of a German issuer. High-yield bonds are issued based on various exemptions from the registration requirements and prospectus requirements of relevant capital market rules. For instance  US investors will need to be qualified institutional buyers to place orders in a Rule 144A high-yield bond offering. The sale to German investors is likewise limited to institutional investors rather than retail investors.Closing mechanicsAre there any particular closing mechanics in your jurisdiction that an issuer of high-yield debt securities should be aware of?No  in particular there is no requirement for a bond to be registered or any filings with German authorities as a result of the issuance of the bond. Clearing is completed through Euroclear and Clearstream. In rare cases  the US portion of the notes may be cleared through Depository Trust Company.If the bond is secured by land charges or mortgages  the notarisation actions and public registry of such security interests is only completed after the closing of the bond.,neutral,0.04,0.92,0.04,negative,0.02,0.35,0.63,True,English,"['high-yield debt', 'Snapshot', 'Germany', 'investment-grade Reg S bond offering', 'relevant capital market rules', 'Rule 144A high-yield bond offering', 'The International Stock Exchange', 'high-yield debt securities financings', 'German Foreign Trade Regulation', 'US registered bond transaction', 'Most high-yield bond offerings', 'high-yield bond offering memoranda', 'EU Market Abuse Regulation', 'Reg S exemptions', 'particular regulatory body', 'minimum denomination exemption', 'different liability regimes', 'many onerous provisions', 'anti-money laundering provisions', 'special purpose vehicle', 'Depository Trust Company', 'European Economic Area', 'Luxembourg Stock Exchange', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'high-yield bond transactions', 'specific German laws', 'holding company level', 'operating company level', 'private placement exemptions', 'High disclosure standards', 'European sanctions laws', 'particular closing mechanics', 'legal disclosure requirements', 'offering memorandum', 'high-yield securities', 'market practice', 'High-yield bonds', 'European Parliament', 'various exemptions', 'Securities Counsel', 'Prospectus Regulation', 'private placements', 'operating companies', 'retail offerings', 'market standard', 'German issuers', 'German regulator', 'German authorities', 'German investors', 'achievable yield', 'United States', 'one hand', 'other hand', 'Channel Islands', 'offer document', 'form elements', 'hidden contribution', 'verdeckte Einlage', 'registration requirements', 'prospectus requirements', 'institutional buyers', 'rare cases', 'land charges', 'notarisation actions', 'public registry', 'security interests', 'US portion', 'institutional investors', 'retail investors', 'US investors', 'length basis', 'other costs', 'investor demands', 'Council', '14 June', 'result', 'compliance', 'notes', 'accordance', 'terms', 'line', 'BaFin', 'TISE', 'listing', 'comments', 'inclusion', 'required', 'benefit', 'EEA', 'proceeds', 'limitations', 'issuance', 'regions', 'countries', 'Section', 'representations', 'guarantors', 'relation', 'anti-boycotts', 'Germany', 'loan', 'arm', 'kind', 'shareholder', 'incurrence', 'Restrictions', 'grounds', 'regulations', 'instance', 'qualified', 'orders', 'sale', 'jurisdiction', 'filings', 'Clearing', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'mortgages']",2022-04-04,2022-04-04,lexology.com

Please see section 11 of the Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting.By order of the BoardThrogmorton Secretaries LLPCompany Secretary4 April 2022Registered Office:6th FloorBastion House140 London WallLondon EC2Y 5DNExplanatory Notes on the resolutionsAn explanation of each of the resolutions is set out below.Resolution 1 - To receive and adopt the Annual Report and AccountsThe Directors are required to present the financial statements  Directors' Report and Auditor's Report to the meeting. These are contained in the Company's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the period ended 31 December 2021 (the ""Annual Report""). A resolution to receive and adopt the financial statements  together with the Directors' Report and the Auditor's Report on those accounts  is included as an ordinary resolution.Resolutions 2-5 - Re-election of DirectorsIn accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code  all of the Directors will retire and offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.The Company has three non-executive directors  all of whom are determined by the Board to be independent directors in accordance with the criteria set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board considers that their skills  experience  independence and knowledge of the Company enable them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectivelyEach of the Board members' biographical details are set out on the Company's website at https://www.physitrackgroup.com/governance/board-directors.Resolutions 6 and 7 - Appointment and Remuneration of AuditorAt each meeting at which the Company's financial statements are presented to its members  the Company is required to appoint an auditor to serve until the next such meeting. As part of its review of the continuing appointment of the auditors  the Board considers the length of tenure of the audit firm  its fees and independence along with any matters raised during each audit. Mazars LLP are the appointed auditors of the Company. Following a tender process in 2020 Mazars performed an audit on the 2018  2019 and 2020 figures for the purpose of the IPO prospective. The audit of the period ended 21 December 2021 was the first audit by Mazars since Physitrack PLC became a public company. The Board recommends the re-appointment of Mazars LLP and this will be proposed to the AGM as Resolution 6. Resolution 7 authorises the Directors to determine the remuneration of Mazars LLP as Auditor.Resolution 8 - Authority to allot Ordinary SharesThe Directors may only allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  shares if authorised to do so by shareholders. Resolution 8 will  if passed  authorise the Directors to allot the Company's Ordinary Shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  Ordinary Shares in the Company up to a maximum nominal amount of ¬£3 252.15 representing 3 252 153 Ordinary Shares and is equivalent to approximately 20 per cent. of the Company's existing issued Ordinary Share capital as at 3 April 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of the Notice).Resolution 9 - Authority to dis-apply pre-emption rightsResolution 9 is a special resolution which is being proposed to authorise the Directors to disapply the pre-emption rights of existing Shareholders in relation to issues of Ordinary Shares under Resolution 8 (being in respect of ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal value of ¬£3 252.15  representing up to approximately 20 per cent. of the Company's issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the Notice)  provided that in the case of any Ordinary Shares allotted the issue price is no lower than the nominal value per Ordinary Share.Resolution 10 - Share RepurchasesResolution 10 is also a special resolution. The Companies Act 2006 allows companies to hold shares acquired by way of market purchase as treasury shares  rather than having to cancel them. This would give the Company the ability to re-issue Ordinary Shares quickly and cost effectively thereby improving liquidity and providing the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.No Ordinary Shares will be sold from treasury at a price less than the net asset value per existing ordinary share at the time of their sale unless they are first offered pro rata to existing Shareholders.The Company may seek to address any significant discount to net asset value at which its Ordinary Shares may be trading by purchasing its own Ordinary Shares in the market on an ad hoc basis.The Directors currently have the authority to make market purchases of up to 10 per cent. of the Ordinary Shares in issue and are seeking to renew this authority to issue up to 10% of the Company's issued share capital  which equates to 1 626 077 at the date of this notice. The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for an ordinary share must not be more than the higher of:(i) 105% of the average of the mid-market values of the Ordinary Shares for the five business days before the purchase is made; or(ii) the price stipulated by the regulatory technical standards adopted by the UK pursuant to the Market Abuse Regulation  being the form of the EU Market Abuse Regulation as incorporated into the law of England and Wales.Ordinary Shares will only be repurchased at prices below the prevailing net asset value per ordinary share  which should have the effect of increasing the net asset value per ordinary share for the remaining Shareholders. The minimum price which may be paid shall be their respective nominal values.It is intended that a renewal of the authority to make market purchases will be sought from Shareholders at each AGM of the Company. Purchases of Ordinary Shares will be made within guidelines established from time to time by the Board. Any purchase of Ordinary Shares would be made only out of the available uncommitted cash resources of the Group.Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company may be held in treasury or cancelled.Investors should note that the repurchase of Ordinary Shares is entirely at the discretion of the Board and no expectation or reliance should be placed on such discretion being exercised on any one or more occasions or as to the proportion of Ordinary Shares that may be repurchased.Settlement of ordinary share transactions in the Company are settled by the CREST share settlement system.The results of the voting on all resolutions will be published on the Company's website as soon as practicable following the conclusion of the AGM.Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting1. COVID-19 MeasuresThe COVID-19 situation is constantly evolving  and the UK Government may change the current restrictions or implement further measures during the affected period. Shareholders should monitor the Company's website at www.physitrackgroup.com for any updates regarding the Annual General Meeting.2. Voting record dateOnly members registered in the Register of Members of the Company at close of business BST on 28 April 2022 shall be entitled to vote at the Annual General Meeting in respect of the number of voting rights registered in their name at that time. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after close of business BST on 28 April 2022 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting.If the Annual General Meeting is adjourned for no more than 48 hours after the original time  the same voting record date will also apply for the purpose of determining the entitlement of members to attend  speak and vote (subject to UK Government restrictions) at the adjourned meeting. If the Annual General Meeting is adjourned for more than 48 hours  then the voting record date will be the close of business on the day which is two days (excluding non-working days) before the day of the adjourned meeting or  if the Company gives notice of the adjourned meeting  at any time specified in that notice.In the case of joint holders of a voting right  the vote of the senior holder who tenders a vote  whether in person or by proxy  shall be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint holders and  for this purpose  seniority shall be determined by the order in which the names stand in the Register of Members in respect of the joint holding.3. Rights to attend and voteSubject to UK Government restrictions  members are entitled to attend and vote at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting or at any adjournment(s) thereof. On a poll each member has one vote for every one share held.Swedish shareholders listed the Euroclear sub-register can attend the Annual General Meeting virtually and can exercise their voting rights through advance voting online  April 27th at the latest. Please see sections 11 - 13 of the Notes below for further details. The meeting notice in its entirety is available on the company's website: physitrackgroup.com4. Right to appoint proxiesPursuant to Section 324 of the Companies Act 2006 (the ""Act"")  a member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting may appoint more than one proxy (subject to UK Government restrictions)  provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to different shares held by him. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.The appointment of a proxy will not preclude a shareholder from attending and voting in person at the Annual General Meeting (subject to UK Government restrictions) or at any adjournment thereof.5. Proxies' rights to vote at the Annual General MeetingOn a vote on a show of hands  each proxy has one vote.If a proxy is appointed by more than one member and all such members have instructed the proxy to vote in the same way  the proxy will only be entitled  on a show of hands  to vote ""for"" or ""against"" as applicable. If a proxy is appointed by more than one member  but such members have given different voting instructions  the proxy may  on a show of hands  vote both ""for"" and ""against"" in order to reflect the different voting instructions.On a poll  all or any of the voting rights of the member may be exercised by one or more duly appointed proxies. However  where a member appoints more than one proxy  Section 285(4) of the Act does not authorise the exercise by the proxies taken together of more extensive voting rights than could be exercised by the member in person.6. Appointment  receipt and termination of proxiesTo appoint a proxy  you may:(a) register your appointment on the Signal Shares portal at www.signalshares.com;(b) request a paper form of proxy from the Company's registrar using the details below; or(c) in the case of CREST members  appoint a proxy via CREST (see note 7 below).By registering on the Signal Shares portal at www.signalshares.com  you can manage your shareholding  including: (i) casting your vote; (ii) changing your dividend payment instruction; (iii) updating your address; and (iv) selecting your communication preference.To be effective  the proxy vote must be submitted at www.signalshares.com so as to have been received by the Company's registrars not less than 48 hours (excluding weekends and public holidays) before the time appointed for the meeting or any adjournment of it.Any power of attorney or other authority under which the proxy is submitted must be returned to the Company's Registrars  Link Group PXS1  10th Floor  Central Square  29 Wellington Street  Leeds LS1 4DL.If a paper form of proxy is requested from the Company's registrar  it should be completed and returned to Link Group PXS1  10th Floor  Central Square  29 Wellington Street  Leeds LS1 4DL to be received not less than 48 hours (excluding weekends and public holidays) before the time appointed for the meeting or any adjournment of it.If you need help with voting online  or require a paper form of proxy  please contact the Company's registrar  Link Group  by email at shareholderenquiries@linkgroup.co.uk or by telephone on 0871 664 0391 (if calling from the UK) or on +44 (0) 371 664 0391 (if calling from outside of the UK).

Termination must be provided in writing and submitted to Link Group.7. Changing Proxy InstructionsTo change your proxy instructions simply submit a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Note that the cut-off times for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also apply in relation to amended instructions; any amended proxy appointment received after the relevant cut-off time will be disregarded. Where you have appointed a proxy using the hard-copy proxy form and would like to change the instructions using another hard-copy proxy form  please contact Link Group as per the communication methods shown above. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment  the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.8. Appointment of Proxies Through CrestCREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Meeting and any adjournment(s) of it by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available from https://www.euroclear.com/site/public/EUI). CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & International Limited's (EUI) specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's agent RA by the voting deadline of 48 hours (excluding non-working days) before the time of the meeting. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST.CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time.In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5) (a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.9. Appointment of Proxies Through ProxymityIf you are an institutional investor you may be able to appoint a proxy electronically via the Proxymity platform  a process which has been agreed by the Company and approved by the Registrar. For further information regarding Proxymity  please go to www.proxymity.io. Your proxy must be lodged 28 April 2022 at 11.00 a.m. BST in order to be considered valid or  if the meeting is adjourned  by the time which is 48 hours before the time of the adjourned meeting.

Bolagsverket).Item 12: Resolution on (A) employee option program; and (B) directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrantsThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to adopt an employee option program for the company's CFO Kasper Damgaard Rous√∏e in accordance with Section A below.The purpose of the proposed employee option program (the ""Employee Option Program 2022"") is to secure a long-term commitment for the company's CFO through a compensation system linked to the company's future value growth. Through the implementation of an employee option program  the future value growth in the company is encouraged  which implies common interests and goals for the shareholders of the company and employees. Such incentive program is also expected to increase the company's possibilities of retaining a competent person. The details of the Employee Option Program 2022 are set out under Section A below.In order to secure the company's undertakings under the Employee Option Program 2022  the board of directors also proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants in accordance with Section B below.A. The board of directors' proposal to resolution on Employee Option Program 2022The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to adopt the Employee Option Program 2022 in accordance with the following substantial guidelines:1. The Employee Option Program 2022 shall comprise a maximum of 120 000 employee options.2. Each employee option entitles the holder a right to acquire one new share in the company at an exercise price amounting to SEK 42 . The exercise price and the number of shares that each employee option entitles right to may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue and similar events whereby the recalculation terms in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants shall be applied.3. The Employee Option Program 2022 shall comprise the company's CFO.4. Allotment shall take place at the latest on 31 May 2022 .5. The allotted employee options are vested by 1/3 each on 31 May 2023   on 31 May 2024 and on 31 May 2025 .6. Vesting requires that the participant remains in employment or performs assignments on a consultancy basis for the company or another company in the company's group (the ""Group"") and has not terminated the employment/assignment as of each of the dates when the respective vesting occurs. If the participant ceases to be employed/perform assignments or gives notice of the employment/consultancy agreement in the Group before a vesting date  the already vested employee options may be exercised on the ordinary dates of exercise in accordance with below  but further vesting will not take place. If the participant's employment/consulting assignment is ended due to termination or notice due to personal reasons/breach of contract  then the already vested employee options shall also expire.7. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting the company  the employee options will vest in their entirety and be exercisable in connection with the relevant transaction.8. The employee options shall not constitute as securities and shall not be transferable och pledged. However  the rights according to the employee options does transfer to the estate in the event of the death of the participant.9. The employee options shall be allotted without consideration.10. Issued and vested employee options can only be utilized during the period as from 1 June 2025 up to and including 30 June 2025 .11. Participation in the Employee Option Program 2022 requires that such participation is in accordance with applicable laws  as well as that such participation can take place with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts according to the company's opinion.12. The employee options shall be governed by separate agreements with the participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Employee Option Program 2022 within the above-mentioned substantial terms and guidelines.B. The board of directors' proposal to resolution on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrantsIn order to enable the company's delivery of shares under the Employee Option Program 2022  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants. The board of directors thus proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants in accordance with the following terms and conditions:1. A maximum of 120 000 warrants will be issued.2. The warrants may only  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be subscribed for by the company's wholly owned subsidiary Qlife ApS (the ""Subsidiary""). The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is due to that the warrants are issued as part of the implementation of the Employee Option Program 2022. In light of what has been stated in the background above  the board of directors considers that it is for the benefit of the company and its shareholders that the company's CFO is offered to participate in the Employee Option Program 2022.3. Subscription shall be made no later than as of 31 May 2022 . The board of directors shall be entitled to postpone the last day for subscription.4. Over subscription cannot occur.5. The warrants shall be issued without consideration. The reason hereof is due to that the warrants shall be issued as part of the implementation of the Employee Option Program 2022.6. Each warrant entitles the holder a right to acquire one new share in the company against cash consideration at a subscription price amounting to SEK 42   whereby the subscription price that exceeds the quota value of the share shall be allocated to the free share premium reserve. The subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles right to may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue or similar events.7. The warrants may be exercised during the time period from and including the registration of the warrants at the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) to and including 30 June 2025 .8. The shares issued upon exercise of a warrant confer the right to dividends as from the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately following effectuation of subscription to such extent that the share has been recorded as interim share in the company's share ledger.9. If all warrants are exercised for subscription of new shares  the share capital will increase with SEK 9 600 .Further  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting shall resolve to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer warrants to the participant in the Employee Option Program 2022 without consideration in connection with the exercise of employee options in accordance with the terms and conditions under Section A above or otherwise dispose over the warrants to secure the company's commitments in relation to the Employee Option Program 2022.Other information regarding the Employee Option Program 2022The board of directors estimates that the Employee Option Program 2022 will entail costs in the form of accounting related personnel costs. Applicable accounting regulations stipulate that the options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and accounted for directly against equity. The accounting related personnel costs do not affect the company's cash flow. Since the participant in the Employee Option Program 2022 is employed in Denmark the board of directors assesses that the Employee Option Program 2022 will not trigger any social costs.The employee options do not have a market value since they are not transferable. However  the board of directors has calculated a theoretical value of the employee options using the Black Scholes formula. Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of the options of SEK 21.40 and that 100 per cent of the options are vested  the total accountable cost for the Employee Option Program 2022 is estimated to be approximately SEK 210 000 before tax during the period 2022-2025 calculated in accordance with the Black Scholes formula (assuming a volatility of 40 per cent).It shall be noted that the calculations above are based on preliminary assumptions and are only intended to provide an illustration of the outcome.As per the date of this notice the total amount of shares in the company amount to 15 484 927 shares. Currently  there are incentive programs in the form of two warrant programs and two employee option programs. For further information regarding the existing incentive programs  please see ""Incentive programs"" on page 8 in the year-end report for the period January- December 2021 . Upon full exercise of all warrants issued in relation to existing incentive programs  in the aggregate 711 108 new shares may be issued.In the event all warrants that are issued in relation to the Employee Option Program 2022 are exercised for subscription of shares  a total of 120 000 shares will be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.77 per cent of the company's share capital and votes after full dilution  calculated on the number of shares that will be added upon full exercise of all 120 000 warrants proposed to be issued in relation to the Employee Option Program 2022. The dilution is estimated to only have a marginal impact on relevant key ratios for the full year 2021.In case all warrants outstanding in relation to existing incentive programs as well as the warrants proposed to be issued according to the Employee Option Program 2022 are exercised for subscription of shares  a total of 831 108 new shares will be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 5.09 per cent of the company's share capital and votes after full dilution  calculated on the number of shares that will be added upon full exercise of all outstanding and proposed incentive programs.The above calculations regarding dilution and impact on key ratios are subject to re-calculation of the warrants in accordance with the customary recalculation terms included in the applicable warrant terms.Particular majority requirementsFor valid resolution on the proposal pursuant to item 11  the proposal has to be supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual general meeting. For valid resolution on the proposal pursuant to item 12  the proposal has to be supported by shareholders representing at least nine tenths of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual general meetingDuty of disclosure at the annual general meetingShareholders present at the annual general meeting have the right to request information pursuant to Chapter 7  Section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)).Meeting documentsThe annual report and the audit report as well as the complete proposals for resolutions and other documents for the annual general meeting will be available at the company's office at Redaregatan 48  SE-252 36 Helsingborg  Sweden and at the company website (www.qlifeholding.com) as from no later than three weeks before the annual general meeting  and will also be sent to shareholders who request it and state their address.

The Board Proposed resolutions Resolution regarding allocation of the company's profit or loss in accordance with the adopted Balance Sheet (item 7.b)The following unrestricted equity is at the disposal of the AGM: Share premium (SEK) 1 372 919 498 Total unrestricted equity (SEK) 109 490 323 Profit for the year (SEK) 93 453 282 Total (SEK) 1 575 863 103 The Board proposes that no dividend be paid for the financial year 2021 and that total of SEK 1 575 863 103 be carried forward. The reason for the proposal is that the Board considers that the company's growth should be prioritized over dividend to shareholders. The Board considers that unrestricted equity can be utilized more expediently by being reinvested in the operations  with the objective of creating the right conditions for reaching pre-determined growth targets. Resolution on authorizing the Board to resolve to issue new shares (item 13)The Board proposes that the AGM decide; (i) to authorize the Board to make decisions regarding one or several new issues of class B shares; (ii) that such new issue/issues may be affected with deviation from shareholders pre-emptive rights; (iii) that payment for newly issued shares shall be made in cash  through offset or in the form of non-cash consideration. (iv) that the company may issue a maximum of 24 000 000 (twenty four million) new class B shares under the authorization; and (v) that the authorization shall apply until the AGM 2023. The purpose of the authorization  and the reason for any deviation from shareholders' pre-emptive rights  is to enable timely and cost-efficient new share issues  with the aim of financing the acquisition of properties or businesses by the company  or to carry out other investments. New share issues under this authorization  in deviation from shareholders' pre-emptive rights  shall be based on a market-based subscription price that reflects market conditions at the time of issue. The CEO  or a party appointed by the Board  shall be entitled to make minor adjustments to the decision as required for registration. Resolution on authorizing the Board to repurchase treasury shares (item 14)The Board proposes that the AGM decide: (i) to authorize the Board to decide  on one or several occasions  to acquire class B shares held in treasury; (ii) that acquisitions may only occur on a regulated market place where the company's shares are listed; (iii) that acquisitions may only occur at a price per share within the registered share price interval as applicable from time to time  corresponding to the interval between highest bid price and lowest offer price; (iv) that the authorization permits a maximum repurchase of shares corresponding to one tenth of the total number of shares issued in the company; and (v) that authorization applies up until the AGM 2023. It is also proposed that the Board is authorized  deviating from shareholders' pre-emptive rights  to decide to transfer class B shares held in treasury as settlement in connection with acquisitions of properties or businesses  or in connection with other investments  at a price corresponding to the share price at the time of transfer. The purpose of authorization is to create conditions that allow the Board to reach expedient decisions regarding the effective utilization of the company's capital and liquidity. Authorization permits the Board  if it is considered appropriate  to utilize potential surplus liquidity to effect reversals to shareholders without necessitating a dividend proposal and/or cancellation of shares to be presented to the AGM. Authorization also aims to increase the company's flexibility to carry out acquisitions of properties  businesses  or other investments.

The resolution shall otherwise be governed by the following terms and conditions.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  be vested in the company's wholly owned subsidiary Medivir Personal AB  Reg. no. 556598-2823 (the ""Subsidiary"")  with the right and obligation for the Subsidiary to transfer the warrants to employees pursuant to the below. Over-subscription is not possible.The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights are to stimulate shareholding in the company by virtue of an incentive program through which employees can take part of and contribute to a positive value increase of the company's share during the period of the proposed program  and that the company shall be able to retain and recruit competent and dedicated staff.The warrants shall be issued at no consideration. Subscription must be completed no later than three weeks after the resolution on issue of warrants. The board shall be entitled to extend the subscription period.Each warrant entitles a right to subscribe for one share of series B in the company. The warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new series B shares during the period from and including 1 December 2025 up to and including 15 December 2025. The new shares which may be issued due to subscription are not subject to any restrictive provisions.The subscription price (strike price) shall be established by the company  or by an independent appraiser or auditor firm retained by the company  and correspond to 175 per cent of the volume weighted average price of the series B share according the official share list of Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days immediately preceding the offer to subscribe for warrants  however not less than the quota value of the shares. The amount of the subscription price exceeding the quota value of the shares shall be contributed to the free share premium reserve.Shares which are newly issued following subscription by virtue of the warrants shall carry an entitlement to participate in dividends for the first time on the next record date for dividends which occurs after subscription for shares by virtue of the utilization of the warrants is effected.The company may  by means of a board resolution and with the consent from the board of directors in the Subsidiary  cancel the Subsidiary's warrants that are not transferred in accordance with the below or that have been re-purchased from participants. Cancellation shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  is authorized to make such minor adjustments to the resolution which may prove necessary in order to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Approval of transfer of warrantsThe board proposes that the general meeting approves of the Subsidiary's transfer of warrants on the following conditions.The right to subscribe for share warrants from the Subsidiary shall vest in the following categories of employees:Category Maximum number of warrants per person Maximum number of warrants per category A. Managing director (not more than 1 person) 300 000 300 000 B. Other members of the executive management(not more than 4 persons) 100 000 400 000 C. Other employees (not more than 6 persons) 25 000 150 000The right to purchase warrants from the Subsidiary shall only vest in employees who  at the end of the application period  have not terminated their employment  have not had their employment terminated or otherwise have given notice  or been notified  of employment termination.Warrants may also be offered to future employees. For such acquisitions  the conditions shall be the same or equivalent to what is stated in this resolution. This means  inter alia  that acquisitions shall be made to the market value at the time of the acquisition.Transfer of warrants to participants is conditional upon it being legally possible to purchase the warrants  and that such transfers can be done using reasonable administrative and financial resources according to the assessment of the board.Application and allotmentApplication for acquisition of warrants shall be made during the period from and including 15 May 2022 up until and including 22 May 2022. The board of the company shall however be entitled to extend the application period for acquisitions and to set a corresponding application period for new employees whose acquisitions are made after the expiration of the initial application period.Medivir shall  in connection with the allocation of the warrants to the participants in the program  and with certain exceptions  reserve a repurchase right regarding the warrants if the participant's employment or assignment within the group is terminated or if the participant wishes to transfer his/her warrants prior to the warrants being exercisable.Should warrants of a certain category remain with the Subsidiary after all applications within the category have been satisfied  the remaining warrants shall be available for allotment to participants in that same or another category whereby the board shall determine the distribution based on participant category  employment category and the number of warrants applied for. However  such distribution must not result in the maximum amount of warrants per person in a certain category being exceeded by more than 50 per cent.The board of the company shall determine the final allotment and the date of the transfer of the warrants. The transfer of warrants may be made up until and including 31 December 2021.Price and payment etc.The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price (premium) established on the basis of a market value of the warrants calculated by an independent valuation institute using the Black & Scholes valuation model. A new market value shall be established in an equivalent way for acquisitions made by new employees after the expiration of the initial application period. The value has preliminary been calculated to be SEK 1.34 per warrant based on a share price of SEK 8.Payment for the allocated warrants shall be made in cash no later than five days following the application for acquisition. The board shall establish a corresponding date of payment for acquisitions made by new employees.Medivir will partly subsidize the participant's acquisition of warrants. The subsidy shall be paid in connection with the allocation of warrants to the participants. The total subsidy granted to the participant shall correspond to half of the participant's investment (after deduction of any income tax of the participant). The total cost for the subsidy  based on the above preliminary value of the warrants  is estimated at SEK 1 740 551 for the entire term of the warrant programme of three years  including any social security contributions.In order to be eligible for the subsidy  the participant must  at the time of the payment of the bonus  not have been dismissed (Sw. avskedad )  terminated his/her employment or given notice of employment termination  remain employed in the company for three years  or the subsidy will  with certain exceptions  be prorated  and must not have transferred his/her warrants.Further information on the warrant programDilutionUpon full exercise of all warrants  850 000 new shares can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.5 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the company  however  subject to any potential adjustment which may occur under the terms and conditions for the warrants. Accordingly  the program offers the employees the possibility to increase their shareholding in the company to the corresponding figure.Impact of financial ratio and costs for the company etc.The company's earnings per share are not affected by the issue of the warrants as the present value of the warrants' strike price exceeds the current market value of the share at the date of issue. Since the warrants are transferred to the participants at market value it is not expected that the company will incur any personnel costs. The warrant program will incur costs in relation to the subsidy that the participants are entitled to. Such costs amount to a maximum of SEK 1 740 551 for the entire term of the warrant program of three years. The warrant program may also incur certain limited costs in terms of external consulting fees and costs relating to the administration of the warrant program.Preparation of the matterThe principles of the warrant program have been prepared by the board of the company and are based on the warrant programs adopted by the annual general meetings 2020 and 2021. The board has thereafter decided to submit this proposal to the annual general meeting. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Other share related incentive programs etc.Except from the current proposal to issue warrants and the warrant programs resolved upon at the annual general meetings 2020 and 2021  the company has no outstanding share related incentive programs. It is the board's intention that the program shall recur annually  albeit in varying sizes.Authorization for the board of directorsThe board proposes that the meeting authorizes the board to execute the resolution in accordance with the above and to ensure that the Subsidiary's board of directors carries out the transfer of the warrants in accordance with the above.Majority requirementsA decision according to the proposal pursuant to item 18 above is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the annual general meeting.

Is there a particular regulatory body that reviews or approves such disclosure requirements?Disclosure for a high-yield bond offering tends to be driven by international (in particular US) law and practice. Swiss law does not affect the usual practice for marketing high-yield bonds. The Swiss Financial Services Act is intended to align with the EU prospectus regulation and recognises the ‚Äòwholesale debt exemption‚Äô (for bonds with a denomination of at least 100 000 Swiss francs).In addition  high-yield bonds tend to be listed outside Switzerland  with the effect that no listing prospectus will be required in Switzerland.Use of proceedsAre there any limitations on the use of proceeds from an issuance of high-yield securities by an issuer?The Use of Proceeds section will usually contemplate that the proceeds will be used outside Switzerland except to the extent use in Switzerland is permitted under the Swiss taxation laws without payments in respect of the high-yield bonds becoming subject to withholding or deduction for Swiss withholding tax as a consequence of such use of proceeds in Switzerland.Restrictions on investmentOn what grounds  if any  could an investor be precluded from investing in high-yield securities?Many European-based investors can only invest in listed securities. Accordingly  listing is sought to accommodate these investors even if the offering of high-yield bonds is made on a private placement basis and secondary market is essentially ‚Äòover-the-counter‚Äô.The distribution of high-yield bonds will typically target large institutional investors  as supported by the high minimum denomination and selling restrictions.Certain classes of potential investors  such as Swiss insurance companies and pension funds  may be subject to restrictions in the composition of their assets that can be used to cover their contingent commitments and may drive their investment decision.Closing mechanicsAre there any particular closing mechanics in your jurisdiction that an issuer of high-yield debt securities should be aware of?The closing of a high-yield bond offering by a Swiss group typically occurs in the normal way.Bonds or notes are issued in the form of global certificates deposited with a common depositary on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream.In acquisition finance  the structural security package (eg  pledge over shares and any intercompany loans; pledge over claims under the SPA) is put in place at closing while the ‚Äòhard‚Äô security package (at the target level) will be implemented post-closing (eg  assignment of trade accounts receivable  control agreement over bank accounts  IP and ‚Äì subject to tax considerations ‚Äì real estate).,neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,negative,0.01,0.32,0.67,True,English,"['high-yield debt', 'Snapshot', 'Switzerland', 'The Swiss Financial Services Act', 'high-yield debt securities financings', 'wholesale debt exemption', 'particular regulatory body', 'private placement basis', 'structural security package', 'hard‚Äô security package', 'Swiss taxation laws', 'Swiss insurance companies', 'trade accounts receivable', 'Many European-based investors', 'large institutional investors', 'high minimum denomination', 'high-yield bond offering', 'EU prospectus regulation', 'Swiss withholding tax', 'particular closing mechanics', 'high-yield securities', 'Swiss law', '100,000 Swiss francs', 'Swiss group', 'listed securities', 'bank accounts', 'tax considerations', 'potential investors', 'high-yield bonds', 'US) law', 'listing prospectus', 'secondary market', 'Certain classes', 'pension funds', 'contingent commitments', 'normal way', 'global certificates', 'common depositary', 'acquisition finance', 'intercompany loans', 'target level', 'control agreement', 'real estate', 'Disclosure requirements', 'usual practice', 'investment decision', 'selling restrictions', 'Proceeds section', 'international', 'addition', 'Switzerland', 'effect', 'Use', 'limitations', 'issuance', 'issuer', 'extent', 'payments', 'respect', 'deduction', 'consequence', 'grounds', 'counter', 'distribution', 'composition', 'assets', 'jurisdiction', 'notes', 'form', 'behalf', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'pledge', 'shares', 'claims', 'SPA', 'assignment', 'IP']",2022-04-04,2022-04-04,lexology.com

Is there a particular regulatory body that reviews or approves such disclosure requirements?Most high-yield bond offerings of German issuers are sold on the basis of Rule 144A / Reg S exemptions and based on the minimum denomination exemption (‚Ç¨100 000) of the Prospectus Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017). As a result  there are no directly applying legal disclosure requirements in the offering memorandum.High-yield bonds of German issuers are typically sold to investors in the US in compliance with Rule 144A to increase demand for the notes and optimise the achievable yield. For such bond offerings that involve private placements into the US in accordance with Rule 144A  it is market practice to put together an offering memorandum that in terms of disclosure is broadly in line with a US registered bond transaction. As a result  the standard for disclosure is substantially higher than for an investment-grade Reg S bond offering in which notes are only sold outside of the United States. High disclosure standards are  on the one hand  the result of different liability regimes in the US and  on the other hand  a result of investor demands as such offering memoranda are the market standard for high-yield bond transactions across Europe.The German regulator  BaFin  is not required to approve high-yield bond offering memoranda because  as set out above  such offerings rely on private placement exemptions under the Prospectus Regulation and do not include retail offerings.Typically  high-yield bond offerings of German issuers are listed on an exchange in Europe  most notably the Luxembourg Stock Exchange  the Irish Stock Exchange or ‚Äì which has been the standard more recently ‚Äì The International Stock Exchange (TISE) in the Channel Islands. Each stock exchange reviews the offer document for requirements for listing  but usually has only comments as to the inclusion of all required form elements. The benefit of listing on TISE is that many onerous provisions of the EU Market Abuse Regulation (MAR) are not applicable to a listing of a bond outside the European Economic Area (EEA).Use of proceedsAre there any limitations on the use of proceeds from an issuance of high-yield securities by an issuer?German issuers are subject to German and European sanctions laws and anti-money laundering provisions that limit the use of proceeds in certain regions and countries globally. Section 7 of the German Foreign Trade Regulation limits the representations that German issuers and guarantors can provide in relation to sanctions. German issuers may not take part in anti-boycotts that are not authorised by Germany  the EU or the Securities Counsel of the UN and  as a result  representations are typically expressly limited by the German Foreign Trade Regulation.If a high-yield bond is issued by a special purpose vehicle or holding company and the proceeds should be on-lent to operating companies  the terms of such loan will need to be on an arm‚Äôs-length basis to avoid a hidden contribution in kind (verdeckte Einlage). Similarly  if legal or other costs were incurred on the shareholder or holding company level as well as on the operating company level  the benefit of the issuance and incurrence of costs are required to be clearly separated.Restrictions on investmentOn what grounds  if any  could an investor be precluded from investing in high-yield securities?There are no specific German laws or regulations that could prevent an investor to invest in a high-yield bond of a German issuer. High-yield bonds are issued based on various exemptions from the registration requirements and prospectus requirements of relevant capital market rules. For instance  US investors will need to be qualified institutional buyers to place orders in a Rule 144A high-yield bond offering. The sale to German investors is likewise limited to institutional investors rather than retail investors.Closing mechanicsAre there any particular closing mechanics in your jurisdiction that an issuer of high-yield debt securities should be aware of?No  in particular there is no requirement for a bond to be registered or any filings with German authorities as a result of the issuance of the bond. Clearing is completed through Euroclear and Clearstream. In rare cases  the US portion of the notes may be cleared through Depository Trust Company.If the bond is secured by land charges or mortgages  the notarisation actions and public registry of such security interests is only completed after the closing of the bond.,neutral,0.04,0.92,0.04,negative,0.02,0.35,0.63,True,English,"['high-yield debt', 'Snapshot', 'Germany', 'investment-grade Reg S bond offering', 'relevant capital market rules', 'Rule 144A high-yield bond offering', 'The International Stock Exchange', 'high-yield debt securities financings', 'German Foreign Trade Regulation', 'US registered bond transaction', 'Most high-yield bond offerings', 'high-yield bond offering memoranda', 'EU Market Abuse Regulation', 'Reg S exemptions', 'particular regulatory body', 'minimum denomination exemption', 'different liability regimes', 'many onerous provisions', 'anti-money laundering provisions', 'special purpose vehicle', 'Depository Trust Company', 'European Economic Area', 'Luxembourg Stock Exchange', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'high-yield bond transactions', 'specific German laws', 'holding company level', 'operating company level', 'private placement exemptions', 'High disclosure standards', 'European sanctions laws', 'particular closing mechanics', 'legal disclosure requirements', 'offering memorandum', 'high-yield securities', 'market practice', 'High-yield bonds', 'European Parliament', 'various exemptions', 'Securities Counsel', 'Prospectus Regulation', 'private placements', 'operating companies', 'retail offerings', 'market standard', 'German issuers', 'German regulator', 'German authorities', 'German investors', 'achievable yield', 'United States', 'one hand', 'other hand', 'Channel Islands', 'offer document', 'form elements', 'hidden contribution', 'verdeckte Einlage', 'registration requirements', 'prospectus requirements', 'institutional buyers', 'rare cases', 'land charges', 'notarisation actions', 'public registry', 'security interests', 'US portion', 'institutional investors', 'retail investors', 'US investors', 'length basis', 'other costs', 'investor demands', 'Council', '14 June', 'result', 'compliance', 'notes', 'accordance', 'terms', 'line', 'BaFin', 'TISE', 'listing', 'comments', 'inclusion', 'required', 'benefit', 'EEA', 'proceeds', 'limitations', 'issuance', 'regions', 'countries', 'Section', 'representations', 'guarantors', 'relation', 'anti-boycotts', 'Germany', 'loan', 'arm', 'kind', 'shareholder', 'incurrence', 'Restrictions', 'grounds', 'regulations', 'instance', 'qualified', 'orders', 'sale', 'jurisdiction', 'filings', 'Clearing', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'mortgages']",2022-04-04,2022-04-04,lexology.com

That still leaves about $552 million owed on the 2022 bond. Russia said it plans to buy back the maturing bond in full.Bondholders who chose not to take the ruble-buyback offer will be paid in US dollars on Monday  sources told Reuters.Meanwhile  Russia is coming up against another April 4 deadline for a coupon payment of $84 million on a separate 2042 bond.Last week  Russia narrowly avoided a default after JPMorgan processed a $447 million dollar-denominated bond payment  despite Clearstream blocking Russia from a key clearinghouse for foreign debt payments the week prior.Western sanctions slapped on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine have meant money is only slowly trickling through the system  as banks seek approval from the US Treasury to process funds.Russia has so far kept up payments on its foreign currency denominated bonds  despite major ratings agencies saying in early March that a debt default washighly likely.,negative,0.02,0.18,0.8,negative,0.01,0.19,0.8,True,English,"['bond payments', 'default fears', 'Russia', 'deadline', 'foreign currency denominated bonds', '$447 million dollar-denominated bond payment', 'major ratings agencies', 'foreign debt payments', 'outstanding bond payments', 'debt default fears', 'coupon payment', 'maturing bond', 'separate 2042 bond', 'Russian government', 'Finance Ministry', 'ruble-buyback offer', 'US dollars', 'April 4 deadline', 'key clearinghouse', 'Western sanctions', 'US Treasury', 'early March', 'Monday deadline', '2022 bond', 'Kremlin', 'rubles', 'Bondholders', 'sources', 'Reuters', 'JPMorgan', 'Clearstream', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'money', 'system', 'banks', 'approval', 'funds']",2022-04-04,2022-04-04,africa.businessinsider.com

These bonds can be nominated and purchased either in UAH or USD.To promote the bonds  the National Bank of Ukraine has introduced a simplified identification and verification mechanism exclusively for foreign individual buyers of war bonds and for Ukrainian nationals who permanently or temporarily reside abroad. This new mechanism enables remote identification and verification. The client would only have to send the documents to the broker/bank through protected communication channels and pass verification by videoconference. Simplified procedure is available for transactions for the total amount of up to UAH 400 000 (approximately EUR 12 273.70) per month.The most recent auction held on 29 March 2022 showed that the interest in Ukrainian military bonds is on the rise. During this auction  the Ministry of Finance issued and placed bonds for total amount of UAH 3.3 billion. The interest rate for the military bonds in UAH with a 15-month redemption period was set at 11%  and with the 6-month redemption period at 10%.Source: –ú—ñ–Ω—Ñ—ñ–Ω –æ–≥–æ–ª–æ—Å–∏–≤ —á–µ—Ä–≥–æ–≤–∏–π –∞—É–∫—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω –∑ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–∂—É –≤—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ–≤–∏—Ö –æ–±–ª—ñ–≥–∞—Ü—ñ–π –Ω–∞ 29 –±–µ—Ä–µ–∑–Ω—è (espreso.tv)Previously  the Ministry of Finance already issued the following war bonds  which also should be available on the secondary market:Military bonds are traded through primary dealers that participate in auctions held by the Ministry of Finance in the interests of their clients. Among the primary dealers are two international and two local banks. In particular  the local banks include –ûschadbank and PrivatBank. International banks acting as primary dealers are Citibank and Raiffeisen Bank. More detailed information on the list of the primary dealers can be found at this link: https://mof.gov.ua/en/perelik-pervinnih-dileriv.For direct purchases  a foreign investor has to follow these steps:choose and conclude an agreement with a Ukrainian broker with primary dealer status (the Broker);open a securities account in one of the Ukrainian depository institutions;place an order with the Broker.If they do not have direct access to Ukrainian depositary system or brokers  foreign investors can also consider using their foreign custodians as intermediaries in the process. Several foreign custodians have access to the Ukrainian depositary system through nominee accounts foreign custodians hold with Ukrainian custodians. These foreign custodians are able to purchase and hold Ukrainian securities on behalf of their clients without the need for their clients to open Ukrainian accounts.

Together  the partners are developing a mobile and emission-free hydrogen generator. The companies will present the prototype of the H 2 Genset within the first half of 2022.In the development partnership  the three companies combine their respective expertise. While SFC Energy contributes its expertise as one of the world's leading manufacturers of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells  Test-Fuchs has years of know-how in hydrogen refuelling and valve technology from the aerospace industry. The Auto AG Group is an innovative full-service provider in the commercial vehicle sector with extensive experience in the maintenance of fuel cell vehicles.With the H 2 Genset  the partners primarily want to address users who were dependent on diesel generators for their previous energy supply and who attach importance to a robust device design. These are often areas without access to the conventional power grid  such as outdoor festivals or large construction sites. The H2Genset - consisting of a hydrogen tank and an EFOY Hydrogen fuel cell - can be brought to any location as a mobile trailer solution in a flexible and time-saving way and is thus also a reliable energy source for blue light and defense organisations.With a targeted power range of 5 to 100 kilowatts (kW)  users can configure the H2Genset to fit their exact requirements. The user-friendly hydrogen fuel cell technology reduces maintenance and fuel consumption to a minimum. At the same time  compared to conventional diesel generators  the H 2 Genset emits no environmentally harmful exhaust gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx)  carbon monoxide (CO) or fine dust.Dr. Peter Podesser  CEO of SFC Energy AG: ""The H 2 Genset is the logical and consistent continuation of our approach to replace diesel generators by emission-free hydrogen technology. It is great that we have found partners in Test-Fuchs and Auto AG who share our vision of a climate-neutral energy supply. The development partnership shows in the best way what can be created when you think innovation across industry and technology boundaries.""Volker Fuchs  CEO of Test-Fuchs GmbH: ""Aerospace is our passion  innovation is our mission. In this respect  we are delighted to be working with SFC Energy and Auto AG Group to make the H2Genset project a success. We firmly believe that hydrogen is the future and together with our partners we will seize the great market opportunities in the generator sector.""Marc Ziegler  CEO of Auto AG Group: ""In the development of the H2Genset  three companies are pooling their competencies  which have been firmly positioned in the market for years and have proven technologies. We see hydrogen not only as the drive concept of the future  but also as an elementary component of a climate-neutral energy supply. Therefore  it is only logical for us to make an important contribution here.""Further information on the H2Genset is available at h2-genset.com.About Auto AG GroupAt Auto AG Group  everything has revolved around the transportation of people and goods in private and public transport since 1918.

He lives in Nairobi with his‚Ä¶ read moreThe DAX index made a spectacular recovery in the first quarter in sync with other top indices. It rose by more than 16% from its lowest level this year even as risks to the German economy remained. The index is trading at ‚Ç¨14 445  where it has been in the past few days. It remains about 11.43% below its highest level this year. Here are the best performing DAX stocks year-to-date.BayerBayer (ETR: BAYN) is a leading German company that focuses on pharmaceuticals and life sciences. It is one of the biggest firms in Germany with a market value of over $61.5 billion. The Bayer share price has done well this year  becoming the best performing stock in the DAX index. It has risen by more than 34% as demand for its products has risen.Are you looking for fast-news  hot-tips and market analysis? Sign-up for the Invezz newsletter  today.Bayer is also in the spotlight because of its new thrombosis prevention drug  which showed positive results during testing. According to Bloomberg  the drug showed about 67% reduction in ISTH major. Therefore  there is a likelihood that the company will turn the drug to become an alternative to the existing ones.Bayer stock price has risen because it is a defensive name that is not affected mostly by the ongoing geopolitical tensions.MTU AeroThe MTU Aero (ETR: MTX) share price has risen by over 15%  becoming the second-best performing stock in the DAX index. The company‚Äôs stock has risen because of the ongoing recovery of the civil aviation industry as the world economy reopens.Most importantly  it has risen because of the decision by the German government to boost its defense spending due to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine. As one of the biggest players in the defence industry  analysts expect that it will be one of those to benefit.Deutsche BankDeutsche Bank (ETR: DBK) is also one of the best-performing stocks in the DAX index. The stock has risen by more than 7.3% as investors cheer the ongoing hawkish tone by central banks. In the United States  the Fed has already hiked rates by 0.25% and there are signs that it will deliver 6 more hikes this year. In the European Union  analysts expect that the ECB will increase rates later this year.Still  Deutsche Bank faces an uphill battle  especially in its investment banking division. Data published last week showed that global deal-making declined sharply in the first quarter. The firm also has some exposure to the Russian market.Other top performers in the DAX index are Deutsche Boerse  RWE  Porsche  and Allianz.Where to buy right nowTo invest simply and easily  users need a low-fee broker with a track record of reliability.

They are a potentially attractive drug delivery system due to their intrinsic properties: small size  wide range of potential routes of administration  natural targeting to immune cells  lack of nucleic acids  and readily available sourcing of RBC for their production. Vesiculation of RBCs that have already been loaded with active therapeutic compounds utilizing the ERYCAPS¬Æ process  entails the potential of producing cargo-loaded RBC-derived extracellular vesicles for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.Fran√ßoise Horand  Director of R&D Operations at ERYTECH  commented: ‚ÄúWe are delighted to present the work of our team and collaborators at the upcoming ERCS meeting  in particular the opportunity to introduce the ERYCEVTM technology  which leverages our proprietary ERYCAPS¬Æ technology in a novel fashion  and allows to produce red blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles  loaded with active ingredients. We are encouraged by the initial results characterizing the in vitro biological activity of these pre-loaded RBCEVs  suggesting potential future application in immune modulation.‚ÄùStory continuesGil Beyen  CEO of ERYTECH  added: ‚ÄúThe results that will be presented at the upcoming ERCS conference underscore the versatility and broad potential of our ERYCAPS¬Æ platform. We look forward to discussing further potential development opportunities with the red blood cell community and will look to provide updates on ERYCEV TM as the program advances going forward.‚ÄùERYTECH and its researchers will also participate in the Poster session on April 8 to present the Capabilities of the RBC therapeutics platform ERYCAPS¬Æ  and in the ‚ÄúRBC Diseases‚Äù session on April 10 to present the work conducted with the LIBM academic laboratory (Laboratoire Interuniversitaire de Biologie de la Motricit√© de Lyon).About ERYTECH and eryaspase (GRASPA¬Æ)ERYTECH is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative red blood cell-based therapeutics for severe forms of cancer and orphan diseases. Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS¬Æ platform  which uses a novel technology to encapsulate drug substances inside red blood cells  ERYTECH is developing a pipeline of product candidates for patients with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH‚Äôs primary focus is on the development of product candidates that target the altered metabolism of cancer cells by depriving them of amino acids necessary for their growth and survival.The Company‚Äôs lead product candidate  eryaspase  which consists of L-asparaginase encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells  targets the cancer cells‚Äô altered asparagine and glutamine metabolism. The proof of concept of eryaspase as a cancer metabolism agent was established in different trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and pancreatic cancer. An investigator sponsored Phase 2 trial (IST) evaluating the use of eryaspase in ALL patients who developed hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase recently reported positive results  based on which the Company intends to request approval in the United States and potentially other territories. The Company is also pursuing a Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial in first-line pancreatic cancer.Eryaspase received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who have developed hypersensitivity reactions to E. coli-derived pegylated asparaginase. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency have granted eryaspase orphan drug status for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and ALL.ERYTECH produces its product candidates for treatment of patients in Europe at its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France  and for patients in the United States at its GMP manufacturing site in Princeton  New Jersey  USA. Eryaspase is not an approved medicine.ERYTECH is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States (ticker: ERYP) and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0011471135  ticker: ERYP).

2229,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://japantoday.com/category/business/focus-tokyo-stock-market-needs-more-than-shake-up-to-lure-foreign-investors,Tokyo stock market revamped in hope of attracting foreign investors,The Tokyo stock market trumpets its largest overhaul in decades to lure more foreign investors. Still  the bourse is missing something such investors have long awaited -- companies with great growth potential. The bourse operator  Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc  on‚Ä¶,"By Ayano ShimizuThe Tokyo stock market trumpets its largest overhaul in decades to lure more foreign investors. Still  the bourse is missing something such investors have long awaited -- companies with great growth potential.The bourse operator  Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc  on Monday reorganized its four trading sections into three -- Prime  Standard and Growth -- for the roughly 3 800 listed companies to be categorized under more distinctive rules to sharpen the focus of each market.The reform came as Japan tries to cement a foothold for the Tokyo market as an international financial hub after its reputation was tarnished by a trading system failure in 2020 that caused an unprecedented full-day trade halt. The setback came in stark contrast to the rise in its U.S. and some Asian peers.Investors and market observers say they find the shake-up less than attractive  saying they are looking more for companies that create innovations to stand out among global competitors than for improving market availability.""There is definitely sentiment among investors that there are markets in other Asian countries with many attractive companies "" Hidetaka Kawakita  an honorary professor at Kyoto University who specializes in stock market analysis  said. ""Compared to them  Japanese companies seem to boast little growth and little increase in stock value.""The reorganization is designed to specify the concepts of each of the three new sections to make it more convenient for investors to pick which stocks to buy. The operator also aims to encourage listed companies to pursue growth more persistently and strengthen governance to raise their corporate value  by imposing higher requirements for market capitalization and outside directors.The TSE last carried out a large-scale restructuring of its trading sections in 1961 when it introduced the First Section and Second Section.The top-tier Prime section  equivalent to the former First Section  is made up of 1 839 companies  or over 80 percent of the total listed on the previous leading section  and centers on inviting global investors.A company in the new top division must have floating shares worth at least 10 billion yen ($81.6 million) that account for 35 percent or more of its outstanding shares.About 300 companies have yet to meet the listing criteria for the Prime section  stricter than for the Standard section for midsize firms and Growth section for up-and-comers. But their shares can be traded in the section  pending improvement in operations based on business plans they submitted to the bourse prior to the market section revamp.""It's more cosmetic than anything else "" said Masakazu Takeda  a portfolio manager of Hennessy Japan Fund  which manages a total asset of about $801 million as of December and is run by California-based Hennessy Funds.""What's the point if you have 2 000 plus companies on the First Section of the TSE and a few years down the road you still have roughly the same number of listed names?"" he said. ""It's not going to help foreign investors sift through the universe.""Foreign investors are of great importance to the TSE  making up about 70 percent of the trading value on the former First Section.According to data by the World Federation of Exchanges  the Tokyo Stock Exchange had a market capitalization of domestic shares worth $6.17 trillion as of February. The value came fifth among global stock exchanges but makes up only a quarter of the New York Stock Exchange  the world's largest bourse home to names like Visa Inc  Johnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola Co.The Tokyo bourse was also behind the U.S. Nasdaq stock market  home to the tech giants known as GAFA including Google LLC and Apple Inc  the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Euronext  a pan-European bourse.The reorganization ""is not a solution for this  and not hitting a right point at all. A sense of urgency to change is what is missing in Japan "" Masakazu Hosomizu  partner and portfolio manager at U.S. firm RMB Capital  said.He said that foreign investors pour their capital in high-quality Japanese companies that meet their own criteria in areas such as corporate governance and capital efficiency.Toyota Motor Corp  the world's largest automaker by volume  had its market capitalization briefly top 40 trillion yen or about $330 billion for the first time in January  ahead of other global names in Japan like Sony Group Corp and SoftBank Group Corp.But it was still far behind Apple that became the world's first company to top $3 trillion in January or U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc. with over $1 trillion in market capitalization.Kyoto University's Kawakita sees the reorganization as a ""fine-tuning"" rather than a reform but a ""first step"" in creating change in the Japanese market.He said he hopes the bourse will go on to implement tougher standards for listed companies in the future  such as requiring a market capitalization of 100 billion yen to have major Japanese companies understand that they cannot stay on the top tier without growth.Hosomizu at RMB Capital said that the TSE should impose tighter listing rules to prompt companies to bolster corporate governance and the monitoring of their management. The TSE could demand hiring more outside directors than the current one-third of the board members required of companies on the Prime section.Akira Kiyota  the chief executive of Japan Exchange Group Inc.  the parent of the TSE  expects the shake-up and stricter requirements to incentivize listed companies to improve their corporate value.""I have high expectations that this reform will be a motivator for companies to work on their corporate value "" he said at a regular press conference last week.

April 4  2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) 300 mg weekly to treat adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  a chronic and progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and impairs the ability to swallow. The target action date for the FDA decision on this investigational use is August 3  2022.The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent 300 mg weekly in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE (Part A and Part B)  and data from an active long-term extension trial. Dupixent 300 mg weekly significantly improved the signs and symptoms of EoE at 24 weeks compared to placebo  including the ability to swallow and reduction in eosinophil count in the esophagus. The safety results of these trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common adverse event observed with Dupixent  in Part A and Part B  was injection site reactions.In September 2020  the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. Dupixent was also granted Orphan Drug designation for the potential treatment of EoE in 2017. Priority review is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Regulatory filings around the world are also planned in 2022. The potential use of Dupixent in EoE is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.Story continuesAbout Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)EoE is a chronic  progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. For people with EoE  swallowing the smallest amount of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. Those with EoE live with anxiety and frustration from having a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid. This disease can also cause narrowing of the esophagus and dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed  which is often painful. In severe cases  a feeding tube is the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. People with EoE may have poor quality of life and are more likely to experience depression than people without EoE. There are approximately 160 000 patients in the U.S. living with EoE who are currently treated  of whom approximately 48 000 have failed multiple treatments.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).In the U.S.  Dupixent is approved in patients aged 6 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis; as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma; and for use with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled.Dupixent is also approved in Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world  and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes  including eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

2233,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fda-accepts-dupixent-dupilumab-priority-045900585.html,FDA Accepts Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) for Priority Review in Patients Aged 12 Years and Older with Eosinophilic Esophagitis,Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the...,"If approved  Dupixent would be the first medicine available in the U.S. indicated to treat eosinophilic esophagitisThere are approximately 160 000 patients in the U.S. living with eosinophilic esophagitis who are currently treated  of whom approximately 48 000 have failed multiple treatmentsTARRYTOWN  N.Y. and PARIS  April 4  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) 300 mg weekly to treat adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  a chronic and progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and impairs the ability to swallow. The target action date for the FDA decision on this investigational use is August 3  2022.The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent 300 mg weekly in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE (Part A and Part B)  and data from an active long-term extension trial. Dupixent 300 mg weekly significantly improved the signs and symptoms of EoE at 24 weeks compared to placebo  including the ability to swallow and reduction in eosinophil count in the esophagus. The safety results of these trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common adverse event observed with Dupixent  in Part A and Part B  was injection site reactions.In September 2020  the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. Dupixent was also granted Orphan Drug designation for the potential treatment of EoE in 2017. Priority review is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Regulatory filings around the world are also planned in 2022. The potential use of Dupixent in EoE is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.Story continuesAbout Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)EoE is a chronic  progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. For people with EoE  swallowing the smallest amount of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. Those with EoE live with anxiety and frustration from having a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid. This disease can also cause narrowing of the esophagus and dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed  which is often painful. In severe cases  a feeding tube is the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. People with EoE may have poor quality of life and are more likely to experience depression than people without EoE. There are approximately 160 000 patients in the U.S. living with EoE who are currently treated  of whom approximately 48 000 have failed multiple treatments.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. By demonstrating significant clinical benefit together with a decrease in type 2 inflammation following IL-4 and IL-13 blockade with Dupixent  the Dupixent Phase 3 clinical program has established that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases for which Dupixent is approved including atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  as well as investigational diseases such as EoE and prurigo nodularis  which have been studied in Phase 3 trials.In the U.S.  Dupixent is approved in patients aged 6 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis; as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma; and for use with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled.Dupixent is also approved in Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world  and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes  including eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

Companies can choose to delist by choice  whether to reduce costs  particularly for smaller companies  or cut the time taken to make decisions.If a company is delisted they no longer have to wait for shareholders and the board of directors to vote on proposals.More often than not take-private deals occur when a company is taken over or merged with another company.There has been a flurry of take-private deals over the past year including Clayton  Dubilier and Rice's takeover of Morrisons  and the AA  bought by Warburg Pincus and TowerBrook Capital Partners.Exchanges can also force companies to delist if they don't meet the regulatory requirements.The London Stock Exchange  for example  requires all listed companies to hold a minimum market cap of ¬£700 000.Other requirements include having a stock price above a certain value and filing annual reports on time.What happens if a company is taken private?The total value of companies bought out by private equity firms and delisted has rocketed to ¬£29.3billion over the last 12 months  according to research by accountancy firm BDO.When a company is approached by a private equity firm the board has to decide whether it wants to recommend the deal to shareholders. If it does the majority of voting shareholders then have to agree to the offer at the proposed price.It usually happens at a premium to the company's existing share price because PE firms tend to go after firms that look undervalued or are trading at a discount.'PE firms want to buy companies that they think can be run better than they're being run now. Or at the very least  where they can strip the company of its assets and sell these for a profit.'After all  that's how they get a return on their investment; unlocking or creating seemingly ignored value ' said Freetrade analyst Gemma Boothroyd.'Existing shareholders can often walk away with a gain on their holdings. But that doesn't mean the premium will be higher than where that share price has stood in previous months or years  assuming that the share price has declined in recent years which has led to the take-private approach in the first place.'So it's no guarantee that all shareholders will benefit from a PE takeover.'Everyday investors who oppose the proposal can make their position known by voting against it but it is unlikely to make much of a difference if institutional investors are largely in favour.After a four month battle  private equity firm Clayton  Dubilier & Rice bought Morrisons for ¬£10bn in a take-private dealGenerally  the acquirer will put forward a cash offer or a tender offer which are often financed using a mixture of cash and shares. Once the company has gone private it will be delisted from the stock exchange.Boothroyd notes that investors can still gain exposure to a company if it's taken private if the PE firm is publicly listed  like KKR.It would not be a direct investment however but it could allow for some continued investment in the once-listed company.Investment platform AJ Bell confirmed it will send a message to shareholders if a company is delisted.'This message will have a brief summary of what has happened and a link to the full statement from the company so customers are up to date with any proceedings. When we receive more information from the delisted firm  we pass this straight onto the customer  including any voting options that might be available.'The shares will remain in the customer's portfolio online with a nil value until the delisted company comes to a final decision.'What happens to shares if a company is merged with another public company?A company could also be taken over or merged with a company that is already publicly listed.In this scenario the holding will be swapped for either a new holding in the buyer or an amount of cash.In 2017 Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management merged to form Standard Life Aberdeen in an ¬£11billion deal.Standard Life shareholders held 66.7 per cent of the new company and the remaining amount went to Aberdeen shareholders.What happens if the company is still listed on another exchange?Often a company will be listed on different exchanges but if a company delists from one exchange then investors won't necessarily lose access to the shares.A cross-listing allows companies to list shares on several exchanges. A company just has to meet the listing requirements of a local exchange and demonstrate it will treat its shareholders equally.A dual listing also allows companies to list on different exchanges and usually happens when two listed firms merge.WHAT HAPPENS TO SHARES IN PASSIVE FUNDS? You may not invest in individual stocks and instead invest through a passive tracker. If a company that is delisted is held in a fund it will be removed from the fund. If it is tracking an exchange like the S&P 500 the fund is realigned and will be replaced with an existing company. Susannah Streeter  senior investments and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: 'When a share held in a passive fund is delisted  its value is typically reduced to zero before being removed from the fund. This is likely to have a negative impact on the tracking error versus the benchmark.'For example  when US cruise operator Carnival bought P&O Princess in 2002 it kept its listings in both London and the NYSE. While they act as one company they're set up as two separate legal entities which means the shares are not interchangeable.However with a cross-listing if you buy shares in a company on the LSE they'll be the same as those listed on the NYSE.'Talks of the US delisting foreign companies that fail to comply with their auditing standards could mean these companies are taken off the US exchanges ' said Boothroyd.'But if investors still wanted access to the companies  they could theoretically invest wherever they're cross-listed.'AJ Bell said if a stock's main listing moves from London to another HMRC recognised stock exchange - which includes Stockholm  Tel Aviv and Euronext - it will keep customers informed and update their portfolios accordingly.Interactive Investor said if a UK company is taken over by a foreign company listed on another exchange it will do its best to ensure the customer can sell the shares at some stage.'We feel this is an advantage of a platform like ii that chooses to access these exchanges rather than rely on CREST settled securities. Be aware however that it can take some time and there is also a possibility that in some cases it may not be possible to trade the shares depending where they are listed.'What happens if the company goes bankrupt?Things get a little more complicated if a company is delisted because it has gone bankrupt.It is very rare for a large public company to delist because of bankruptcy but it has happened and it can be confusing.Susannah Streeter  Hargreaves Lansdown's senior investment and markets analyst said: 'If a company is delisted because it's gone bankrupt  gone into liquidation or into administration  it doesn't always mean the end of the road for shareholders  as in some cases  a company can emerge from this situation and resume trading.'However  for the most part  the shares will be cancelled  meaning shareholders get no return on their investment.'Usually  an insolvent business will go into administration and a consulting or accounting firm is appointed to manage the company and settle its remaining debts.The administrators distribute the remaining assets to pay off the debts but shareholders tend to be at the bottom of the pile. Secured creditors like banks and institutional lenders  unpaid employees and suppliers are paid before investors.'Unfortunately  the shareholders of a company that's gone bust will find themselves at the bottom of the list of debtors  meaning that quite often they don't get anything back at all ' says Streeter.The outcome is dependent on how much the company is worth and how much debt it has accrued. If the assets are smaller than the debt pile the creditors take everything and can shut down the business or continue as a new private company owned entirely by the creditors.If the assets are greater than the debt the creditors get paid and shareholders get the value of anything left over in cash.A company might survive and issue new stock but it is unlikely as the debt pile tends to strip out any remaining value.Streeter adds: 'Debenhams' shareholders had their investments wiped out when the company fell into administration  and there was a domino effect for shareholders of Sports Direct International  now Frasers Group  given the company's 30 per cent stake in the business evaporated.'Shareholders in Patisserie Valerie also saw their holdings eaten up after it collapsed. It represented a double blow  given that just months before institutional investors in the company had stumped up ¬£15million in an emergency fundraising round in a bid to keep it afloat.'What happens if the shares are suspended?In extraordinary circumstances  trading in shares of certain companies is suspended.This is usually because the Financial Conduct Authority thinks it is necessary to protect investors or the company has failed to meet its obligations including publishing financial information.You maintain your shareholder rights if shares are suspended but you will be unable to execute or place any trades for the company.Recently the LSE suspended trading in 27 companies with links to Russia  including energy and banking firms Gazprom and Sberbank.AJ Bell told us that with suspended shares  such as Evraz or other Russian-linked stocks  the holdings will show in customer portfolios  valued at the price the stock was suspended at.Hargreaves Lansdown added: 'If a company's shares have been suspended  it won't be possible to trade. However  shares can continue to be held digitally and the value shown on the app or online will be as at the day they were suspended.',neutral,0.02,0.91,0.08,negative,0.01,0.16,0.83,True,English,"['shares', 'Freetrade analyst Gemma Boothroyd', 'The London Stock Exchange', 'growing valuation gap', 'current geopolitical backdrop', 'TowerBrook Capital Partners', 'minimum market cap', 'four month battle', 'Aberdeen Asset Management', 'Standard Life Aberdeen', 'private equity firms', 'Standard Life shareholders', 'existing share price', 'stock price', 'private deals', 'private approach', 'Aberdeen shareholders', 'accountancy firm', 'PE firms', 'Existing shareholders', 'one exchange', 'US peers', 'regulatory requirements', 'past year', 'Warburg Pincus', 'Other requirements', 'annual reports', 'last 12 months', 'previous months', 'first place', 'AJ Bell', 'brief summary', 'full statement', 'voting options', 'final decision', '66.7 per cent', 'direct investment', 'continued investment', 'Investment platform', 'tender offer', '¬£11billion deal', 'different exchanges', 'several exchanges', 'voting shareholders', 'total value', 'recent years', 'PE takeover', 'Everyday investors', 'institutional investors', 'nil value', 'new holding', 'remaining amount', 'UK-listed companies', 'smaller companies', 'public company', 'new company', 'cash offer', 'handful', 'number', 'choice', 'costs', 'time', 'decisions', 'board', 'directors', 'proposals', 'flurry', 'Clayton', 'Dubilier', 'Morrisons', 'AA', 'example', 'research', 'BDO', 'majority', 'premium', 'discount', 'assets', 'profit', 'return', 'gain', 'holdings', 'guarantee', 'position', 'difference', 'favour', 'acquirer', 'mixture', 'shares', 'exposure', 'KKR.', 'message', 'link', 'customers', 'date', 'proceedings', 'information', 'portfolio', 'scenario', 'buyer', 'access', 'cross-listing', '2017']",2022-04-04,2022-04-04,thisismoney.co.uk

2236,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/04/04/business/financial-markets/tse-overhaul-issues/,Tokyo stock market needs more than a shake-up to lure foreign investors,Investors and market observers say they find a recent shake-up less than attractive  saying they are looking more for companies that create innovations to stand out among global competitors.,The Tokyo stock market is trumpeting its largest overhaul in decades to lure more foreign investors. Still  the bourse is missing something such investors have long awaited ‚Äî companies with great growth potential.Its operator  Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc.  on Monday reorganized its four trading sections into three ‚Äî Prime  Standard and Growth ‚Äî for the roughly 3 800 listed companies to be categorized under more distinctive rules to sharpen the focus of each market.The reform came as Japan tries to cement a foothold for the Tokyo market as an international financial hub after its reputation was tarnished by a trading system failure in 2020 that caused an unprecedented full-day trade halt. The setback came in stark contrast to the rise in its U.S. and some Asian peers.Investors and market observers say they find the shake-up less than attractive  saying they are looking more for companies that create innovations to stand out among global competitors than for improving market availability.‚ÄúThere is definitely sentiment among investors that there are markets in other Asian countries with many attractive companies ‚Äù said Hidetaka Kawakita  an honorary professor at Kyoto University who specializes in stock market analysis. ‚ÄúCompared to them  Japanese companies seem to boast little growth and little increase in stock value.‚ÄùThe reorganization is designed to specify the concepts of each of the three new sections to make it more convenient for investors to pick which stocks to buy. The operator also aims to encourage listed companies to pursue growth more persistently and strengthen governance to raise their corporate value  by imposing higher requirements for market capitalization and outside directors.The TSE last carried out a large-scale restructuring of its trading sections in 1961 when it introduced the First Section and Second Section.The top-tier Prime section  equivalent to the former First Section  is made up of 1 839 companies  or over 80% of the total listed on the previous leading section  and centers on inviting global investors.A company in the new top division must have floating shares worth at least ¬•10 billion ($81.6 million) that account for 35% or more of its outstanding shares.About 300 companies have yet to meet the listing criteria for the Prime section  stricter than for the Standard section for midsize firms and Growth section for up-and-comers. But their shares can be traded in the section  pending improvement in operations based on business plans they submitted to the bourse prior to the market section revamp.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more cosmetic than anything else ‚Äù said Masakazu Takeda  a portfolio manager of Hennessy Japan Fund  which manages a total asset of about $801 million as of December and is run by California-based Hennessy Funds.‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point if you have 2 000 plus companies on the First Section of the TSE and a few years down the road you still have roughly the same number of listed names?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to help foreign investors sift through the universe.‚ÄùForeign investors are of great importance to the TSE  making up about 70% of the trading value on the former First Section.According to data by the World Federation of Exchanges  the Tokyo Stock Exchange had a market capitalization of domestic shares worth $6.17 trillion as of February. The value came fifth among global stock exchanges but makes up only a quarter of the New York Stock Exchange  the world‚Äôs largest bourse home to names like Visa Inc.  Johnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola Co.The Tokyo bourse was also behind the U.S. Nasdaq stock market  home to the tech giants known as GAFA including Google LLC and Apple Inc.  the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Euronext  a pan-European bourse.The reorganization ‚Äúis not a solution for this  and not hitting a right point at all. A sense of urgency to change is what is missing in Japan ‚Äù Masakazu Hosomizu  partner and portfolio manager at U.S. firm RMB Capital  said.He said that foreign investors pour their capital in high-quality Japanese companies that meet their own criteria in areas such as corporate governance and capital efficiency.Toyota Motor Corp.  the world‚Äôs largest automaker by volume  had its market capitalization briefly top ¬•40 trillion or about $330 billion for the first time in January  ahead of other global names in Japan like Sony Group Corp. and SoftBank Group Corp.But it was still far behind Apple that became the world‚Äôs first company to top $3 trillion in January or U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc. with over $1 trillion in market capitalization.Kyoto University‚Äôs Kawakita sees the reorganization as a ‚Äúfine-tuning‚Äù rather than a reform but a ‚Äúfirst step‚Äù in creating change in the Japanese market.He said he hopes the bourse will go on to implement tougher standards for listed companies in the future  such as requiring a market capitalization of ¬•100 billion to have major Japanese companies understand that they cannot stay on the top tier without growth.Hosomizu at RMB Capital said that the TSE should impose tighter listing rules to prompt companies to bolster corporate governance and the monitoring of their management. The TSE could demand hiring more outside directors than the current one-third of the board members required of companies on the Prime section.Akira Kiyota  the chief executive of Japan Exchange Group Inc.  the parent of the TSE  expects the shake-up and stricter requirements to incentivize listed companies to improve their corporate value.‚ÄúI have high expectations that this reform will be a motivator for companies to work on their corporate value ‚Äù he said at a regular press conference last week. ‚ÄúI would like to see the Prime market consist of companies that can attract global investors as its concept states.‚ÄùPHOTO GALLERY (CLICK TO ENLARGE),neutral,0.08,0.57,0.35,mixed,0.08,0.18,0.74,True,English,"['Tokyo stock market', 'foreign investors', 'shake-up', 'U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc.', 'U.S. Nasdaq stock market', 'unprecedented full-day trade halt', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc.', 'The Tokyo stock market', 'U.S. firm', 'Shanghai Stock Exchange', 'international financial hub', 'California-based Hennessy Funds', 'Toyota Motor Corp.', 'Sony Group Corp.', 'SoftBank Group Corp', 'new top division', 'stock market analysis', 'trading system failure', 'other Asian countries', 'previous leading section', 'four trading sections', 'three new sections', 'tighter listing rules', 'global stock exchanges', 'many attractive companies', 'The Tokyo bourse', 'former First Section', 'Hennessy Japan Fund', 'high-quality Japanese companies', 'major Japanese companies', 'top-tier Prime section', 'great growth potential', 'other global names', 'Tokyo market', 'Visa Inc.', 'stock value', 'Apple Inc.', 'Japanese market', 'market section', 'distinctive rules', 'Asian peers', 'global competitors', 'great importance', 'top tier', 'market observers', 'market availability', 'market capitalization', 'first time', 'first step', 'The TSE', 'Second Section', 'trading value', 'global investors', 'largest overhaul', 'stark contrast', 'honorary professor', 'Kyoto University', 'little increase', 'higher requirements', 'outside directors', 'large-scale restructuring', 'listing criteria', 'midsize firms', 'business plans', 'Masakazu Takeda', 'portfolio manager', 'same number', 'Coca-Cola Co', 'tech giants', 'Google LLC', 'largest automaker', 'tougher standards', '3,800 listed companies', 'Growth section', '2,000 plus companies', 'first company', 'corporate value', 'floating shares', 'outstanding shares', 'Standard section', 'domestic shares', 'RMB Capital', 'capital efficiency', 'little growth', 'largest bourse', 'pan-European bourse', 'foreign investors', 'Hidetaka Kawakita', 'total asset', 'right point', 'Masakazu Hosomizu', 'corporate governance', 'World Federation', '1,839 companies', '300 companies', 'decades', 'something', 'operator', 'Monday', 'focus', 'reform', 'foothold', 'reputation', 'setback', 'rise', 'shake-up', 'innovations', 'sentiment', 'markets', 'reorganization', 'concepts', 'stocks', 'comers', 'improvement', 'operations', 'December', 'road', 'universe', 'data', 'February', 'quarter', 'Johnson', 'GAFA', 'Euronext', 'solution', 'sense', 'urgency', 'partner', 'areas', 'volume', 'January', 'fine-tuning', 'future']",2022-04-04,2022-04-04,japantimes.co.jp

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) 300 mg weekly to treat adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  a chronic and progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and impairs the ability to swallow. The target action date for the FDA decision on this investigational use is August 3  2022.The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent 300 mg weekly in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE (Part A and Part B)  and data from an active long-term extension trial. Dupixent 300 mg weekly significantly improved the signs and symptoms of EoE at 24 weeks compared to placebo  including the ability to swallow and reduction in eosinophil count in the esophagus. The safety results of these trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common adverse event observed with Dupixent  in Part A and Part B  was injection site reactions.In September 2020  the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. Dupixent was also granted Orphan Drug designation for the potential treatment of EoE in 2017. Priority review is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Regulatory filings around the world are also planned in 2022. The potential use of Dupixent in EoE is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)EoE is a chronic  progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. For people with EoE  swallowing the smallest amount of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. Those with EoE live with anxiety and frustration from having a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid. This disease can also cause narrowing of the esophagus and dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed  which is often painful. In severe cases  a feeding tube is the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. People with EoE may have poor quality of life and are more likely to experience depression than people without EoE. There are approximately 160 000 patients in the U.S. living with EoE who are currently treated  of whom approximately 48 000 have failed multiple treatments.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. By demonstrating significant clinical benefit together with a decrease in type 2 inflammation following IL-4 and IL-13 blockade with Dupixent  the Dupixent Phase 3 clinical program has established that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases for which Dupixent is approved including atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  as well as investigational diseases such as EoE and prurigo nodularis  which have been studied in Phase 3 trials.In the U.S.  Dupixent is approved in patients aged 6 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis; as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma; and for use with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled.Dupixent is also approved in Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world  and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes  including eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2).

Today  it is the condition to keep your investors.‚ÄùHe argues that this has been ‚Äúan accelerator‚Äù of decarbonisation development.Euronext is developing ESG indices to help investors find relevant projects  Boujnah said.One factor making shipping‚Äôs green finance picture more transparent has been the wide take-up of the Poseidon Principles  which provide a global framework for assessing and disclosing the climate alignment of lenders‚Äô shipping books.Article continues below the advertBanks must disclose whether their loan portfolios are meeting climate goals.Norwegian shipping lender DNB‚Äôs chief executive  Kjerstin Braathen  said the measures have made for greater transparency around the indirect emissions in its maritime portfolio.The bank has a clear target of a 25% reduction towards 2030  she added.A start  but not enough‚ÄúIt is enough? No ‚Äù she admitted  but ‚ÄúThe principles are not static. This will be a dynamic process. This is about having a map. If you don‚Äôt have a map  you don‚Äôt know where you are going.‚ÄùGyrid Skalleberg Ingero  chief financial officer of Norwegian maritime technology group Kongsberg  said shipping is not doing enough  but sustainable finance is increasing. One-fifth of the bond market is now green in Nordic countries  she added.Skalleberg Ingero also expressed her frustration that regulations on emissions taxation are changing all the time.She called for a global standardisation of regimes and said it is a weakness of the industry that this has not been ‚Äúlanded‚Äù yet.Braathen said it is going to take time. Meanwhile  DNB is helping small and medium-sized companies understand that decarbonisation will take a lot of work and ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no way around it‚Äù.Boujnah said it is investors who are now driving the spread of green bonds in shipping.‚ÄúNorway leads the way.

2246,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.cfodive.com/news/spencer-stuarts-new-cfo-tracks-ukraine/621500/,Spencer Stuart's new CFO tracks Ukraine,5 hours ago,"Dive Brief:Christine Laurens joined global executive search and advisory firm Stuart Spencer as CFO in the first quarter  succeeding Valerie Harper  now head of Europe  the Middle East  Africa and Asia-Pacific for the firm.The move makes Laurens a three-time CFO: she was formerly CFO at global management consulting firm Kearney  where she rose through the ranks holding numerous positions over nearly two decades. She was also CFO at Keyrus  a technology consultancy listed on the Euronext High Growth Exchange.Reflecting on beating the odds to hold the the top finance seats even as women still only accounted for 15.1% of CFOs at major companies last year  Laurens said  ‚ÄúBeing a woman can sometimes bring benefits ... I‚Äôve never approached my role with ego. I‚Äôve always tried to approach my role with expertise and empathy  meaning that I know what I‚Äôm talking about but I‚Äôm not trying to fight with others ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs more about the success of the firm.‚ÄùDive Insight:Laurens  who began her career at EY in Paris in its technology and media practice  said her approach to the CFO roles has evolved since she first took the finance helm in her late 20s at Keyrus. At the smaller Keyrus she was more hands on and at the larger organizations she‚Äôs since joined she has focused more on financial planning and analysis. But she has always enjoyed digging in to analyze data and help drive her firms' directions.‚ÄúOne thing that is critical to me in any role I‚Äôve had as CFO is to think as a business partner and therefore to use numbers not just for reporting ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs really to get insight and to use what we see from the numbers to help drive and make decisions ‚Äù Laurens said.Christine Laurens Courtesy of Spencer StuartShe has a track record of doing just that. At Kearney  she and her team analyzed the drivers of the business that led to a change in the compensation model to incentivize people to focus on the bottom line  she said. ‚ÄúWhen you start changing the way you incentivize people it usually helps drive the right behaviors ‚Äù she said  adding that it can ‚Äúmake people think  ‚Äòwell  I need to care about working capital  I need to care about the profitability of the engagements.'‚ÄùAt Spencer Stuart she plans to tap into its recently implemented ERP system to harvest insights to drive strategy. In terms of macro risks  she sees the war in Ukraine as the top concern facing the firm followed by inflation and cybersecurity.While the company doesn‚Äôt have operations in Ukraine and very limited operations in Russia  it‚Äôs a global firm doing business in more than 30 countries  she said. As such  Spencer Stuart‚Äôs finance department along with the executive in charge of risks for the firm and all business leaders are monitoring leading indicators to keep abreast of whether the company‚Äôs business is being affected so they can make adjustments. To date she has seen no change for Spencer Stuart's business  she said.‚ÄúRight now as of today we have not identified a slow down but ... things can move very fast as we‚Äôve seen with the pandemic "" Laurens said in an interview early last week. Consulting businesses could be impacted by the war because companies are unsure and therefore they may want to postpone their investments or change the way they think about their succession  she said.",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.34,0.22,0.44,True,English,"['Spencer Stuart', 'new CFO', 'Ukraine', 'Euronext High Growth Exchange', 'global management consulting firm', 'global executive search', 'top finance seats', 'Consulting businesses', 'global firm', 'top concern', 'finance helm', 'finance department', 'Dive Brief', 'Stuart Spencer', 'first quarter', 'Valerie Harper', 'Middle East', 'numerous positions', 'two decades', 'media practice', 'late 20s', 'larger organizations', 'financial planning', ""firms' directions"", 'One thing', 'Spencer Stuart', 'track record', 'compensation model', 'bottom line', 'right behaviors', 'working capital', 'ERP system', 'leading indicators', 'slow down', 'advisory firm', 'technology consultancy', 'major companies', 'Dive Insight', 'macro risks', 'limited operations', 'three-time CFO', 'CFO roles', 'smaller Keyrus', 'business partner', 'business leaders', 'Christine Laurens', 'head', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'Asia-Pacific', 'move', 'Kearney', 'ranks', 'odds', 'women', 'CFOs', 'woman', 'benefits', 'ego', 'expertise', 'empathy', 'others', 'success', 'career', 'Paris', 'approach', 'hands', 'analysis', 'data', 'numbers', 'reporting', 'decisions', 'Courtesy', 'team', 'drivers', 'people', 'way', 'profitability', 'engagements', 'insights', 'strategy', 'terms', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'inflation', 'cybersecurity', 'company', 'Russia', '30 countries', 'charge', 'adjustments', 'date', 'today', 'things', 'pandemic', 'interview', 'investments']",2022-04-04,2022-04-04,cfodive.com

(‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúEDAC‚Äù)  the parent of the group of the same name  specialised in construction such as maintenance and renovation of buildings and other architectural structures using double safety ropes  listed on the Euronext Growth Milan stock exchange (ticker symbol EDAC) and on Euronext Growth Paris (ticker symbol ALEAC)  announces the completion of the procedure for the establishment of a new joint stock company in the Principality of Monaco  called EdiliziAcrobatica Monaco S.A.M. (hereinafter ‚ÄúNewCo‚Äù)  in partnership with other entities  such as the Monegasque company Engeco S.A.M.  a historic construction and real estate development company active in the local market of the Principality and elsewhere  and with the Italian investment holding company G.B.Par S.r.l.  owned by the Borromeo Arese family.In fact  the establishment of the NewCo  which will perform acrobatic construction works using double safety ropes in the construction and public works sector in the dynamic Monegasque market  is part of the broader international growth project launched by the Group in 2021 which calls for commercial expansion into markets considered strategic.With regard to the composition of the NewCo's initial share capital  today EDAC acquired a majority shareholding equal to 60%  which guarantees control and therefore the possibility of consolidating the NewCo within the Group's scope. The partner Engeco became the owner of a 30% stake in the NewCo's share capital  while the shareholder G.B.Par now owns the remaining 10%.From an operational point of view  the NewCo will therefore be managed by EdiliziAcrobatica as majority shareholder  and following the completion of some formal paperwork the managing director Riccardo Iovino will assume the position of Chairman of the Board of Directors and managing director with full powers and management powers.Since construction is a regulated business within the Principality of Monaco  the procedure for the incorporation of the NewCo and therefore the operational start-up of its activity was conditioned on the positive completion of the authorisation procedure initiated a few months ago by the sponsoring shareholders at the Directorate for Economic Development of the local government  which  by decree issued on 6 January 2022  authorised the establishment of the aforementioned company  consequently approving the by-laws drafted for this purpose. The start-up and document management of the filing with the competent authorities was also managed with the support of local consultants.By virtue of specific agreements between the promoting shareholders  the incorporation of the NewCo now having been completed  the composition of its board of directors will now be modified  being made up of three members ‚Äì each representing one of the shareholders ‚Äì namely Mr Riccardo Iovino as Chairman and managing director  Mr Giorgio Cassina and Mr Vitaliano Borromeo Arese.Riccardo Iovino  CEO and Founder of EdiliziAcrobatica S.p.A.  commented ‚ÄúThe decision to bring EdiliziAcrobatica technology to Monaco was certainly no coincidence. The urban configuration in Monaco is ideal for lean  fast and light operations such as those that EdiliziAcrobatica's know-how can provide.
