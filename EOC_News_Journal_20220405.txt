It shall also be possible to make such an issue resolution stipulating in-kind payment  the right to offset debt or other conditions referred to in Chapter 13 Section 5 first paragraph item 6 in the Swedish Companies Act.The purpose of the authorization is to provide flexibility to the board in its work to ensure that the company can appropriately raise capital for the financing of the business. Issuances of new shares under the authorization shall be made on market terms.The board of directors' proposal for resolution on the issue of warrants of series 2022:1 (item 19)The board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants and to approve of transfer of the warrants in accordance with the following.Issue of warrantsThe board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to carry out a directed issue of not more than 850 000 warrants  entailing an increase in the share capital of not more than SEK 425 000 at full subscription. The resolution shall otherwise be governed by the following terms and conditions.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  be vested in the company's wholly owned subsidiary Medivir Personal AB  Reg. no. 556598-2823 (the ""Subsidiary"")  with the right and obligation for the Subsidiary to transfer the warrants to employees pursuant to the below. Over-subscription is not possible.The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights are to stimulate shareholding in the company by virtue of an incentive program through which employees can take part of and contribute to a positive value increase of the company's share during the period of the proposed program  and that the company shall be able to retain and recruit competent and dedicated staff.The warrants shall be issued at no consideration. Subscription must be completed no later than three weeks after the resolution on issue of warrants. The board shall be entitled to extend the subscription period.Each warrant entitles a right to subscribe for one share of series B in the company. The warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new series B shares during the period from and including 1 December 2025 up to and including 15 December 2025. The new shares which may be issued due to subscription are not subject to any restrictive provisions.The subscription price (strike price) shall be established by the company  or by an independent appraiser or auditor firm retained by the company  and correspond to 175 per cent of the volume weighted average price of the series B share according the official share list of Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days immediately preceding the offer to subscribe for warrants  however not less than the quota value of the shares. The amount of the subscription price exceeding the quota value of the shares shall be contributed to the free share premium reserve.Shares which are newly issued following subscription by virtue of the warrants shall carry an entitlement to participate in dividends for the first time on the next record date for dividends which occurs after subscription for shares by virtue of the utilization of the warrants is effected.The company may  by means of a board resolution and with the consent from the board of directors in the Subsidiary  cancel the Subsidiary's warrants that are not transferred in accordance with the below or that have been re-purchased from participants. Cancellation shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  is authorized to make such minor adjustments to the resolution which may prove necessary in order to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Approval of transfer of warrantsThe board proposes that the general meeting approves of the Subsidiary's transfer of warrants on the following conditions.The right to subscribe for share warrants from the Subsidiary shall vest in the following categories of employees:Category Maximum number of warrants per person Maximum number of warrants per category A. Managing director (not more than 1 person) 300 000 300 000 B. Other members of the executive management(not more than 4 persons) 100 000 400 000 C. Other employees (not more than 6 persons) 25 000 150 000The right to purchase warrants from the Subsidiary shall only vest in employees who  at the end of the application period  have not terminated their employment  have not had their employment terminated or otherwise have given notice  or been notified  of employment termination.Warrants may also be offered to future employees. For such acquisitions  the conditions shall be the same or equivalent to what is stated in this resolution. This means  inter alia  that acquisitions shall be made to the market value at the time of the acquisition.Transfer of warrants to participants is conditional upon it being legally possible to purchase the warrants  and that such transfers can be done using reasonable administrative and financial resources according to the assessment of the board.Application and allotmentApplication for acquisition of warrants shall be made during the period from and including 15 May 2022 up until and including 22 May 2022. The board of the company shall however be entitled to extend the application period for acquisitions and to set a corresponding application period for new employees whose acquisitions are made after the expiration of the initial application period.Medivir shall  in connection with the allocation of the warrants to the participants in the program  and with certain exceptions  reserve a repurchase right regarding the warrants if the participant's employment or assignment within the group is terminated or if the participant wishes to transfer his/her warrants prior to the warrants being exercisable.Should warrants of a certain category remain with the Subsidiary after all applications within the category have been satisfied  the remaining warrants shall be available for allotment to participants in that same or another category whereby the board shall determine the distribution based on participant category  employment category and the number of warrants applied for. However  such distribution must not result in the maximum amount of warrants per person in a certain category being exceeded by more than 50 per cent.The board of the company shall determine the final allotment and the date of the transfer of the warrants. The transfer of warrants may be made up until and including 31 December 2021.Price and payment etc.The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price (premium) established on the basis of a market value of the warrants calculated by an independent valuation institute using the Black & Scholes valuation model. A new market value shall be established in an equivalent way for acquisitions made by new employees after the expiration of the initial application period. The value has preliminary been calculated to be SEK 1.34 per warrant based on a share price of SEK 8.Payment for the allocated warrants shall be made in cash no later than five days following the application for acquisition. The board shall establish a corresponding date of payment for acquisitions made by new employees.Medivir will partly subsidize the participant's acquisition of warrants. The subsidy shall be paid in connection with the allocation of warrants to the participants. The total subsidy granted to the participant shall correspond to half of the participant's investment (after deduction of any income tax of the participant). The total cost for the subsidy  based on the above preliminary value of the warrants  is estimated at SEK 1 740 551 for the entire term of the warrant programme of three years  including any social security contributions.In order to be eligible for the subsidy  the participant must  at the time of the payment of the bonus  not have been dismissed (Sw. avskedad )  terminated his/her employment or given notice of employment termination  remain employed in the company for three years  or the subsidy will  with certain exceptions  be prorated  and must not have transferred his/her warrants.Further information on the warrant programDilutionUpon full exercise of all warrants  850 000 new shares can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.5 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the company  however  subject to any potential adjustment which may occur under the terms and conditions for the warrants. Accordingly  the program offers the employees the possibility to increase their shareholding in the company to the corresponding figure.Impact of financial ratio and costs for the company etc.The company's earnings per share are not affected by the issue of the warrants as the present value of the warrants' strike price exceeds the current market value of the share at the date of issue. Since the warrants are transferred to the participants at market value it is not expected that the company will incur any personnel costs. The warrant program will incur costs in relation to the subsidy that the participants are entitled to. Such costs amount to a maximum of SEK 1 740 551 for the entire term of the warrant program of three years.

Over-subscription is not possible. The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights are to stimulate shareholding in the company by virtue of an incentive program through which employees can take part of and contributeto a positive value increase of the company's share during the period of the proposed program  and that the company shall be able to retain and recruit competent and dedicated staff. The warrants shall be issued at no consideration. Subscription must be completed no later than three weeks after the resolution on issue of warrants. The board shall be entitled to extend the subscription period. Each warrant entitles a right to subscribe for one share of series B in the company. The warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new series B shares during the period from and including 1 December 2025 up to and including 15 December 2025. The new shares which may be issued due to subscription are not subject to any restrictive provisions. The subscription price (strike price) shall be established by the company  or by an independent appraiser or auditor firm retained by the company  and correspond to 175 per cent of the volume weighted average price of the series B share according the official share list of Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days immediately preceding the offer to subscribe for warrants  however not less than the quota value of the shares. The amount of the subscription price exceeding the quota value of the shares shall be contributed to the free share premium reserve. Shares which are newly issued following subscription by virtue of the warrants shall carry an entitlement to participate in dividends for the first time on the next record date for dividends which occurs after subscription for shares by virtue of the utilization of the warrants is effected. The company may  by means of a board resolution and with the consent from the board of directors in the Subsidiary  cancel the Subsidiary's warrants that are not transferred in accordance with the below or that have been re-purchased from participants. Cancellation shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  is authorized to make such minor adjustments to the resolution which may prove necessary in order to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Approval of transfer of warrants The board proposes that the general meeting approves of the Subsidiary's transfer of warrants on the following conditions. The right to subscribe for share warrants from the Subsidiary shall vest in the following categories of employees: Category Maximum number of warrants per person Maximum number of warrants per category A. Managing director (not more than 1 person) 300 000 300 000 B. Other members of the executive management (not more than 4 persons) 100 000 400 000 C.

Please see section 11 of the Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting.By order of the BoardThrogmorton Secretaries LLPCompany Secretary4 April 2022Registered Office:6th FloorBastion House140 London WallLondon EC2Y 5DNExplanatory Notes on the resolutionsAn explanation of each of the resolutions is set out below.Resolution 1 ‚Äì To receive and adopt the Annual Report and AccountsThe Directors are required to present the financial statements  Directors‚Äô Report and Auditor‚Äôs Report to the meeting. These are contained in the Company‚Äôs Annual Report and Financial Statements for the period ended 31 December 2021 (the ‚ÄúAnnual Report‚Äù). A resolution to receive and adopt the financial statements  together with the Directors‚Äô Report and the Auditor‚Äôs Report on those accounts  is included as an ordinary resolution.Resolutions 2-5 ‚Äì Re-election of DirectorsIn accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code  all of the Directors will retire and offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.The Company has three non-executive directors  all of whom are determined by the Board to be independent directors in accordance with the criteria set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board considers that their skills  experience  independence and knowledge of the Company enable them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectivelyEach of the Board members‚Äô biographical details are set out on the Company‚Äôs website at https://www.physitrackgroup.com/governance/board-directors.Resolutions 6 and 7 ‚Äì Appointment and Remuneration of AuditorAt each meeting at which the Company‚Äôs financial statements are presented to its members  the Company is required to appoint an auditor to serve until the next such meeting. As part of its review of the continuing appointment of the auditors  the Board considers the length of tenure of the audit firm  its fees and independence along with any matters raised during each audit. Mazars LLP are the appointed auditors of the Company. Following a tender process in 2020 Mazars performed an audit on the 2018  2019 and 2020 figures for the purpose of the IPO prospective. The audit of the period ended 21 December 2021 was the first audit by Mazars since Physitrack PLC became a public company. The Board recommends the re-appointment of Mazars LLP and this will be proposed to the AGM as Resolution 6. Resolution 7 authorises the Directors to determine the remuneration of Mazars LLP as Auditor.Resolution 8 ‚Äì Authority to allot Ordinary SharesThe Directors may only allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  shares if authorised to do so by shareholders. Resolution 8 will  if passed  authorise the Directors to allot the Company‚Äôs Ordinary Shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  Ordinary Shares in the Company up to a maximum nominal amount of ¬£3 252.15 representing 3 252 153 Ordinary Shares and is equivalent to approximately 20 per cent. of the Company‚Äôs existing issued Ordinary Share capital as at 3 April 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of the Notice).Resolution 9 ‚Äì Authority to dis-apply pre-emption rightsResolution 9 is a special resolution which is being proposed to authorise the Directors to disapply the pre-emption rights of existing Shareholders in relation to issues of Ordinary Shares under Resolution 8 (being in respect of ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal value of ¬£3 252.15  representing up to approximately 20 per cent. of the Company‚Äôs issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the Notice)  provided that in the case of any Ordinary Shares allotted the issue price is no lower than the nominal value per Ordinary Share.Resolution 10 ‚Äì Share RepurchasesResolution 10 is also a special resolution. The Companies Act 2006 allows companies to hold shares acquired by way of market purchase as treasury shares  rather than having to cancel them. This would give the Company the ability to re-issue Ordinary Shares quickly and cost effectively thereby improving liquidity and providing the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.No Ordinary Shares will be sold from treasury at a price less than the net asset value per existing ordinary share at the time of their sale unless they are first offered pro rata to existing Shareholders.The Company may seek to address any significant discount to net asset value at which its Ordinary Shares may be trading by purchasing its own Ordinary Shares in the market on an ad hoc basis.The Directors currently have the authority to make market purchases of up to 10 per cent. of the Ordinary Shares in issue and are seeking to renew this authority to issue up to 10% of the Company‚Äôs issued share capital  which equates to 1 626 077 at the date of this notice. The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for an ordinary share must not be more than the higher of:(i) 105% of the average of the mid-market values of the Ordinary Shares for the five business days before the purchase is made; or(ii) the price stipulated by the regulatory technical standards adopted by the UK pursuant to the Market Abuse Regulation  being the form of the EU Market Abuse Regulation as incorporated into the law of England and Wales.Ordinary Shares will only be repurchased at prices below the prevailing net asset value per ordinary share  which should have the effect of increasing the net asset value per ordinary share for the remaining Shareholders. The minimum price which may be paid shall be their respective nominal values.It is intended that a renewal of the authority to make market purchases will be sought from Shareholders at each AGM of the Company. Purchases of Ordinary Shares will be made within guidelines established from time to time by the Board. Any purchase of Ordinary Shares would be made only out of the available uncommitted cash resources of the Group.Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company may be held in treasury or cancelled.Investors should note that the repurchase of Ordinary Shares is entirely at the discretion of the Board and no expectation or reliance should be placed on such discretion being exercised on any one or more occasions or as to the proportion of Ordinary Shares that may be repurchased.Settlement of ordinary share transactions in the Company are settled by the CREST share settlement system.The results of the voting on all resolutions will be published on the Company‚Äôs website as soon as practicable following the conclusion of the AGM.Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting1.

The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer‚Äôs agent (ID: RA10) by the voting deadline of 48 hours (excluding non-working days) before the time of the meeting. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer‚Äôs agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST.CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages.

Please see section 11 of the Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting.By order of the BoardThrogmorton Secretaries LLPCompany Secretary4 April 2022Registered Office:6th FloorBastion House140 London WallLondon EC2Y 5DNExplanatory Notes on the resolutionsAn explanation of each of the resolutions is set out below.Resolution 1 - To receive and adopt the Annual Report and AccountsThe Directors are required to present the financial statements  Directors' Report and Auditor's Report to the meeting. These are contained in the Company's Annual Report and Financial Statements for the period ended 31 December 2021 (the ""Annual Report""). A resolution to receive and adopt the financial statements  together with the Directors' Report and the Auditor's Report on those accounts  is included as an ordinary resolution.Resolutions 2-5 - Re-election of DirectorsIn accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code  all of the Directors will retire and offer themselves for re-election at the forthcoming AGM.The Company has three non-executive directors  all of whom are determined by the Board to be independent directors in accordance with the criteria set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. The Board considers that their skills  experience  independence and knowledge of the Company enable them to discharge their respective duties and responsibilities effectivelyEach of the Board members' biographical details are set out on the Company's website at https://www.physitrackgroup.com/governance/board-directors.Resolutions 6 and 7 - Appointment and Remuneration of AuditorAt each meeting at which the Company's financial statements are presented to its members  the Company is required to appoint an auditor to serve until the next such meeting. As part of its review of the continuing appointment of the auditors  the Board considers the length of tenure of the audit firm  its fees and independence along with any matters raised during each audit. Mazars LLP are the appointed auditors of the Company. Following a tender process in 2020 Mazars performed an audit on the 2018  2019 and 2020 figures for the purpose of the IPO prospective. The audit of the period ended 21 December 2021 was the first audit by Mazars since Physitrack PLC became a public company. The Board recommends the re-appointment of Mazars LLP and this will be proposed to the AGM as Resolution 6. Resolution 7 authorises the Directors to determine the remuneration of Mazars LLP as Auditor.Resolution 8 - Authority to allot Ordinary SharesThe Directors may only allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  shares if authorised to do so by shareholders. Resolution 8 will  if passed  authorise the Directors to allot the Company's Ordinary Shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  Ordinary Shares in the Company up to a maximum nominal amount of ¬£3 252.15 representing 3 252 153 Ordinary Shares and is equivalent to approximately 20 per cent. of the Company's existing issued Ordinary Share capital as at 3 April 2022 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of the Notice).Resolution 9 - Authority to dis-apply pre-emption rightsResolution 9 is a special resolution which is being proposed to authorise the Directors to disapply the pre-emption rights of existing Shareholders in relation to issues of Ordinary Shares under Resolution 8 (being in respect of ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal value of ¬£3 252.15  representing up to approximately 20 per cent. of the Company's issued ordinary share capital as at the date of the Notice)  provided that in the case of any Ordinary Shares allotted the issue price is no lower than the nominal value per Ordinary Share.Resolution 10 - Share RepurchasesResolution 10 is also a special resolution. The Companies Act 2006 allows companies to hold shares acquired by way of market purchase as treasury shares  rather than having to cancel them. This would give the Company the ability to re-issue Ordinary Shares quickly and cost effectively thereby improving liquidity and providing the Company with additional flexibility in the management of its capital base.No Ordinary Shares will be sold from treasury at a price less than the net asset value per existing ordinary share at the time of their sale unless they are first offered pro rata to existing Shareholders.The Company may seek to address any significant discount to net asset value at which its Ordinary Shares may be trading by purchasing its own Ordinary Shares in the market on an ad hoc basis.The Directors currently have the authority to make market purchases of up to 10 per cent. of the Ordinary Shares in issue and are seeking to renew this authority to issue up to 10% of the Company's issued share capital  which equates to 1 626 077 at the date of this notice. The maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for an ordinary share must not be more than the higher of:(i) 105% of the average of the mid-market values of the Ordinary Shares for the five business days before the purchase is made; or(ii) the price stipulated by the regulatory technical standards adopted by the UK pursuant to the Market Abuse Regulation  being the form of the EU Market Abuse Regulation as incorporated into the law of England and Wales.Ordinary Shares will only be repurchased at prices below the prevailing net asset value per ordinary share  which should have the effect of increasing the net asset value per ordinary share for the remaining Shareholders. The minimum price which may be paid shall be their respective nominal values.It is intended that a renewal of the authority to make market purchases will be sought from Shareholders at each AGM of the Company. Purchases of Ordinary Shares will be made within guidelines established from time to time by the Board. Any purchase of Ordinary Shares would be made only out of the available uncommitted cash resources of the Group.Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company may be held in treasury or cancelled.Investors should note that the repurchase of Ordinary Shares is entirely at the discretion of the Board and no expectation or reliance should be placed on such discretion being exercised on any one or more occasions or as to the proportion of Ordinary Shares that may be repurchased.Settlement of ordinary share transactions in the Company are settled by the CREST share settlement system.The results of the voting on all resolutions will be published on the Company's website as soon as practicable following the conclusion of the AGM.Notes to the Notice of Annual General Meeting1.

That still leaves about $552 million owed on the 2022 bond. Russia said it plans to buy back the maturing bond in full.Bondholders who chose not to take the ruble-buyback offer will be paid in US dollars on Monday  sources told Reuters.Meanwhile  Russia is coming up against another April 4 deadline for a coupon payment of $84 million on a separate 2042 bond.Last week  Russia narrowly avoided a default after JPMorgan processed a $447 million dollar-denominated bond payment  despite Clearstream blocking Russia from a key clearinghouse for foreign debt payments the week prior.Western sanctions slapped on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine have meant money is only slowly trickling through the system  as banks seek approval from the US Treasury to process funds.Russia has so far kept up payments on its foreign currency denominated bonds  despite major ratings agencies saying in early March that a debt default washighly likely.,negative,0.02,0.18,0.8,negative,0.01,0.19,0.8,True,English,"['bond payments', 'default fears', 'Russia', 'deadline', 'foreign currency denominated bonds', '$447 million dollar-denominated bond payment', 'major ratings agencies', 'foreign debt payments', 'outstanding bond payments', 'debt default fears', 'coupon payment', 'maturing bond', 'separate 2042 bond', 'Russian government', 'Finance Ministry', 'ruble-buyback offer', 'US dollars', 'April 4 deadline', 'key clearinghouse', 'Western sanctions', 'US Treasury', 'early March', 'Monday deadline', '2022 bond', 'Kremlin', 'rubles', 'Bondholders', 'sources', 'Reuters', 'JPMorgan', 'Clearstream', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'money', 'system', 'banks', 'approval', 'funds']",2022-04-04,2022-04-05,africa.businessinsider.com

These bonds can be nominated and purchased either in UAH or USD.To promote the bonds  the National Bank of Ukraine has introduced a simplified identification and verification mechanism exclusively for foreign individual buyers of war bonds and for Ukrainian nationals who permanently or temporarily reside abroad. This new mechanism enables remote identification and verification. The client would only have to send the documents to the broker/bank through protected communication channels and pass verification by videoconference. Simplified procedure is available for transactions for the total amount of up to UAH 400 000 (approximately EUR 12 273.70) per month.The most recent auction held on 29 March 2022 showed that the interest in Ukrainian military bonds is on the rise. During this auction  the Ministry of Finance issued and placed bonds for total amount of UAH 3.3 billion. The interest rate for the military bonds in UAH with a 15-month redemption period was set at 11%  and with the 6-month redemption period at 10%.Source: –ú—ñ–Ω—Ñ—ñ–Ω –æ–≥–æ–ª–æ—Å–∏–≤ —á–µ—Ä–≥–æ–≤–∏–π –∞—É–∫—Ü—ñ–æ–Ω –∑ –ø—Ä–æ–¥–∞–∂—É –≤—ñ–π—Å—å–∫–æ–≤–∏—Ö –æ–±–ª—ñ–≥–∞—Ü—ñ–π –Ω–∞ 29 –±–µ—Ä–µ–∑–Ω—è (espreso.tv)Previously  the Ministry of Finance already issued the following war bonds  which also should be available on the secondary market:Military bonds are traded through primary dealers that participate in auctions held by the Ministry of Finance in the interests of their clients. Among the primary dealers are two international and two local banks. In particular  the local banks include –ûschadbank and PrivatBank. International banks acting as primary dealers are Citibank and Raiffeisen Bank. More detailed information on the list of the primary dealers can be found at this link: https://mof.gov.ua/en/perelik-pervinnih-dileriv.For direct purchases  a foreign investor has to follow these steps:choose and conclude an agreement with a Ukrainian broker with primary dealer status (the Broker);open a securities account in one of the Ukrainian depository institutions;place an order with the Broker.If they do not have direct access to Ukrainian depositary system or brokers  foreign investors can also consider using their foreign custodians as intermediaries in the process. Several foreign custodians have access to the Ukrainian depositary system through nominee accounts foreign custodians hold with Ukrainian custodians. These foreign custodians are able to purchase and hold Ukrainian securities on behalf of their clients without the need for their clients to open Ukrainian accounts.

They are a potentially attractive drug delivery system due to their intrinsic properties: small size  wide range of potential routes of administration  natural targeting to immune cells  lack of nucleic acids  and readily available sourcing of RBC for their production. Vesiculation of RBCs that have already been loaded with active therapeutic compounds utilizing the ERYCAPS¬Æ process  entails the potential of producing cargo-loaded RBC-derived extracellular vesicles for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.Fran√ßoise Horand  Director of R&D Operations at ERYTECH  commented: ‚ÄúWe are delighted to present the work of our team and collaborators at the upcoming ERCS meeting  in particular the opportunity to introduce the ERYCEVTM technology  which leverages our proprietary ERYCAPS¬Æ technology in a novel fashion  and allows to produce red blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles  loaded with active ingredients. We are encouraged by the initial results characterizing the in vitro biological activity of these pre-loaded RBCEVs  suggesting potential future application in immune modulation.‚ÄùStory continuesGil Beyen  CEO of ERYTECH  added: ‚ÄúThe results that will be presented at the upcoming ERCS conference underscore the versatility and broad potential of our ERYCAPS¬Æ platform. We look forward to discussing further potential development opportunities with the red blood cell community and will look to provide updates on ERYCEV TM as the program advances going forward.‚ÄùERYTECH and its researchers will also participate in the Poster session on April 8 to present the Capabilities of the RBC therapeutics platform ERYCAPS¬Æ  and in the ‚ÄúRBC Diseases‚Äù session on April 10 to present the work conducted with the LIBM academic laboratory (Laboratoire Interuniversitaire de Biologie de la Motricit√© de Lyon).About ERYTECH and eryaspase (GRASPA¬Æ)ERYTECH is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative red blood cell-based therapeutics for severe forms of cancer and orphan diseases. Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS¬Æ platform  which uses a novel technology to encapsulate drug substances inside red blood cells  ERYTECH is developing a pipeline of product candidates for patients with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH‚Äôs primary focus is on the development of product candidates that target the altered metabolism of cancer cells by depriving them of amino acids necessary for their growth and survival.The Company‚Äôs lead product candidate  eryaspase  which consists of L-asparaginase encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells  targets the cancer cells‚Äô altered asparagine and glutamine metabolism. The proof of concept of eryaspase as a cancer metabolism agent was established in different trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and pancreatic cancer. An investigator sponsored Phase 2 trial (IST) evaluating the use of eryaspase in ALL patients who developed hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase recently reported positive results  based on which the Company intends to request approval in the United States and potentially other territories. The Company is also pursuing a Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial in first-line pancreatic cancer.Eryaspase received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who have developed hypersensitivity reactions to E. coli-derived pegylated asparaginase. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency have granted eryaspase orphan drug status for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and ALL.ERYTECH produces its product candidates for treatment of patients in Europe at its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France  and for patients in the United States at its GMP manufacturing site in Princeton  New Jersey  USA. Eryaspase is not an approved medicine.ERYTECH is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States (ticker: ERYP) and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0011471135  ticker: ERYP).

2229,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://japantoday.com/category/business/focus-tokyo-stock-market-needs-more-than-shake-up-to-lure-foreign-investors,Tokyo stock market revamped in hope of attracting foreign investors,The Tokyo stock market trumpets its largest overhaul in decades to lure more foreign investors. Still  the bourse is missing something such investors have long awaited -- companies with great growth potential. The bourse operator  Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc  on‚Ä¶,"By Ayano ShimizuThe Tokyo stock market trumpets its largest overhaul in decades to lure more foreign investors. Still  the bourse is missing something such investors have long awaited -- companies with great growth potential.The bourse operator  Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc  on Monday reorganized its four trading sections into three -- Prime  Standard and Growth -- for the roughly 3 800 listed companies to be categorized under more distinctive rules to sharpen the focus of each market.The reform came as Japan tries to cement a foothold for the Tokyo market as an international financial hub after its reputation was tarnished by a trading system failure in 2020 that caused an unprecedented full-day trade halt. The setback came in stark contrast to the rise in its U.S. and some Asian peers.Investors and market observers say they find the shake-up less than attractive  saying they are looking more for companies that create innovations to stand out among global competitors than for improving market availability.""There is definitely sentiment among investors that there are markets in other Asian countries with many attractive companies "" Hidetaka Kawakita  an honorary professor at Kyoto University who specializes in stock market analysis  said. ""Compared to them  Japanese companies seem to boast little growth and little increase in stock value.""The reorganization is designed to specify the concepts of each of the three new sections to make it more convenient for investors to pick which stocks to buy. The operator also aims to encourage listed companies to pursue growth more persistently and strengthen governance to raise their corporate value  by imposing higher requirements for market capitalization and outside directors.The TSE last carried out a large-scale restructuring of its trading sections in 1961 when it introduced the First Section and Second Section.The top-tier Prime section  equivalent to the former First Section  is made up of 1 839 companies  or over 80 percent of the total listed on the previous leading section  and centers on inviting global investors.A company in the new top division must have floating shares worth at least 10 billion yen ($81.6 million) that account for 35 percent or more of its outstanding shares.About 300 companies have yet to meet the listing criteria for the Prime section  stricter than for the Standard section for midsize firms and Growth section for up-and-comers. But their shares can be traded in the section  pending improvement in operations based on business plans they submitted to the bourse prior to the market section revamp.""It's more cosmetic than anything else "" said Masakazu Takeda  a portfolio manager of Hennessy Japan Fund  which manages a total asset of about $801 million as of December and is run by California-based Hennessy Funds.""What's the point if you have 2 000 plus companies on the First Section of the TSE and a few years down the road you still have roughly the same number of listed names?"" he said. ""It's not going to help foreign investors sift through the universe.""Foreign investors are of great importance to the TSE  making up about 70 percent of the trading value on the former First Section.According to data by the World Federation of Exchanges  the Tokyo Stock Exchange had a market capitalization of domestic shares worth $6.17 trillion as of February. The value came fifth among global stock exchanges but makes up only a quarter of the New York Stock Exchange  the world's largest bourse home to names like Visa Inc  Johnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola Co.The Tokyo bourse was also behind the U.S. Nasdaq stock market  home to the tech giants known as GAFA including Google LLC and Apple Inc  the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Euronext  a pan-European bourse.The reorganization ""is not a solution for this  and not hitting a right point at all. A sense of urgency to change is what is missing in Japan "" Masakazu Hosomizu  partner and portfolio manager at U.S. firm RMB Capital  said.He said that foreign investors pour their capital in high-quality Japanese companies that meet their own criteria in areas such as corporate governance and capital efficiency.Toyota Motor Corp  the world's largest automaker by volume  had its market capitalization briefly top 40 trillion yen or about $330 billion for the first time in January  ahead of other global names in Japan like Sony Group Corp and SoftBank Group Corp.But it was still far behind Apple that became the world's first company to top $3 trillion in January or U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc. with over $1 trillion in market capitalization.Kyoto University's Kawakita sees the reorganization as a ""fine-tuning"" rather than a reform but a ""first step"" in creating change in the Japanese market.He said he hopes the bourse will go on to implement tougher standards for listed companies in the future  such as requiring a market capitalization of 100 billion yen to have major Japanese companies understand that they cannot stay on the top tier without growth.Hosomizu at RMB Capital said that the TSE should impose tighter listing rules to prompt companies to bolster corporate governance and the monitoring of their management. The TSE could demand hiring more outside directors than the current one-third of the board members required of companies on the Prime section.Akira Kiyota  the chief executive of Japan Exchange Group Inc.  the parent of the TSE  expects the shake-up and stricter requirements to incentivize listed companies to improve their corporate value.""I have high expectations that this reform will be a motivator for companies to work on their corporate value "" he said at a regular press conference last week.

April 4  2022. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) 300 mg weekly to treat adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  a chronic and progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and impairs the ability to swallow. The target action date for the FDA decision on this investigational use is August 3  2022.The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent 300 mg weekly in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE (Part A and Part B)  and data from an active long-term extension trial. Dupixent 300 mg weekly significantly improved the signs and symptoms of EoE at 24 weeks compared to placebo  including the ability to swallow and reduction in eosinophil count in the esophagus. The safety results of these trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common adverse event observed with Dupixent  in Part A and Part B  was injection site reactions.In September 2020  the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. Dupixent was also granted Orphan Drug designation for the potential treatment of EoE in 2017. Priority review is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Regulatory filings around the world are also planned in 2022. The potential use of Dupixent in EoE is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.Story continuesAbout Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)EoE is a chronic  progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. For people with EoE  swallowing the smallest amount of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. Those with EoE live with anxiety and frustration from having a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid. This disease can also cause narrowing of the esophagus and dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed  which is often painful. In severe cases  a feeding tube is the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. People with EoE may have poor quality of life and are more likely to experience depression than people without EoE. There are approximately 160 000 patients in the U.S. living with EoE who are currently treated  of whom approximately 48 000 have failed multiple treatments.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP).In the U.S.  Dupixent is approved in patients aged 6 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis; as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma; and for use with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled.Dupixent is also approved in Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world  and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes  including eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) 300 mg weekly to treat adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  a chronic and progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and impairs the ability to swallow. The target action date for the FDA decision on this investigational use is August 3  2022.The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent 300 mg weekly in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE (Part A and Part B)  and data from an active long-term extension trial. Dupixent 300 mg weekly significantly improved the signs and symptoms of EoE at 24 weeks compared to placebo  including the ability to swallow and reduction in eosinophil count in the esophagus. The safety results of these trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications.

By demonstrating significant clinical benefit together with a decrease in type 2 inflammation following IL-4 and IL-13 blockade with Dupixent  the Dupixent Phase 3 clinical program has established that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases for which Dupixent is approved including atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  as well as investigational diseases such as EoE and prurigo nodularis  which have been studied in Phase 3 trials.In the U.S.  Dupixent is approved in patients aged 6 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis; as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma; and for use with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled.Dupixent is also approved in Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world  and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes  including eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 years of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. DUPIXENT is not used to treat sudden breathing problems. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis under 18 years of age.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR U.S. PATIENTSDo not use if you are allergic to dupilumab or to any of the ingredients in DUPIXENT¬Æ.Before using DUPIXENT  tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions  including if you:have eye problemshave a parasitic (helminth) infectionare scheduled to receive any vaccinations. You should not receive a ""live vaccine"" right before and during treatment with DUPIXENT.are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. It is not known whether DUPIXENT will harm your unborn baby.are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. It is not known whether DUPIXENT passes into your breast milk.Tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins and herbal supplements.Especially tell your healthcare provider if you are taking oral  topical  or inhaled corticosteroid medicines; have asthma and use an asthma medicine; or have atopic dermatitis or CRSwNP  and also have asthma. Do not change or stop your corticosteroid medicine or other asthma medicine without talking to your healthcare provider. This may cause other symptoms that were controlled by the corticosteroid medicine or other asthma medicine to come back.DUPIXENT can cause serious side effects  including:Allergic reactions.

2234,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/investing/article-10648215/What-happens-delisted-shares.html,What happens to delisted shares?,Take-private deals have seen more UK companies delisting from the stock exchange. What happens if the company you're invested in has been delisted or suspended from trading?,The growing valuation gap between UK-listed companies and their US peers has made take-private deals more attractive to private equity firms and it has led to a handful of companies delisting.Additionally  the current geopolitical backdrop has also led to a number of companies being suspended from the London Stock Exchange.But what happens if you're invested in a company that has been bought out and delisted  or the company is removed entirely from the exchange involuntarily?Companies can choose to be delisted from the stock exchange or suspended for failing to meet regulatory requirementsWhy are companies delisted?A company is delisted when it is removed from a stock exchange. Companies can choose to delist by choice  whether to reduce costs  particularly for smaller companies  or cut the time taken to make decisions.If a company is delisted they no longer have to wait for shareholders and the board of directors to vote on proposals.More often than not take-private deals occur when a company is taken over or merged with another company.There has been a flurry of take-private deals over the past year including Clayton  Dubilier and Rice's takeover of Morrisons  and the AA  bought by Warburg Pincus and TowerBrook Capital Partners.Exchanges can also force companies to delist if they don't meet the regulatory requirements.The London Stock Exchange  for example  requires all listed companies to hold a minimum market cap of ¬£700 000.Other requirements include having a stock price above a certain value and filing annual reports on time.What happens if a company is taken private?The total value of companies bought out by private equity firms and delisted has rocketed to ¬£29.3billion over the last 12 months  according to research by accountancy firm BDO.When a company is approached by a private equity firm the board has to decide whether it wants to recommend the deal to shareholders. If it does the majority of voting shareholders then have to agree to the offer at the proposed price.It usually happens at a premium to the company's existing share price because PE firms tend to go after firms that look undervalued or are trading at a discount.'PE firms want to buy companies that they think can be run better than they're being run now. Or at the very least  where they can strip the company of its assets and sell these for a profit.'After all  that's how they get a return on their investment; unlocking or creating seemingly ignored value ' said Freetrade analyst Gemma Boothroyd.'Existing shareholders can often walk away with a gain on their holdings. But that doesn't mean the premium will be higher than where that share price has stood in previous months or years  assuming that the share price has declined in recent years which has led to the take-private approach in the first place.'So it's no guarantee that all shareholders will benefit from a PE takeover.'Everyday investors who oppose the proposal can make their position known by voting against it but it is unlikely to make much of a difference if institutional investors are largely in favour.After a four month battle  private equity firm Clayton  Dubilier & Rice bought Morrisons for ¬£10bn in a take-private dealGenerally  the acquirer will put forward a cash offer or a tender offer which are often financed using a mixture of cash and shares. Once the company has gone private it will be delisted from the stock exchange.Boothroyd notes that investors can still gain exposure to a company if it's taken private if the PE firm is publicly listed  like KKR.It would not be a direct investment however but it could allow for some continued investment in the once-listed company.Investment platform AJ Bell confirmed it will send a message to shareholders if a company is delisted.'This message will have a brief summary of what has happened and a link to the full statement from the company so customers are up to date with any proceedings. When we receive more information from the delisted firm  we pass this straight onto the customer  including any voting options that might be available.'The shares will remain in the customer's portfolio online with a nil value until the delisted company comes to a final decision.'What happens to shares if a company is merged with another public company?A company could also be taken over or merged with a company that is already publicly listed.In this scenario the holding will be swapped for either a new holding in the buyer or an amount of cash.In 2017 Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management merged to form Standard Life Aberdeen in an ¬£11billion deal.Standard Life shareholders held 66.7 per cent of the new company and the remaining amount went to Aberdeen shareholders.What happens if the company is still listed on another exchange?Often a company will be listed on different exchanges but if a company delists from one exchange then investors won't necessarily lose access to the shares.A cross-listing allows companies to list shares on several exchanges. A company just has to meet the listing requirements of a local exchange and demonstrate it will treat its shareholders equally.A dual listing also allows companies to list on different exchanges and usually happens when two listed firms merge.WHAT HAPPENS TO SHARES IN PASSIVE FUNDS? You may not invest in individual stocks and instead invest through a passive tracker. If a company that is delisted is held in a fund it will be removed from the fund. If it is tracking an exchange like the S&P 500 the fund is realigned and will be replaced with an existing company. Susannah Streeter  senior investments and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said: 'When a share held in a passive fund is delisted  its value is typically reduced to zero before being removed from the fund. This is likely to have a negative impact on the tracking error versus the benchmark.'For example  when US cruise operator Carnival bought P&O Princess in 2002 it kept its listings in both London and the NYSE. While they act as one company they're set up as two separate legal entities which means the shares are not interchangeable.However with a cross-listing if you buy shares in a company on the LSE they'll be the same as those listed on the NYSE.'Talks of the US delisting foreign companies that fail to comply with their auditing standards could mean these companies are taken off the US exchanges ' said Boothroyd.'But if investors still wanted access to the companies  they could theoretically invest wherever they're cross-listed.'AJ Bell said if a stock's main listing moves from London to another HMRC recognised stock exchange - which includes Stockholm  Tel Aviv and Euronext - it will keep customers informed and update their portfolios accordingly.Interactive Investor said if a UK company is taken over by a foreign company listed on another exchange it will do its best to ensure the customer can sell the shares at some stage.'We feel this is an advantage of a platform like ii that chooses to access these exchanges rather than rely on CREST settled securities. Be aware however that it can take some time and there is also a possibility that in some cases it may not be possible to trade the shares depending where they are listed.'What happens if the company goes bankrupt?Things get a little more complicated if a company is delisted because it has gone bankrupt.It is very rare for a large public company to delist because of bankruptcy but it has happened and it can be confusing.Susannah Streeter  Hargreaves Lansdown's senior investment and markets analyst said: 'If a company is delisted because it's gone bankrupt  gone into liquidation or into administration  it doesn't always mean the end of the road for shareholders  as in some cases  a company can emerge from this situation and resume trading.'However  for the most part  the shares will be cancelled  meaning shareholders get no return on their investment.'Usually  an insolvent business will go into administration and a consulting or accounting firm is appointed to manage the company and settle its remaining debts.The administrators distribute the remaining assets to pay off the debts but shareholders tend to be at the bottom of the pile. Secured creditors like banks and institutional lenders  unpaid employees and suppliers are paid before investors.'Unfortunately  the shareholders of a company that's gone bust will find themselves at the bottom of the list of debtors  meaning that quite often they don't get anything back at all ' says Streeter.The outcome is dependent on how much the company is worth and how much debt it has accrued. If the assets are smaller than the debt pile the creditors take everything and can shut down the business or continue as a new private company owned entirely by the creditors.If the assets are greater than the debt the creditors get paid and shareholders get the value of anything left over in cash.A company might survive and issue new stock but it is unlikely as the debt pile tends to strip out any remaining value.Streeter adds: 'Debenhams' shareholders had their investments wiped out when the company fell into administration  and there was a domino effect for shareholders of Sports Direct International  now Frasers Group  given the company's 30 per cent stake in the business evaporated.'Shareholders in Patisserie Valerie also saw their holdings eaten up after it collapsed. It represented a double blow  given that just months before institutional investors in the company had stumped up ¬£15million in an emergency fundraising round in a bid to keep it afloat.'What happens if the shares are suspended?In extraordinary circumstances  trading in shares of certain companies is suspended.This is usually because the Financial Conduct Authority thinks it is necessary to protect investors or the company has failed to meet its obligations including publishing financial information.You maintain your shareholder rights if shares are suspended but you will be unable to execute or place any trades for the company.Recently the LSE suspended trading in 27 companies with links to Russia  including energy and banking firms Gazprom and Sberbank.AJ Bell told us that with suspended shares  such as Evraz or other Russian-linked stocks  the holdings will show in customer portfolios  valued at the price the stock was suspended at.Hargreaves Lansdown added: 'If a company's shares have been suspended  it won't be possible to trade.

2236,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2022/04/04/business/financial-markets/tse-overhaul-issues/,Tokyo stock market needs more than a shake-up to lure foreign investors,Investors and market observers say they find a recent shake-up less than attractive  saying they are looking more for companies that create innovations to stand out among global competitors.,The Tokyo stock market is trumpeting its largest overhaul in decades to lure more foreign investors. Still  the bourse is missing something such investors have long awaited ‚Äî companies with great growth potential.Its operator  Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc.  on Monday reorganized its four trading sections into three ‚Äî Prime  Standard and Growth ‚Äî for the roughly 3 800 listed companies to be categorized under more distinctive rules to sharpen the focus of each market.The reform came as Japan tries to cement a foothold for the Tokyo market as an international financial hub after its reputation was tarnished by a trading system failure in 2020 that caused an unprecedented full-day trade halt. The setback came in stark contrast to the rise in its U.S. and some Asian peers.Investors and market observers say they find the shake-up less than attractive  saying they are looking more for companies that create innovations to stand out among global competitors than for improving market availability.‚ÄúThere is definitely sentiment among investors that there are markets in other Asian countries with many attractive companies ‚Äù said Hidetaka Kawakita  an honorary professor at Kyoto University who specializes in stock market analysis. ‚ÄúCompared to them  Japanese companies seem to boast little growth and little increase in stock value.‚ÄùThe reorganization is designed to specify the concepts of each of the three new sections to make it more convenient for investors to pick which stocks to buy. The operator also aims to encourage listed companies to pursue growth more persistently and strengthen governance to raise their corporate value  by imposing higher requirements for market capitalization and outside directors.The TSE last carried out a large-scale restructuring of its trading sections in 1961 when it introduced the First Section and Second Section.The top-tier Prime section  equivalent to the former First Section  is made up of 1 839 companies  or over 80% of the total listed on the previous leading section  and centers on inviting global investors.A company in the new top division must have floating shares worth at least ¬•10 billion ($81.6 million) that account for 35% or more of its outstanding shares.About 300 companies have yet to meet the listing criteria for the Prime section  stricter than for the Standard section for midsize firms and Growth section for up-and-comers. But their shares can be traded in the section  pending improvement in operations based on business plans they submitted to the bourse prior to the market section revamp.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more cosmetic than anything else ‚Äù said Masakazu Takeda  a portfolio manager of Hennessy Japan Fund  which manages a total asset of about $801 million as of December and is run by California-based Hennessy Funds.‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the point if you have 2 000 plus companies on the First Section of the TSE and a few years down the road you still have roughly the same number of listed names?‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not going to help foreign investors sift through the universe.‚ÄùForeign investors are of great importance to the TSE  making up about 70% of the trading value on the former First Section.According to data by the World Federation of Exchanges  the Tokyo Stock Exchange had a market capitalization of domestic shares worth $6.17 trillion as of February. The value came fifth among global stock exchanges but makes up only a quarter of the New York Stock Exchange  the world‚Äôs largest bourse home to names like Visa Inc.  Johnson & Johnson and Coca-Cola Co.The Tokyo bourse was also behind the U.S. Nasdaq stock market  home to the tech giants known as GAFA including Google LLC and Apple Inc.  the Shanghai Stock Exchange and the Euronext  a pan-European bourse.The reorganization ‚Äúis not a solution for this  and not hitting a right point at all. A sense of urgency to change is what is missing in Japan ‚Äù Masakazu Hosomizu  partner and portfolio manager at U.S. firm RMB Capital  said.He said that foreign investors pour their capital in high-quality Japanese companies that meet their own criteria in areas such as corporate governance and capital efficiency.Toyota Motor Corp.  the world‚Äôs largest automaker by volume  had its market capitalization briefly top ¬•40 trillion or about $330 billion for the first time in January  ahead of other global names in Japan like Sony Group Corp. and SoftBank Group Corp.But it was still far behind Apple that became the world‚Äôs first company to top $3 trillion in January or U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc. with over $1 trillion in market capitalization.Kyoto University‚Äôs Kawakita sees the reorganization as a ‚Äúfine-tuning‚Äù rather than a reform but a ‚Äúfirst step‚Äù in creating change in the Japanese market.He said he hopes the bourse will go on to implement tougher standards for listed companies in the future  such as requiring a market capitalization of ¬•100 billion to have major Japanese companies understand that they cannot stay on the top tier without growth.Hosomizu at RMB Capital said that the TSE should impose tighter listing rules to prompt companies to bolster corporate governance and the monitoring of their management. The TSE could demand hiring more outside directors than the current one-third of the board members required of companies on the Prime section.Akira Kiyota  the chief executive of Japan Exchange Group Inc.  the parent of the TSE  expects the shake-up and stricter requirements to incentivize listed companies to improve their corporate value.‚ÄúI have high expectations that this reform will be a motivator for companies to work on their corporate value ‚Äù he said at a regular press conference last week. ‚ÄúI would like to see the Prime market consist of companies that can attract global investors as its concept states.‚ÄùPHOTO GALLERY (CLICK TO ENLARGE),neutral,0.08,0.57,0.35,mixed,0.08,0.18,0.74,True,English,"['Tokyo stock market', 'foreign investors', 'shake-up', 'U.S. electric carmaker Tesla Inc.', 'U.S. Nasdaq stock market', 'unprecedented full-day trade halt', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Tokyo Stock Exchange Inc.', 'The Tokyo stock market', 'U.S. firm', 'Shanghai Stock Exchange', 'international financial hub', 'California-based Hennessy Funds', 'Toyota Motor Corp.', 'Sony Group Corp.', 'SoftBank Group Corp', 'new top division', 'stock market analysis', 'trading system failure', 'other Asian countries', 'previous leading section', 'four trading sections', 'three new sections', 'tighter listing rules', 'global stock exchanges', 'many attractive companies', 'The Tokyo bourse', 'former First Section', 'Hennessy Japan Fund', 'high-quality Japanese companies', 'major Japanese companies', 'top-tier Prime section', 'great growth potential', 'other global names', 'Tokyo market', 'Visa Inc.', 'stock value', 'Apple Inc.', 'Japanese market', 'market section', 'distinctive rules', 'Asian peers', 'global competitors', 'great importance', 'top tier', 'market observers', 'market availability', 'market capitalization', 'first time', 'first step', 'The TSE', 'Second Section', 'trading value', 'global investors', 'largest overhaul', 'stark contrast', 'honorary professor', 'Kyoto University', 'little increase', 'higher requirements', 'outside directors', 'large-scale restructuring', 'listing criteria', 'midsize firms', 'business plans', 'Masakazu Takeda', 'portfolio manager', 'same number', 'Coca-Cola Co', 'tech giants', 'Google LLC', 'largest automaker', 'tougher standards', '3,800 listed companies', 'Growth section', '2,000 plus companies', 'first company', 'corporate value', 'floating shares', 'outstanding shares', 'Standard section', 'domestic shares', 'RMB Capital', 'capital efficiency', 'little growth', 'largest bourse', 'pan-European bourse', 'foreign investors', 'Hidetaka Kawakita', 'total asset', 'right point', 'Masakazu Hosomizu', 'corporate governance', 'World Federation', '1,839 companies', '300 companies', 'decades', 'something', 'operator', 'Monday', 'focus', 'reform', 'foothold', 'reputation', 'setback', 'rise', 'shake-up', 'innovations', 'sentiment', 'markets', 'reorganization', 'concepts', 'stocks', 'comers', 'improvement', 'operations', 'December', 'road', 'universe', 'data', 'February', 'quarter', 'Johnson', 'GAFA', 'Euronext', 'solution', 'sense', 'urgency', 'partner', 'areas', 'volume', 'January', 'fine-tuning', 'future']",2022-04-04,2022-04-05,japantimes.co.jp

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent¬Æ (dupilumab) 300 mg weekly to treat adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years and older with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  a chronic and progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and impairs the ability to swallow. The target action date for the FDA decision on this investigational use is August 3  2022.The sBLA is supported by data from two Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent 300 mg weekly in patients aged 12 years and older with EoE (Part A and Part B)  and data from an active long-term extension trial. Dupixent 300 mg weekly significantly improved the signs and symptoms of EoE at 24 weeks compared to placebo  including the ability to swallow and reduction in eosinophil count in the esophagus. The safety results of these trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common adverse event observed with Dupixent  in Part A and Part B  was injection site reactions.In September 2020  the U.S. FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with EoE. Dupixent was also granted Orphan Drug designation for the potential treatment of EoE in 2017. Priority review is granted to therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions. Regulatory filings around the world are also planned in 2022. The potential use of Dupixent in EoE is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE)EoE is a chronic  progressive type 2 inflammatory disease that damages the esophagus and prevents it from working properly. For people with EoE  swallowing the smallest amount of food can be a painful and worrisome choking experience. Those with EoE live with anxiety and frustration from having a constantly evolving list of foods to avoid. This disease can also cause narrowing of the esophagus and dilation (physical expansion) of the esophagus may be needed  which is often painful. In severe cases  a feeding tube is the only option to ensure proper caloric intake and adequate nutrition. People with EoE may have poor quality of life and are more likely to experience depression than people without EoE. There are approximately 160 000 patients in the U.S. living with EoE who are currently treated  of whom approximately 48 000 have failed multiple treatments.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune¬Æ technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. By demonstrating significant clinical benefit together with a decrease in type 2 inflammation following IL-4 and IL-13 blockade with Dupixent  the Dupixent Phase 3 clinical program has established that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases for which Dupixent is approved including atopic dermatitis  asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  as well as investigational diseases such as EoE and prurigo nodularis  which have been studied in Phase 3 trials.In the U.S.  Dupixent is approved in patients aged 6 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis; as an add-on maintenance treatment of patients aged 6 years and older with moderate-to-severe asthma characterized by an eosinophilic phenotype or with oral corticosteroid-dependent asthma; and for use with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled.Dupixent is also approved in Europe  Japan and other countries around the world for use in specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis and certain patients with asthma or CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world  and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite¬Æ technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV¬Æ (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo¬Æ (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent¬Æ (alirocumab)  Kevzara¬Æ (sarilumab)  Evkeeza¬Æ (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb‚Ñ¢ (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes  including eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

The proposition is in accordance with the board of director's recommendation.The board of directors' proposal on a share issue authorization (item 18)The board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize to the board  up and until the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without pre-emptive rights for shareholders  to resolve on the issue of new shares of series B  comprising a total of not more than 20 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the company after the utilization of the authorization. It shall also be possible to make such an issue resolution stipulating in-kind payment  the right to offset debt or other conditions referred to in Chapter 13 Section 5 first paragraph item 6 in the Swedish Companies Act.The purpose of the authorization is to provide flexibility to the board in its work to ensure that the company can appropriately raise capital for the financing of the business. Issuances of new shares under the authorization shall be made on market terms.The board of directors' proposal for resolution on the issue of warrants of series 2022:1 (item 19)The board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants and to approve of transfer of the warrants in accordance with the following.Issue of warrantsThe board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to carry out a directed issue of not more than 850 000 warrants  entailing an increase in the share capital of not more than SEK 425 000 at full subscription. The resolution shall otherwise be governed by the following terms and conditions.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  be vested in the company's wholly owned subsidiary Medivir Personal AB  Reg. no. 556598-2823 (the ""Subsidiary"")  with the right and obligation for the Subsidiary to transfer the warrants to employees pursuant to the below. Over-subscription is not possible.The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights are to stimulate shareholding in the company by virtue of an incentive program through which employees can take part of and contribute to a positive value increase of the company's share during the period of the proposed program  and that the company shall be able to retain and recruit competent and dedicated staff.The warrants shall be issued at no consideration. Subscription must be completed no later than three weeks after the resolution on issue of warrants. The board shall be entitled to extend the subscription period.Each warrant entitles a right to subscribe for one share of series B in the company. The warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new series B shares during the period from and including 1 December 2025 up to and including 15 December 2025. The new shares which may be issued due to subscription are not subject to any restrictive provisions.The subscription price (strike price) shall be established by the company  or by an independent appraiser or auditor firm retained by the company  and correspond to 175 per cent of the volume weighted average price of the series B share according the official share list of Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days immediately preceding the offer to subscribe for warrants  however not less than the quota value of the shares. The amount of the subscription price exceeding the quota value of the shares shall be contributed to the free share premium reserve.Shares which are newly issued following subscription by virtue of the warrants shall carry an entitlement to participate in dividends for the first time on the next record date for dividends which occurs after subscription for shares by virtue of the utilization of the warrants is effected.The company may  by means of a board resolution and with the consent from the board of directors in the Subsidiary  cancel the Subsidiary's warrants that are not transferred in accordance with the below or that have been re-purchased from participants. Cancellation shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  is authorized to make such minor adjustments to the resolution which may prove necessary in order to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Approval of transfer of warrantsThe board proposes that the general meeting approves of the Subsidiary's transfer of warrants on the following conditions.The right to subscribe for share warrants from the Subsidiary shall vest in the following categories of employees:Category Maximum number of warrants per person Maximum number of warrants per category A. Managing director (not more than 1 person) 300 000 300 000 B. Other members of the executive management(not more than 4 persons) 100 000 400 000 C. Other employees (not more than 6 persons) 25 000 150 000The right to purchase warrants from the Subsidiary shall only vest in employees who  at the end of the application period  have not terminated their employment  have not had their employment terminated or otherwise have given notice  or been notified  of employment termination.Warrants may also be offered to future employees. For such acquisitions  the conditions shall be the same or equivalent to what is stated in this resolution. This means  inter alia  that acquisitions shall be made to the market value at the time of the acquisition.Transfer of warrants to participants is conditional upon it being legally possible to purchase the warrants  and that such transfers can be done using reasonable administrative and financial resources according to the assessment of the board.Application and allotmentApplication for acquisition of warrants shall be made during the period from and including 15 May 2022 up until and including 22 May 2022. The board of the company shall however be entitled to extend the application period for acquisitions and to set a corresponding application period for new employees whose acquisitions are made after the expiration of the initial application period.Medivir shall  in connection with the allocation of the warrants to the participants in the program  and with certain exceptions  reserve a repurchase right regarding the warrants if the participant's employment or assignment within the group is terminated or if the participant wishes to transfer his/her warrants prior to the warrants being exercisable.Should warrants of a certain category remain with the Subsidiary after all applications within the category have been satisfied  the remaining warrants shall be available for allotment to participants in that same or another category whereby the board shall determine the distribution based on participant category  employment category and the number of warrants applied for. However  such distribution must not result in the maximum amount of warrants per person in a certain category being exceeded by more than 50 per cent.The board of the company shall determine the final allotment and the date of the transfer of the warrants. The transfer of warrants may be made up until and including 31 December 2021.Price and payment etc.The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price (premium) established on the basis of a market value of the warrants calculated by an independent valuation institute using the Black & Scholes valuation model. A new market value shall be established in an equivalent way for acquisitions made by new employees after the expiration of the initial application period. The value has preliminary been calculated to be SEK 1.34 per warrant based on a share price of SEK 8.Payment for the allocated warrants shall be made in cash no later than five days following the application for acquisition. The board shall establish a corresponding date of payment for acquisitions made by new employees.Medivir will partly subsidize the participant's acquisition of warrants. The subsidy shall be paid in connection with the allocation of warrants to the participants. The total subsidy granted to the participant shall correspond to half of the participant's investment (after deduction of any income tax of the participant). The total cost for the subsidy  based on the above preliminary value of the warrants  is estimated at SEK 1 740 551 for the entire term of the warrant programme of three years  including any social security contributions.In order to be eligible for the subsidy  the participant must  at the time of the payment of the bonus  not have been dismissed (Sw. avskedad )  terminated his/her employment or given notice of employment termination  remain employed in the company for three years  or the subsidy will  with certain exceptions  be prorated  and must not have transferred his/her warrants.Further information on the warrant programDilutionUpon full exercise of all warrants  850 000 new shares can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.5 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the company  however  subject to any potential adjustment which may occur under the terms and conditions for the warrants. Accordingly  the program offers the employees the possibility to increase their shareholding in the company to the corresponding figure.Impact of financial ratio and costs for the company etc.The company's earnings per share are not affected by the issue of the warrants as the present value of the warrants' strike price exceeds the current market value of the share at the date of issue. Since the warrants are transferred to the participants at market value it is not expected that the company will incur any personnel costs. The warrant program will incur costs in relation to the subsidy that the participants are entitled to. Such costs amount to a maximum of SEK 1 740 551 for the entire term of the warrant program of three years. The warrant program may also incur certain limited costs in terms of external consulting fees and costs relating to the administration of the warrant program.Preparation of the matterThe principles of the warrant program have been prepared by the board of the company and are based on the warrant programs adopted by the annual general meetings 2020 and 2021. The board has thereafter decided to submit this proposal to the annual general meeting. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Other share related incentive programs etc.Except from the current proposal to issue warrants and the warrant programs resolved upon at the annual general meetings 2020 and 2021  the company has no outstanding share related incentive programs. It is the board's intention that the program shall recur annually  albeit in varying sizes.Authorization for the board of directorsThe board proposes that the meeting authorizes the board to execute the resolution in accordance with the above and to ensure that the Subsidiary's board of directors carries out the transfer of the warrants in accordance with the above.Majority requirementsA decision according to the proposal pursuant to item 18 above is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the annual general meeting. A decision according to the proposal pursuant to item 19 above is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the annual general meeting.DocumentationThe annual report  the remuneration report and other supporting documentation for resolutions will be available at the company's offices  Medivir AB  Lunastigen 5  SE-141 22 Huddinge  Sweden no later than three weeks prior to the meeting.

The guidelines shall be applied to remuneration agreed and changes to previously agreed remuneration  after the guidelines have been adopted by the Annual General Meeting. The guidelines do not apply to remuneration resolved by the Annual General Meeting.The guidelines‚Äô promotion of IBT‚Äôs business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityIBT develops  and intends to market and sell  safe and efficacious therapies that affect infants‚Äô microbiome and thereby prevent or treat rare diseases that affects premature infants. For more information on IBT‚Äôs business strategy  see the annual report.Successful implementation of the business strategy and safeguarding IBT‚Äôs long-term interests  including its sustainability  require IBT to be able to recruit  motivate and retain competent employees who work to achieve maximum shareholder and customer value. This requires IBT to be able to offer competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable senior executives to be offered competitive total remuneration.Forms of remuneration  etc.Remuneration shall be market-based and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. The Annual General Meeting may in addition ‚Äì and independent of these guidelines ‚Äì resolve on for example share-related and share-price based remuneration. The total remuneration package to senior executives should include a well-balanced mix of the above-named components as well as terms of notice and severance pay. The Board should annually evaluate the extent to which share-based or share-price based long-term incentive programmes should be proposed to the Annual General Meeting.The fixed cash salary shall be individual and based on the senior executive‚Äôs responsibilities and role as well as the individual‚Äôs competence and experience in the relevant position.The variable cash remuneration may amount to a maximum of 40 percent of fixed annual cash salary.Senior executives who are entitled to pensions shall have pension benefits that are defined contribution. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits. Pension premiums for defined contribution pensions shall amount to a maximum of 33 percent of fixed annual cash salary.Other benefits may include life insurance  health insurance (Sw: sjukv√•rdsf√∂rs√§kring) and a company car benefit. Such benefits shall be of limited value in relation to other compensation and be consistent with what is customary in the respective geographical market. Other benefits may amount to a maximum of 5 percent of fixed annual cash salary.Termination of employmentIn the event of termination of employment by the company the maximum notice period is six months. Fixed cash salary during the notice period plus any severance pay may not together exceed an amount equivalent to the individual‚Äôs fixed cash salary for a one-year period. In case of termination by the senior executive  the notice period may not be less than three months and no severance pay will be paid.Criteria for distribution of variable cash remuneration  etc.Variable cash remuneration shall be linked to pre-determined and measurable criteria which may be financial or non-financial. It can also comprise individually adapted quantitative or qualitative targets. The criteria shall be designed so that they promote the Group‚Äôs business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  through for example having a clear link to IBT‚Äôs business strategy or promoting the senior executive‚Äôs long-term development.Fulfilment of the criteria for payment of variable cash remuneration shall be measured during a period of one year. When the measurement period for fulfilment of the criteria for payment of variable cash remuneration has ended  the extent to which the criteria have been met shall be determined. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for assessment with regard to variable cash remuneration to the CEO. As regards variable cash remuneration to other senior executives  the CEO is responsible for the assessment.Salary and terms of employment for employeesIn preparation of the Board‚Äôs proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salaries and terms of employment for the company‚Äôs employees have been taken into account through information on employees‚Äô total remuneration  remuneration components as well as remuneration increases and rate of increase over time comprising a part of the Remuneration Committee‚Äôs and the Board‚Äôs basis for decision when evaluating the reasonableness of these guidelines and the limitations that are a consequence of them.Decision-making process to establish  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board has established a Remuneration Committee. The tasks of the committee include preparation of the Board‚Äôs proposal for decision on guidelines for remuneration to senior executives. The Board shall prepare proposals for new guidelines at least every fourth year and present the proposal for decision to the Annual General Meeting. The guidelines shall apply until new guidelines are adopted by the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programmes for variable remuneration to senior executives  application of the guidelines for remuneration to senior executives as well as applicable remuneration structures and remuneration levels in the Group. When the Board considers and makes decisions on remuneration-related matters  the CEO or other senior executives are not present insofar as they are affected by the issues.Departure from the guidelinesThe Board may decide temporarily to depart from the guidelines wholly or partly if in an individual case there is reason for this and such departure is necessary in order to meet IBT‚Äôs long-term interests  including its sustainability  or in order to ensure IBT‚Äôs financial viability. As stated above  the tasks of the Remuneration Committee include preparing the Board‚Äôs decision on remuneration matters  which includes decisions to depart from the guidelines.Description of material changes to the guidelines and how the views of shareholders‚Äô have been taken into considerationIn the proposal for guidelines submitted at the 2022 Annual General Meeting  the maximum amount for variable cash remuneration has been raised from 30 percent to 40 percent of the fixed annual cash salary. IBT has not received any views from shareholders to take into consideration in the preparation of this proposal.Item 16 ‚Äì The Board‚Äôs proposal for a resolution regarding authorization for new issuance of sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting approve that the Board of Directors have a mandate to  on one or more occasion until the next Annual General Meeting  issue new B-class shares. The Board of Directors will be able to decide on a new issuance of shares with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô pre-emption rights. This authorisation is to include the right to issue shares with cash payment  payment by contribution in kind or payment by way of set-off  and otherwise subject to conditions as set out in Chapter 13  Section 5  first paragraph 6 of the Swedish Companies Act.The decision by the Board of Directors in relation to a new share issue that deviates from shareholders‚Äô pre-emption rights (directed issue) shall not exceed a twenty percent increase in share capital in relation to the share capital when the mandate for new issue is first utilised by the Board of Directors.The share issue under this authorization shall be on market terms. The Board shall have the right to determine the conditions of the issue under this authorization as well as mandate to determine who has the right to subscribe for shares. The purpose of the authorization is to provide the Board with flexibility in efforts to ensure that the company in an appropriate manner  has additional capital to finance the company‚Äôs ongoing clinical activities  and to enable a broadening of the owner base of the company.Item 17 ‚Äì The Board‚Äôs proposal for a resolution regarding implementation of an incentive programThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt an incentive program for the company‚Äôs employees and key persons engaged as consultants via i) a directed issue of warrants to the company or its wholly owned subsidiary IBT Baby AB  Reg. No 559110-7353 (the ‚ÄúSubsidiary‚Äù)  and ii) approval of transfer of warrants to participants in the incentive program. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new B-share in the company.The Board of Directors believes that it is important and in the interest of all shareholders that the employees and other key persons  who are deemed to be important for the company‚Äôs further development  have a long-term interest in a good value increase of the company‚Äôs shares. A personal long-term ownership commitment can be expected to contribute to an increased interest in the company‚Äôs operations and earnings and raise the participants‚Äô motivation and connection with the company and its shareholders.Based on the existing number of shares in the company  the dilution resulting from the proposed incentive program  assuming that all warrants are exercised for subscription of new B-shares  will be approximately 2.64 percent of the shares and approximately 2.04 percent of the votes. The percentage dilution in respect of the shares has been calculated according to the following formula: 1-(existing number of shares/new number of shares)  and in respect of the votes according to the following formula: 1-(existing number of votes/new number of votes). This calculation does not consider already outstanding warrants in the incentive programs that were implemented in 2017 and 2020  respectively. The dilution is expected to have a limited effect on the company‚Äôs key performance indicators.This proposal has been prepared by the remuneration committee and thereafter by the Board of Directors in consultation with external advisors. The resigning board member Robert Molander is a part of the executive management and has not participated in the Board‚Äôs handling of or decision in the matter.Directed issue of warrants to the company or the SubsidiaryThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed issue of a maximum of 304 500 warrants on the following terms:The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders‚Äô preferential rights  belong to the company or the Subsidiary. Over-subscription can not occur.The reason for the deviation from shareholders‚Äô preferential rights is that the issue is a part of the implementation of the incentive program  with which the company‚Äôs employees and other key persons are given the opportunity to take part in a positive development in the company. The existence of such a program is expected to increase the company‚Äôs ability to attract and retain qualified employees.Subscription of the warrants shall be made through subscription on a subscription list no later than May 13  2022. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period.The warrants are issued free of charge.Each warrant will entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new B-share in the company at a subscription price corresponding to 200 percent of the volume-weighted average price of the company‚Äôs share according to Nasdaq Stockholm‚Äôs official price list during the period ten (10) trading days before May 4  2022. Any share premium shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve.Subscription of B-shares by exercise of warrants shall be made in accordance with the terms of the warrants from June 1  2025 up to and including September 30  2025.If all warrants are exercised for subscription of B-shares  the company‚Äôs registered share capital will increase by 82 990.560062 SEK (given current quota value and provided that no recalculation is carried out pursuant to the warrant terms).B-shares issued as a result of subscription shall entitle to dividends on the dividend record date occurring after the share capital is registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) and B-shares have been recorded in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB.The warrants will otherwise be subject to customary terms regarding inter alia recalculation  which are included in the board‚Äôs complete proposal.Approval of transfer of warrants from the Subsidiary to participants in the incentive programThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the company or the Subsidiary transfers a maximum of 304 500 warrants to the company‚Äôs CEO  senior executives and other employees and key persons engaged as consultants  or to companies wholly owned by such persons  according to the following principles.Category A ‚Äì CEO: the CEO may be allotted a maximum of 120 000 warrants.Category B ‚Äì other senior executives: participants in this category may be allotted a maximum of 115 000 warrants collectively and each participant in the category may be allotted a maximum of 75 000 warrants individually.Category C ‚Äì other employees: participants in this category may be allotted a maximum of 69 500 warrants collectively and each participant may be allotted a maximum of 20 000 warrants individually.The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price established on the basis of an estimated market value of the warrants at the time of the transfer by applying the Black & Scholes valuation model (option premium). Calculation of the option premium shall be performed by an independent valuation expert.In order to enable the participants acquisition of the warrants  the board may decide on an extra bonus payment which net after deduction for taxes and social security contributions is equivalent to 100% of the option premium.In addition  a so-called pre-emption agreement shall be entered into  pursuant to which the warrant holder shall be obliged to offer the company or the Subsidiary to acquire the warrants  or a portion of them  under certain conditions.Transfer of warrants to participants in the incentive program requires that such transfer may be lawfully made and that it  according to the Board of Directors‚Äô assessment  may be made to reasonable administrative costs.The employees who are entitled to acquire warrants must notify their intention to acquire warrants during the period from May 16  2022 up to and including May 31  2022. However  the Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the time for such notification and to resolve on a new notification period for employees whose acquisitions occur after the initial acquisition period has ended.Costs for the incentive programThe incentive program has been prepared in consultation with external legal and financial advisers and the costs for this guidance is estimated to amount to a maximum of SEK 80 000. The company‚Äôs costs for bonus payments to cover the option premium is expected to amount to approximately SEK 4 800 000.In addition to the costs stated above  the Board of Directors deems that the incentive program will cause certain administrative costs in connection with registration  transfer and share subscription by exercise of warrants.Other outstanding share-related incentive programs in the companyWarrant program 2017/2022On May 4  2017  the Annual General Meeting decided on an incentive program by a directed issue of warrants to the Subsidiary. The number of issued warrants is 280 000. In total 260 000 warrants have been transferred to employees. The transfers have been carried out on market terms at a price determined at the time of the transfers by applying the Black & Scholes method of valuation.The holder of warrants may  during the period from April 3  2022 up to and including May 3  2022  for each warrant subscribe for one and one tenth (1.1) new B-share in the company at a subscription price per share amounting to SEK 272.41 (a recalculation of the terms has taken place due to share issues in November 2017 and January 2018).Warrant program 2020/2024On June 16  2020  the Annual General Meeting decided on an incentive program by a directed issue of warrants to the Subsidiary. The number of issued warrants is 375 000. In total 244 073 warrants have been transferred to employees. The transfers have been carried out on market terms at a price determined at the time of the transfers by applying the Black & Scholes method of valuation.The holder of warrants may  during the period from July 1  2024 up to and including September 30  2024  for each warrant subscribe for one (1) new B-share in the company at a subscription price per share amounting to SEK 400.There are no other share-based incentive programs in the company.Majority requirementsThe resolutions above are conditional on each other and are therefore to be adopted jointly. A valid resolution requires approval of shareholders representing at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.OtherThe CEO  or any other person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to take those smaller measures that may be required in order to register and implement the resolution.Further informationAvailable documentation and proxy formsThe annual report and other complete documentation will be made available at the company and on www.ibtherapeutics.com no later than three weeks before the Meeting and will be sent free of charge to all shareholders who so request and provide their postal address.

Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations include: commodity price fluctuations; uncertainty with the estimates of the quantities and quality of reserves and resources; risks related to the Company's ability to continue production and generate revenues; risks related to the disruption of infrastructure; risks related to political instability in Kurdistan; risks related to dependence on third parties for the development of projects; equipment breakdowns  labour disputes  non-compliance with permit requirements or other unanticipated difficulties with or interruptions in development; the uncertainties involving the economic viability of developing contingent or prospective resources in the Atrush block and the Sarsang block (following completion of the Sarsang acquisition); risks pertaining to the outbreak of the global pandemics  including COVID-19; government regulation of operations; environmental risks; prices for energy inputs  labour  materials  supplies and services; and risks associated with the validity of petroleum contracts in Kurdistan. In particular  these statements involve assumptions made with regard to the Company's ability to close the Sarsang Acquisition  the commercial viability of the Atrush and Sarsang block  the future demand and prices pertaining to oil and gas  the timely payment for oil deliveries from the KRG and that neither the Federal Government of Iraq¬¥s court decision implying that the KRG's production sharing contracts should be voided or amended  nor the KRG¬¥s order for the cessation of flaring  will be enforced in ways that will have a significant negative impact on ShaMaran¬¥s operations. The Company's Forward-Looking Statements reflect the beliefs  opinions  and projections on the date the statements are made. The Company assumes no obligation to update the Forward-Looking Statements or beliefs  opinions  projections  or other factors  should they change  except as required by law.The Covid-19 virus and the restrictions and disruptions related to it have had a drastic adverse effect on the world demand for  and prices of  oil and gas as well as the market price of the shares of oil and gas companies generally  including the Company's Shares. There can be no assurance that these adverse effects will not continue or that commodity prices will not decrease or remain volatile in the future. These factors are beyond the control of ShaMaran and it is difficult to assess how these  and other factors  will continue to affect the Company and the market price of ShaMaran's Shares. In light of the current situation  as at the date of this news release  the Company continues to review and assess its business plans and assumptions regarding the business environment  as well as its estimates of future production  cash flows  operating costs  and capital expenditures.ABOUT SHAMARANShaMaran is a Kurdistan focused oil development and exploration company which holds a 27.6% interest  through its wholly-owned subsidiary General Exploration Partners  Inc.  in the Atrush Block and as announced in the Company's news release of July 12  2021 upon successful closing of the acquisition from a TotalEnergies' affiliate will then also hold an 18% interest through its then wholly-owned subsidiary TEPKRI Sarsang A/S in the Sarsang Block.ShaMaran is a Canadian oil and gas company listed on the TSX-V and the Nasdaq First North under the symbol ""SNM"" and is part of the ""Lundin Group of Companies"".Follow us on Social Media:Instagram: @shamaranpetroleumcorpTwitter: @shamaran_corpFacebook: @shamaranpetroleumcorpSOURCE ShaMaran Petroleum Corp.For further information: ShaMaran Investor Relations: [email protected]; Sophia Shane  Corporate Development  Canada  +1 604 806 3575  [email protected]; Robert Eriksson  Investor Relations  Sweden  +46 701 112615",positive,0.49,0.31,0.2,mixed,0.25,0.3,0.45,True,English,"['SHAMARAN ANNOUNCES', 'MAJOR SHAREHOLDER', 'IMPORTANT NOTICE', 'SHAMARAN SHARES', 'EUROCLEAR SWEDEN', 'RIGHTS', 'UNDERWRITTEN', 'HOLDERS', 'Nasdaq First North Growth Market', 'Investments S.√†.r.l.', 'Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority', 'Subsidi√§r teckning', 'Dr. Adel Chaouch', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'TSX Venture Exchange', 'pro rata basis', 'Standby Commitment Agreement', 'Basic Subscription Privilege', 'The Standby Purchaser', 'related party rules', 'Additional Subscription Privilege', 'Minority Security Holders', 'applicable prospectus requirements', 'total outstanding Shares', 'The Rights Offering', 'rights offering notice', 'Rights Offering Circular', 'ShaMaran Common Shares', 'one (1) ShaMaran Share', 'Swedish prospectus', 'subscription price', 'applicable legislation', 'subscription period', 'The Prospectus', 'additional Shares', 'Four (4) Rights', 'rights offerings', 'next steps', 'Eligible Jurisdiction', 'one (1) right', 'United Kingdom', 'final approval', 'Zebra Holdings', 'equity securities', 'other Rightsholders', 'other remuneration', 'Multilateral Instrument', 'Special Transactions', 'joint actor', 'Eastern time', 'Eligible Holders', 'Euroclear Sweden', 'Ineligible Shareholder', 'SNM.TR', 'Record Date', 'shareholders', 'President', 'launch', 'Company', 'benefit', 'Terms', 'close', 'business', 'April', 'payment', 'CAD', 'SEK', 'provinces', 'territories', 'Canada', 'accordance', 'exemptions', 'Norway', 'Denmark', 'Finland', 'France', 'Netherlands', 'Luxembourg', 'Details', 'website', 'shamaranpetroleum', 'profile', 'SEDAR', 'satisfaction', 'information', 'fee', 'undertaking', 'Protection', 'exception', 'trading', 'TSX-V', 'symbol', 'Stockholm', 'mailing', 'CET', 'May', 'termination', 'expiry', 'value', 'exercise', 'full', 'Sv']",2022-04-05,2022-04-05,newswire.ca

All statements  other than statements of historical fact  included herein  including  without limitation  the timing of and other procedural matters associated with the Rights Offering; the closing of the Sarsang Acquisition  final KRG approval  the anticipated use of proceeds from the Rights Offering  the successful completion of the Rights Offering  the continued listing of the Shares in the capital of the Company on NASDAQ First North and the TSX-V  liquidity and working capital  the effects of the Sarsang Acquisition on ShaMaran¬¥s business  development and prospects and the Company's business goals and objectives are Forward-Looking Statements. Forward-Looking Statements are frequently  but not always  identified by words such as ""expects""  ""anticipates""  ""believes""  ""intends""  ""estimates""  ""potential""  ""possible""  and similar expressions  or statements that events  conditions  or results ""will""  ""may""  ""could""  or ""should"" occur or be achieved.Forward-Looking Statements involve various risks and uncertainties. There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate  and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations include: commodity price fluctuations; uncertainty with the estimates of the quantities and quality of reserves and resources; risks related to the Company's ability to continue production and generate revenues; risks related to the disruption of infrastructure; risks related to political instability in Kurdistan; risks related to dependence on third parties for the development of projects; equipment breakdowns  labour disputes  non-compliance with permit requirements or other unanticipated difficulties with or interruptions in development; the uncertainties involving the economic viability of developing contingent or prospective resources in the Atrush block and the Sarsang block (following completion of the Sarsang acquisition); risks pertaining to the outbreak of the global pandemics  including COVID-19; government regulation of operations; environmental risks; prices for energy inputs  labour  materials  supplies and services; and risks associated with the validity of petroleum contracts in Kurdistan. In particular  these statements involve assumptions made with regard to the Company's ability to close the Sarsang Acquisition  the commercial viability of the Atrush and Sarsang block  the future demand and prices pertaining to oil and gas  the timely payment for oil deliveries from the KRG and that neither the Federal Government of Iraq¬¥s court decision implying that the KRG's production sharing contracts should be voided or amended  nor the KRG¬¥s order for the cessation of flaring  will be enforced in ways that will have a significant negative impact on ShaMaran¬¥s operations. The Company's Forward-Looking Statements reflect the beliefs  opinions  and projections on the date the statements are made. The Company assumes no obligation to update the Forward-Looking Statements or beliefs  opinions  projections  or other factors  should they change  except as required by law.The Covid-19 virus and the restrictions and disruptions related to it have had a drastic adverse effect on the world demand for  and prices of  oil and gas as well as the market price of the shares of oil and gas companies generally  including the Company's Shares.

For pet care companies  this has meant big business.‚ÄùEMRJ tracks the Foxberry Emerging Market Internet & Ecommerce index of 57 companies involved in digital commerce and online marketplaces  on-demand food  ride-hailing  social commerce  online travel  logistics and fulfilment  online search  digital advertisement digital media  video gaming and entertainment.Like PETZ  EMRJ‚Äôs index only captures companies deriving at least 20% of their revenues from its desired theme. Companies must also have a minimum market cap of $500m  a daily trading volume above $2m. Weightings to each emerging market are also capped at 25% on index rebalance days.Stuart Forbes  co-founder and director at Rize ETF  said: ‚ÄúIn the years ahead  we are looking at two converging but mutually reinforcing megatrends: the internet as an incubator for technological innovation and ecommerce as a catalyst for behavioural change.‚ÄúOur ETF does two things.

To date  there is no suitable treatment for a serious nuclear accident. The three products are at the heart of the issues with the tragic international situation in Ukraine  raising the possibility of nuclear war. They are also topical with the recent decisions to maintain the development of nuclear power plants.Medesis Pharma's three drug candidates were developed in collaboration with the French Atomic Energy Commission (LRT-CEA)  which carried out all the studies on animals contaminated by radionuclides  and with the Armed Forces Biomedical Research Institute (IRBA) for studies on irradiated animals. Each of these products is protected by an international patent registered or in the process of being registered in most nuclear countries in the world.The therapeutic activity has been demonstrated  and a complementary program is necessary with pharmaceutical development for industrial production and a tolerance study on healthy volunteers to demonstrate safety before introducing the products into State emergency stocks.Funding requests for these 3 programs have been submitted by Medesis Pharma to the French Defense Innovation Agency.NU01: NanoCaDTPA: Plutonium decorporationFor more than 40 years  CaDTPA has been used by repeated slow IV infusion over several weeks. However  this treatment carried out in a medical environment is suitable for a few contaminated people (workers in Nuclear Power Plants)  but impossible to implement when several hundred thousand people are contaminated.NanoCaDTPA (formulation of CaDTPA in the Aonys microemulsion) makes it possible to obtain the same efficiency of extraction of Plutonium  but with simple administration in the mouth  from a bottle stored at room temperature.Story continuesNU02: NanoPB (Prussian Blue): Cesium decorporationPrussian Blue has been used for many years for the extraction of Cesium. It is administered in large capsules of 500 mg  18 capsules per day for 2 to 3 months. Impossible to dissolve  it is almost impossible to give to children and adolescents and is accompanied by obstinate constipation resulting in irradiation of the small pelvis. However  Cesium is fixed preferentially in the muscles and in particular in the heart muscle causing abnormalities and cardiac pathologies in children and adolescents.The NanoPB consists of Prussian Blue nanoparticles synthesized and stabilized in the Aonys microemulsion. It allows to obtain a decorporation of cesium 3 times faster with 100 times less Prussian Blue. It is drinkable and suitable for administration at any age  including infants and children.NP02: NanoManganeseThe active ingredient is manganese sulphate in the Aonys microemulsion. This product prevents and treats the storm of inflammatory cytokines triggered by irradiation that causes major respiratory and digestive inflammation responsible for death. Efficacy is observed if treatment is started within hours of irradiation. It is administered by mouth and stored in bottles at room temperature.This product is currently in a Phase II clinical study in Brazil to treat severe forms of COVID-19 which are also linked to an inflammatory cytokine storm.General information about a nuclear explosionDuring an explosion  a nuclear weapon first generates a ball of fire  the size of which varies with the power. A 1 kiloton bomb would thus generate a ball 60 meters in diameter causing damage up to 2 kilometers around the point of impact. A 1 000-kiloton bomb would generate a fireball of more than 1 kilometer  the impact of which could have a radius of up to 20 kilometers.Blast effect: the explosion causes a shock wave with a displacement of an air mass capable of destroying all surrounding objects. The vacuum created by the moving air then drives strong winds  similar to a cyclone or tornado;Heat: light radiation and its heat  which represent more than a third of the energy of the bomb  cause fires and burns on people;Radiation: the bomb generates direct radiation at the moment of its explosion;Radioactive pollution that can be carried by the winds over great distances by radionuclides which are absorbed by the respiratory and digestive tracts  settle in the tissues  in particular the lungs  liver  bones and heart  and will never again be eliminated and will cause cancer 10 to 15 years later.Product development PlanFor each of the two decorporation products of Plutonium and Cesium:‚Ä¢ Pharmaceutical CMC development with preparation for industrial production ‚Ä¢ Tolerance study on 50 healthy volunteers treated for one month.For the radiation protection product already in clinical development:‚Ä¢ Industrial development ‚Ä¢ Tolerance study on 50 healthy volunteers for one month.Deadlines for product registration and industrial manufacturing:‚Ä¢ 18 months for the two decorporation products‚Ä¢ 12 months for the radiation protection productIn practice  these deadlines can be shortened or extended depending on whether or not the Medicines Agency and the public authorities consider it urgent.√Ä propos de Medesis PharmaPour avancer dans le traitement des maladies graves d√©pourvues de traitement efficace  Medesis Pharma con√ßoit des candidats m√©dicaments en s‚Äôappuyant sur sa technologie propri√©taire Aonys¬Æ d‚Äôadministration de principes actifs sous forme de nano-gouttelettes par voie buccale qui rend efficace le delivery des principes actifs dans toutes les cellules  avec un passage de la Barri√®re H√©mato Enc√©phaliqueCette approche innovante est appliqu√©e √† de futurs m√©dicaments pour traiter des maladies majeures d√©pourvues de traitements efficaces : la Maladie d‚ÄôAlzheimer  la Maladie de Huntington  certains cancers r√©sistants et les inflammations respiratoires s√©v√®res comme celles li√©es √† la COVID-19.

Pivotal patients completing the six-months post-implantation period will be included in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis  and reporting of these data is planned for Q4 2022. A further 29 patients from the Roll-In Cohort were also implanted with the alfapump and will be included in the overall safety analysis.Importantly  a preliminary interim analysis1 of patient survival following alfapump implantation in the Roll-In Cohort indicated a mean survival probability of 70% at 12 months. This compares favourably with the published literature reporting a survival rate for refractory ascites patients of only 50% at 12 months.2""Completing alfapump implantations is an important milestone for our POSEIDON study given the uncertainties of hospital resource availability that still exist due to COVID  and enables us to report the primary endpoint data before the end of this year as planned ‚Äù commented Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical. ‚ÄúGiven the strong efficacy results we reported in last year's interim analysis  we are confident that these implanted patients in the Pivotal Cohort will give us sufficient statistical power for the primary efficacy endpoint. For our safety evaluation  we are including the data from the Roll-In patients which will bring the total number in that assessment to approximately 70.‚ÄùStory continues‚ÄúWe are encouraged by our preliminary interim review of patient survival with 70% of the POSEIDON Roll-In patients alive at 12 months post-implantation ‚Äù added Dr. Gijs Klarenbeek  Senior Medical Adviser of Sequana Medical. ‚ÄúWe believe that this survival data combined with the dramatic reduction in the rate of therapeutic paracentesis and the clinically relevant improvement in quality of life in the interim analysis of the first 26 Roll-in patients suggest that the alfapump is a highly attractive treatment option for this patient group that has been overlooked for too long.‚ÄùKaplan Meier ‚Äì Preliminary survival rate analysis of Roll-In Cohort   dated 25 March 2022Summary of the 2 nd i nterim a nalysis of Roll-In Cohort reported in July 2021In July 2021  the Company reported the second interim analysis on 26 patients from the Roll-In Cohort  reaffirming the previous positive efficacy results of the alfapump and providing longer-term evidence of the reduction in therapeutic paracentesis and continued improvements in quality of life. Data from this Roll-In Cohort substantially exceeded the pre-defined requirements of the primary endpoints as defined for the Pivotal Cohort in the study3  demonstrating: (i) over 90% reduction in mean frequency of therapeutic paracentesis (TP) versus baseline  (ii) all patients having at least a 50% reduction in mean frequency of TP per month versus baseline  (iii) clinically important improvement in quality of life maintained even up to 12 months post-implantation  and (iv) safety profile in line with expectations.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsTel: +32 498 05 35 79Email: IR@sequanamedical.comLifeSci AdvisorsGuillaume van RenterghemTel: +41 76 735 01 31Email: gvanrenterghem@lifesciadvisors.comAbout the POSEIDON studyPOSEIDON is a single-arm  open-label and within subject cross-over study of the alfapump in patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and is being conducted in approximately 20 centres across the U.S. and Canada. All patients have been enrolled in the study and implanted with the alfapump. Patients enrolled in the Pivotal Cohort entered into a three-month pre-implant observation period before they were implanted with the alfapump. The study allowed to enrol additional patients in a Roll-In Cohort to ensure new centres were experienced with the alfapump implantation prior to enrolling patients in the Pivotal Cohort.The primary effectiveness outcomes of the study include the proportion of patients with a 50% reduction in the overall average frequency of therapeutic paracentesis per month in the post-implant observation period (month four to month six post-implantation) as compared to the pre-implant observation period. The primary safety endpoint is the rate of alfapump-related re-interventions adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee. Patients will be followed for up to two years for analysis of secondary outcome measurements including safety (device and/or procedure-related adverse events)  quality of life (assessed by general SF36 as well as disease-specific Ascites Q questionnaires)  nutritional status  health economics and overall survival.

Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases ‚Äì including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure ‚Äì with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed ‚Ç¨3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR¬Æ is estimated to be over ‚Ç¨5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.The alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.In the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints and a rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life. All patients have been implanted with the alfapump and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines. Over 900 alfapump systems have been implanted to date.Sequana Medical has combined its proven alfapump and proprietary DSR therapy  and is developing the alfapump DSR  a breakthrough approach to fluid overload due to heart failure. RED DESERT demonstrated that repeated DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients is able to manage their fluid and sodium balance  improve their cardio-renal status and restore their diuretic response for months post-treatment. Interim results from the ongoing SAHARA DESERT study in decompensated heart failure patients indicate that repeated DSR therapy can safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate persistent congestion and restore euvolemia  together with considerable benefit in cardio-renal status and a dramatic improvement in diuretic responsiveness. Reporting of top-line data is planned for H2 2022.Sequana Medical is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Pivotal patients completing the six-months post-implantation period will be included in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis  and reporting of these data is planned for Q4 2022. A further 29 patients from the Roll-In Cohort were also implanted with the alfapump and will be included in the overall safety analysis.Importantly  a preliminary interim analysis1 of patient survival following alfapump implantation in the Roll-In Cohort indicated a mean survival probability of 70% at 12 months. This compares favourably with the published literature reporting a survival rate for refractory ascites patients of only 50% at 12 months.2""Completing alfapump implantations is an important milestone for our POSEIDON study given the uncertainties of hospital resource availability that still exist due to COVID  and enables us to report the primary endpoint data before the end of this year as planned ‚Äù commented Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical. ‚ÄúGiven the strong efficacy results we reported in last year's interim analysis  we are confident that these implanted patients in the Pivotal Cohort will give us sufficient statistical power for the primary efficacy endpoint. For our safety evaluation  we are including the data from the Roll-In patients which will bring the total number in that assessment to approximately 70.‚ÄùStory continues‚ÄúWe are encouraged by our preliminary interim review of patient survival with 70% of the POSEIDON Roll-In patients alive at 12 months post-implantation ‚Äù added Dr. Gijs Klarenbeek  Senior Medical Adviser of Sequana Medical. ‚ÄúWe believe that this survival data combined with the dramatic reduction in the rate of therapeutic paracentesis and the clinically relevant improvement in quality of life in the interim analysis of the first 26 Roll-in patients suggest that the alfapump is a highly attractive treatment option for this patient group that has been overlooked for too long.‚ÄùKaplan Meier ‚Äì Preliminary survival rate analysis of Roll-In Cohort  dated 25 March 2022 :https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/1a65f324-c436-4786-8089-3c891f88037bSummary of the 2 nd interim analysis of Roll-In Cohort reported in July 2021In July 2021  the Company reported the second interim analysis on 26 patients from the Roll-In Cohort  reaffirming the previous positive efficacy results of the alfapump and providing longer-term evidence of the reduction in therapeutic paracentesis and continued improvements in quality of life. Data from this Roll-In Cohort substantially exceeded the pre-defined requirements of the primary endpoints as defined for the Pivotal Cohort in the study3  demonstrating: (i) over 90% reduction in mean frequency of therapeutic paracentesis (TP) versus baseline  (ii) all patients having at least a 50% reduction in mean frequency of TP per month versus baseline  (iii) clinically important improvement in quality of life maintained even up to 12 months post-implantation  and (iv) safety profile in line with expectations.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsTel: +32 498 05 35 79Email: IR@sequanamedical.comLifeSci AdvisorsGuillaume van RenterghemTel: +41 76 735 01 31Email: gvanrenterghem@lifesciadvisors.comAbout the POSEIDON studyPOSEIDON is a single-arm  open-label and within subject cross-over study of the alfapump in patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and is being conducted in approximately 20 centres across the U.S. and Canada. All patients have been enrolled in the study and implanted with the alfapump. Patients enrolled in the Pivotal Cohort entered into a three-month pre-implant observation period before they were implanted with the alfapump. The study allowed to enrol additional patients in a Roll-In Cohort to ensure new centres were experienced with the alfapump implantation prior to enrolling patients in the Pivotal Cohort.The primary effectiveness outcomes of the study include the proportion of patients with a 50% reduction in the overall average frequency of therapeutic paracentesis per month in the post-implant observation period (month four to month six post-implantation) as compared to the pre-implant observation period. The primary safety endpoint is the rate of alfapump-related re-interventions adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee. Patients will be followed for up to two years for analysis of secondary outcome measurements including safety (device and/or procedure-related adverse events)  quality of life (assessed by general SF36 as well as disease-specific Ascites Q questionnaires)  nutritional status  health economics and overall survival.

Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases ‚Äî including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure ‚Äî with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed ‚Ç¨3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR¬Æ is estimated to be over ‚Ç¨5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.The alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.In the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints and a rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life. All patients have been implanted with the alfapump and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines. Over 900 alfapump systems have been implanted to date.Sequana Medical has combined its proven alfapump and proprietary DSR therapy  and is developing the alfapump DSR  a breakthrough approach to fluid overload due to heart failure. RED DESERT demonstrated that repeated DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients is able to manage their fluid and sodium balance  improve their cardio-renal status and restore their diuretic response for months post-treatment. Interim results from the ongoing SAHARA DESERT study in decompensated heart failure patients indicate that repeated DSR therapy can safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate persistent congestion and restore euvolemia  together with considerable benefit in cardio-renal status and a dramatic improvement in diuretic responsiveness. Reporting of top-line data is planned for H2 2022.Sequana Medical is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Howard Jr.  M.D.  Professor of Neurology (Neuromuscular Disease)  Medicine and Allied Health  Department of Neurology  The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of MedicinePhase 3 ADAPT+ Study DesignThe Phase 3 ADAPT+ trial is a long-term  single-arm  open-label  multicenter trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of VYVGART in patients with gMG. Ninety-one percent (151/167) of ADAPT patients entered the ADAPT+ study. A total of 106 AChR-Ab+ and 33 AChR-Ab‚Äì had received at least one dose of open-label VYVGART (including 66 ADAPT placebo patients). The remaining patients were either still responding to treatment from their last cycle in ADAPT  or dropped out between rollover. There were at least four weeks between cycles in the ADAPT+ study  with a maximum of ten cycles. The mean study duration was 363 days  resulting in 138 patient-years of observation.See the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART in the U.S.  which includes the below Important Safety Information.

VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization).

Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases.About VYVGART¬ÆVYVGART¬Æ (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRN)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRN blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first-and-only approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in the U.S. and Japan.

The patient was included in the European trial  ARENA-2 (NCT03644706)  and treated for more than 5 years with ADV-7103. This case supports the interest of ADV-7103 in the treatment of dRTA and the long-term advantage of a bi-daily dosing compared to the usual management of this disease.The scientific paper is referenced below:Boyer  O.
