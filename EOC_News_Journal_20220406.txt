The guidelines shall be applied to remuneration agreed and changes to previously agreed remuneration  after the guidelines have been adopted by the Annual General Meeting. The guidelines do not apply to remuneration resolved by the Annual General Meeting.The guidelines’ promotion of IBT’s business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityIBT develops  and intends to market and sell  safe and efficacious therapies that affect infants’ microbiome and thereby prevent or treat rare diseases that affects premature infants. For more information on IBT’s business strategy  see the annual report.Successful implementation of the business strategy and safeguarding IBT’s long-term interests  including its sustainability  require IBT to be able to recruit  motivate and retain competent employees who work to achieve maximum shareholder and customer value. This requires IBT to be able to offer competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable senior executives to be offered competitive total remuneration.Forms of remuneration  etc.Remuneration shall be market-based and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. The Annual General Meeting may in addition – and independent of these guidelines – resolve on for example share-related and share-price based remuneration. The total remuneration package to senior executives should include a well-balanced mix of the above-named components as well as terms of notice and severance pay. The Board should annually evaluate the extent to which share-based or share-price based long-term incentive programmes should be proposed to the Annual General Meeting.The fixed cash salary shall be individual and based on the senior executive’s responsibilities and role as well as the individual’s competence and experience in the relevant position.The variable cash remuneration may amount to a maximum of 40 percent of fixed annual cash salary.Senior executives who are entitled to pensions shall have pension benefits that are defined contribution. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits. Pension premiums for defined contribution pensions shall amount to a maximum of 33 percent of fixed annual cash salary.Other benefits may include life insurance  health insurance (Sw: sjukvårdsförsäkring) and a company car benefit. Such benefits shall be of limited value in relation to other compensation and be consistent with what is customary in the respective geographical market. Other benefits may amount to a maximum of 5 percent of fixed annual cash salary.Termination of employmentIn the event of termination of employment by the company the maximum notice period is six months. Fixed cash salary during the notice period plus any severance pay may not together exceed an amount equivalent to the individual’s fixed cash salary for a one-year period. In case of termination by the senior executive  the notice period may not be less than three months and no severance pay will be paid.Criteria for distribution of variable cash remuneration  etc.Variable cash remuneration shall be linked to pre-determined and measurable criteria which may be financial or non-financial. It can also comprise individually adapted quantitative or qualitative targets. The criteria shall be designed so that they promote the Group’s business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  through for example having a clear link to IBT’s business strategy or promoting the senior executive’s long-term development.Fulfilment of the criteria for payment of variable cash remuneration shall be measured during a period of one year. When the measurement period for fulfilment of the criteria for payment of variable cash remuneration has ended  the extent to which the criteria have been met shall be determined. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for assessment with regard to variable cash remuneration to the CEO. As regards variable cash remuneration to other senior executives  the CEO is responsible for the assessment.Salary and terms of employment for employeesIn preparation of the Board’s proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salaries and terms of employment for the company’s employees have been taken into account through information on employees’ total remuneration  remuneration components as well as remuneration increases and rate of increase over time comprising a part of the Remuneration Committee’s and the Board’s basis for decision when evaluating the reasonableness of these guidelines and the limitations that are a consequence of them.Decision-making process to establish  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board has established a Remuneration Committee. The tasks of the committee include preparation of the Board’s proposal for decision on guidelines for remuneration to senior executives. The Board shall prepare proposals for new guidelines at least every fourth year and present the proposal for decision to the Annual General Meeting. The guidelines shall apply until new guidelines are adopted by the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programmes for variable remuneration to senior executives  application of the guidelines for remuneration to senior executives as well as applicable remuneration structures and remuneration levels in the Group. When the Board considers and makes decisions on remuneration-related matters  the CEO or other senior executives are not present insofar as they are affected by the issues.Departure from the guidelinesThe Board may decide temporarily to depart from the guidelines wholly or partly if in an individual case there is reason for this and such departure is necessary in order to meet IBT’s long-term interests  including its sustainability  or in order to ensure IBT’s financial viability. As stated above  the tasks of the Remuneration Committee include preparing the Board’s decision on remuneration matters  which includes decisions to depart from the guidelines.Description of material changes to the guidelines and how the views of shareholders’ have been taken into considerationIn the proposal for guidelines submitted at the 2022 Annual General Meeting  the maximum amount for variable cash remuneration has been raised from 30 percent to 40 percent of the fixed annual cash salary. IBT has not received any views from shareholders to take into consideration in the preparation of this proposal.Item 16 – The Board’s proposal for a resolution regarding authorization for new issuance of sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting approve that the Board of Directors have a mandate to  on one or more occasion until the next Annual General Meeting  issue new B-class shares. The Board of Directors will be able to decide on a new issuance of shares with deviation from the shareholders’ pre-emption rights. This authorisation is to include the right to issue shares with cash payment  payment by contribution in kind or payment by way of set-off  and otherwise subject to conditions as set out in Chapter 13  Section 5  first paragraph 6 of the Swedish Companies Act.The decision by the Board of Directors in relation to a new share issue that deviates from shareholders’ pre-emption rights (directed issue) shall not exceed a twenty percent increase in share capital in relation to the share capital when the mandate for new issue is first utilised by the Board of Directors.The share issue under this authorization shall be on market terms. The Board shall have the right to determine the conditions of the issue under this authorization as well as mandate to determine who has the right to subscribe for shares. The purpose of the authorization is to provide the Board with flexibility in efforts to ensure that the company in an appropriate manner  has additional capital to finance the company’s ongoing clinical activities  and to enable a broadening of the owner base of the company.Item 17 – The Board’s proposal for a resolution regarding implementation of an incentive programThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt an incentive program for the company’s employees and key persons engaged as consultants via i) a directed issue of warrants to the company or its wholly owned subsidiary IBT Baby AB  Reg. No 559110-7353 (the “Subsidiary”)  and ii) approval of transfer of warrants to participants in the incentive program. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new B-share in the company.The Board of Directors believes that it is important and in the interest of all shareholders that the employees and other key persons  who are deemed to be important for the company’s further development  have a long-term interest in a good value increase of the company’s shares. A personal long-term ownership commitment can be expected to contribute to an increased interest in the company’s operations and earnings and raise the participants’ motivation and connection with the company and its shareholders.Based on the existing number of shares in the company  the dilution resulting from the proposed incentive program  assuming that all warrants are exercised for subscription of new B-shares  will be approximately 2.64 percent of the shares and approximately 2.04 percent of the votes. The percentage dilution in respect of the shares has been calculated according to the following formula: 1-(existing number of shares/new number of shares)  and in respect of the votes according to the following formula: 1-(existing number of votes/new number of votes). This calculation does not consider already outstanding warrants in the incentive programs that were implemented in 2017 and 2020  respectively. The dilution is expected to have a limited effect on the company’s key performance indicators.This proposal has been prepared by the remuneration committee and thereafter by the Board of Directors in consultation with external advisors. The resigning board member Robert Molander is a part of the executive management and has not participated in the Board’s handling of or decision in the matter.Directed issue of warrants to the company or the SubsidiaryThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed issue of a maximum of 304 500 warrants on the following terms:The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  belong to the company or the Subsidiary. Over-subscription can not occur.The reason for the deviation from shareholders’ preferential rights is that the issue is a part of the implementation of the incentive program  with which the company’s employees and other key persons are given the opportunity to take part in a positive development in the company. The existence of such a program is expected to increase the company’s ability to attract and retain qualified employees.Subscription of the warrants shall be made through subscription on a subscription list no later than May 13  2022. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period.The warrants are issued free of charge.Each warrant will entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new B-share in the company at a subscription price corresponding to 200 percent of the volume-weighted average price of the company’s share according to Nasdaq Stockholm’s official price list during the period ten (10) trading days before May 4  2022. Any share premium shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve.Subscription of B-shares by exercise of warrants shall be made in accordance with the terms of the warrants from June 1  2025 up to and including September 30  2025.If all warrants are exercised for subscription of B-shares  the company’s registered share capital will increase by 82 990.560062 SEK (given current quota value and provided that no recalculation is carried out pursuant to the warrant terms).B-shares issued as a result of subscription shall entitle to dividends on the dividend record date occurring after the share capital is registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) and B-shares have been recorded in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB.The warrants will otherwise be subject to customary terms regarding inter alia recalculation  which are included in the board’s complete proposal.Approval of transfer of warrants from the Subsidiary to participants in the incentive programThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the company or the Subsidiary transfers a maximum of 304 500 warrants to the company’s CEO  senior executives and other employees and key persons engaged as consultants  or to companies wholly owned by such persons  according to the following principles.Category A – CEO: the CEO may be allotted a maximum of 120 000 warrants.Category B – other senior executives: participants in this category may be allotted a maximum of 115 000 warrants collectively and each participant in the category may be allotted a maximum of 75 000 warrants individually.Category C – other employees: participants in this category may be allotted a maximum of 69 500 warrants collectively and each participant may be allotted a maximum of 20 000 warrants individually.The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price established on the basis of an estimated market value of the warrants at the time of the transfer by applying the Black & Scholes valuation model (option premium). Calculation of the option premium shall be performed by an independent valuation expert.In order to enable the participants acquisition of the warrants  the board may decide on an extra bonus payment which net after deduction for taxes and social security contributions is equivalent to 100% of the option premium.In addition  a so-called pre-emption agreement shall be entered into  pursuant to which the warrant holder shall be obliged to offer the company or the Subsidiary to acquire the warrants  or a portion of them  under certain conditions.Transfer of warrants to participants in the incentive program requires that such transfer may be lawfully made and that it  according to the Board of Directors’ assessment  may be made to reasonable administrative costs.The employees who are entitled to acquire warrants must notify their intention to acquire warrants during the period from May 16  2022 up to and including May 31  2022. However  the Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the time for such notification and to resolve on a new notification period for employees whose acquisitions occur after the initial acquisition period has ended.Costs for the incentive programThe incentive program has been prepared in consultation with external legal and financial advisers and the costs for this guidance is estimated to amount to a maximum of SEK 80 000. The company’s costs for bonus payments to cover the option premium is expected to amount to approximately SEK 4 800 000.In addition to the costs stated above  the Board of Directors deems that the incentive program will cause certain administrative costs in connection with registration  transfer and share subscription by exercise of warrants.Other outstanding share-related incentive programs in the companyWarrant program 2017/2022On May 4  2017  the Annual General Meeting decided on an incentive program by a directed issue of warrants to the Subsidiary. The number of issued warrants is 280 000. In total 260 000 warrants have been transferred to employees. The transfers have been carried out on market terms at a price determined at the time of the transfers by applying the Black & Scholes method of valuation.The holder of warrants may  during the period from April 3  2022 up to and including May 3  2022  for each warrant subscribe for one and one tenth (1.1) new B-share in the company at a subscription price per share amounting to SEK 272.41 (a recalculation of the terms has taken place due to share issues in November 2017 and January 2018).Warrant program 2020/2024On June 16  2020  the Annual General Meeting decided on an incentive program by a directed issue of warrants to the Subsidiary. The number of issued warrants is 375 000. In total 244 073 warrants have been transferred to employees. The transfers have been carried out on market terms at a price determined at the time of the transfers by applying the Black & Scholes method of valuation.The holder of warrants may  during the period from July 1  2024 up to and including September 30  2024  for each warrant subscribe for one (1) new B-share in the company at a subscription price per share amounting to SEK 400.There are no other share-based incentive programs in the company.Majority requirementsThe resolutions above are conditional on each other and are therefore to be adopted jointly. A valid resolution requires approval of shareholders representing at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.OtherThe CEO  or any other person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to take those smaller measures that may be required in order to register and implement the resolution.Further informationAvailable documentation and proxy formsThe annual report and other complete documentation will be made available at the company and on www.ibtherapeutics.com no later than three weeks before the Meeting and will be sent free of charge to all shareholders who so request and provide their postal address.

The request comes as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has spurred widespread concerns over a possible nuclear attack.Medesis did not say how much funding would be required  but gave itself 12 to 18 month deadlines for product registration and manufacturing  subject to demands from public authorities.""To date  there is no suitable treatment for a serious nuclear accident "" it said in a statement.The company said its products were relevant to the war in Ukraine as well as to European plans to boost nuclear generation as countries seek to reduce reliance on Russian energy and secure carbon-free electricity.A nuclear explosion would generate a fireball and destructive shock blast  burns from light and heat radiation  and radioactive pollution that can be carried by winds across great distances and cause long-term cancers  it said.EXTREME SITUATION""The world has realised  with the tragic events in Ukraine and notably the bombing near a power station  that the nuclear threat is still very much alive "" said Invest Securities' deputy managing director Pascal Hadjedj.After health providers worldwide were left with inadequate resources to face the coronavirus pandemic  the brokerage said it was key to prepare stocks to avoid an ""extreme situation"".Rx Securities' managing director Samir Devani added that Medesis' treatments could be developed rapidly and result in stockpile orders.Sources told Reuters last week the European Union had agreed to stockpile equipment and medicine to protect against nuclear incidents.Medesis' drug programmes seek to treat plutonium and caesium contamination  and prevent and treat respiratory and digestive inflammation caused by radiation.They include a synthesised version of Prussian Blue which could be taken orally and stored at room temperature  and caesium medication that would be suitable for children.French President Emmanuel Macron  who is running for re-election this month  has announced plans for six new nuclear reactors and studies for a further eight.",neutral,0.04,0.74,0.21,negative,0.02,0.12,0.86,True,English,"['funding request', 'nuclear threat', 'Medesis', 'drugs', 'deputy managing director Pascal Hadjedj', ""Rx Securities' managing director"", 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'six new nuclear reactors', '12 to 18 month deadlines', 'destructive shock blast', 'French biotech company', 'multiple trading halts', 'Defence Innovation Agency', 'possible nuclear attack', 'serious nuclear accident', ""Medesis' drug programmes"", 'Invest Securities', 'early trading', 'nuclear contamination', 'nuclear generation', 'nuclear explosion', 'nuclear threat', 'nuclear incidents', 'three drugs', '75 per cent', '10.50am GMT', 'large populations', 'widespread concerns', 'product registration', 'public authorities', 'Russian energy', 'carbon-free electricity', 'radioactive pollution', 'great distances', 'long-term cancers', 'EXTREME SITUATION', 'tragic events', 'power station', 'health providers', 'inadequate resources', 'coronavirus pandemic', 'Samir Devani', 'stockpile orders', 'European Union', 'caesium contamination', 'digestive inflammation', 'Prussian Blue', 'room temperature', 'caesium medication', 'Medesis Pharma', 'defence funding', ""Medesis' treatments"", 'suitable treatment', 'European plans', 'heat radiation', 'Medesis shares', 'development', 'Tuesday', 'Apr', 'surge', 'Euronext', 'France', 'civil', 'military', 'request', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'manufacturing', 'demands', 'date', 'statement', 'products', 'war', 'countries', 'reliance', 'fireball', 'burns', 'light', 'winds', 'world', 'bombing', 'brokerage', 'stocks', 'Reuters', 'equipment', 'medicine', 'plutonium', 'respiratory', 'synthesised', 'version', 'children', 'election', 'studies', '53']",2022-04-05,2022-04-06,channelnewsasia.com

This center will provide real-time protection against cyber-attacks in the country and across the African continent as a whole.The digital transformation of African societies  as illustrated by the extensive use of mobile payments across the continent  and the rise in teleworking due to the health crisis  have had a major impact on Africa's vulnerability to cyber-attacks. While businesses  administrations and individuals are becoming increasingly connected  this trend must be accompanied by an increase in the level of protection in order to tackle the multiplication and sophistication of attacks. Outside the financial sector  all sectors are affected  including the most important ones  such as government services but also water distribution  energy and telecommunications.Furthermore  a new legal framework is driving African businesses to equip themselves with a means of supervision in the field of cybersecurity. Thales  which is already present in Morocco  is thus strengthening its cyber expertise on the continent.The SOCs combine 24/7 threat detection and analysis capabilities and deliver responses in compliance with the country's cybersecurity infrastructure and policies.

2299,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medesis-pharma-wishes-accelerate-development-064500259.html,Medesis Pharma wishes to accelerate the development of its antinuclear products and provides an update on its strategy,Medesis Pharma wishes to accelerate the development of its antinuclear products and provides an update on its strategy Montpellier (France)  April  5  2022 -...,Medesis Pharma SAMedesis Pharma wishes to accelerate the development of its antinuclear products and provides an update on its strategyMontpellier (France)  April  5  2022 - 8:45am – Medesis Pharma (ISIN: FR0010844464  Ticker: ALMDP)  a pharmaceutical biotechnology company developing drug candidates with its proprietary buccal active ingredient delivery technology  Aonys®  publishes an information note on the three future drugs in development for the protection of large populations contaminated after a civil or military nuclear accident.Three drugs are specifically intended for the treatment of large populations contaminated or irradiated after a civil or military nuclear accident. To date  there is no suitable treatment for a serious nuclear accident. The three products are at the heart of the issues with the tragic international situation in Ukraine  raising the possibility of nuclear war. They are also topical with the recent decisions to maintain the development of nuclear power plants.Medesis Pharma's three drug candidates were developed in collaboration with the French Atomic Energy Commission (LRT-CEA)  which carried out all the studies on animals contaminated by radionuclides  and with the Armed Forces Biomedical Research Institute (IRBA) for studies on irradiated animals. Each of these products is protected by an international patent registered or in the process of being registered in most nuclear countries in the world.The therapeutic activity has been demonstrated  and a complementary program is necessary with pharmaceutical development for industrial production and a tolerance study on healthy volunteers to demonstrate safety before introducing the products into State emergency stocks.Funding requests for these 3 programs have been submitted by Medesis Pharma to the French Defense Innovation Agency.NU01: NanoCaDTPA: Plutonium decorporationFor more than 40 years  CaDTPA has been used by repeated slow IV infusion over several weeks. However  this treatment carried out in a medical environment is suitable for a few contaminated people (workers in Nuclear Power Plants)  but impossible to implement when several hundred thousand people are contaminated.NanoCaDTPA (formulation of CaDTPA in the Aonys microemulsion) makes it possible to obtain the same efficiency of extraction of Plutonium  but with simple administration in the mouth  from a bottle stored at room temperature.Story continuesNU02: NanoPB (Prussian Blue): Cesium decorporationPrussian Blue has been used for many years for the extraction of Cesium. It is administered in large capsules of 500 mg  18 capsules per day for 2 to 3 months. Impossible to dissolve  it is almost impossible to give to children and adolescents and is accompanied by obstinate constipation resulting in irradiation of the small pelvis. However  Cesium is fixed preferentially in the muscles and in particular in the heart muscle causing abnormalities and cardiac pathologies in children and adolescents.The NanoPB consists of Prussian Blue nanoparticles synthesized and stabilized in the Aonys microemulsion. It allows to obtain a decorporation of cesium 3 times faster with 100 times less Prussian Blue. It is drinkable and suitable for administration at any age  including infants and children.NP02: NanoManganeseThe active ingredient is manganese sulphate in the Aonys microemulsion. This product prevents and treats the storm of inflammatory cytokines triggered by irradiation that causes major respiratory and digestive inflammation responsible for death. Efficacy is observed if treatment is started within hours of irradiation. It is administered by mouth and stored in bottles at room temperature.This product is currently in a Phase II clinical study in Brazil to treat severe forms of COVID-19 which are also linked to an inflammatory cytokine storm.General information about a nuclear explosionDuring an explosion  a nuclear weapon first generates a ball of fire  the size of which varies with the power. A 1 kiloton bomb would thus generate a ball 60 meters in diameter causing damage up to 2 kilometers around the point of impact. A 1 000-kiloton bomb would generate a fireball of more than 1 kilometer  the impact of which could have a radius of up to 20 kilometers.Blast effect: the explosion causes a shock wave with a displacement of an air mass capable of destroying all surrounding objects. The vacuum created by the moving air then drives strong winds  similar to a cyclone or tornado;Heat: light radiation and its heat  which represent more than a third of the energy of the bomb  cause fires and burns on people;Radiation: the bomb generates direct radiation at the moment of its explosion;Radioactive pollution that can be carried by the winds over great distances by radionuclides which are absorbed by the respiratory and digestive tracts  settle in the tissues  in particular the lungs  liver  bones and heart  and will never again be eliminated and will cause cancer 10 to 15 years later.Product development PlanFor each of the two decorporation products of Plutonium and Cesium:• Pharmaceutical CMC development with preparation for industrial production • Tolerance study on 50 healthy volunteers treated for one month.For the radiation protection product already in clinical development:• Industrial development • Tolerance study on 50 healthy volunteers for one month.Deadlines for product registration and industrial manufacturing:• 18 months for the two decorporation products• 12 months for the radiation protection productIn practice  these deadlines can be shortened or extended depending on whether or not the Medicines Agency and the public authorities consider it urgent.À propos de Medesis PharmaPour avancer dans le traitement des maladies graves dépourvues de traitement efficace  Medesis Pharma conçoit des candidats médicaments en s’appuyant sur sa technologie propriétaire Aonys® d’administration de principes actifs sous forme de nano-gouttelettes par voie buccale qui rend efficace le delivery des principes actifs dans toutes les cellules  avec un passage de la Barrière Hémato EncéphaliqueCette approche innovante est appliquée à de futurs médicaments pour traiter des maladies majeures dépourvues de traitements efficaces : la Maladie d’Alzheimer  la Maladie de Huntington  certains cancers résistants et les inflammations respiratoires sévères comme celles liées à la COVID-19.

Pivotal patients completing the six-months post-implantation period will be included in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis  and reporting of these data is planned for Q4 2022. A further 29 patients from the Roll-In Cohort were also implanted with the alfapump and will be included in the overall safety analysis.Importantly  a preliminary interim analysis1 of patient survival following alfapump implantation in the Roll-In Cohort indicated a mean survival probability of 70% at 12 months. This compares favourably with the published literature reporting a survival rate for refractory ascites patients of only 50% at 12 months.2""Completing alfapump implantations is an important milestone for our POSEIDON study given the uncertainties of hospital resource availability that still exist due to COVID  and enables us to report the primary endpoint data before the end of this year as planned ” commented Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical. “Given the strong efficacy results we reported in last year's interim analysis  we are confident that these implanted patients in the Pivotal Cohort will give us sufficient statistical power for the primary efficacy endpoint. For our safety evaluation  we are including the data from the Roll-In patients which will bring the total number in that assessment to approximately 70.”Story continues“We are encouraged by our preliminary interim review of patient survival with 70% of the POSEIDON Roll-In patients alive at 12 months post-implantation ” added Dr. Gijs Klarenbeek  Senior Medical Adviser of Sequana Medical. “We believe that this survival data combined with the dramatic reduction in the rate of therapeutic paracentesis and the clinically relevant improvement in quality of life in the interim analysis of the first 26 Roll-in patients suggest that the alfapump is a highly attractive treatment option for this patient group that has been overlooked for too long.”Kaplan Meier – Preliminary survival rate analysis of Roll-In Cohort   dated 25 March 2022Summary of the 2 nd i nterim a nalysis of Roll-In Cohort reported in July 2021In July 2021  the Company reported the second interim analysis on 26 patients from the Roll-In Cohort  reaffirming the previous positive efficacy results of the alfapump and providing longer-term evidence of the reduction in therapeutic paracentesis and continued improvements in quality of life. Data from this Roll-In Cohort substantially exceeded the pre-defined requirements of the primary endpoints as defined for the Pivotal Cohort in the study3  demonstrating: (i) over 90% reduction in mean frequency of therapeutic paracentesis (TP) versus baseline  (ii) all patients having at least a 50% reduction in mean frequency of TP per month versus baseline  (iii) clinically important improvement in quality of life maintained even up to 12 months post-implantation  and (iv) safety profile in line with expectations.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsTel: +32 498 05 35 79Email: IR@sequanamedical.comLifeSci AdvisorsGuillaume van RenterghemTel: +41 76 735 01 31Email: gvanrenterghem@lifesciadvisors.comAbout the POSEIDON studyPOSEIDON is a single-arm  open-label and within subject cross-over study of the alfapump in patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and is being conducted in approximately 20 centres across the U.S. and Canada. All patients have been enrolled in the study and implanted with the alfapump. Patients enrolled in the Pivotal Cohort entered into a three-month pre-implant observation period before they were implanted with the alfapump. The study allowed to enrol additional patients in a Roll-In Cohort to ensure new centres were experienced with the alfapump implantation prior to enrolling patients in the Pivotal Cohort.The primary effectiveness outcomes of the study include the proportion of patients with a 50% reduction in the overall average frequency of therapeutic paracentesis per month in the post-implant observation period (month four to month six post-implantation) as compared to the pre-implant observation period. The primary safety endpoint is the rate of alfapump-related re-interventions adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee. Patients will be followed for up to two years for analysis of secondary outcome measurements including safety (device and/or procedure-related adverse events)  quality of life (assessed by general SF36 as well as disease-specific Ascites Q questionnaires)  nutritional status  health economics and overall survival. For more information about the study  please visit clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03973866).About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical is a commercial stage medical device company utilizing its proprietary alfapump® and DSR® (Direct Sodium Removal) technologies to develop innovative treatments for fluid overload in liver disease  malignant ascites and heart failure where diuretics are no longer effective. Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases – including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure – with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed €3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR® is estimated to be over €5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.The alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.In the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints and a rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life. All patients have been implanted with the alfapump and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines. Over 900 alfapump systems have been implanted to date.Sequana Medical has combined its proven alfapump and proprietary DSR therapy  and is developing the alfapump DSR  a breakthrough approach to fluid overload due to heart failure. RED DESERT demonstrated that repeated DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients is able to manage their fluid and sodium balance  improve their cardio-renal status and restore their diuretic response for months post-treatment. Interim results from the ongoing SAHARA DESERT study in decompensated heart failure patients indicate that repeated DSR therapy can safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate persistent congestion and restore euvolemia  together with considerable benefit in cardio-renal status and a dramatic improvement in diuretic responsiveness. Reporting of top-line data is planned for H2 2022.Sequana Medical is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Pivotal patients completing the six-months post-implantation period will be included in the primary efficacy endpoint analysis  and reporting of these data is planned for Q4 2022. A further 29 patients from the Roll-In Cohort were also implanted with the alfapump and will be included in the overall safety analysis.Importantly  a preliminary interim analysis1 of patient survival following alfapump implantation in the Roll-In Cohort indicated a mean survival probability of 70% at 12 months. This compares favourably with the published literature reporting a survival rate for refractory ascites patients of only 50% at 12 months.2""Completing alfapump implantations is an important milestone for our POSEIDON study given the uncertainties of hospital resource availability that still exist due to COVID  and enables us to report the primary endpoint data before the end of this year as planned ” commented Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical. “Given the strong efficacy results we reported in last year's interim analysis  we are confident that these implanted patients in the Pivotal Cohort will give us sufficient statistical power for the primary efficacy endpoint. For our safety evaluation  we are including the data from the Roll-In patients which will bring the total number in that assessment to approximately 70.”Story continues“We are encouraged by our preliminary interim review of patient survival with 70% of the POSEIDON Roll-In patients alive at 12 months post-implantation ” added Dr. Gijs Klarenbeek  Senior Medical Adviser of Sequana Medical. “We believe that this survival data combined with the dramatic reduction in the rate of therapeutic paracentesis and the clinically relevant improvement in quality of life in the interim analysis of the first 26 Roll-in patients suggest that the alfapump is a highly attractive treatment option for this patient group that has been overlooked for too long.”Kaplan Meier – Preliminary survival rate analysis of Roll-In Cohort  dated 25 March 2022 :https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/1a65f324-c436-4786-8089-3c891f88037bSummary of the 2 nd interim analysis of Roll-In Cohort reported in July 2021In July 2021  the Company reported the second interim analysis on 26 patients from the Roll-In Cohort  reaffirming the previous positive efficacy results of the alfapump and providing longer-term evidence of the reduction in therapeutic paracentesis and continued improvements in quality of life. Data from this Roll-In Cohort substantially exceeded the pre-defined requirements of the primary endpoints as defined for the Pivotal Cohort in the study3  demonstrating: (i) over 90% reduction in mean frequency of therapeutic paracentesis (TP) versus baseline  (ii) all patients having at least a 50% reduction in mean frequency of TP per month versus baseline  (iii) clinically important improvement in quality of life maintained even up to 12 months post-implantation  and (iv) safety profile in line with expectations.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsTel: +32 498 05 35 79Email: IR@sequanamedical.comLifeSci AdvisorsGuillaume van RenterghemTel: +41 76 735 01 31Email: gvanrenterghem@lifesciadvisors.comAbout the POSEIDON studyPOSEIDON is a single-arm  open-label and within subject cross-over study of the alfapump in patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and is being conducted in approximately 20 centres across the U.S. and Canada. All patients have been enrolled in the study and implanted with the alfapump. Patients enrolled in the Pivotal Cohort entered into a three-month pre-implant observation period before they were implanted with the alfapump. The study allowed to enrol additional patients in a Roll-In Cohort to ensure new centres were experienced with the alfapump implantation prior to enrolling patients in the Pivotal Cohort.The primary effectiveness outcomes of the study include the proportion of patients with a 50% reduction in the overall average frequency of therapeutic paracentesis per month in the post-implant observation period (month four to month six post-implantation) as compared to the pre-implant observation period. The primary safety endpoint is the rate of alfapump-related re-interventions adjudicated by the Clinical Events Committee. Patients will be followed for up to two years for analysis of secondary outcome measurements including safety (device and/or procedure-related adverse events)  quality of life (assessed by general SF36 as well as disease-specific Ascites Q questionnaires)  nutritional status  health economics and overall survival.

Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases — including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure — with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed €3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR® is estimated to be over €5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.The alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.In the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints and a rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life. All patients have been implanted with the alfapump and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines. Over 900 alfapump systems have been implanted to date.Sequana Medical has combined its proven alfapump and proprietary DSR therapy  and is developing the alfapump DSR  a breakthrough approach to fluid overload due to heart failure. RED DESERT demonstrated that repeated DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients is able to manage their fluid and sodium balance  improve their cardio-renal status and restore their diuretic response for months post-treatment. Interim results from the ongoing SAHARA DESERT study in decompensated heart failure patients indicate that repeated DSR therapy can safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate persistent congestion and restore euvolemia  together with considerable benefit in cardio-renal status and a dramatic improvement in diuretic responsiveness. Reporting of top-line data is planned for H2 2022.Sequana Medical is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The data will be presented today in an oral presentation at the 74th Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Neurology (AAN).“gMG can have a devastating impact on a person and their ability to lead a fulfilling life. For healthcare providers treating gMG patients  the ADAPT+ results provide greater understanding of how long-term treatment with VYVGART could help their patients overcome some of the daily limitations they face living with this debilitating disease ” said James F. Howard Jr.  M.D.  Professor of Neurology  Medicine and Allied Health  Department of Neurology  UNC School of Medicine and principal investigator for the ADAPT+ trial. “Patients who participated in ADAPT+ continued to experience consistent efficacy and safety over a year of treatment  reinforcing the potential benefit this targeted therapy can offer to this community.”“The ADAPT+ data continue to strengthen our belief in the potential of VYVGART to improve the lives of people impacted by gMG ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “Together with the robust clinical data already observed in the ADAPT study  these results further support the value of VYVGART as an efficacious  well-tolerated targeted treatment option for a patient community that has been underserved for years. We are grateful for and humbled by the ongoing participation of patients  caregivers  and investigators in the clinical trial  all of whom make continued innovation possible.”Story continuesHighlights of ADAPT+ Interim Analysis139 patients received at least one dose of VYVGART in ADAPT+. As of the interim analysis  the mean treatment duration was 363 days. Efficacy analyses were based on 106 patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.Patients who continued on long-term treatment with VYVGART experienced consistent and clinically meaningful improvement on both the Myasthenia Gravis Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) and Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) scales. The safety profile of long-term treatment (up to 10 treatment cycles) with VYVGART continued to be favorable and consistent with ADAPT.E fficacy is repeata ble   consistent and predictable with each subsequent treatment cycle Onset and durability of response remain consistent with each additional treatment cycle Mean improvements on MG-ADL and QMG scales from five treatment cycles were 5.1 and 4.7  respectively  and remained consistent between cycles Depth of response at increasing MG-ADL and QMG response thresholds remains consistent with ADAPT and between ADAPT+ treatment cycles 54.6% of patients received ≤5.5 treatment cycles per year based on patients who completed at least one year of VYVGART treatment at time of interim analysisSafety profile consistent with ADAPT VYVGART was well-tolerated with a consistent safety profile to the ADAPT trial and during the COVID-19 global pandemic. Majority of adverse events were mild to moderate in severity.Details of AAN oral presentation:Long-term Safety  Tolerability  and Efficacy of Efgartigimod in Patients with Generalized Myasthenia Gravis: Interim Results of the ADAPT+ StudyTuesday  April 5  2022  at 4:06 PM PTSession: S25: Autoimmune Neurology 2: Clinical Trials and Treatment; Presentation 004Presenter: James F.

Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months1  where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population1.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases.About VYVGART®VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRN)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRN blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

There can be no assurance that such statements will prove to be accurate  and actual results and future events could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the Company's expectations include: commodity price fluctuations; uncertainty with the estimates of the quantities and quality of reserves and resources; risks related to the Company's ability to continue production and generate revenues; risks related to the disruption of infrastructure; risks related to political instability in Kurdistan; risks related to dependence on third parties for the development of projects; equipment breakdowns  labour disputes  non-compliance with permit requirements or other unanticipated difficulties with or interruptions in development; the uncertainties involving the economic viability of developing contingent or prospective resources in the Atrush block and the Sarsang block (following completion of the Sarsang acquisition); risks pertaining to the outbreak of the global pandemics  including COVID-19; government regulation of operations; environmental risks; prices for energy inputs  labour  materials  supplies and services; and risks associated with the validity of petroleum contracts in Kurdistan.

Presentation of the Financial Statements  the Board of Directors’ Report  and the Auditor’s Report for the year 2021  and presentation of the CEO’s ReviewSince the General Meeting may only be attended by voting in advance  the company’s Annual Report for the year 2021  which includes the Financial Statements of the company  the Board of Directors’ Report and the Auditor’s Report  and which is available on the company’s website at http://www.sievicapital.fi/en/annual-general-meetings/agm-2022  is deemed to have been presented to the General Meeting.7. Adoption of the Financial Statements8. Resolution on the use of profit shown on the balance sheet and the payment of dividendThe Board of Directors proposes to the General Meeting that no dividend be distributed by resolution of the General Meeting for the financial period ended on 31 December 2021  but that the General Meeting authorise the Board of Directors to decide later  at its discretion  on the distribution of a dividend of a total maximum of EUR 0.05 per share in one or more instalments. The proposed authorisation would be valid from the date of the resolution until the next Annual General Meeting  however  at the latest until 31 May 2023. The company will publish the Board of Directors’ possible dividend distribution decisions separately and confirm the dividend record and payment dates at the same time. The dividend paid based on the authorisation would be paid to shareholders who on the record date of the dividend payment in question are recorded in the shareholders’ register maintained by Euroclear Finland Oy.The profit distribution proposal of the Board of Directors takes into account the company’s liquidity situation at the time of making the profit distribution proposal after the acquisitions of investments carried out last year and expected cash flows during the current year. The Board of Directors aims to use the proposed authorisation during the current year.Since the Board of Directors has proposed that instead of an immediate dividend resolution  the Board of Directors would be authorised by the General Meeting to decide on the dividend as set forth above  the shareholders have the right  in deviation from the Board of Directors’ proposal  to demand a minority dividend pursuant to Chapter 13  Section 7 of the Finnish Companies Act. The minority dividend would be distributed if a demand to this effect is made by shareholders who hold at least one tenth of all shares in the company. The amount of minority dividend would be EUR 1 561 862.50 (corresponding to a dividend of approximately EUR 0.0269 per share)  which corresponds to half of the profit for the financial year 2021 (which was EUR 3 123 724.99). A shareholder demanding minority dividend may vote for the minority dividend in advance voting  and no separate counterproposal or demand to the company is required. The Board of Directors has informed that it would take the potential distribution of minority dividend into account as a reduction in the amount of funds to be distributed based on the authorisation  provided that the General Meeting authorises the Board of Directors to decide on the distribution of funds as proposed.9. Resolution on the discharge from liability of the members of the Board of Directors and the CEOs10. Adoption of the Governing Bodies’ Remuneration ReportThe Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting adopts  through an advisory resolution  the company’s Governing Bodies’ Remuneration Report for the year 2021.Since the General Meeting may only be attended by voting in advance  the Governing Bodies’ Remuneration Report  which is available on the company’s website at http://www.sievicapital.fi/en/annual-general-meetings/agm-2022  is deemed to have been presented to the General Meeting.11.

Fears eased in mid-March when the first interest payments due since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine came through  proving that at least some of the country’s borrowers could still service their foreign currency bonds. The relief was short-lived. In early April  an attempt to pay Russian government dollar-debt obligations was rejected by foreign banks  increasing the risk of the country’s first sovereign default since 1998.1. What went wrong?Russia’s Finance Ministry said it still made the payments by transferring the money in rubles to a special account for foreigners with the country’s National Settlement Depository  citing a local decree allowing foreign debt payments in local currency. However  neither of the securities involved allowed payment in rubles  according to bond documents. Credit assessors including Fitch Ratings and S&P Global have said Russia will be considered in default if it doesn’t pay coupon payments in dollars within a 30-day grace period. Shortly after the dollar payment was rejected  the cost of insuring Russia’s government debt surged to signal a record 99% chance of default within the year.Advertisement2. What’s obstructing Russian debt payments?Governments have frozen about half of Russia’s foreign reserves  sanctions have isolated its banking system and some payments are being delayed by banks doing lengthy checks that they aren’t breaching any restrictions. In early April  the U.S. Treasury halted dollar debt payments from Russia’s accounts at U.S. banks  depriving it of an important source of funds to cover its obligations. An exemption that’s allowed U.S. and overseas investors to continue receiving payments on Russian debt is set to expire at the end of May. State enterprises such as Gazprom PJSC and Rosneft PJSC have continued to honor their foreign debts  but Severstal PJSC ran out of time for an interest payment after Citigroup Inc. blocked it for fear of breaching sanctions. Russian Railways JSC and EuroChem have also missed payment deadlines as the cash got stuck for compliance checks on its way to investors. Moves by the world’s biggest clearing houses -- Clearstream and Euroclear -- to curb settlement services they provide for Russian bonds have further complicated the flow of funds.3. What’s the Russian government’s response?AdvertisementOfficials in Moscow have previously warned that Russia would be forced to pay in rubles if sanctions block the transfer of dollars or euros. Such a switch  if applied to all Russian debt  would widely be seen as a default. If it weren’t  the world “would be awash in Venezuelan bolivars and Argentine pesos ” according to Elena L. Daly  a sovereign debt restructuring lawyer based in Paris. It may work in some cases: Six of the government’s dollar and euro-denominated bonds have what’s known as “fallback optionality ” which would allow the borrower to pay in other currencies  and in some cases  the ruble. But there’s little sign that Russian firms would emulate the government and try to switch payments to rubles -- or that foreign investors would be willing to receive them.4. What happens next?The debacle takes Russia a step closer to its first sovereign default since shockwaves from the Asian debt crisis and tumbling oil prices pushed Boris Yeltsin’s government to renege on about $40 billion of domestic debt. It took Russia about six years to gain so-called investment-grade status  which meant it could be held by a broad pool of investors. Russia’s credit ratings were dramatically slashed after the Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine in a sudden fall from investment grade. It has been sanctioned in various ways by the U.S. and its allies since it annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014  though it has been building foreign reserves.Advertisement5. What principles are at stake?Russia’s situation is unusual because companies could possibly keep servicing their debt even if the sovereign defaults. Some of them sell bonds via foreign subsidiaries and have dollars offshore. Issuers also have a responsibility to treat all bondholders fairly and must follow the “pari passu” principle (Latin for “equal footing”)  meaning that they can’t treat holders of the same note differently. That idea played a role in Argentina in 2014  when it was blocked by a U.S. judge from paying some bondholders until it resolved a long-running legal saga between the government and holdouts led by Paul Singer’s Elliott Investment Management.6. What options do investors have?If bondholders don’t get paid  it’s likely the start of a very long  complicated process. History is an imperfect guide  but Russia already holds the record for the longest time between default and some form of resolution with creditors: After the Bolsheviks refused to service or recognize the czar’s debts a century ago  the Soviet Union signed an agreement to settle at least some of those claims in 1986. Even if many of the notes are governed by English law and hence bondholders can take the Russian government to court in England  any attempt to enforce an agreement now will likely involve Russian assets and Russian courts. How foreign investors will access them is hard to know at this stage. The price of Russia’s dollar-denominated debt plunged in expectation of a default  with bonds due in 2023 quoted at just over a third of their face value on April 5. It fell 11 cents on the dollar on the new U.S. restrictions.Advertisement7. Are investors insured?Some investors purchase credit-default swaps  or CDS  insurance-like instruments designed to cover losses if a country or company fails to meet its obligations. However  roughly $13 billion of Russian government debt could be ineligible  a panel of banks and investors ruled March 11  because of the possibility of ruble payments on six of the bonds.8. What’s the broader impact?Concerns about a Russian default are rippling through other emerging markets. A Russian sovereign default is no longer an “improbable event ” International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said March 13  though the exposure of global banks to Russia is “definitely not systemically relevant.” Some investors have warned that a Russian default could ultimately lead to a global sovereign debt crisis if investors start shunning risk and more countries are locked out of financial markets.Advertisement• The Odd Lots podcast looks at alternative payments clauses in Russian bonds.• Bloomberg’s Big Take on how Russia is spiraling toward default  how its economy might adapt and its high-wire act to avoid default.• A 2008 research paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research on the history of sovereign defaults in emerging markets.• Bloomberg Opinion’s Max Hastings on centuries of Russian brutality.• Bloomberg QuickTakes on the SWIFT payment system and the history of sanctions against Russia.• A statement by the U.S. Treasury Department on initial sanctions concerning Russian debt and the Treasury’s 2021 global sanctions review.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2022 Bloomberg L.P.GiftOutline Gift Article,negative,0.02,0.14,0.85,negative,0.01,0.08,0.92,True,English,"['Analysis', 'Sanctions', 'Russia', 'Brink', 'Default', 'sovereign debt restructuring lawyer', 'Russian government dollar-debt obligations', '30-day grace period', 'biggest clearing houses', 'Elena L.

The Remuneration Report is available on Eltel's website www.eltelgroup.com . The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting approve the Remuneration Report. Item 15: Resolution regarding share-based long-term incentive program 2022 etc. The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting pass a resolution on the implementation of a share-based long-term incentive program 2022 (LTIP 2022). Below is a description of the main contents of the proposal. The Board of Director's complete proposal is available on Eltel's website www.eltelgroup.com. A. Terms of the LTIP 2022 The Board of Directors want to implement a long-term incentive program for senior executives and other key individuals in order to encourage a personal long-term ownership in the company  and in order to increase and strengthen the potential for recruiting  retaining and motivating such senior executives and key individuals. Therefore  the Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting approves the implementation of LTIP 2022 for senior executives and key individuals within the company. Participants will  after a qualifying period and assuming an investment of their own in Eltel Shares  be given the opportunity to  without consideration  receive allotments of Eltel Shares (defined below) and exercise options issued by the company. The number of allotted Eltel Shares and options will depend on the number of Eltel Shares that they have purchased themselves and on the fulfilment of certain performance requirements. Eltel Shares are ordinary shares in the company (""Eltel Shares""). The term of LTIP 2022 is approximately three years. The LTIP 2022 will be directed towards a maximum of twelve senior executives and other key individuals in the company. The participants are based in Sweden and other countries where the Eltel Group is active. Participation in the LTIP 2022 assumes that the participant acquires and locks a certain minimum and maximum  respectively  number of Eltel Shares into LTIP 2022 (""Savings Shares""). Savings Shares shall be newly acquired Eltel Shares. For each acquired Savings Share  the participant shall be entitled to  after a certain vesting period (defined below)  provided continued employment and dependent on the fulfilment of certain performance requirements during the financial years 2022-2025  receive allotment of Eltel Shares (""Performance Shares"") and exercise options issued by the company (""Performance Options""). The performance requirements are linked to certain financial key figures. The participant shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares and Performance Options. The participant shall have the right to exercise the Performance Options commencing on the day after the end of the vesting period and during two weeks thereafter (""Exercise Period""). The exercise price when the participant exercises the Performance Option shall correspond to 120 percent of the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for the Eltel Share during the first ten trading days that directly follows the Annual General Meeting 2022 (the ""Purchase Price""). Customary recalculation of the Purchase Price as well as of the number of Eltel Shares that each Performance Option corresponds to may occur in certain situations. The exercise of the Performance Options may be made by using so called net strike. Net strike may also be applicable on the performance options under the long term incentive program decided by the Annual General Meeting 2021. Allotment of Performance Shares and Performance Options within LTIP 2022 will be made during a limited period of time following the latter of the date of (i) the presentation of the first quarterly report for the first quarter of 2025  and (ii) the first record date for dividends decided by the Annual General Meeting 2025. The period up to this date is referred to as the qualification period (vesting period). In order for the participant to be entitled to receive allotment of Performance Shares and Performance Options  it is assumed that the participant remains an employee of the Eltel Group during the full qualification period up until allotment  that the participant  during this period  has kept all Savings Shares  and that the performance requirements are fulfilled. The participant can receive allotment of a maximum of eight (8) Performance Shares and eight (8) Performance Options per Savings Share. The participant's maximum gross profit per Performance Share and Performance Option shall in this regard be limited to three times the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for the Eltel Share during the first ten trading days that directly follows after the Annual General Meeting 2022. The Board of Directors shall  in accordance with the resolutions by the General Meeting set forth herein  be responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2022. The Board of Directors may also decide on the implementation of an alternative cash based incentive for participants in countries where the acquisition of Savings Shares or allotment of Performance Shares and/or Performance Options is not possible  as well as if otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTIP 2022. The intention is that the Board of Directors shall launch LTIP 2022 in May 2022 . In the event that the general meeting does not resolve in accordance with item B with the required majority  the Company shall hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party in accordance with what is stated in item C below. Participation in LTIP 2022 requires that the Participant makes a binding commitment that allotted Performance Shares and the additional Eltel Shares received through the exercise of the Performance Options shall not be sold or otherwise disposed of during a period of two years from the allotment of Performance Shares and Performance Options under the LTIP (so called lock-up). Exceptions from this may be granted by the Board of Directors  so that  inter alia  Participants may be able to sell shares in order to finance the payment of tax that arises upon allotment under LTIP 2022. B. Hedge for LTIP 2022 in the form of newly issued class C shares etc. The Board of Directors proposes that the implementation of LTIP 2022 shall be made in a cost-effective and flexible manner  and that the undertakings of the company for delivery of Performance Shares as well as Eltel Shares at exercise of the Performance Options and the company's cash-flow for the payment of social fees primarily shall be hedged by a directed issue of convertible and redeemable class C shares. Therefore  it is proposed that the Board of Directors shall be authorized to resolve on a directed issue and repurchase of a maximum of 1 934 400 Class C Shares as well as transfer of a maximum of 1 488 000 Eltel Shares owned by the company on certain terms and conditions. Further it is proposed to renew the authorisation for the board to sell shares in the stock market for the cash-flow effect of the payment of social security contributions in LTIP 2018 and LTIP 2021. The authorisation in this regard comprises up to a maximum of 365 968 Eltel shares. C. Equity swap agreement with a third party In the event that the necessary majority is not obtained for item B above  the company will hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2022 is expected to entail  by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Eltel Shares in the company regarding LTIP 2022. The relevant number of Eltel Shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed under item B above. Majority requirements etc. A valid resolution under item B above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths (90%) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting approve the resolution. Item 16: Resolution regarding authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on issuance of new shares The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board of Directors  on one or more occasions during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  against cash payment  for payment in kind or by way of set-off  to resolve on share issues corresponding to an aggregate dilution of not more than 10 per cent of the registered share capital. The purpose of the authorisation and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable the company in a time efficient way to secure financing of its strategy and/or to use its own shares to make payments in connection with acquisitions of companies or businesses which the company may undertake  or to settle any deferred payments related to such acquisitions  or to raise capital for such acquisitions or deferred payments. The basis for the issue price shall be in accordance with current market conditions at the time of the share issue. For a valid resolution  the resolution must be supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting. Item 17: Resolution regarding authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase and transfer of the company's own shares The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board of Directors  on one or more occasions during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to resolve to repurchase in aggregate as many shares as may be purchased without the company's holding at any time exceeding 10 per cent of the total number of shares in the company. The shares shall be acquired on Nasdaq Stockholm where shares in the company are listed and only at a price within the price range registered at any given time  i.e. the range between the highest bid price and the lowest offer price. It is also proposed that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to resolve on the transfer of the company's own shares  on one or several occasions prior to the next Annual General Meeting  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  against cash payment  for payment in kind or by way of set-off. The basis for the consideration in connection with transfer of own shares shall be in accordance with current market conditions at the time of the transfer. The purpose of the authorisations and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable the company in a time efficient way to use its own shares to make payments in connection with acquisitions of companies or businesses which the company may undertake  or to settle any deferred payments related to such acquisitions  or to raise capital for such acquisitions or deferred payments. The purpose of the authorisation to repurchase and to transfer shares is also to enable a continuous adjustment of the company's capital structure  thus contributing to increased shareholder value. For a valid resolution  the resolution must be supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting. Complete proposals  etc. The Annual Report for the financial year 2021  the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2021  the Nomination Committee's complete proposals and statement as well as the Board of Directors' complete proposals in accordance with the above  including reports and statements related thereto under the Swedish Companies Act  are available at the company and on the company's website www.eltelgroup.com and will also be sent to those shareholders who so request and provide their address.

A reissuance shall mean the board of directors’ access to issue new warrants as substitution for warrants that have already been issued but which have terminated.The principal terms and conditions which shall apply to the issued warrants are enclosed as Schedule 1 to the articles of association (Schedule 3). The board of directors shall be authorized to determine the detailed terms and conditions of the issued warrants and the distribution thereof in accordance with the terms and conditions set out in that schedule.For the issuance of warrants based on the above autorisation the following shall apply:Partial payment of the subscription amount is not permitted. The new shares will be without pre-emption rights for existing shareholders  and the pre-emption rights relating to the new shares will not be restricted in respect of future capital increases. The transferability of the new shares will not be restricted  and the new shareholders will not be obligated to let their shares be redeemed. The new shares will be issued through VP Securities A/S and will be admitted to trading and oﬃcial listing on the Exchange. The new shares will be issued in the name of the holder and will be negotiable instruments.It is proposed that the authorization to the board of directors to issue warrants is replacing the lapsed authorization in section 5.1 in the articles of association as set out in the draft new articles of association  enclosed as Schedule 3 to this notice.Re item 11. Proposal on issuance of warrantsIt is proposed to issue 368 540 warrants to the proposed two new board members of the company in the following order:Petra von Rohr should be granted 184 270 warrants and Ole Larsen should be granted 184 270 warrants.Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for 1 share in the company at a nominal value of DKK 0.01.The warrants shall be subject to the terms and conditions attached as Schedule 4 to the company’s articles of association (Schedule 3).In addition to this  and with reference to clause 167  referring to clause 154 and 158 of the Danish Companies Act  it is proposed that the following terms and conditions shall apply to the subscription of the warrants and the capital increase in the company relating the issuance of shares in the company that will occur in connection with a warrant holder’s exercise of warrants. Consequently  the following shall apply:The nominal value of the capital in-crease resulting from the exercise of warrants will be at least DKK 0.01 and maximum nominally DKK 3 685.40 always provided that the adjustment mechanism set out in section 11 of Schedule 4 to the company’s articles of association may result in a higher value. Each warrant gives the holder a right to subscribe for one ordinary share in the company with a nominal value of DKK 0.01 each. The new shares may be subscribed for against payment of a cash exercise price equivalent to the company’s volume weighted average share price in the 10 business days after the Date of Grant plus 10%. New shares issued on the basis of the warrants will confer upon the holders the right to receive dividend and other rights in the company from the time of registration with the Danish Business Authority of the capital increase connected to the issue of shares. The company will bear the costs of the issue of warrants and the subsequent exercise thereof. The company’s costs in connection with the issue and the resulting capital increase are estimated at DKK 25 000. The existing shareholders will have no pre-emption rights  as the shares are issued in favour of the relevant warrant holders by signing the attached subscription lists. Shares issued on the basis of warrants will not be subject to any restrictions in the pre-emption rights in connection with future capital increases. The new shares will be issued through VP Securities A/S and will be admitted to trading and oﬃcial listing on the Exchange. The new shares will be issued in the name of the holder and will be negotiable instruments.As a part of the issue of warrants  it is proposed to authorize the board of directors to resolve the pertaining capital increase  provided under section 155(2) of the Danish Companies Act  in accordance with this item 11 and to implement any necessary changes to the company’s articles of association.It is proposed that the issuance of the warrants is included as set out in the draft new articles of association  enclosed as Schedule 4 to this notice.Re Item 12. Proposal on authorization to the chairman of the meetingThe board of directors proposes to authorize the chairman of the general meeting – with right of substitution – to ﬁle the resolutions passed with the Danish Business Authority and to make such amendments to the resolutions passed by the general meeting which the Danish Business Authority might demand as a condition to register the resolutions passed by the general meeting.Additional informationAdoption requirementsThe approval of the board of directors’ proposals under agenda items 10a and 11 requires that both 2/3 of the cast votes as well as 2/3 of the share capital represented at the general meeting are in favour of the proposal.The remaining proposals on the agenda can be adopted by simple majority.Share capital and voting rightsAt the time of this notice  the share capital in Linkﬁre is nominally DKK 595 320.86 divided into 59.532.086 shares  each of a nominal value of DKK 0.01 each.

Fears eased in mid-March when the first interest payments due since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine came through  proving that at least some of the country’s borrowers could still service their foreign currency bonds. The relief was short-lived. In early April  an attempt to pay Russian government dollar-debt obligations was rejected by foreign banks  increasing the risk of the country’s first sovereign default since 1998.1. What went wrong?Russia’s Finance Ministry said it still made the payments by transferring the money in rubles to a special account for foreigners with the country’s National Settlement Depository  citing a local decree allowing foreign debt payments in local currency. However  neither of the securities involved allowed payment in rubles  according to bond documents. Credit assessors including Fitch Ratings and S&P Global have said Russia will be considered in default if it doesn’t pay coupon payments in dollars within a 30-day grace period. Shortly after the dollar payment was rejected  the cost of insuring Russia’s government debt surged to signal a record 99% chance of default within the year.Advertisement2. What’s obstructing Russian debt payments?Governments have frozen about half of Russia’s foreign reserves  sanctions have isolated its banking system and some payments are being delayed by banks doing lengthy checks that they aren’t breaching any restrictions. In early April  the U.S. Treasury halted dollar debt payments from Russia’s accounts at U.S. banks  depriving it of an important source of funds to cover its obligations. An exemption that’s allowed U.S. and overseas investors to continue receiving payments on Russian debt is set to expire at the end of May. State enterprises such as Gazprom PJSC and Rosneft PJSC have continued to honor their foreign debts  but Severstal PJSC ran out of time for an interest payment after Citigroup Inc. blocked it for fear of breaching sanctions. Russian Railways JSC and EuroChem have also missed payment deadlines as the cash got stuck for compliance checks on its way to investors. Moves by the world’s biggest clearing houses -- Clearstream and Euroclear -- to curb settlement services they provide for Russian bonds have further complicated the flow of funds.3. What’s the Russian government’s response?AdvertisementOfficials in Moscow have previously warned that Russia would be forced to pay in rubles if sanctions block the transfer of dollars or euros. Such a switch  if applied to all Russian debt  would widely be seen as a default. If it weren’t  the world “would be awash in Venezuelan bolivars and Argentine pesos ” according to Elena L. Daly  a sovereign debt restructuring lawyer based in Paris. It may work in some cases: Six of the government’s dollar and euro-denominated bonds have what’s known as “fallback optionality ” which would allow the borrower to pay in other currencies  and in some cases  the ruble. But there’s little sign that Russian firms would emulate the government and try to switch payments to rubles -- or that foreign investors would be willing to receive them.4. What happens next?The debacle takes Russia a step closer to its first sovereign default since shockwaves from the Asian debt crisis and tumbling oil prices pushed Boris Yeltsin’s government to renege on about $40 billion of domestic debt. It took Russia about six years to gain so-called investment-grade status  which meant it could be held by a broad pool of investors. Russia’s credit ratings were dramatically slashed after the Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine in a sudden fall from investment grade. It has been sanctioned in various ways by the U.S. and its allies since it annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014  though it has been building foreign reserves.Advertisement5. What principles are at stake?Russia’s situation is unusual because companies could possibly keep servicing their debt even if the sovereign defaults. Some of them sell bonds via foreign subsidiaries and have dollars offshore. Issuers also have a responsibility to treat all bondholders fairly and must follow the “pari passu” principle (Latin for “equal footing”)  meaning that they can’t treat holders of the same note differently. That idea played a role in Argentina in 2014  when it was blocked by a U.S. judge from paying some bondholders until it resolved a long-running legal saga between the government and holdouts led by Paul Singer’s Elliott Investment Management.6. What options do investors have?If bondholders don’t get paid  it’s likely the start of a very long  complicated process. History is an imperfect guide  but Russia already holds the record for the longest time between default and some form of resolution with creditors: After the Bolsheviks refused to service or recognize the czar’s debts a century ago  the Soviet Union signed an agreement to settle at least some of those claims in 1986. Even if many of the notes are governed by English law and hence bondholders can take the Russian government to court in England  any attempt to enforce an agreement now will likely involve Russian assets and Russian courts. How foreign investors will access them is hard to know at this stage. The price of Russia’s dollar-denominated debt plunged in expectation of a default  with bonds due in 2023 quoted at just over a third of their face value on April 5. It fell 11 cents on the dollar on the new U.S. restrictions.Advertisement7. Are investors insured?Some investors purchase credit-default swaps  or CDS  insurance-like instruments designed to cover losses if a country or company fails to meet its obligations. However  roughly $13 billion of Russian government debt could be ineligible  a panel of banks and investors ruled March 11  because of the possibility of ruble payments on six of the bonds.8. What’s the broader impact?Concerns about a Russian default are rippling through other emerging markets. A Russian sovereign default is no longer an “improbable event ” International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said March 13  though the exposure of global banks to Russia is “definitely not systemically relevant.” Some investors have warned that a Russian default could ultimately lead to a global sovereign debt crisis if investors start shunning risk and more countries are locked out of financial markets.Advertisement• The Odd Lots podcast looks at alternative payments clauses in Russian bonds.• Bloomberg’s Big Take on how Russia is spiraling toward default  how its economy might adapt and its high-wire act to avoid default.• A 2008 research paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research on the history of sovereign defaults in emerging markets.• Bloomberg Opinion’s Max Hastings on centuries of Russian brutality.• Bloomberg QuickTakes on the SWIFT payment system and the history of sanctions against Russia.• A statement by the U.S. Treasury Department on initial sanctions concerning Russian debt and the Treasury’s 2021 global sanctions review.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2022 Bloomberg L.P.GiftOutline Gift Article,negative,0.02,0.14,0.85,negative,0.01,0.08,0.92,True,English,"['Analysis', 'Sanctions', 'Russia', 'Brink', 'Default', 'sovereign debt restructuring lawyer', 'Russian government dollar-debt obligations', '30-day grace period', 'biggest clearing houses', 'Elena L.

2346,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.thejournal.ie/readme/ireland-tax-haven-ifsc-5730209-Apr2022/,Opinion: How can Ireland really help Ukraine? Stop bankrolling Russia's oligarchs,11 hours ago,IN 2018  RESEARCHERS investigating global tax evasion made a shocking discovery. With less than 0.1 per cent of the world’s population  Ireland was the biggest tax haven on the planet in 2015.Thomas Tørsløv and his colleagues made this discovery by highlighting an anomaly in the way profits were being declared in the state. Businesses usually announce profits of between 30 to 40% of their wages  but for Ireland  this figure was closer to 800%.This could only be explained in one of two ways. Either Irish workers were being hired for their superhuman abilities or their employers were funnelling vast profits made by foreign workers through the Irish taxation system. I want to make the case that the second explanation is the correct one.Ireland’s flawed systemSince the 1980s  Ireland has become one of the world’s most important offshore centres with an estimated €100 billion being moved through the state annually for no other reason than to avoid taxation (these are calculations in our book  Tax Haven Ireland). This has helped to enrich 10 to 15 of the world’s most powerful corporations  but there are wider geopolitical implications that stretch far beyond the avoidance of taxation.Offshore centres (OFCs) typically provide three strategic benefits for the owners of capital. Globally  it is estimated that they help corporations to avoid $4 trillion in taxes annually. This is equivalent to the entire German economy and this amount could prevent the deaths of millions of children denied public services as a result.The second key advantage is in the area of regulation. OFCs specialise in undermining the rules that regulate how businesses behave. They have been at the forefront of neoliberal policymaking since the 1980s  undermining workers’ rights and driving a long-term increase in global inequality.AdvertisementThe third key advantage is in the area of secrecy. OFCs specialise in shielding the owners of financial assets from public scrutiny. They help the world’s richest people to avoid control by democratic forces  and in-so-doing  create a grey area of illegality  exploited by those who want to shift resources without proper oversight.The offshore networks used by the corporate elite are also those used by criminal gangs  and in the case of the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC) – by Russian oligarchs.Ireland’s shadow banking systemOver the last decade  an enormous shadow banking system has grown up in Dublin. Ireland’s real economy is currently worth €250 billion  but according to the Central Bank  it has a shadow banking system worth €3.45 trillion – the fifth largest on the planet.‘Shadow banking’ refers to activity that takes place outside the regulatory system operated by the world’s central banks. In the official regime  banks accept financial oversight in return for security from taxpayers’ money. Regulation is meant to target their riskiest operations  and in return  financial organisations can avail of taxpayers’ money  if  and when  they find themselves in trouble.The Blanket Bank Guarantee Scheme is one example of this taxpayer-funded support. Operating in the shadows means none of this applies  however. Shadow banks can lend with much lower reserve requirements; they can trade without the normal regulatory supervision; they can move assets in ways that are incredibly hard to evaluate.This has made them attractive to wealthy investors  including a number of prominent Russian companies. Using Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) known as Section 110 Companies (named after the legislation that enacted them)  Russian investors raised €110 billion through the IFSC in the decade from 2007-2017. This was the second largest source of debt flowing into Russia from international markets and there were a number of characteristics that made these flows suspicious.Research by Cillian Doyle and Jim Stewart of Trinity College in 2020 showed that there were 121 Russian connected conduits (the technical term for shadow companies that act as intermediaries) operating out of the IFSC during the period in question  although many of them took steps to disguise their beneficial owners.More than half (66) were operating under charitable status for example  while a number of prospectus documents assured investors that the owners of the debt would not be disclosed on Clearstream (an important data-sharing website).The brass platesThe vehicles used to borrow this money had no assets or employees and despite the fact that a number of the bonds were never repaid  there were few reports of litigation.It is strange that creditors never took their debtors to court when they were not repaid  and for this reason  Doyle and Stewart hypothesise that much of this money is involved in a process known as ‘Round Tripping’.This refers to money moved out of Russia through clandestine routes only to be moved back in again as foreign direct investment. This further suggests that the people making the loans were also those receiving the money  often to avail of stronger property rights in the west  but sometimes for more nefarious reasons.The report found that seven firms connected with 13 conduits were identified by the Russian Central Bank as being subject to insider trading and market manipulation  while a number of the prospectus documents recognised that funds raised by conduits in the IFSC could be used for money laundering further down the chain.In other words  it is possible that conduits that were fully compliant under Irish law were being used by cross-border criminal organisations that took advantage of the lax regulation that was provided. There is also evidence that firms using Irish SPVs were able to evade NATO-based sanctions.SanctionsOne of Russia’s most important energy companies  Rosneft  was placed on a sanctions list following the annexation of Crimea in 2014 for example  but within a month the company had begun to funnel billions into its Russian operation using CBOM Finance Plc – a company operating out of the IFSC.The Irish government officially supports western sanctions and yet they were willing to tolerate clandestine flows back into Russia  presumably as collateral damage in support of their wider financial objectives.Doyle and Stewart list six Russian companies that were sanctioned by the Western powers and yet continued to raise money through Dublin. They also list six Russian banks with conduits based in the IFSC that provided finance for companies directly financing Russian military expenditure.#Open journalism No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you Support us nowSource: Brian O'BoyleThere is no suggestion that Dublin based SPVs lent directly to the Russian military  but they did funnel money to banks that lent to the Russian forces. In the wake of Putin’s invasion of Ukraine  the West has imposed biting sanctions on the Russian economy. The most serious have involved freezing the foreign assets of the Russian Central Bank in a bid to collapse the rouble.This is an extremely blunt instrument that will destroy the lives of ordinary Russians and  in this context  it is worth underlining that the western powers have not yet frozen all of the Russian assets in the western shadow banks.Establishment voices are increasingly belligerent in their attempt to use the invasion of Ukraine to undermine Ireland’s neutrality. What they won’t tell the public  however  is that the most effective thing that the government could do is to put itself on the side of peace and dismantle the shadow banking system that has helped to enrich US capitalists and Russian oligarchs alike.Brian O’Boyle lectures in economics at St Angela College  National University of Ireland  Galway.

Call Settlement Dates: If the Notes are called on any Observation Date starting on October 18  2022 and thereafter  the Call Settlement Date will be the Coupon Payment Date corresponding to that Observation Date.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesPayment if Called: If the Notes are automatically called  then  on the applicable Call Settlement Date  for each $1 000 principal amount  you will receive $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on that Call Settlement Date. Initial Stock Price: The closing price of the Reference Stock on the Trade Date. Final Stock Price: The closing price of the Reference Stock on the Valuation Date. Call Stock Price: 100% of the Initial Stock Price. Trigger Price and Coupon Barrier: 75% of the Initial Stock Price. Payment at Maturity (if not previously called and held to maturity): If the Notes are not previously called  we will pay you at maturity an amount based on the Final Stock Price of the Reference Stock: • If the Final Stock Price is greater than or equal to the Trigger Price  we will pay you a cash payment equal to the principal amount plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Maturity Date. • If the Final Stock Price is below the Trigger Price  you will receive at maturity  for each $1 000 in principal amount  a cash payment equal to: $1 000 + ($1 000 x Reference Stock Return) The amount of cash that you receive will be less than your principal amount  if anything  resulting in a loss that is proportionate to the decline of the Reference Stock from the Trade Date to the Valuation Date. Investors in the Notes will lose some or all of their principal amount if the Final Stock Price of the Reference Stock is less than the Trigger Price. Reference Stock Return: Final Stock Price – Initial Stock Price Initial Stock Price Stock Settlement: Not applicable. Payments on the Notes will be made solely in cash. Market Disruption Events: The occurrence of a market disruption event (or a non-trading day) as to the Reference Stock will result in the postponement of an Observation Date or the Valuation Date  as described in the product prospectus supplement. Calculation Agent: RBC Capital Markets  LLC (“RBCCM”) U.S. Tax Treatment: By purchasing a Note  each holder agrees (in the absence of a change in law  an administrative determination or a judicial ruling to the contrary) to treat the Notes as a callable pre-paid cash-settled contingent income-bearing derivative contract linked to the Reference Stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However  the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in the Notes are uncertain and the Internal Revenue Service could assert that the Notes should be taxed in a manner that is different from that described in the preceding sentence. Please see the section below  “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences ” and the discussion (including the opinion of Ashurst LLP  our special U.S. tax counsel) in the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021 under “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences ” which apply to the Notes. Secondary Market: RBCCM (or one of its affiliates)  though not obligated to do so  may maintain a secondary market in the Notes after the issue date. The amount that you may receive upon sale of your Notes prior to maturity may be less than the principal amount. Listing: The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Settlement: DTC global (including through its indirect participants Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg as described under “Ownership and Book-Entry Issuance” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021).Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesTerms Incorporated in the Master Note: All of the terms appearing on the cover page and above the item captioned “Secondary Market” on pages P-2 and P-3 of this terms supplement and the terms appearing under the caption “General Terms of the Notes” in the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021  as modified by this terms supplement.The Trade Date  issue date and other dates set forth above are subject to change  and will be set forth in the final pricing supplement relating to the Notes.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesADDITIONAL TERMS OF YOUR NOTESYou should read this terms supplement together with the prospectus dated September 14  2021  as supplemented by the prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021 and the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021  relating to our Senior Global Medium Term Notes  Series I  of which these Notes are a part.

The table illustrates the Payment at Maturity of the Notes (including the final Contingent Coupon  if payable) for a hypothetical range of performance for the Reference Stock  assuming the following terms and that the Notes are not automatically called prior to maturity:Hypothetical Initial Stock Price: $100.00* Hypothetical Trigger Price and Coupon Barrier: $75.00  which is 75% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Rate: 8.00% per annum (or 2.00% per quarter)  which is the midpoint of the Contingent Coupon Rate range set forth above. Hypothetical Contingent Coupon Amount: $20.00 per quarter Observation Dates: Quarterly Principal Amount: $1 000 per Note* The hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $100 used in the examples below has been chosen for illustrative purposes only and does not represent the expected actual Initial Stock Price. The actual Initial Stock Price will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement relating to the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Prices are shown in the first column on the left. The second column shows the Payment at Maturity for a range of Final Stock Prices on the Valuation Date. The third column shows the amount of cash to be paid on the Notes per $1 000 in principal amount. If the Notes are called prior to maturity  the hypothetical examples below will not be relevant  and you will receive on the applicable Coupon Payment Date  for each $1 000 principal amount  $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes.Hypothetical Final Stock Price of the Reference Stock Payment at Maturity as Percentage of Principal Amount Payment at Maturity (assuming that the Notes were not previously called) $150.00 102.00%* $1 020.00* $140.00 102.00%* $1 020.00* $130.00 102.00%* $1 020.00* $120.00 102.00%* $1 020.00* $110.00 102.00%* $1 020.00* $100.00 102.00%* $1 020.00* $90.00 102.00%* $1 020.00* $80.00 102.00%* $1 020.00* $75.00 102.00%* $1 020.00* $74.99 74.99% $749.90 $70.00 70.00% $700.00 $60.00 60.00% $600.00 $50.00 50.00% $500.00 $40.00 40.00% $400.00 $30.00 30.00% $300.00 $20.00 20.00% $200.00 $10.00 10.00% $100.00 $0.00 0% $0.00 * Including the final Contingent Coupon  if payable.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesHypothetical Examples of Amounts Payable at MaturityThe following hypothetical examples illustrate how the payments at maturity set forth in the table above are calculated  assuming the Notes have not been called.Example 1: The price of the Reference Stock increases by 25% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $125.00. Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 25% appreciation in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 2: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 10% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $90.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the Notes  a cash payment of $1 000 per Note  despite the 10% decline in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 3: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 60% from the Initial Stock Price of $100.00 to the Final Stock Price of $40.00 . Because the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price and its Coupon Barrier  the final Contingent Coupon will not be payable on the Maturity Date  and we will pay only $400.00 for each $1 000 in the principal amount of the Notes  calculated as follows:Principal Amount + (Principal Amount x Reference Stock Return)= $1 000 + ($1 000 x -60.00%) = $1 000 - $600.00 = $400.00* * *The Payments at Maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on theoretical prices of the Reference Stock that may not be achieved on the Valuation Date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your Notes on the Maturity Date or at any other time  including any time you may wish to sell your Notes  may bear little relation to the hypothetical Payments at Maturity shown above  and those amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the Notes.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesSELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONSAn investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Stock. These risks are explained in more detail in the section “Risk Factors” in the product prospectus supplement. In addition to the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the product prospectus supplement  you should consider the following:Risks Relating to the Terms of the Notes• You May Lose All or a Portion of the Principal Amount at Maturity — Investors in the Notes could lose all or a substantial portion of their principal amount if there is a decline in the trading price of the Reference Stock between the Trade Date and the Valuation Date. If the Notes are not automatically called and the Final Stock Price is less than the Trigger Price  the amount that you receive at maturity will represent a loss of your principal that is proportionate to the decline in the closing price of the Reference Stock from the Trade Date to the Valuation Date. Any Contingent Coupons received on the Notes prior to the Maturity Date may not be sufficient to compensate for any such loss.• The Notes Are Subject to an Automatic Call — If on any Observation Date beginning in October 2022  the closing price of the Reference Stock is greater than or equal to the Call Stock Price  then the Notes will be automatically called. If the Notes are automatically called  then  on the applicable Call Settlement Date  for each $1 000 in principal amount  you will receive $1 000 plus the Contingent Coupon otherwise due on the applicable Call Settlement Date. You will not receive any Contingent Coupons after the Call Settlement Date. You may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from the automatic call in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on the Notes would have been if they had not been called.• You May Not Receive Any Contingent Coupons — We will not necessarily make any coupon payments on the Notes. If the closing price of the Reference Stock on an Observation Date is less than the Coupon Barrier  we will not pay you the Contingent Coupon applicable to that Observation Date. If the closing price of the Reference Stock is less than the Coupon Barrier on each of the Observation Dates and on the Valuation Date  we will not pay you any Contingent Coupons during the term of  and you will not receive a positive return on your Notes. Generally  this non-payment of the Contingent Coupon coincides with a period of greater risk of principal loss on your Notes. Accordingly  if we do not pay the Contingent Coupon on the Maturity Date  you will also incur a loss of principal  because the Final Stock Price will be less than the Trigger Price.• The Call Feature and the Contingent Coupon Feature Limit Your Potential Return — The return potential of the Notes is limited to the pre-specified Contingent Coupon Rate  regardless of the appreciation of the Reference Stock. In addition  the total return on the Notes will vary based on the number of Observation Dates on which the Contingent Coupon becomes payable prior to maturity or an automatic call. Further  if the Notes are called due to the Call Feature  you will not receive any Contingent Coupons or any other payment in respect of any Observation Dates after the applicable Call Settlement Date. Since the Notes could be called as early as the second Observation Date  the total return on the Notes could be minimal. If the Notes are not called  you may be subject to the full downside performance of the Reference Stock even though your potential return is limited to the Contingent Coupon Rate. As a result  the return on an investment in the Notes could be less than the return on a direct investment in the Reference Stock.• Your Return on the Notes May Be Lower than the Return on a Conventional Debt Security of Comparable Maturity — The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you bought a conventional senior interest bearing debt security of Royal Bank.• Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Changes in Our Credit Ratings Are Expected to Affect the Market Value of the Notes — The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result  your receipt of any Contingent Coupons  if payable  and the amount due on any relevant payment date is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations on the applicable payment dates. This will be the case even if the price of the Reference Stock increases after the Trade Date. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be at any time during the term of the Notes.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesRisks Relating to the Secondary Market for the Notes• There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes-Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses — There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. RBCCM and our other affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. RBCCM or any other affiliate of ours may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and asked prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.Risks Relating to the Initial Estimated Value of the Notes• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Less than the Price to the Public — The initial estimated value that will be set forth in the final pricing supplement for the Notes does not represent a minimum price at which we  RBCCM or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase the Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity  their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and the initial estimated value. This is due to  among other things  changes in the price of the Reference Stock  the borrowing rate we pay to issue securities of this kind  and the inclusion in the price to the public of the underwriting discount and the estimated costs relating to our hedging of the Notes. These factors  together with various credit  market and economic factors over the term of the Notes  are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors  the price  if any  at which you may be able to sell your Notes prior to maturity may be less than your original purchase price  as any such sale price would not be expected to include the underwriting discount and the hedging costs relating to the Notes. In addition to bid-ask spreads  the value of the Notes determined by RBCCM for any secondary market price is expected to be based on the secondary rate rather than the internal funding rate used to price the Notes and determine the initial estimated value. As a result  the secondary price will be less than if the internal funding rate was used. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly  you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes that We Will Provide in the Final Pricing Supplement Will Be an Estimate Only  Calculated as of the Time the Terms of the Notes Are Set — The initial estimated value of the Notes will be based on the value of our obligation to make the payments on the Notes  together with the mid-market value of the derivative embedded in the terms of the Notes. See “Structuring the Notes” below. Our estimate will be based on a variety of assumptions  including our credit spreads  expectations as to dividends  interest rates and volatility  and the expected term of the Notes. These assumptions are based on certain forecasts about future events  which may prove to be incorrect. Other entities may value the Notes or similar securities at a price that is significantly different than we do.The value of the Notes at any time after the Trade Date will vary based on many factors  including changes in market conditions  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result  the actual value you would receive if you sold the Notes in any secondary market  if any  should be expected to differ materially from the initial estimated value of your Notes.Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest and Our Trading Activities• Our Business Activities May Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates expect to engage in trading activities related to the Reference Stock that are not for the account of holders of the Notes or on their behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders’ interests in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for their customers and in accounts under their management. These trading activities  if they influence the share price of the Reference Stock  could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. We and one or more of our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with the Reference Stock Issuer  including making loans to or providing advisory services. These services could include investment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These activities may present a conflict between our or one or more of our affiliates’ obligations and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to theAuto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesReference Stock. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the share price of the Reference Stock  and  therefore  the market value of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Reference Stock• Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Reference Stock — The return on your Notes is unlikely to reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned shares of the Reference Stock. For instance  you will not receive or be entitled to receive any dividend payments or other distributions on the Reference Stock during the term of your Notes. As an owner of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or any other rights that holders of the Reference Stock may have. Furthermore  the Reference Stock may appreciate substantially during the term of the Notes  while your potential return will be limited to the applicable Contingent Coupon payments.• There Is No Affiliation Between the Reference Stock Issuer and RBCCM  and RBCCM Is Not Responsible for any Disclosure by the Reference Stock Issuer — We are not affiliated with the Reference Stock Issuer. However  we and our affiliates may currently  or from time to time in the future engage  in business with the Reference Stock Issuer. Nevertheless  neither we nor our affiliates assume any responsibilities for the accuracy or the completeness of any information that any other company prepares. You  as an investor in the Notes  should make your own investigation into the Reference Stock. The Reference Stock Issuer is not involved in this offering and has no obligation of any sort with respect to your Notes. The Reference Stock Issuer has no obligation to take your interests into consideration for any reason  including when taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of your Notes.• The Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Market Disruption Events and Adjustments — The payment at maturity  each Observation Date and the Valuation Date are subject to adjustment as described in the product prospectus supplement. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see “General Terms of the Notes—Market Disruption Events” in the product prospectus supplement.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesINFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE STOCK ISSUERThe Reference Stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”). Companies with securities registered under that Act are required to file periodically certain financial and other information specified by the SEC. Information filed with the SEC can be obtained through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. In addition  information regarding the Reference Stock may be obtained from other sources including  but not limited to  press releases  newspaper articles and other publicly disseminated documents.The following information regarding the Reference Stock Issuer is derived from publicly available information.We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of reports filed by the Reference Stock Issuer with the SEC  information published by it on its website or in any other format  information about it obtained from any other source or the information provided below.We obtained the information regarding the historical performance of the Reference Stock set forth below from Bloomberg Financial Markets.NIKE  Inc.NIKE  Inc. designs  develops  and markets athletic footwear  apparel  equipment  and accessory products for men  women  and children. The company sells its products to retail stores  through its own stores  subsidiaries  and distributors.The company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “NIKE"".Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesHistorical InformationThe graph below illustrates the performance of the Reference Stock from January 1  2012 to April 4  2022   reflecting a hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $134.34  which was its closing price on April 4  2022. The red line represents a hypothetical Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price of $100.76  which is equal to 75% of the hypothetical Initial Stock Price ( rounded to two decimal places). The actual Coupon Barrier and Trigger Price will be based on the closing price of the Reference Stock on the Trade Date.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesSUPPLEMENTAL DISCUSSION OFU.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCESThe following disclosure supplements  and to the extent inconsistent supersedes  the discussion in the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021 under “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences.”Under Section 871(m) of the Code  a “dividend equivalent” payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States. Such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a non-U.S. holder. Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations  payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (“ELIs”) that are “specified ELIs” may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference  directly or indirectly  an interest in an “underlying security ” which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However  the IRS has issued guidance that states that the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the effective dates of the U.S. Treasury Department regulations to provide that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1  2023. Based on our determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments  non-U.S. holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments  if any  under the Notes. However  it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Reference Stock or the Notes  and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. holders that enter  or have entered  into other transactions in respect of the Reference Stock or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding  we (or the applicable withholding agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on or about April 21  2022  which is the third (3rd) business day following the Trade Date (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+3”). See “Plan of Distribution” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021. For additional information as to the relationship between us and RBCCM  please see the section “Plan of Distribution—Conflicts of Interest” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021.We expect to deliver the Notes on a date that is greater than two business days following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act  trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days  unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than two business days prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.In the initial offering of the Notes  they will be offered to investors at a purchase price equal to par  except with respect to certain accounts as indicated on the cover page of this document. In addition to the underwriting discount set forth on the cover page  we or one of our affiliates may also pay an expected fee to a broker-dealer that is unaffiliated with us for providing certain electronic platform services with respect to this offering.The value of the Notes shown on your account statement may be based on RBCCM’s estimate of the value of the Notes if RBCCM or another of our affiliates were to make a market in the Notes (which it is not obligated to do). That estimate will be based upon the price that RBCCM may pay for the Notes in light of then prevailing market conditions  our creditworthiness and transaction costs. For a period of approximately 6 months after the issue date of the Notes  the value of the Notes that may be shown on your account statement may be higher than RBCCM’s estimated value of the Notes at that time. This is because the estimated value of the Notes will not include the underwriting discount and our hedging costs and profits; however  the value of the Notes shown on your account statement during that period may initially be a higher amount  reflecting the addition of RBCCM’s underwriting discount and our estimated costs and profits from hedging the Notes. This excess is expected to decrease over time until the end of this period. After this period  if RBCCM repurchases your Notes  it expects to do so at prices that reflect their estimated value.We may use this terms supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition  RBCCM or another of our affiliates may use this terms supplement in a market-making transaction in the Notes after their initial sale. Unless we or our agent informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this terms supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.Auto-Callable Contingent Coupon Barrier NotesSTRUCTURING THE NOTESThe Notes are our debt securities  the return on which is linked to the performance of the Reference Stock. As is the case for all of our debt securities  including our structured notes  the economic terms of the Notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition  because structured notes result in increased operational  funding and liability management costs to us  we typically borrow the funds under these Notes at a rate that is more favorable to us than the rate that we might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity. Using this relatively lower implied borrowing rate rather than the secondary market rate  is a factor that is likely to reduce the initial estimated value of the Notes at the time their terms are set. Unlike the estimated value that will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement  any value of the Notes determined for purposes of a secondary market transaction may be based on a different funding rate  which may result in a lower value for the Notes than if our initial internal funding rate were used.In order to satisfy our payment obligations under the Notes  we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options  put options or other derivatives) on the issue date with RBCCM or one of our other subsidiaries. The terms of these hedging arrangements take into account a number of factors  including our creditworthiness  interest rate movements  the volatility of the Reference Stock  and the tenor of the Notes. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.The lower implied borrowing rate is a factor that reduces the economic terms of the Notes to you. The initial offering price of the Notes also reflects the underwriting commission and our estimated hedging costs. These factors result in the initial estimated value for the Notes on the Trade Date being less than their public offering price.

Investors Keep Watch,War  sanctions and disrupted payment chains have left the holders of about $150 billion in bonds sold by Russia and its companies abroad bracing for defaults. Fears eased in mid-March when the first interest payments due since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine came through ,War  sanctions and disrupted payment systems have left the holders of about $150 billion in bonds sold by Russia and its companies abroad bracing for defaults. Fears eased in mid-March when the first interest payments due since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine came through  proving that at least some of the country’s borrowers could still service their foreign currency bonds. The relief was short-lived. In early April  an attempt to pay Russian government dollar-debt obligations was rejected by foreign banks  increasing the risk of the country’s first sovereign default since 1998.1. What went wrong?Russia’s Finance Ministry said it still made the payments by transferring the money in rubles to a special account for foreigners with the country’s National Settlement Depository  citing a local decree allowing foreign debt payments in local currency. However  neither of the securities involved allowed payment in rubles  according to bond documents. Credit assessors including Fitch Ratings and S&P Global have said Russia will be considered in default if it doesn’t pay coupon payments in dollars within a 30-day grace period. Shortly after the dollar payment was rejected  the cost of insuring Russia’s government debt surged to signal a record 99% chance of default within the year.Advertisement2. What’s obstructing Russian debt payments?Governments have frozen about half of Russia’s foreign reserves  sanctions have isolated its banking system and some payments are being delayed by banks doing lengthy checks that they aren’t breaching any restrictions. In early April  the U.S. Treasury halted dollar debt payments from Russia’s accounts at U.S. banks  depriving it of an important source of funds to cover its obligations. An exemption that’s allowed U.S. and overseas investors to continue receiving payments on Russian debt is set to expire at the end of May. State enterprises such as Gazprom PJSC and Rosneft PJSC have continued to honor their foreign debts  but Severstal PJSC ran out of time for an interest payment after Citigroup Inc. blocked it for fear of breaching sanctions. Russian Railways JSC and EuroChem have also missed payment deadlines as the cash got stuck for compliance checks on its way to investors. Moves by the world’s biggest clearing houses -- Clearstream and Euroclear -- to curb settlement services they provide for Russian bonds have further complicated the flow of funds.3. What’s the Russian government’s response?AdvertisementOfficials in Moscow have previously warned that Russia would be forced to pay in rubles if sanctions block the transfer of dollars or euros. Such a switch  if applied to all Russian debt  would widely be seen as a default. If it weren’t  the world “would be awash in Venezuelan bolivars and Argentine pesos ” according to Elena L. Daly  a sovereign debt restructuring lawyer based in Paris. It may work in some cases: Six of the government’s dollar and euro-denominated bonds have what’s known as “fallback optionality ” which would allow the borrower to pay in other currencies  and in some cases  the ruble. But there’s little sign that Russian firms would emulate the government and try to switch payments to rubles -- or that foreign investors would be willing to receive them.4. What happens next?The debacle takes Russia a step closer to its first sovereign default since shockwaves from the Asian debt crisis and tumbling oil prices pushed Boris Yeltsin’s government to renege on about $40 billion of domestic debt. It took Russia about six years to gain so-called investment-grade status  which meant it could be held by a broad pool of investors. Russia’s credit ratings were dramatically slashed after the Feb. 24 attack on Ukraine in a sudden fall from investment grade. It has been sanctioned in various ways by the U.S. and its allies since it annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014  though it has been building foreign reserves.Advertisement5. What principles are at stake?Russia’s situation is unusual because companies could possibly keep servicing their debt even if the sovereign defaults. Some of them sell bonds via foreign subsidiaries and have dollars offshore. Issuers also have a responsibility to treat all bondholders fairly and must follow the “pari passu” principle (Latin for “equal footing”)  meaning that they can’t treat holders of the same note differently. That idea played a role in Argentina in 2014  when it was blocked by a U.S. judge from paying some bondholders until it resolved a long-running legal saga between the government and holdouts led by Paul Singer’s Elliott Investment Management.6. What options do investors have?If bondholders don’t get paid  it’s likely the start of a very long  complicated process. History is an imperfect guide  but Russia already holds the record for the longest time between default and some form of resolution with creditors: After the Bolsheviks refused to service or recognize the czar’s debts a century ago  the Soviet Union signed an agreement to settle at least some of those claims in 1986. Even if many of the notes are governed by English law and hence bondholders can take the Russian government to court in England  any attempt to enforce an agreement now will likely involve Russian assets and Russian courts. How foreign investors will access them is hard to know at this stage. The price of Russia’s dollar-denominated debt plunged in expectation of a default  with bonds due in 2023 quoted at just over a third of their face value on April 5. It fell 11 cents on the dollar on the new U.S. restrictions.Advertisement7. Are investors insured?Some investors purchase credit-default swaps  or CDS  insurance-like instruments designed to cover losses if a country or company fails to meet its obligations. However  roughly $13 billion of Russian government debt could be ineligible  a panel of banks and investors ruled March 11  because of the possibility of ruble payments on six of the bonds.8. What’s the broader impact?Concerns about a Russian default are rippling through other emerging markets. A Russian sovereign default is no longer an “improbable event ” International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said March 13  though the exposure of global banks to Russia is “definitely not systemically relevant.” Some investors have warned that a Russian default could ultimately lead to a global sovereign debt crisis if investors start shunning risk and more countries are locked out of financial markets.Advertisement• The Odd Lots podcast looks at alternative payments clauses in Russian bonds.• Bloomberg’s Big Take on how Russia is spiraling toward default  how its economy might adapt and its high-wire act to avoid default.• A 2008 research paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research on the history of sovereign defaults in emerging markets.• Bloomberg Opinion’s Max Hastings on centuries of Russian brutality.• Bloomberg QuickTakes on the SWIFT payment system and the history of sanctions against Russia.• A statement by the U.S. Treasury Department on initial sanctions concerning Russian debt and the Treasury’s 2021 global sanctions review.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2022 Bloomberg L.P.GiftOutline Gift Article,negative,0.02,0.46,0.52,negative,0.01,0.08,0.92,True,English,"['Russian Bonds', 'Investors', 'sovereign debt restructuring lawyer', 'Russian government dollar-debt obligations', '30-day grace period', 'biggest clearing houses', 'Elena L.

The trial was conducted by the Nordic Society of Pediatric Haematology and Oncology (NOPHO) at 21 clinical sites in the Nordic and Baltic countries of Europe and enrolled 55 patients. Primary objectives of the trial were asparaginase enzyme activity and safety. Both endpoints were met.Eryaspase demonstrated sustained asparaginase enzyme activity above the threshold of >100 U/L at trough levels 14 days after first infusion in 92.5% of patients. Eryaspase was generally well tolerated when added to chemotherapy and almost all patients were able to receive the intended courses of asparaginase (median of 5 doses per patient). Of the 55 patients  only 2 patients had severe allergic reaction and withdrew eryaspase treatment.The Principal Investigator  Dr. Birgitte Klug Albertsen  Associate Professor at Aarhus University Hospital  Denmark  commented  ""I am grateful that the editors of the British Journal of Haematology selected our study for publication. The study demonstrated that eryaspase  given as a convenient schedule every two weeks  provides a sustained asparaginase enzyme activity level above the recommended threshold for other Asparaginase treatments  few hypersensitivity reactions and is generally well tolerated in combination with chemotherapy. We conclude that eryaspase seems to be a promising treatment alternative for ALL patients with hypersensitivity to PEG-asparaginase.”Story continues“We are proud to be working with the NOPHO group in conducting this study in ALL  and hopeful that study results provide the possibility of an alternative treatment for ALL patients with hypersensitivity to PEG-asparaginase.” said Dr. Iman El-Hariry  ERYTECH’s Chief Medical Officer. “We have an ongoing dialogue with the U.S. FDA regarding a potential regulatory approval in this indication based on the NOPHO-sponsored trial.”The paper: “Asparaginase Encapsulated in Erythrocytes as Second-line Treatment in Hypersensitive Patients with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia” by Line Stensig Lynggaard  Goda Vaitkeviciene  Cecilia Langenskiöld  Anne Kristine Lehmann  Päivi M.

More than 13 000 cases are diagnosed in the US and Europe each year with the majority of patients diagnosedbefore age 20. Asparaginase has been an integral component of ALL treatment for several years but is associated with treatment- limiting hypersensitivity in up to 30% of patients. Discontinuation of asparaginase therapy in ALL patients has been associated withinferior event free survival highlighting the need for additional asparaginase based treatment options.About ERYTECH and eryaspase (GRASPA®)ERYTECH is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative red blood cell-based therapeutics for severe forms of cancer and orphan diseases. Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS® platform  which uses a novel technology to encapsulate drug substances inside red blood cells  ERYTECH is developing a pipeline of product candidates for patients with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH’s primary focus is on the development of product candidates that target the altered metabolism of cancer cells by depriving them of amino acids necessary for their growth and survival.The Company’s lead product candidate  eryaspase  which consists of L-asparaginase encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells  targets the cancer cells’ altered asparagine and glutamine metabolism. The proof of concept of eryaspase as a cancer metabolism agent was established in different trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and pancreatic cancer. An investigator sponsored Phase 2 trial (IST) evaluating the use of eryaspase in ALL patients who developed hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase recently reported positive results  based on which the Company intends to request approval in the United States and potentially other territories. The Company is also pursuing a Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial in first-line pancreatic cancer.Eryaspase received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who have developed hypersensitivity reactions to E. coli-derived pegylated asparaginase. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency have granted eryaspase orphan drug status for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and ALL.ERYTECH produces its product candidates for treatment of patients in Europe at its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France  and for patients in the United States at its GMP manufacturing site in Princeton  New Jersey  USA. Eryaspase is not an approved medicine.ERYTECH is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States (ticker: ERYP) and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0011471135  ticker: ERYP).

The Company's technology is based on pioneering research in ""host defense peptides"" – nature's first line of defense towards foreign pathogens. Lytix Biopharma's lead product  LTX-315  is a first-in-class oncolytic molecule representing a new and superior in situ therapeutic vaccination principle to boost anti-cancer immunity  with the potential to be the ideal combination partner with other types of immunotherapies. LTX-315 target cancer cells and disintegrate their cell membranes  causing immunogenic cell death and release of a patient's tumor specific antigens. This mode of action allows cytotoxic T cells to recognize  infiltrate  and attack cancer cells. The Company was listed on Euronext Growth in Oslo in June 2021  following a private placement covered by investors such as PBM Capital  a U.S. based  healthcare-focused investment firm. For more information  visit www.lytixbiopharma.com.About LTX-315LTX-315 is a potential first-in-class oncolytic molecule administered directly into a tumor to induce immunogenic cell death  which may offer a non-surgical option for patients suffering from skin cancer. The technology is based on pioneering research in ""host defense peptides"" – nature's first line of defense towards foreign pathogens. LTX-315 has demonstrated positive tumor-specific immune cell responses in multi-indication Phase I/II oncology trials.About in situ vaccinationIn situ vaccination stimulates a patient's immune system by injecting drugs with the ability to kill cancer cells straight into the tumor environment. Lytix Biopharma has applied this approach with its first-in-class oncolytic molecules  representing an alternative and unique approach to cancer vaccination. Importantly  this approach generates an immune response against a broad antigen repertoire without pre-identifying the antigens  which in turn can save considerable costs and valuable time.This information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/lytix-biopharma-as/r/lytix-biopharma-receives-milestone-payment-from-verrica-pharmaceuticals-inc--triggered-by-first-pati c2839791CisionView original content:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/lytix-biopharma-receives-milestone-payment-from-verrica-pharmaceuticals-inc-triggered-by-first-patient-dosed-with-ltx-315-301518470.htmlSOURCE Lytix Biopharma AS",neutral,0.03,0.94,0.03,mixed,0.32,0.23,0.46,True,English,"['Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc', 'Lytix Biopharma', 'milestone payment', 'first patient', 'LTX-3', 'U.S. based, healthcare-focused investment firm', 'superior in situ therapeutic vaccination principle', 'multi-indication Phase I/II oncology trials', 'positive tumor-specific immune cell responses', 'exclusive worldwide license agreement', 'situ vaccination technology platform', 'USD 1 million milestone payment', 'LTX-315 target cancer cells', 'Phase II study', 'dermatologic oncology conditions', 'Phase II trial', 'dermatologic oncology indications', 'squamous cell carcinomas', 'high unmet need', 'worldwide annual sales', 'ideal combination partner', 'immunogenic cell death', 'broad antigen repertoire', 'cytotoxic T cells', 'Non-melanoma skin cancers', 'contingent regulatory milestones', 'basal cell carcinoma', 'novel oncolytic molecule', 'host defense peptides', '3-4 million patients', 'non-surgical treatment option', 'clinical-stage biotech company', 'Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.', 'class oncolytic molecules', 'novel cancer immunotherapies', 'new treatment options', 'tumor specific antigens', 'Lytix Biopharma AS', 'potential new treatment', 'cancer vaccination', '5 million diagnoses', 'sales milestones', 'cell membranes', 'immune system', 'immune response', 'cancer indications', 'clinical-stage company', 'clinical trial', 'surgical option', 'licensing agreement', 'cancer therapy', 'common form', 'new treatments', 'upfront payment', 'aggregate payments', 'tiered royalties', 'full announcement', 'pioneering research', 'foreign pathogens', 'lead product', 'anti-cancer immunity', 'other types', 'Euronext Growth', 'private placement', 'PBM Capital', 'tumor environment', 'considerable costs', 'valuable time', 'original content', 'first line', 'Øystein Rekdal', 'development goals', 'The Company', 'unique approach', 'first patient', 'news.cision', 'OSLO', 'Norway', 'April', 'PRNewswire', 'accordance', 'parties', 'CEO', 'August', 'terms', 'achievement', 'addition', 'Story', 'verrica-pharmaceuticals', 'phase-2-study', 'oncolytic-peptide-based-immunotherapy', 'cell-carcinoma', 'information', 'clinicaltrials', 'Telephone', 'mail', 'Oystein', 'lytixbiopharma', 'area', 'nature', 'release', 'mode', 'action', 'June', 'investors', 'drugs', 'ability', 'alternative', 'turn', 'lytix-biopharma', 'first-pati']",2022-04-05,2022-04-06,finance.yahoo.com

These data emphasize ABX464's capacity to maintain and further improve patient-outcomes over time  as well as its continued favorable safety and tolerability.Prof. William Sandborn  M.D.  University of California San Diego School of Medicine and Co-Founder and Chief Medical Officer at Shoreline Biosciences  CA  said: ""The data of these patients treated for one year in this phase 2b maintenance study confirm the previous  positive observations made with ABX464 in the phase 2a. Currently  many patients stop responding or do not respond at all to available therapies. These results are encouraging as they suggest that ABX464 can induce short-term and  more importantly  maintain and even improve long-term efficacy in patients with in moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. The good safety and tolerability profile seen in the phase 2b is also very encouraging.""Story continuesProf. Bruce Sands  M.D.  M.S.  the Dr. Burrill B. Crohn Professor of Medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai  New York City  NY  added[1]:""These maintenance data indicate that ABX464 may change the treatment paradigm for bio-naïve as well as refractory ulcerative colitis patients. ABX464 showed a solid and durable efficacy signal along with a good tolerability profile  which differentiates it from many other products on the market or in late-stage testing in UC. Beyond efficacy and safety  ABX464 also offers convenient once-daily oral administration.""Prof. Hartmut J. Ehrlich  M.D.  CEO of Abivax  said: ""We are very pleased with the results of the phase 2b maintenance study with ABX464 after the first year of continued daily treatment. 65.3% of patients with at least a clinical response at the end of induction were in clinical remission after one year  which confirms the outcome of the phase 2a study with 66.7%. These are best-in-class results  demonstrating that the unique mechanism of action of our drug-candidate can induce high rates of durable clinical remissions in patients suffering from moderate to severe ulcerative colitis. Along with the maintenance data recently reported from our phase 2a trial in rheumatoid arthritis  these results further underpin the capacity of ABX464 to effectively address a broad range of chronic inflammatory diseases. Abivax will be initiating the ABX464 phase 3 program in UC soon  with a first patient to be included in Q3 2022. We want to make this potentially transformative drug-candidate available as quickly as possible to patients suffering from ulcerative colitis and possibly further chronic inflammatory indications.""ABX464 phase 2b clinical maintenance study in ulcerative colitis97.7% (217/222) of all patients who completed the phase 2b induction study  irrespective of treatments or treatment outcome during the induction phase  enrolled in the open-label maintenance study to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy profile of ABX464 for up to two years.The interim analysis after one year of treatment from the phase 2b open-label extension study in UC included all 217 patients who enrolled into the maintenance study with ABX464.At week 48Full analysis setn=217(Non-responder imputation)Clinical remission[2]n= 120 (55.3%)Endoscopic improvement[3]n=134 (61.8%)Endoscopic remission[4]n= 73 (33.6%)Clinical response[5]n=175 (80.6%)Maintained clinical remission at week 48n=38/52 (73.1%)* Drop-outs (33 patients) were considered as treatment failures in the full analysis set.Main efficacy endpoints according to clinical response status at end of the induction (week 8):At week 48Patients with clinical response after inductionn=121Patients without clinical response after inductionn=96Clinical remissionn=79 (65.3%)n=41 (42.7%)Endoscopic improvementn=85 (70.2%)n=49 (51.0%)Endoscopic remissionn=46 (38.0%)n=26 (27.1%)Among the 217 patients who completed the first year of 50mg once-daily oral dosing with ABX464  52 had entered the maintenance study already in clinical remission. 38 (73.1%) out of these 52 patients stayed in clinical remission during this first year of maintenance treatment. It is remarkable that 82/165 (49.7%) patients who were not in clinical remission at the end of induction achieved a de novo clinical remission during the first year of maintenance.Furthermore  the clinical remission rate for patients who did not show at least a clinical response at the end of the induction phase was 42.7% (full analysis set) after 48 weeks of treatment  demonstrating that long-term administration of ABX464 provided substantial clinical benefits also for these patients.33/217 (15.2%) of patients dropped out during the first 48 weeks of the phase 2b maintenance study. Worsening of UC was the primary cause of premature study discontinuation (10 patients - 30%). These patients were all considered as treatment failures in the full analysis set.During the induction and the maintenance phases of the phase 2b study  ABX464 continued to show a good safety and tolerability profile  confirming the data already generated in over 1 000 patients and volunteers treated with ABX464 so far.[6]254 patients with moderate to severe active ulcerative colitis were enrolled into the phase 2b clinical study and dosed within three once-daily oral ABX464 treatment groups (25mg  50mg and 100mg) or placebo. 50% of these patients had inadequate response  loss of response  or intolerance to biologics and/or JAK inhibitor treatments while the other 50% were refractory to conventional treatments. Endoscopies were read centrally and blinded by independent reviewers. The baseline disease characteristics were well balanced across all ABX464 dose groups and the placebo group. Enrolled patients suffered from longstanding UC with an overall mean disease duration of 8.05 years and 71.4% of the patients showed a severe disease profile (baseline modified Mayo Score of 7 to 9 points).Impact of the war in Ukraine on Abivax's phase 2b clinical studyThe ABX464 phase 2b maintenance study in moderate to severe UC patients is the only trial currently conducted by Abivax on Ukrainian territory. The evaluation after 12 months of treatment had already been conducted for all Ukrainian patients prior to the outbreak of the war and are taken into account in the one-year results presented in this press release.ABX464 phase 1 clinical studiesAbivax conducts four phase 1 studies with ABX464 in healthy volunteers  as part of the usual practice during late-stage clinical drug development.The patient enrollment has been completed in all studies and the data analysis is progressing according to plan.The currently available preliminary results are all supportive in advancing ABX464 into the pivotal phase 3 program.ABX464 global pivotal phase 3 clinical program in ulcerative colitisIn December 2021 and January 2022 respectively  the US regulatory agency (FDA) as well as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) expressed their support in moving ABX464 into a pivotal phase 3 program in moderate to severe UC. The agencies raised no concerns regarding clinical safety  non-clinical safety  or CMC.Both the FDA and EMA agreed with Abivax that progressing 25mg and 50mg (as the highest dose) into phase 3 testing is appropriate for both induction and the subsequent maintenance studies in UC. The agencies were supportive of Abivax's intention to drop the 100mg dose  as no additional therapeutic benefit could be observed with this higher dose.Abivax is working with IQVIA  a global premier CRO  to jointly set-up and conduct these studies across Europe  the US  Japan and other global geographies. Given the current developments  Abivax decided that Ukraine  Russia and Belarus cannot be part of the ABX464 global phase 3 study program in UC.Currently  more than 400 study sites  out of the targeted 600 sites  already confirmed their participation in the phase 3 trial and the enrollment of the first patient is planned for Q3 2022.Acquisition of Prosynergia SARLAbivax announces that it acquired on April 1  2022  Prosynergia SARL  a Luxembourg biotech company  in order to strengthen the Abivax development portfolio  for an amount of EUR 3.25M.

Clayton Hot…,BRISTOL  England--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dalata Hotel Group Plc (“Dalata” or “the Group”)  the largest hotel operator in Ireland  growing rapidly in the UK with a presence in continental Europe  today officially opens the Group’s first hotel in Bristol. Clayton Hotel Bristol City is ideally located in the centre of Bristol city and marks the Group’s 17th hotel in the United Kingdom (“UK”). The Group currently operates eleven Clayton hotels and six Maldron hotels across the UK.UK expansion in full flow2022 is a significant year for Dalata’s UK growth plan with the opening of four new hotels  making it one of the fastest growing hotel groups in the UK this year. In addition to Clayton Hotel Bristol City  the first quarter saw the opening of both a Clayton and a Maldron hotel in Manchester and later this year will see the opening of a Clayton hotel in Glasgow.Post 2022  Dalata has a further pipeline of new hotel openings across the UK  which includes hotels in London  Brighton  Liverpool and Manchester. The Group’s current growth plans will see Dalata increase its UK footprint by 65% between the start of 2022 and 2024  bringing its UK room total to over 5 000 rooms.Dalata is an award-winning employer  providing direct employment to more than 1 200 people across the region. The Group’s ambitious UK expansion plan will see it employ just under 1 400 people by 2024.Clayton Hotel Bristol CityAdding 80 jobs locally  the new 4-star hotel is close to Bristol’s commercial centre and within walking distance of the main shopping and leisure districts. The hotel boasts 255 air-conditioned bedrooms  a bar  restaurant  gym  and extensive conference facilities. The new hotel represents a £50 million investment  converting the former Edward Everard's Printing Works on Broad Street in Bristol’s city centre. The hotel’s main entrance is framed by the historical Art Nouveau façade  dating back to the 1900’s  which pays tribute to printing and literature greats Johannes Gutenberg and William Morris.The decision to refurbish the existing building  rather than demolish and build anew is estimated to have saved 2 084 tonnes of CO2 emissions.

Clayton Hotel Bristol City is ideally located …,"Bristol -- Dalata Hotel Group Plc (“Dalata” or “the Group”)  the largest hotel operator in Ireland  growing rapidly in the UK with a presence in continental Europe  today officially opens the Group’s first hotel in Bristol. Clayton Hotel Bristol City is ideally located in the centre of Bristol city and marks the Group’s 17th hotel in the United Kingdom (“UK”). The Group currently operates eleven Clayton hotels and six Maldron hotels across the UK.UK expansion in full flow2022 is a significant year for Dalata’s UK growth plan with the opening of four new hotels  making it one of the fastest growing hotel groups in the UK this year. In addition to Clayton Hotel Bristol City  the first quarter saw the opening of both a Clayton and a Maldron hotel in Manchester and later this year will see the opening of a Clayton hotel in Glasgow.Post 2022  Dalata has a further pipeline of new hotel openings across the UK  which includes hotels in London  Brighton  Liverpool and Manchester. The Group’s current growth plans will see Dalata increase its UK footprint by 65% between the start of 2022 and 2024  bringing its UK room total to over 5 000 rooms.Dalata is an award-winning employer  providing direct employment to more than 1 200 people across the region. The Group’s ambitious UK expansion plan will see it employ just under 1 400 people by 2024.Clayton Hotel Bristol CityAdding 80 jobs locally  the new 4-star hotel is close to Bristol’s commercial centre and within walking distance of the main shopping and leisure districts. The hotel boasts 255 air-conditioned bedrooms  a bar  restaurant  gym  and extensive conference facilities. The new hotel represents a £50 million investment  converting the former Edward Everard's Printing Works on Broad Street in Bristol’s city centre. The hotel’s main entrance is framed by the historical Art Nouveau façade  dating back to the 1900’s  which pays tribute to printing and literature greats Johannes Gutenberg and William Morris.The decision to refurbish the existing building  rather than demolish and build anew is estimated to have saved 2 084 tonnes of CO2 emissions. These carbon savings are equivalent to the CO2 emitted in powering 264 homes in one year.Bristol is the eighth most visited town or city in the UK  by international visitors. It is an attractive destination for both business travellers and tourists and welcomed more than 2.5 million visitors in 2019. It has a vibrant and fast-growing economy with burgeoning engineering  aerospace  fintech  digital and creative sectors and was recently named the most innovative UK city outside of London.Commenting on the opening  Dermot Crowley  CEO of Dalata Hotel Group said:“The opening of the Clayton Hotel Bristol City is a further demonstration of our Group’s ambition to grow our presence in the UK market. It is a fabulous property in one of the UK’s most popular destination cities. We are confident of the continued recovery in the hospitality sector and look forward to investing in other targeted UK locations throughout 2022 and beyond.Our greatest asset continues to be our engaged people  in Ireland  the UK and Germany  and we are proud that we are generating significant new employment in the market. This will be the 17th hotel operated by Dalata in the UK  and our pipeline includes hotels in London  Brighton  Liverpool  Glasgow and Manchester. This is definitely a time to look forward.”Shane Casserly  Corporate Development Director of Dalata Hotel Group added:“Today’s opening of the Clayton Hotel Bristol City is another significant milestone in our growth story and demonstrates the strength of the partnerships we have across the UK. I am encouraged by the opportunity that remains across the region  which is a key focus for our team.We were delighted to work with our valued partners  Artisan Real Estate Investors  Abrdn and McAleer & Rushe Construction on this development  which will be a flagship property in the heart of Bristol City Centre.”Dalata’s UK FootprintUK Hotel Portfolio (Hotels - Rooms)Clayton Hotel Manchester Airport - 365Clayton Hotel Leeds - 334Clayton Hotel Manchester City Centre - 329Maldron Hotel Glasgow City - 300Maldron Hotel Manchester City Centre - 278Maldron Hotel Newcastle - 265Clayton Hotel Bristol City - 255Maldron Hotel Belfast City - 237Clayton Hotel Chiswick  London - 227Clayton Hotel Birmingham - 218Clayton Hotel Cardiff  Wales - 216Clayton Hotel City of London - 212Clayton Hotel Belfast - 170Clayton Hotel Cambridge - 160Clayton Crown Hotel  London - 152Maldron Hotel Belfast International Airport - 104Maldron Hotel Derry - 93Total Rooms in the UK: 3 915UK Pipeline (Hotels - Rooms)Clayton Hotel Glasgow City - 303Maldron Hotel Liverpool City - 260Maldron Hotel Brighton - 221Maldron Hotel Cathedral Quarter  Manchester - 188Maldron Hotel Shoreditch  London - 149Extension to Clayton Hotel City of London - 14Total UK Pipeline Rooms: 1 135About DalataDalata Hotel Group plc was founded in August 2007 and listed as a plc in March 2014.

The Company's technology is based on pioneering research in ""host defense peptides"" – nature's first line of defense towards foreign pathogens. Lytix Biopharma's lead product  LTX-315  is a first-in-class oncolytic molecule representing a new and superior in situ therapeutic vaccination principle to boost anti-cancer immunity  with the potential to be the ideal combination partner with other types of immunotherapies. LTX-315 target cancer cells and disintegrate their cell membranes  causing immunogenic cell death and release of a patient's tumor specific antigens. This mode of action allows cytotoxic T cells to recognize  infiltrate  and attack cancer cells. The Company was listed on Euronext Growth in Oslo in June 2021  following a private placement covered by investors such as PBM Capital  a U.S. based  healthcare-focused investment firm. For more information  visit www.lytixbiopharma.com.About LTX-315LTX-315 is a potential first-in-class oncolytic molecule administered directly into a tumor to induce immunogenic cell death  which may offer a non-surgical option for patients suffering from skin cancer. The technology is based on pioneering research in ""host defense peptides"" – nature's first line of defense towards foreign pathogens. LTX-315 has demonstrated positive tumor-specific immune cell responses in multi-indication Phase I/II oncology trials.About in situ vaccinationIn situ vaccination stimulates a patient's immune system by injecting drugs with the ability to kill cancer cells straight into the tumor environment. Lytix Biopharma has applied this approach with its first-in-class oncolytic molecules  representing an alternative and unique approach to cancer vaccination. Importantly  this approach generates an immune response against a broad antigen repertoire without pre-identifying the antigens  which in turn can save considerable costs and valuable time.This information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/lytix-biopharma-as/r/lytix-biopharma-receives-milestone-payment-from-verrica-pharmaceuticals-inc--triggered-by-first-pati c2839791SOURCE Lytix Biopharma AS",neutral,0.03,0.94,0.03,mixed,0.27,0.2,0.53,True,English,"['Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc', 'Lytix Biopharma', 'milestone payment', 'first patient', 'LTX-3', 'U.S. based, healthcare-focused investment firm', 'superior in situ therapeutic vaccination principle', 'multi-indication Phase I/II oncology trials', 'positive tumor-specific immune cell responses', 'exclusive worldwide license agreement', 'situ vaccination technology platform', 'SOURCE Lytix Biopharma AS', 'USD 1 million milestone payment', 'LTX-315 target cancer cells', 'Phase II study', 'dermatologic oncology conditions', 'Phase II trial', 'dermatologic oncology indications', 'squamous cell carcinomas', 'high unmet need', 'worldwide annual sales', 'ideal combination partner', 'immunogenic cell death', 'broad antigen repertoire', 'basal cell carcinoma', 'cytotoxic T cells', 'Non-melanoma skin cancers', 'contingent regulatory milestones', 'novel oncolytic molecule', 'host defense peptides', '3-4 million patients', 'non-surgical treatment option', 'clinical-stage biotech company', 'Verrica Pharmaceuticals Inc.', 'class oncolytic molecules', 'novel cancer immunotherapies', 'new treatment options', 'tumor specific antigens', 'potential new treatment', 'cancer vaccination', '5 million diagnoses', 'sales milestones', 'cell membranes', 'immune system', 'immune response', 'cancer indications', 'clinical-stage company', 'clinical trial', 'surgical option', 'licensing agreement', 'upfront payment', 'cancer therapy', 'common form', 'new treatments', 'Øystein Rekdal', 'aggregate payments', 'tiered royalties', 'full announcement', 'pioneering research', 'first line', 'foreign pathogens', 'lead product', 'anti-cancer immunity', 'other types', 'Euronext Growth', 'private placement', 'PBM Capital', 'tumor environment', 'considerable costs', 'valuable time', 'development goals', 'The Company', 'first patient', 'unique approach', 'news.cision', 'OSLO', 'Norway', 'April', 'PRNewswire', 'accordance', 'parties', 'CEO', 'August', 'terms', 'achievement', 'addition', 'verrica-pharmaceuticals', 'phase-2-study', 'oncolytic-peptide-based-immunotherapy', 'basal-cell-carcinoma', 'information', 'clinicaltrials', 'Telephone', 'mail', 'area', 'nature', 'release', 'mode', 'action', 'June', 'investors', 'lytixbiopharma', 'drugs', 'ability', 'alternative', 'turn', 'lytix-biopharma', 'first-pati']",2022-04-05,2022-04-06,prnewswire.com

In addition  it aims to provide you with any details and additional information concerning the documents provided for by the regulations in force that you may require.FIRST RESOLUTIONApproval of the proposed transfer of the listing of the Company's shares from the regulated market of Euronext Paris to the Euronext Growth Paris market within twelve (12) months from the date of this Meeting (the ""Transfer"") and powers to be granted to the Board of Directors.The Company's shares are currently admitted to trading in France on Compartment C of the regulated market of Euronext Paris.The Company announced in a press release dated 21 February 2022 that it was considering the transfer of its listing to Euronext Growth Paris  the implementation of which requires the prior approval of the Company's shareholders.The transfer of the shares from Euronext Paris to Euronext Growth Paris would allow the Company to reduce its exposure to the regulatory constraints linked to the Euronext Paris market and to be listed on a simplified market more adapted to the Group's profile and its current needs. This transfer would also allow the Company to focus on its activities  while maintaining its listing on a market segment more appropriate to the Company's current size.1Atari SA complies with the eligibility criteria required under the transfer procedure  which must also be met on the date of the transfer request.This transfer would consist of an application to Euronext to delist the shares from the Euronext market and to admit them simultaneously to trading on the Euronext Growth Paris market.Subject to approval of the proposed transaction by the shareholders and a positive decision by Euronext Paris SA on the application for admission of the Company's shares to Euronext Growth  the direct listing will take place through an accelerated admission procedure for the Company's existing shares  without the issuance of new shares.This transfer could take place  at the earliest  two months after the General Meeting called to vote on the proposed transfer of listing from Euronext Paris to Euronext Growth Paris  i.e.  at the earliest on 20 June 2022.The consequences of the Transfer would include the following:In terms of periodic financial information:The annual company accounts  the management report and the statutory auditors' reports would be published no later than four months after the end of the financial year.The half-yearly accounts  including a balance sheet  an income statement and comments on the period would be published no later than four months after the end of the half-year.
