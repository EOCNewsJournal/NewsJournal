But it has been blocked by both Western sanctions and some of Russia's own capital restrictions.The privately owned lender has been blocked from using SWIFT  the global interbank transfer messaging system. The U.S. Treasury has prohibited the bank and other Russian borrowers from making dollar debt payments with funds from U.S. bank accounts.Similar restrictions by the U.S. and other Western governments have frozen bank assets held in Western banks  including the Russian government's foreign currency reserves. Moscow  meanwhile  hasthat sharply restrict the transfer of dollars and other hard currency from Russian accounts.""Currently  Sovcombank  due to sanctions imposed by the United States and other countries  as well as retaliatory restrictions from the Russian Federation  does not have the technical ability to dispose of blocked assets and fully use the international payment infrastructure to service loans "" the lender said on its website.It added that until the sanctions are lifted  it will temporarily suspend interest payments on the loans.Sovcombank expects to be able to transfer interest payments for two of the eurobonds registered at Russian depositories within a few weeks. This process is expected to begin once Sovcombank has developed a mechanism with Russian regulators.Two eurobonds are listed with international depositories  such as Euroclear . The bank said it is working with regulators of all the countries involved to develop a method to make bond payments  but did not specify when this would be accomplished.The bank is one of a growing group of Russian institutions struggling to service debt payments after Western governments cut the country off from the global financial system.Moscow announced on Wednesday it was forced to make a scheduledon foreign dollar bonds in rubles  prompting speculation Russia would default on its sovereign debt.--Additional reporting by Najiyya Budaly.

Meanwhile  the reckless Russian decision to shell a nuclear power plant risked causing another Chernobyl-like environmental catastrophe.Socially  the invasion has cost the lives of thousands of innocent civilians and created a refugee crisis. The Russian alleged war crimes that are coming to light in the city of Bucha indicate the wanton brutality of the invasion and the social ills it cost.Governance has also suffered from the invasion. Putin's decree shielding leased Russian commercial airplanes from seizure by their lawful owners as well as his public consideration of seizing the assets of departing western companies indicate a troubling situation on corporate governance.We are therefore troubled by ISS's apparent decision to leave Russia's ESG rating unchanged.We would like you to provide us with answers to the following questions:Question 1Has ISS has taken any money from Kremlin-affiliated public companies like Gazprom  Lukoil  and Rosneft? If so  how much and for what services?Question 2Have you or other ISS executives met with any Russian oligarchs or government officials? If so  what was discussed?Question 3Can you explain why state owned or affiliated Russian companies are given better ESG ratings than western companies with seemingly far better ESG records? Gazprom  for example  has a ""C Minus"" rating while Rosneft has a ""C"" rating in spite of seemingly terrible environmental records and leadership who are currently under western sanctions.Question 4Have ISS parent companies Genstar Capital or Deutsche Boerse influenced  or attempted to influence  ISS ESG ratings of Russia or Russian companies?In light of the gravity of this crisis  we urge you to respond to these questions no later than Thursday April 14th.Sincerely Ghada SalahuddinPresident & CEOThe Corporate Citizenship Projectwww.CorporateCitizenshipProject.comGhada Salahuddin  President &CEO of The Corporate Citizenship Project  issued the following statement regarding the letter:""Putin's evil and cruel invasion of Ukraine has cost the lives of thousands of innocent people  a refugee crisis  and come close to causing a global environmental catastrophe. For ISS to apparently refuse to downgrade Russia's ESG rating and the rating of government-affiliated companies again calls into question the integrity of ISS's ESG ratings.

2445,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4500143-puma-expect-aggressive-growth-to-bring-its-valuation-in-line-with-peer-adidas,Puma: Expect Aggressive Growth To Bring Its Valuation In Line With Peer Adidas,1 day ago,"PhoThoughts/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionWhile everyone knows the big sporting goods brands like Nike (NKE) and Adidas (OTCQX:ADDYY) (OTCQX:ADDDF)  Puma (OTCPK:PMMAF) (OTCPK:PUMSY) is often forgotten as this smaller player only has a total revenue of just under 6B EUR. The company is making good progress in the Americas as the revenue increased by almost 50% in 2021  which is a much larger revenue increase than any of the other regions Puma is active in. This pushed the contribution from the Americas to the consolidated revenue mix to almost 39% (up from just under 34% in 2020). 2021 also was the first year in the company’s history its revenue in the Americas was higher than its core EMEA markets.Yahoo FinanceAs Puma’s listing in the US is rather illiquid  I’d strongly recommend to trade in Puma’s shares using its primary listing on the Deutsche Boerse stock exchange. The ticker symbol in Germany is PUM and the average daily volume of 500 000 shares represents a monetary value of 37MEUR. And since last year  Puma is a member of the Dax 40 index.Unfortunately  the Puma website mainly contains download-only links  but you can find all relevant information here.Puma is aggressively investing in its expansion  and that weighs on the free cash flow result2021 wasn’t an easy year for Puma as in the first half of the year the company had to deal with COVID-related measures like store closings while in the second half of the year Puma had to deal with supply chain issues. The logistical difficulties are persisting but I hope to see the majority of the issues to be resolved by the end of this year as the acute shortage of shipping containers should be over while port congestion levels should improve.Puma’s financial results recovered nicely from the disappointing performance in 2020. The revenue increased by about 30% to 6.8B EUR while the gross profit increased at a slightly faster pace. As you can see in the image below  the ""other operating expenses"" increased by about 20% which is a rather strong increase but this was obviously totally absorbed by the higher revenue and gross profit and the EBIT almost tripled on a YoY basis.Puma Investor RelationsWith a net income of 377M EUR of which just under 310M EUR was attributable to the shareholders of Puma  the EPS came in at approximately 2.07 EUR per share. That’s almost four times higher than in 2020.As Puma is running a clean balance sheet with little debt  the total finance expenses may appear to be high but as the image below shows  the net interest expenses on the financial debt were close to zero. The interest related to the lease liabilities exceeded 31M EUR (up from 29.3M EUR in 2020) and another substantial portion of the net finance expenses was related to ""other"" expenses: These are derivatives on currencies.Puma Investor RelationsAs Puma is currently trading at 35 times its earnings  I was hoping the free cash flow result would outpace the reported net income. Unfortunately  Puma has shifted its growth investments into a higher gear and the reported free cash flow is actually lower than the reported net income due to those investments in growth.The company published an operating cash flow of 460.1M EUR  but as you can see below  this includes an investment in the working capital position to the tune of 214.3M EUR. We also see Puma paid 146.9M EUR in taxes although the income statement indicates about 129M EUR was due based on the FY2021 pre-tax result. On an adjusted basis  the operating cash flow was approximately 692M EUR.Puma Investor RelationsHowever  there are some other adjustments we still need to make. We should deduct the 48M EUR paid to the non-controlling interests while we also should deduct the 161M EUR in lease payments as well as the 44.4M EUR in interest payments (consisting of the interest payments on both the financial debt as well as the lease liabilities). And to be consistent  we should also add the 11.9M EUR in received interest payments into account.Puma Investor RelationsThat would result in an adjusted operating cash flow of 451M EUR. The total capex was approximately 202M EUR which means Puma generated a free cash flow result of 249M EUR which is just under 1.70 EUR per share. Disappointing? Yes. But we clearly see the combination of capex (202M EUR) and lease payments (161M EUR) for a total of 363M EUR is quite a bit higher than the 306M EUR in depreciation and amortization expenses for the year.For 2022  Puma expects to report a double digit revenue growth which should trickle down to the net income level as well. Whereas the EBIT in 2021 was approximately 557M EUR  Puma is now guiding for a full-year EBIT of 600-700M EUR which would be an increase of 8%-26%. Given the current situation in Europe and how inflation is making its way through all supply chains and as it will likely rattle consumer confidence levels  perhaps we should aim for the lower end of the official EBIT guidance.Puma will continue to invest in itself in 2022 and the total capex will once again be substantially higher than in 2021. Puma expects to invest 220M EUR in ""fixed assets"" this year as the company continues to build out its infrastructure to support the long-term growth plans.Puma Investor RelationsInvestment thesisPuma has digested the weak performance in 2020 and despite being impacted by supply chain issues and temporary store closures  Puma saw its net income and free cash flow increase by a triple-digit percentage. That’s great but that still doesn’t make the stock cheap.Puma is currently trading at about 35 times its 2021 earnings  but we can likely expect an EPS increase of about 10% in 2022 if the company is indeed able to hike its revenue and EBIT as expected. Considering Puma has a positive net cash position of approximately 375M EUR (excluding lease liabilities) and generated an EBITDA of approximately 700M EUR (again  excluding lease related liabilities and depreciation expenses)  the stock is trading at an EV/EBITDA ratio of 15.As Puma is a growth story  perhaps we give more weight to the future. The analyst consensus estimate calls for an EBITDA of 1.37B EUR in 2024. If I would assume about 190M EUR will be lease-related  the underlying EBITDA excluding leases would be around 1.18B EUR and that would reduce the forward EV/EBITDA to less than 9  making Puma a whole lot more appealing as an investment and trading in line with European competitor Adidas.I currently have no position in Puma but I will keep an eye on how the company performs in the near future.",neutral,0.09,0.89,0.02,mixed,0.1,0.15,0.75,True,English,"['Aggressive Growth', 'Peer Adidas', 'Puma', 'Valuation', 'Line', 'big sporting goods brands', 'Deutsche Boerse stock exchange', 'free cash flow result', 'double digit revenue growth', 'operating cash flow', 'FY2021 pre-tax result', 'core EMEA markets', 'average daily volume', 'port congestion levels', 'clean balance sheet', 'working capital position', 'consumer confidence levels', 'consolidated revenue mix', 'other operating expenses', 'net finance expenses', 'official EBIT guidance', 'net income level', 'supply chain issues', 'Puma Investor Relations', 'total finance expenses', 'net interest expenses', 'larger revenue increase', 'other"" expenses', 'Yahoo Finance', 'amortization expenses', 'supply chains', 'other regions', 'other adjustments', 'income statement', 'total revenue', 'higher revenue', 'iStock Editorial', 'Getty Images', 'OTCPK:PMMAF', 'OTCPK:PUMSY', 'smaller player', 'good progress', 'ticker symbol', 'monetary value', 'Dax 40 index', 'download-only links', 'relevant information', 'first half', 'COVID-related measures', 'store closings', 'second half', 'logistical difficulties', 'acute shortage', 'shipping containers', 'financial results', 'disappointing performance', 'faster pace', 'strong increase', 'YoY basis', 'little debt', 'financial debt', 'lease liabilities', 'substantial portion', 'higher gear', 'adjusted basis', 'controlling interests', 'lease payments', 'interest payments', 'current situation', '310M EUR', '48M EUR', '161M EUR', '44.4M EUR', '11.9M EUR', '306M EUR', 'growth investments', 'full-year EBIT', 'total capex', 'primary listing', 'lower end', 'first year', 'last year', 'easy year', 'Puma website', '29.3M EUR', 'gross profit', '2.07 EUR', '214.3M', 'PhoThoughts', 'Introduction', 'everyone', 'Nike', 'NKE', 'Adidas', 'OTCQX', 'ADDYY', 'ADDDF', '6B', 'company', 'Americas', 'contribution', 'history', 'shares', 'Germany', '37MEUR', 'member', 'expansion', 'majority', '6.8B', '377M', 'shareholders', 'EPS', '31M', 'derivatives', 'currencies', '35 times', 'earnings', '460.1M', 'tune', 'taxes', '129M', '692M', 'account', '451M', '202M', '249M', 'combination', '363M', 'depreciation', '557M', '600-700M', 'Europe', 'inflation', 'way', '1.70']",2022-04-08,2022-04-08,seekingalpha.com

The trial is a randomized  placebo-controlled study and is expected to enroll 60 patients in France. The primary endpoint is safety  while the secondary endpoint will evaluate MaaT013’s potential to improve the response to ICI therapies  as a consequence of MaaT013’s impact on the patient’s gut microbiome. Patients will be randomized to receive either MaaT013 in combination with both ICIs or a placebo with both ICIs. MaaT Pharma will provide MaaT013 drug candidate and the placebo for this study as well as perform the microbiome profiling of patients using its proprietary gutPrint® platform. This clinical trial is registered on clinicaltrials.gov.Several studies have suggested that gut microbiota diversity and richness are predictors of response to ICI treatment4 in patients with solid tumors. Notably  in two recent studies conducted in melanoma patients5  fecal microbiota transfer from ICI therapy responders could overcome resistance to that same therapy in non-responders.About MaaT013MaaT013 is a full-ecosystem  off-the-shelf  standardized  pooled-donor  Microbiome Ecosystem Therapy. It is characterized by a consistently high diversity and richness of microbial species and the presence of ButycoreTM (group of bacterial species known to produce anti-inflammatory metabolites). MaaT013 aims to restore the symbiotic relationship between the patient’s functional gut microbiome and their immune system to correct the responsiveness and tolerance of immune functions and thus reduce steroid-resistant  gastrointestinal-predominant aGvHD. MaaT013 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for acute Graft-versus-Host Disease (aGvHD) and is currently being evaluated in a Phase 3 clinical trial. MaaT Pharma has obtained positive safety and efficiency clinical data for 76 patients with aGvHD (Phase 2 clinical trial and Early Access Program in France).About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology. Committed to treating cancer and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD)  a serious complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation  MaaT Pharma has launched  in March 2022  a Phase 3 clinical trial for patients with acute GvHD  following the achievement of its proof of concept in a Phase 2 trial. Its powerful discovery and analysis platform  gutPrint®  supports the development and expansion of its pipeline by determining novel disease targets  evaluating drug candidates  and identifying biomarkers for microbiome-related conditions.The company’s Microbiome Ecosystem Therapies are produced through a standardized cGMP manufacturing and quality control process to safely deliver the full diversity of the microbiome  in liquid and oral formulations. MaaT Pharma benefits from the commitment of world-leading scientists and established relationships with regulators to support the integration of the use of microbiome therapies in clinical practice.MaaT Pharma is listed on Euronext Paris (ticker: MAAT).Forward-looking StatementsAll statements other than statements of historical fact included in this press release about future events are subject to (i) change without notice and (ii) factors beyond the Company’s control.

Audit reports are in the process of being issued.Consolidated data - in € millions 2021 2020 Var. in % Revenue 922.5 937.2 -1.6% EBITDA 117.1 175.3 -33.2% Current operating income 75.2 113.7 -33.8% Current operating margin 8.2% 12.1% -3.9 pts Operating income 70.4 107.0 -34.2% Financial income (2.2) (1.9) - Net result (group share) 51.2 85.5 -40.2% Net margin 5.5% 9.1% -3.6 ptsBUSINESS GROWTH AT CONSTANT SCOPE AND EXCHANGE RATESIn 2021  production levels in the global automotive industry remained low  growing slowly (+2.5%  source IHS Markit)  in an environment still characterised by strong pressure on the supply of raw materials and electronic components. Against this difficult backdrop  AKWEL managed to achieve its objective of increasing business  with reported revenue down 1.6% but up 2.8% at constant scope and exchange rates. Given the low visibility  and the highly volatile production levels of manufacturers  the Group’s ability to adapt and its traditionally conservative inventory management enabled it to meet customer demand.ONE OF THE HIGHEST CURRENT OPERATING MARGINS IN THE SECTORDisrupted production conditions as well as the partial and delayed impact of increases in purchasing prices naturally weighed on the Group’s cost structure in 2021. Gross operating surplus (EBITDA) was down 33.2%  also including an unfavourable base effect of the change in presentation of provisions for warranty returns (+€19m on 2020 EBITDA related to this change)  with no impact on current operating income. This amounted to €75.2m  down 33.8%  as expected at the time of the publication of annual revenue  including an additional provision for a warranty returns of €7.3m  representing a current operating margin of 8.2%  comparable to pre-crisis results. This level of profitability continues to position AKWEL as one of the best-performing European auto parts manufacturers. The recognition of an impairment loss of €3.7m on Swedish activities led to operating income of €70.4m  and after a tax expense down to €16.3m  net income Group share came to €51.2m  representing a net margin of 5.5% of revenue.Story continuesGROSS CASH POSITION OF €167.4 M AT CLOSINGGiven the change in the Group’s operating performance  its self-financing capacity was down to €92.5m. With WCR up €6.8m and €30m in investments made during the financial year  AKWEL generated a free cash flow of €57.1m in 2021  leading to a positive net cash position of €98.2m (including lease obligations) and gross cash flow of €167.4m at the close  compared with €175.1m at the end of 2020. The distribution of a dividend maintained at €0.45 per share for 2021 will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders to be held on Wednesday 25 May 2022.REMAIN AGILE IN 2022 AND CONTINUE TO PREPARE FOR THE FUTUREWhile the global automotive market is expected to rise in 2022  production uncertainties remain high  with continued tensions on commodities and components and an inflationary global environment reinforced by the current geopolitical situation. Against this backdrop  AKWEL  which has no direct exposure to the Ukraine-Russia region  anticipates a moderate increase in its business  with profitability likely to continue to be penalised by the lack of visibility on customer needs  rising purchasing prices  and the difficulty of quickly passing on major increases in energy and transport costs. With a particularly robust financial position  the Group will increase its investments once again from 2022 to optimise the competitiveness of its sites  and to give itself the means to make the most of all the opportunities identified in terms of product potential as part of the transition from thermal combustion engines to electricity and hydrogen.Next press release: Turnover for the first quarter of 2022  on 05 May 2022  after markets close.An independent  family-owned group listed on the Euronext Paris Stock Exchange  AKWEL is an automotive and HGV equipment and systems manufacturer specialising in fluid management and mechanisms  offering first-rate industrial and technological expertise in applying and processing materials (plastics  rubber  metal) and mechatronic integration.Operating in 20 countries across every continent  AKWEL employs 9 700 people worldwide.Euronext Paris – Compartment B – ISIN: FR0000053027 – Reuters: AKW.PA – Bloomberg: AKW:FPAttachment,neutral,0.03,0.92,0.04,mixed,0.19,0.2,0.61,True,English,"['AKWEL POSTS NET EARNINGS', 'performing European auto parts manufacturers', 'HIGHEST CURRENT OPERATING MARGINS', 'positive net cash position', 'Euronext Paris Stock Exchange', 'AKWEL POSTS NET EARNINGS', 'net income Group share', 'GROSS CASH POSITION', 'Gross cash flow', 'free cash flow', 'current geopolitical situation', 'unfavourable base effect', 'thermal combustion engines', 'Next press release', 'Gross operating surplus', 'robust financial position', 'Current operating income', 'Disrupted production conditions', 'conservative inventory management', 'Annual General Meeting', 'global automotive industry', 'volatile production levels', 'global automotive market', 'inflationary global environment', 'rising purchasing prices', 'independent, family-owned group', 'Net margin', 'Financial income', 'Net result', 'operating performance', 'EXCHANGE RATES', 'production uncertainties', 'fluid management', '2021 annual results', 'financial year', 'HGV equipment', 'systems manufacturer', 'executive board', 'Audit reports', 'Consolidated data', 'CONSTANT SCOPE', 'IHS Markit', 'strong pressure', 'raw materials', 'customer demand', 'cost structure', 'warranty returns', 'additional provision', 'pre-crisis results', 'impairment loss', 'Swedish activities', 'tax expense', 'self-financing capacity', 'lease obligations', 'continued tensions', 'direct exposure', 'Ukraine-Russia region', 'moderate increase', 'customer needs', 'transport costs', 'product potential', 'first quarter', 'first-rate industrial', 'technological expertise', 'processing materials', 'mechatronic integration', 'Compartment B', 'share Akwel', 'annual revenue', 'electronic components', 'difficult backdrop', 'low visibility', 'delayed impact', 'Wednesday 25 May', 'major increases', 'BUSINESS GROWTH', 'AKW.PA', '05 May', 'Thursday', 'April', 'Proposition', 'dividend', 'mechanisms', 'millions', 'Var', 'EBITDA', 'source', 'supply', 'objective', 'ability', 'SECTOR', 'partial', 'presentation', 'provisions', 'time', 'publication', 'recognition', 'Story', 'CLOSING', 'WCR', 'investments', 'close', 'distribution', 'Shareholders', 'REMAIN', 'FUTURE', 'commodities', 'lack', 'difficulty', 'energy', 'competitiveness', 'sites', 'means', 'opportunities', 'terms', 'transition', 'electricity', 'hydrogen', 'Turnover', 'markets', 'applying', 'plastics', 'rubber', 'metal', '20 countries', 'continent', '9,700 people', 'Reuters', 'Bloomberg', 'Attachment', '€', '6', '2020']",2022-04-07,2022-04-08,finance.yahoo.com

This result is considered meaningful as the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) for the 400MWT in sarcopenia is 0.1 m/s.However  due to restrictions during the pandemic  only 106 patients could perform the 400m walk test at the end-of-treatment visit  which was the primary endpoint of our study which resulted in 55% of loss of efficacy data.On January 24  2022  a meeting between the Company and the FDA was held.During which we discussed conducting additional dose-finding and further definition of the proposed population and indication  as well as CMC (chemistry  manufacturing  and control section) data to be submitted  and the regulatory non-clinical plan.We are currently assessing FDA comments and recommendations and preparing for the submission of a seamless design phase 2-3 with the objective of having a First Patient In by H2 2022.Story continuesWe anticipate to have other discussions with FDA in Q3 2022 and with EMA in H1 2022 to get scientific advice  including on the results of the Phase 2b study and potential progression into Phase 2-3.Stanislas Veillet  CEO of Biophytis  declares: ""In 2021 Sarconeos BIO(101) reached a key milestone with the end of SARA phase 2 trial in Sarcopenia. We achieved the study with encouraging results  mostly in the Per Protocol population. Unfortunately it was lacking statistical power due to regulatory restrictions during the pandemic. We are now exchanging with FDA and soon with EMA for the prepation our phase 2-3 study. Assuming authorizations are obtained  we expect to have our FPI by end of H2 2022.""Regarding COVA:The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) had recommened in September 2021 the continuation of the COVA study unmodified based on the results of the second Interim Analysis on 155 patients  showing the efficacy of the treatment with Sarconeos (BIO101) in the promising zone and no futility of the study. The initial target for the study was the recrtment of 310 to 465 patients.Since April 2020  237 patients meeting the study criteria have been enrolled in the trial in France  the United States  Belgium and Brazil  in 37 clinical centers. Since the end of 2021  global immunity in Europe  US  and Brazil  as well as vaccination campaigns have strongly progressed. In addition  the number of hospital admissions has also decreased due to the reduced severity of the Omicron variant. As a result  the Company has experiencedsignificant slow-downs in the speed of patient recruitment during the last months.In this context after consultation of its experts for the study as well as its medical & scientific advisors  the Company has stopped the enrollment at the 237th patient  and is proceeding to close its clinical centers in Q2 2022  in order to report the results of the study in Q3 2022.Stanislas Veillet  CEO of Biophytis  stated: ""Our clinical trial is inherently dependent on the evolution of the pandemic  which is  after the 5th wave  declining globally in the United States  Europe and Brazil. We are adapting to this situation in giving priority to obtaining the study's results. Stopping the recruitement is an important step that should enable us to announce COVA results during Q3 2022. We are convinced that COVID-19 is becoming endemic and will persist over time. We have yet to demonstrate that Sarconeos (BIO101) might bring a real therapeutic solution for patients hospitalized with severe respiratory manifestations  with no pharmacological treatment option as of today"".As a reminder  the COVA clinical programme (identifier clinicaltrials.gov: NCT04472728) is an international  multi-centre  double-blind  placebo-controlled  group-sequential and adaptive two-part study. It is a phase 2-3 study evaluating Sarconeos (BIO101) in patients aged 45 years and older  hospitalised with severe respiratory manifestations of COVID-19. Part 1 of the COVA study is an exploratory Phase 2 proof-of-concept study designed to provide preliminary data on the safety  tolerability and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) in 50 hospitalised patients with severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19. Part 2 of the COVA study is a randomised phase 3 study investigating the safety and efficacy of Sarconeos (BIO101) on respiratory function in 310 to 465 COVID-19 patients (including the 50 patients from the first part of the study).About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specialized in the development of therapeutics that are aimed at slowing the degenerative processes associated with aging  including severe respiratory failure in patients suffering from COVID-19.Sarconeos (BIO101)  our leading drug candidate  is a small molecule  administered orally  being developed as a treatment for sarcopenia with a positive Phase 2 clinical trial performed in the United States and Europe (SARA-INT).

This second country will accelerate patient enrollment in this Phase II clinical trial of DNV3837 in Clostridioides difficile infections.This announcement follows the review of the data from the first part of the trial by the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  which gave a positive opinion for the continuation of the trial (see press release of January 6  2022).The second part of the study will be conducted in an open-label manner. Thus  all 40 patients who will be included in the trial will receive DNV3837. As a reminder  the second part of the trial has been optimized with a reduction in the dose and duration of intravenous administration to 6 hours per day during the 10-day treatment period. This modification simplifies the management of the trial for the investigating physicians and their teams.Dr. Thomas Louie  Professor of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases at the University of Calgary (Canada) and a world expert on Clostridioides difficile  will lead and report on the trial in Canada. He said: “I am delighted to join this trial to evaluate DNV3837  which could be an important advance in the management of patients with Clostridioides difficile infection  in particular severely affected patients with bowel dysmotility where orally administered antimicrobials may have difficulty reaching the active site of infection.”Story continuesAlexis Rideau  CEO of DEINOVE  concluded “The extension of our trial into Canada is a major step forward for DEINOVE and provides new hope for Canadian patients. We are proud to work with leading specialists  notably Dr. Thomas Louie  a world expert in the development of innovative therapeutic solutions for Clostridioides difficile infections.”ABOUT CLOSTRIDIOIDES DIFFICILE INFECTIONS (ICD)More than 40% of hospitalized patients with Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) have been classified as severe disease associated with higher morbidity and mortality1. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identifies CDI as one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infections  ahead of even MRSA2 infections. In the United States  it is estimated that CDI causes nearly half a million disease cases each year  and approximately 29 300 deaths3. This condition is not limited to the United States and recent studies4 show that the incidence of this type of infection is greatly underestimated in other parts of the world  such as Europe and Asia.To date  there is no proven therapeutic solution for CDI patients with severe vomiting  ileus and toxic megacolon. The oral route being compromised  the available treatments  which are mostly oral  have difficulty reaching the intestine because of the patient's pathological condition (reduced gastrointestinal motility  intubation  intestinal perforation  etc.)  and the few antibiotics that could be administered intravenously do not cross the gastrointestinal barrier and therefore do not reach the infection site.ABOUT THE DNV3837 ANTIBIOTIC CANDIDATEDNV3837 – a prodrug5 of the DNV3681 molecule (also known as MCB3681) – is a narrow-spectrum  hybrid oxazolidinone-quinolone synthetic antibiotic targeting only Gram-positive bacteria. It is developed as a highly active first-line treatment targeting C. diff.It has demonstrated significant activity and superiority to reference treatments against isolates of C. diff.  regardless of their virulence (including the hyper virulent BI/NAP1/027 strain).DNV3837 is an intravenous antibiotic that  when converted to its active form DNV3681  crosses the gastrointestinal barrier and accumulates in the intestinal lumen  allowing it to precisely target the infection site. Several Phase I trials (on approximately a hundred healthy volunteers) have shown a high concentration of the antibiotic in stools  a strong marker of its presence in the intestine. It has also demonstrated its ability to eliminate Clostridioides bacteria without affecting the gut microbiota.FDA granted the DNV3837 drug with Qualified Infectious Disease Product (QIDP) designation and Fast Track status.For more information on the DNV3837 Phase II clinical trial in Clostridioides difficile infections  visit ClinicalTrials.gov: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03988855ABOUT DEINOVEDEINOVE is a French biotechnology company pioneering the exploration of a new domain of life  unexplored at 99.9%: the “microbial dark matter”. By revealing the metabolic potential of rare bacteria or still classified as uncultivable  it tackles a global health and economic challenge: antimicrobial resistance.The new therapies discovered and developed by DEINOVE target superbugs (microbes that have become resistant to one or more antimicrobials) that cause life-threatening infections which are now spreading at high speed.This breakthrough approach gave rise to one of the world’s first specialized micro-biotechnology platforms and a unique collection of nearly 10 000 rare strains and thousands of bacterial extracts. Today  DEINOVE is conducting several development programs  of which its first antibiotic candidate is currently evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial in severe Clostridioides difficile infections  one of the world’s first emergencies. The Company has also developed new bacterial micro-factories that address the other issue in the race against antimicrobial resistance: the industrial production of these rare and low concentrated compounds with often too complex chemical structures to be generated by chemical synthesis.Located at the heart of the Euromedecine park in Montpellier  DEINOVE has been listed on EURONEXT GROWTH® (ALDEI – code ISIN FR0010879056) since 2010. The Company has over 50 employees and relies on a network of world-class academic  technological  industrial and institutional partners.CONTACTSInvestorsMario AlcarazChief Financial Officer+33 (0)4 48 19 01 00ir@deinove.comMediaATCG Partners – Marie PUVIEUX+33 (0)9 81 87 46 72 / +33 (0)6 10 54 36 72communication@deinove.com1 Zar FA et al.

The group capitalized on its strong position with its core target group  tier-2 customers.During the 2019/2021 period  the average annual growth rate was +24% compared to +19% during the 2017/2019 period.Controlling operating costsThe direct cost rate remains at 0.45%  equivalent to that of 2020 and 2019  which attests to HiPay's ability to control its operating costs.EBITDA was 2.8 million euros  which was positive for a second year in a row after 3.4 million euros in 2020  a year in which the company benefited from operating cost savings due to the public health situation  including partial business measures not renewed in 2021. When adjusted for this situation  EBITDA increased by 88%.Taking into account a loss of -2.8 million euros from non-ordinary activities (total and prudent provision for a tax risk)  a net loss of -0.6 million euros and a tax expense of 0.3 million euros  the net result is -4.3 million euros (vs. -1.8 million euros in 2020).Story continuesStrong operating cash flow generationHiPay's 2021 performance resulted in an operating cash flow of 6.8 million euros  which is higher than its investments. It consists mainly of cash flow from operations of 3.6 million and a change in working capital of 3.2 million. HiPay's business model  once operational profitability is achieved  benefits from an advantageous working capital structure. Its main revenue components are collected much quicker than its direct costs and other operating expenses are disbursed.As of December 31  2021  the company has 2.1 million euros in available cash.Additionally  there is a 3.7 million euro unused balance from the BJ Invest current account. Therefore  as of December 31  2021  HiPay has a cash mobilization capacity of 5.8 million euros.OutlookHiPay expects another year of double-digit growth in 2022  with first quarter sales growing at a more moderate pace than in the last quarter of 2021. At the same time  the group will continue to rigorously manage its expenses by striving to contain structural costs and by controlling the increase in its marketing budget in order to convert an increasingly significant portion of its growth into EBITDA and operating cash flow generation.Additionally  HiPay will continue to grow profitably by expanding its client portfolio  increasing the average volume processed per client and regularly adding new value-added features to its platform.Next financial communication: Q1 2022 revenue - May 19  2022 before market opening.1 Consolidated income at 31 December 2021 is currently being reviewed by external auditors. The accounts were closed on 31 March 2022 by the board of directors.

We have succeeded in listing the Company on Nasdaq in February 2021  which now allows us to be present in the most important market in the world for investment in Biotech. We also renewed our instruments with historical partners: Atlas and Kreos Capital  for a total of €42M of new financings. Those new instruments  together with our €24 millions of cash at the end of December 2021 should allow a good financial visibility for the development of the Company.Regarding the projects  after having launched COVA - our international study in Covid-19 in 2020 - the whole Company was focused in 2021 on patient recruitment. Based on the independent DMC review of our study in September 2021 based on the first 155 patients  Sarconeos (BIO101) was demonstrating efficacy in the ""promising zone"" for respiratory manifestations linked to COVID-19. This interim result was very important for us to progress the study into its last phase. Since then  the health situation has changed. The number of hospitalized patients has decreased  due to a lower severity from the Omicron variant  and to the strong progression of collective immunization. Therefore  we have taken the decision to early terminate patient enrolment into the COVA study  in order to be able to report results by Q3 2022. In the meantime  we will have the opportunity to bring Sarconeos (BIO101) to some patients in Brazil  in the framework of an Expanded Access Program (EAP) for which we obtained authorization from ANVISA last December 2021.Lastly  2021 was also a landmark year for SARA  our phase 2 trial in Sarcopenia. We achieved the study with encouraging results  despite a reduced cohort having performed the full test of our primary endpoint: the 400MWT test  due to restrictions during the pandemic. We are now exchanging with FDA for the preparation our phase 2-3 study and assuming authorizations are obtained  we expect to enroll our first patient in by H2 2022.Story continuesIn a global very unstable context since two years  we have demonstrated our capacity to adapt  while progressing the development of our main assets. We are still concentrating on the Company key objective  which is to bring to the market the products coming from our research.""Major operational milestones achieved during 2021:As regards to our global Phase 2-3 COVA study in COVID-19:The Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) had recommended in September 2021 from the Interim Analysis 2 the continuation of the COVA study without modification of the protocol based on results showing the efficacy of the treatment with Sarconeos (BIO101) in the promising zone and no futility of the study 237 patients have been randomized to date  over a total cohort expected to be between 310 and 465 patients  in 35 clinical centers in France  Belgium  the USA and BrazilAs regards to our Phase 2 SARA-INT trial for the treatment of Sarcopenia:Sarconeos (BIO101) at the highest dose of 350 mg bid demonstrated an increase of 0.1 meter per second (m/s) in the PP population (Per Protocol subset of participants that complied to the clinical protocol) of treatment). This result is meaningful as the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) for the 400MWT in sarcopenia is 0.1 m/s.However  due to restrictions during the pandemic  only 106 patients could perform the 400m walk test at the end-of-treatment visit  which was the primary endpoint of our study - ie 55% of loss of efficacy data Following a type C meeting in January 2022 with the FDA the Company is currently preparing a Phase 2-3 study  with the objective of having a first patient in during H2 2022  pending regulatory authorizations  and depending on the evolution of the pandemic.2022 outlook and perspectives:For the COVAstudy in COVID-19:To date  237 patients have been recruited in our COVA study. Due to the evolution of the pandemic in the territories of our studies which are presenting high vaccination and collective immunization rates  provided the predominance of the Omicron variant which involve significantly lower number of hospital cases  patient recruitment has strongly slowed down and then stopped since the first months of 2022. In this context  we have decided to early terminate patient enrollment  and plan to report the results of this trial by Q3 2022.For the SARA study in Sarcopenia:Following the first type C meeting with FDA in January 2022  a second type C meeting is planned in Q3 2022 to discuss the Phase 2-3 protocol. The objective is to have a FPI (First patient In) for this study during H2 2022. We also plan to have discussions with EMA during H2 2022  in order to obtain scientific advice on the Phase 2 results and the progression toward a phase 2-3. These plans remain subject to regulatory authorizations and procedures  any delays in patient recruitment or retention  interruptions in sourcing or supply chain  and to COVID-19-related delays.For the MYODAstudy in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD):After an IND ''may proceed'' letter from the FDA (USA)in December 2019  in March 2021 Biophytis received approval from the Belgian FAMHP to proceed with its clinical investigation of Sarconeos (BIO101) in non-ambulatory patients with DMD. However due to the COVID-19 situation and its impact on our operational capabilities  the MYODA study has been delayed to end of 2022 or beginning of 2023 depending on the evolution of the pandemic.Annual 2021 Financial ResultsThe Company's annual 2021 non-audited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS were reviewed by the Company's Board of Directors on April 4  2022.

Net research and development expenses were €19.7 million for 2021  an increase of €9.8 million  compared to €9.9 million in 2020. This increase is mainly reflecting the progression of the COVA program from Phase 1 to Phase 2  the finalization of SARA-INT  our phase 2 trial in Sarcopenia  as well as the scaling up of Sarconeos (BIO101) to prepare for potential registration.Net research and development expenses included research tax credits (French 'Crédit d'Impôt Recherche'  or CIR) totaling €4 million in 2021 compared to €3.3 million in 2020.* General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were €7.2 million for 2021 compared to €4 million for 2020  an increase of €3.2 million  primarily in connection with our listing on Nasdaq  and to higher personnel costs.Financial results:Financial loss amounted to €4.4 million in 2021 vs €11.6 million in 2020  a decrease of €7.2 million  resulting majorly from the variation of the fair value as calculated using IFRS 9  for our various convertible financing instruments  respectively Atlas  Kreos and Negma in 2021 and Atlas & Negma in 2020.* Net Loss. Net loss was €31.2 million for 2021  as compared to €25.5 million for 2020. Net loss per share (based on weighted-average number of shares outstanding over the period except the treasury shares) was €0.26 in 2021 compared to €0.43 in 2020.Appointments:Biophytis has reinforced its management teams through the nominations of: Benoit Canolle as Chief Business Officer  and Rob Van Maanen as Chief Medical Officer in 2021  then Philippe Rousseau as Chief Financial Officer in April 2022  upon departure of Evelyne NguyenAt the Board level  Claude Allary serves as Independent Director since July 2021  replacing Jean Franchi.Reminder of key operational events(more details are provided in our press releases as available on Biophytis's website: www.biophytis.com)Cova Phase 2-3 program in respiratory deficiencies linked to COVID-19:On May 12th  the Company announced it has recruited the 155th participant for Part 2 of the study in patients infected with COVID-19  which allowed the independent Data Monitoring Committee(DMC) to conduct its second interim analysis  based on safety and efficacy data  for thecontinuation of the trial  in case of favourable results.On June 30th  Biophytis secured contracts with a major global Custom Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO) for the manufacturing of registration batches of Sarconeos (BIO101). These contracts were signed in preparation of the potential filing of the product in COVID-19 for Emergency Use Authorization with FDA  or Conditional Marketing Authorization with EMA.On August 16th  the Company announced recommendation by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) to continue patient recruitment into part 2 of the COVA study with the protocol unmodified after review of safety data  based on the first 50 patients.On September 15th  the Company announced the recommendation by the DMC to continue the COVA study without any modification of the protocol after the interim efficacy data were found in the promising zone.This Interim Analysis 2 was based on 155 COVID-19 patients hospitalized with respiratory failure and has shown no futility  indicating that BIO101 remains a candidate treatment for acute respiratory failure associated with COVID-19.In December 2021 we received approval from the ANVISA (Brazilian health authority) to use our product Sarconeos (BIO101) for an Expanded Access Program (EAP) to treat hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19. A maximum of 80 patients who are mechanically ventilated in Intensive Care Unit of Brazilian hospitals will be treated with Sarconeos (BIO101) for up to 28 days to prevent further deterioration and mortality.Lastly  the Company has announced today the early termination of patient recruitment provided the evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic  and projects to report results by Q3 2022.SARA Phase 2 program in sarcopenia:On October 4th  the Company announced full results of the study  showing that Sarconeos (BIO101) at the highest dose of 350 mg bid showed an increase of 0.09 meter per second (m/s) in the FAS population and of 0.10 m/s in the PP population compared to placebo in observed data  for the 400MWT in gait speed  after 6 months of treatment in observed data. The Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) for the 400MWT in sarcopenia is 0.1 m/s.The product also showed a very good safety profile at the doses of 175 mg bid and of 350 mg bid with no Serious Adverse Events (SAE) related to the product.On January 24  2022  a type C meeting between the Company and the FDA was held.During the meeting  we discussed conducting additional dose-finding studies  as well as safety and pharmacokinetics data.We also discussed further definition of the proposed population and indication  and CMC (chemistry  manufacturing  and control section) data to be submitted  as well as the regulatory non-clinical plan.We will assess  and address FDA's recommendations in the coming development of our seamless Phase 2-3 program. Based on the comments from FDA  we plan to submit the protocols for our next studies in Q4 2022.

A summary of the consolidated financial statements is included below.Pascal Prigent  CEO of GENFIT  commented: “2021 was a pivotal year for us. We are pleased to have delivered on our key commitments which were to improve our financial situation  pursue our Phase 3 trial and strengthen our pipeline. We are grateful to our dedicated team for their efforts in realizing these objectives and our investors for their continued support.

The audit procedures by the Statutory Auditors are underway.Revenue and other operating incomeStory continuesRevenue and other operating income for 2021 amounted to €85.6 million compared to €7.8 million for 2020.Revenue for 2021 amounted to €80.1 million  mainly from the receipt of the €120.0 million upfront payment from Ipsen  out of which €80.0 million is recognized as 2021 revenue  after deduction of €40.0 million deferred revenue  which will gradually be recognized as revenue following the completion of the ELATIVE™ double-blind study. Other revenue recognized in 2021 is related to licensing agreements with Labcorp for the deployment of NIS4® technology in NASH.Revenue for 2020 amounted to €0.8 million  mainly from the license agreements with Labcorp  as well as one-time sales of goods and services within the scope of the collaboration and license agreement with Terns Pharmaceuticals.Other operating income included mainly the research tax credit (known as Crédit d’Impôt Recherche or CIR) granted by the French tax authorities  which amounted to €5.3 million for 2021 compared with €7.9 million for 2020  which was reduced by a €1.9 million expense following the settlement of a dispute relating to the CIR for 2010  2011  2012 and 2014.Operating expenses and operating resultOperating expenses for 2021 amounted to €53.8 million compared to €90.7 million for 2020.R&D expenditures  general and administrative expenses  marketing and market access expenses and other operating expenses decreased in 2021 compared to the previous year  amounting to €53.6 million compared to €85.3 million for 2020. This decrease mainly reflected the effects of the reorganization and restructuring plan  which was initiated during the fourth quarter 2020 and throughout 2021. The non-recurring costs associated with the implementation of the reorganization and restructuring plan decreased significantly from €5.3 million in 2020 to €0.1 million in 2021  consisting primarily of fees related to the renegotiation of the convertible bonds  partially offset by the reversal of certain impairment losses and provisions previously booked in 2020.In 2021  GENFIT generated a consolidated operating result of €31.8 million compared to an operating loss of €82.9 million in 2020.Financial result2021 resulted in a financial income of €37.7 million compared to a financial loss of €18.8 million in 2020.This variation was mainly due to the €35.6 million one-time bonus relating to the partial buyback of the convertible bonds (OCEANE) and to the decrease in expenses related to financial interest from €11.6 million in 2020 to €4.8 million in 2021.The foreign exchange result on cash and cash equivalents was a net gain of €6.7 million in 2021  compared to a net loss of €8.5 million in 2020. This mainly resulted from the effect of the exchange rate fluctuations on the cash investments held in US dollars  which have been kept in their original currency since they were invested. In connection with the preceding  €5.9 million out of the total 2021 foreign exchange result is qualified as unrealized.Cash and cash equivalentsAs of December 31  2021  the Company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted to €258.8 million compared with €171.0 million as of December 31  2020.This is mainly the result of:The €120.0 million non-refundable initial payment received from Ipsen pursuant to the license agreement signed in December 2021  further increased by €24.0 million of collected VAT;Ipsen’s €28.0 million equity investment in GENFIT’s share capital received in December 2021;The reimbursement in October 2021 of the 2020 CIR for €7.9 million;The granting of two State-guaranteed loans and a subsidized loan in June  July and November 2021 for a total amount of €15.2 million;€47.5 million (not including transaction expenses) disbursed for the partial buyback of the OCEANE convertible bonds in January 2021; andCash used in operating activities over the period.Note: taking into account the partial buyback of the OCEANEs and the conversions into shares that have taken place since the renegotiation of the convertible debt  which gave rise to the creation of 6 941 875 new shares  the residual convertible bond debt amounts to a nominal amount of €56.9 million as of April 7  2022  i.e. less than a third of the amount of the initial nominal debt of €180.0 million. The number of OCEANEs remaining in circulation is 1 923 662  representing a maximum dilution in the event of conversion of all convertible bonds of 17.52% (in % of capital held as of April 7  2022).2021 Key HighlightsFinancial – key highlightsSuccessful c onvertible debt renegotiationWe successfully restructured the convertible debt at the end of January 2021 with a partial buy-back and extended the maturity to October 2025. At the end of 2021  the outstanding nominal debt was approximately €56.9 million  i.e. less than a third of the initial nominal debt of €180.0 million.Non-dilutive State-Guaranteed Loan s for a total amount of €15 .2 millionIn 2021  GENFIT secured €15.2 million non-dilutive loans granted in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic  of which €13 million are guaranteed up to 90% by the French state.Long-term strategic partnership with IPSENIn December 2021  GENFIT entered into an exclusive  worldwide1 licensing agreement with IPSEN for elafibranor  a Phase 3 asset evaluated in Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC). Under the terms of the agreement  GENFIT received an upfront cash payment of €120.0 million and is eligible for regulatory  commercial and sales-based milestone payments of up to €360.0 million. GENFIT is also eligible to receive tiered double-digit royalties of up to 20%. In addition to global commercialization2  IPSEN will be responsible for all clinical development of elafibranor following completion of the ELATIVE™ double-blind period  including completion of the long-term open-label extension period of the ELATIVE™ trial. To underscore GENFIT and Ipsen’s long-term partnership  Ipsen has taken an 8% ownership stake for €28.0 million. Ipsen has now become GENFIT’s largest shareholder.Pipeline development – key highlightsElafibranor development program in PBCDespite the COVID-19 pandemic  patient enrolment for the Phase 3 ELATIVE™ clinical trial progressed well throughout 2021  with positive Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) outcomes. In February 2021  the Company announced the publication  in the Journal of Hepatology  of the positive results of the Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating elafibranor in patients with PBC and an incomplete response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). These results show a clinically significant improvement on the primary and composite biochemical evaluation criteria which is the primary endpoint of the pivotal trial to support accelerated approval. In addition  the results showed a positive trend on the improvement of pruritus  while preserving a favorable tolerability profile.Significant progress made in implementing our n ew pipeline strategyIn May 2021  we announced our new strategic direction in R&D which centers around refocusing our efforts in two new franchises with significant unmet medical needs: Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) and cholestatic diseases.In November 2021  we announced the first patient first visit for the evaluation of NTZ in subjects with hepatic impairment and we are currently initiating a Phase 1 study in renal impairment as part of our ACLF program. ACLF is a severe liver disease with a high unmet need. These Phase 1 studies represent a key milestone in the Company’s pipeline development and  upon completion and if positive  will enable GENFIT to progress towards a proof-of-concept study in patients with acute decompensated cirrhosis and ACLF.In December 2021  GENFIT strengthened its cholestatic disease franchise through the in-licensing of exclusive rights from Genoscience Pharma to develop and commercialize the investigational drug GNS561 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) in the United States  Canada and Europe  including the United Kingdom and Switzerland.On the diagnostics side of the business  in November 2021  a study undertaken by the Non-Invasive Biomarkers of Metabolic Liver Disease (NIMBLE)  an initiative of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health’s Biomarkers Consortium (FNIH) confirmed that NIS4® technology demonstrates a unique performance in identifying patients with at-risk Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)  and provided evidence that it had the best results of the five blood-based biomarker panels which were assessed in this study  for the diagnosis of fibrosis stage≥ 2. The FNIH NIMBLE findings will have a strong utility for the whole NASH field and practitioners  and could potentially pave the way for regulatory qualification for non-invasive tests in NASH. NIS4® technology is currently powering a test called NASHnext™ commercialized by our partner Labcorp in the U.S. and Canada.Organizational and governance updatesIn March 2021  Jean-François Tiné was appointed Member of the Board of Directors  replacing Philippe Moons.In April 2021  GENFIT appointed Thomas Baetz as Chief Financial Officer.In 2021  GENFIT added four new members to its Executive Committee: Pascal Caisey (hired as Chief Commercial Officer and promoted Chief Operating Officer in February 2022)  Stefanie Magner (Chief Compliance Officer and VP International Legal Affairs)  Philippe Motté (Chief Regulatory and Quality Officer) and Thomas Baetz (Chief Financial Officer).In October 2021  the Environmental Social Governance (ESG) Committee was created following new recommendations of the Middlenext Code. The aim of the committee is to measure and track GENFIT’s non-financial performance on an annual basis. Ms. Catherine Larue serves as Chairwoman on the ESG Committee.Outlook 2022Building on our strengths to execute our strategyWe believe our strengths  listed below  provide the foundation that will allow us to successfully expand our activities in 2022 and beyond:Experience in bringing early-stage assets into late development stages  with expertise ranging from research to pre-commercialization  and including clinical development and regulatory affairs;A portfolio rationalized in 2021  focusing on disease areas with high unmet needs and high market potential;Choosing partners with a strong commercial track-record; andA robust financial situation with a strong cash position.Continuing elafibranor development program in PBCAs previously communicated  we saw a disruption in our clinical operations at the end of last year due to the COVID pandemic and specifically the rise of the Omicron strain. However  our recruitment numbers rebounded significantly in the first quarter 2022 as the situation normalized. Screening of patients will stop next week as end of enrollment is now imminent.This means that we remain committed to deliver topline data readout in the second quarter 2023  in line with our previous guidance.Pursuing the execution of existing programsOur second objective is to continue the execution of the following programs:NTZ in ACLF: following encouraging pre-clinical results  we are moving forward with the Phase 1 trial in hepatic impairment  aiming for data readout by the third quarter 2022. We are also initiating a Phase 1 study in renal impairment  with data anticipated in the fourth quarter 2022. If positive  both the hepatic and renal studies will be supportive of the ACLF Investigational New Drug application and proof-of-concept study.GNS561 in CCA: we intend to start a Phase 1b/2 trial by the second half 2022.NASH Diagnostics: our goal is to further establish NIS4™ technology through scientific publications and increased use in the field.Pipeline strategy and impact on financial outlookGENFIT will continue to grow and diversify its pipeline in 2022 by leveraging its expertise in bringing early-stage assets to late-development stages. To achieve this goal  we follow a dual-track approach based on repurposing of molecules approved in other indications and in-licensing of molecules developed by other companies.As we continue our efforts to identify product candidates with the highest potential  conduct pre-clinical studies and clinical trials and advance the development of our diagnostic test  we expect that our cash used in operational activities will increase to €65 million in 2022 (excluding exceptional items of €30.0 million payable in 2022 in relation to the upfront payment received from Ipsen in late 2021  i.e. primarily VAT collected and corporate income tax  as well as potential costs and expenses in future business development activities such as in-licensing).GENFIT will host a conference call in English and in French on April 8  2022 at 8.00am ET / 1:00pm GMT / 2:00pm CETBoth the English and French conference calls will be accessible on the investor page of our website  under the events section at https://ir.genfit.com/ or by calling 800-239-9838 (toll-free U.S and Canada)  0800 358 6377 (toll-free UK) or 0805 101 219 (toll-free France) five minutes prior to the start time (confirmation code: 9241456).

This merger would lead to creation of a market leader in the tanker market.,On Thursday  two of the world's largest operators of crude oil tankers Euronav and Frontline   announced a merger. The two companies are going to merge in all-share transactions  and it will result in the world's largest oil tanker fleet in terms of capability.Frontline board has already approved the merger valuing the combined entity at $4.2 billion. The merged entity will surpass Cosco   China's largest owner of large crude carriers. Post the merger  Frontline will hold a 59% stake in the merged company and the remaining holding will belong to Euronav.Post-merger  Frontline would be in a position to offer value-enhancing services to its customers and increase fleet revenue and utilization. It will benefit all the stakeholders. The combined fleet will consist of 57 Suezmax vessels  69 very large crude carriers  and 20 long-range two Aframax vessels.The deal will make it the largest owner of both suezmaxes and VLCCs  overtaking Greek-owned private fleets and national owners in China  Saudi Arabia  and Iran.The merger news was in the air for a long time  so it has not come as a surprise to most people. The news gained momentum when Fredriksen  a transport tycoon  bought 9% stake in Euronav in 2021. However  readers should know that the merger was first sought two decades back in 1999.The chief executive position will remain with Hugo De Stoop . The board of directors will change and now will have the following: two nominated by the Fredriksen holding company Hemen Holding Limited  three current independent Euronav board members  and two additional new independent directors.Euronav is listed in New York and Euronext  while Frontline is listed on the Oslo and New York Inventory Exchanges.Frontline VLCCs are not listed on the Tankers International pool website. On the other side  Euronav vessels are listed.

2479,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-dupixent-dupilumab-approved-050000582.html,Press Release: Dupixent® (dupilumab) approved by European Commission for children aged 6 to 11 years with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation,Dupixent® (dupilumab) approved by European Commission for children aged 6 to 11 years with severe asthma with type 2 inflammation Dupixent is the only...,Sanofi - Aventis GroupeDupixent® (dupilumab) approved by European Commission for children aged 6 to 11 years with severe asthma with type 2 inflammationDupixent is the only biologic indicated in the European Union for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation  characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fractional exhaled nitric oxideApproval based on Phase 3 data showing Dupixent significantly reduced severe asthma attacks and also improved lung function and health-related quality of life for childrenData reinforce well-established safety profile of DupixentParis and Tarrytown  N.Y. April 7  2022. The European Commission (EC) has expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union. Dupixent is now also approved in children aged 6 to 11 years as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)  who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.Naimish Patel  M.D.Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation  Sanofi“We are excited to bring the well-established safety and efficacy of Dupixent to even younger patients living with uncontrolled severe asthma in Europe. In addition to greatly reducing severe asthma attacks and improving lung function  patients in our clinical trial also reduced their oral corticosteroid use. This is particularly meaningful as these are medicines that can carry significant safety risks if used long term. This approval underscores our continued commitment to bringing Dupixent to as many patients as possible suffering from the negative effects of severe asthma with the hope of improving their quality of life.”Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Up to 85% of children with asthma may have type 2 inflammation and are more likely to have higher disease burden. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care ICS and bronchodilators  these children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing  wheezing and difficulty breathing. Severe asthma may impact children's developing airways and cause potentially life-threatening exacerbations. Children with severe asthma also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks. Uncontrolled severe asthma can interfere with day-to-day activities  like sleeping  attending school and playing sports.Story continuesDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent Phase 3 clinical program  which has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation  has established that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.President and Chief Scientific Officer  Regeneron“Today’s approval in Europe recognizes the benefits of Dupixent in helping children living with the profound effects of severe asthma  including unpredictable asthma attacks  routine disruption to daily activities and the use of systemic steroids that can impede children’s growth. Dupixent is the only treatment available that specifically blocks two key drivers of type 2 inflammation  IL-4 and IL-13  which our trials show plays a major role in childhood asthma  as well as in related conditions such as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and the often co-morbid condition  atopic dermatitis. In clinical trials  Dupixent significantly reduced asthma attacks  helped children breathe better and improved their health-related quality of life. We also remain committed to investigating Dupixent in other conditions where type 2 inflammation may significantly impact patients’ lives  including eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria.”The EC decision is based on pivotal data from the Phase 3 VOYAGE trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent combined with standard-of-care asthma therapy in 408 children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma.Two pre-specified populations with evidence of type 2 inflammation were evaluated for the primary analysis: 1) patients with baseline blood eosinophils (EOS) ≥300 cells/μl (n=259) and 2) patients with either baseline FeNO ≥20 parts per billion (ppb) or baseline blood EOS ≥150 cells/μl (n=350). Patients who added Dupixent to standard-of-care in these two groups  respectively  experienced:Substantially reduced rates of severe asthma attacks  with a 65% and 59% average reduction over one year compared to placebo (0.24 and 0.31 events per year for Dupixent vs. 0.67 and 0.75 for placebo  respectively).Improved lung function observed as early as two weeks and sustained for up to 52 weeks  measured by percent predicted FEV 1 (FEV 1 pp). At 12 weeks  patients taking Dupixent improved their lung function by 5.32 and 5.21 percentage points compared to placebo  respectively.Improved asthma control  with 81% and 79% of patients reporting a clinically meaningful improvement at 24 weeks  based on disease symptoms and impact compared to 64% and 69% of placebo patients  respectively.Improved health-related quality of life  with 73% and 73% of patients reporting a clinically meaningful improvement at 24 weeks  compared to 63% and 65% of placebo patients  respectively.Reduced systemic corticosteroid use by an average of 66% and 59% over one year compared to placebo (0.27 and 0.35 courses per year for Dupixent vs. 0.81 and 0.86 for placebo  respectively).The safety results from the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. The overall rates of adverse events were 83% for Dupixent and 80% for placebo. Adverse events that were more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included injection site reactions (18% Dupixent  13% placebo)  viral upper respiratory tract infections (12% Dupixent  10% placebo) and eosinophilia (7% Dupixent  1% placebo). Helminth infections were also more commonly observed with Dupixent in patients aged 6 to 11 years and were reported in 2% of Dupixent patients and 0% of placebo patients.About the LIBERTY ASTHMA VOYAGE TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent (100 mg or 200 mg every two weeks  based on weight tier) combined with standard-of-care asthma therapy in 408 children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. More than 90% of children in the trial had at least one concurrent atopic medical condition such as allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis.The primary endpoint was the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over one year  and the key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in percentage of predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 (FEV 1 pp) at week 12. The FEV1pp seeks to evaluate a patient's change in lung function compared to their predicted lung function based on age  height  sex and ethnicity to account for children's growing lung capacity at different stages of development. Additional secondary endpoints included responder rates for asthma control as measured by a ≥0.5 improvement on the Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 Interviewer Administered (ACQ-7-IA; 7-point scale) and health-related quality of life as measured by a ≥0.5 improvement on the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activities-Interviewer Administered (PAQLQ(S)-IA; 7-point scale).About DupixentDupixent is also approved in Europe  U.S.  Japan and other countries around the world for use in certain patients with asthma  specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis as well as CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world  and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.Dupixent is an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years  Dupixent dosing is based on weight tier (100 mg every two weeks or 300 mg every four weeks for children ≥15 to <30 kg  200 mg every two weeks or 300 mg every four weeks for children ≥30 to <60 kg and 200 mg every two weeks for children ≥60 kg) and is supplied as a pre-filled syringe. It is also available as a pre-filled pen for adolescents (12 to 17 years) and adults at 200 and 300 mg doses. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes including pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) has expanded the marketing authorization for...,"Approval based on Phase 3 data showing Dupixent significantly reduced severe asthma attacks and also improved lung function and health-related quality of life for childrenData reinforce well-established safety profile of DupixentTARRYTOWN  N.Y. and PARIS  April 7  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals  Inc. (NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) has expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union. Dupixent is now also approved in children aged 6 to 11 years as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)  who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.""Today's approval in Europe recognizes the benefits of Dupixent in helping children living with the profound effects of severe asthma  including unpredictable asthma attacks  routine disruption to daily activities and the use of systemic steroids that can impede children's growth "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. ""Dupixent is the only treatment available that specifically blocks two key drivers of type 2 inflammation  IL-4 and IL-13  which our trials show plays a major role in childhood asthma  as well as in related conditions such as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and the often co-morbid condition  atopic dermatitis. In clinical trials  Dupixent significantly reduced asthma attacks  helped children breathe better and improved their health-related quality of life. We also remain committed to investigating Dupixent in other conditions where type 2 inflammation may significantly impact patients' lives  including eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria.""Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Up to 85% of children with asthma may have type 2 inflammation and are more likely to have higher disease burden. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care ICS and bronchodilators  these children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing  wheezing and difficulty breathing. Severe asthma may impact children's developing airways and cause potentially life-threatening exacerbations. Children with severe asthma also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks. Uncontrolled severe asthma can interfere with day-to-day activities  like sleeping  attending school and playing sports.Story continuesDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. By demonstrating significant clinical benefit together with a decrease in type 2 inflammation following IL-4 and IL-13 blockade with Dupixent  the Dupixent Phase 3 clinical program has established that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases for which Dupixent is approved including asthma  atopic dermatitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  as well as investigational diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis  which have been studied in Phase 3 trials.""We are excited to bring the well-established safety and efficacy profile of Dupixent to even younger patients living with uncontrolled severe asthma in Europe. In addition to greatly reducing severe asthma attacks and improving lung function  patients in our clinical trials also reduced their oral corticosteroid use. This is particularly meaningful as these are medicines that can carry significant safety risks if used long term "" said Naimish Patel  M.D. Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""This approval underscores our continued commitment to bringing Dupixent to as many patients as possible suffering from the negative effects of severe asthma with the hope of improving their quality of life.""The EC decision is based on pivotal data from the Phase 3 VOYAGE trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent combined with standard-of-care asthma therapy in 408 children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma.Two pre-specified populations with evidence of type 2 inflammation were evaluated for the primary analysis: 1) patients with baseline blood eosinophils (EOS) ≥300 cells/μl (n=259) and 2) patients with either baseline FeNO ≥20 parts per billion (ppb) or baseline blood EOS ≥150 cells/μl (n=350). Patients who added Dupixent to standard-of-care in these two groups  respectively  experienced:Substantially reduced rates of severe asthma attacks  with a 65% and 59% average reduction over one year compared to placebo (0.24 and 0.31 events per year for Dupixent vs. 0.67 and 0.75 for placebo  respectively).Improved lung function observed as early as two weeks and sustained for up to 52 weeks  measured by percent predicted FEV 1 (FEV 1 pp).Improved asthma control  with 81% and 79% of patients reporting a clinically meaningful improvement at 24 weeks  based on disease symptoms and impact compared to 64% and 69% of placebo patients  respectively.Improved health-related quality of life  with 73% and 73% of patients reporting a clinically meaningful improvement at 24 weeks  compared to 63% and 65% of placebo patients  respectively.Reduced systemic corticosteroid use by an average of 66% and 59% over one year compared to placebo (0.27 and 0.35 courses per year for Dupixent vs. 0.81 and 0.86 for placebo  respectively).The safety results from the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. The overall rates of adverse events were 83% for Dupixent and 80% for placebo. Adverse events that were more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included injection site reactions (18% Dupixent  13% placebo)  viral upper respiratory tract infections (12% Dupixent  10% placebo) and eosinophilia (7% Dupixent  1% placebo). Helminth infections were also more commonly observed with Dupixent in patients aged 6 to 11 years and were reported in 2% of Dupixent patients and 0% of placebo patients.About the LIBERTY ASTHMA VOYAGE TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent (100 mg or 200 mg every two weeks  based on weight tier) combined with standard-of-care asthma therapy in 408 children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. More than 90% of children in the trial had at least one concurrent atopic medical condition such as allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis.The primary endpoint was the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over one year  and the key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in percentage of predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 (FEV 1 pp) at week 12. The FEV 1 pp seeks to evaluate a patient's change in lung function compared to their predicted lung function based on age  height  sex and ethnicity to account for children's growing lung capacity at different stages of development. Additional secondary endpoints included responder rates for asthma control as measured by a ≥0.5 improvement on the Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 Interviewer Administered (ACQ-7-IA; 7-point scale) and health-related quality of life as measured by a ≥0.5 improvement on the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activities-Interviewer Administered (PAQLQ(S)-IA; 7-point scale).About DupixentDupixent is also approved in Europe  U.S.  Japan and other countries around the world for use in certain patients with asthma  specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis as well as CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world  and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.Dupixent is an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years  Dupixent dosing is based on weight tier (100 mg every two weeks or 300 mg every four weeks for children ≥15 to <30 kg  200 mg every two weeks or 300 mg every four weeks for children ≥30 to <60 kg and 200 mg every two weeks for children ≥60 kg) and is supplied as a pre-filled syringe. It is also available as a pre-filled pen for adolescents (12 to 17 years) and adults at 200 and 300 mg doses. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and InmazebTM (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes including pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 years of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. DUPIXENT is not used to treat sudden breathing problems. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled.

Animoca Brands  which was founded in January 2014 by Yat Siu and David Kim  and its various subsidiaries “develop and publish a broad portfolio of blockchain games  traditional games  and other products  many of which are based on popular global brands  such as Formula 1®  Disney  WWE  Power Rangers  MotoGP™  and Doraemon. Animoca Brands is also a prolific investor with over 100 investments in NFT-related blockchain companies  including Sky Mavis (Axie Infinity)  Dapper Labs (NBA Top Shot)  OpenSea  Harmony  Bitski  and Alien Worlds.”Here is how Binance Research described The Sandbox back in August 2020:“The Sandbox is a virtual world built on the Ethereum blockchain  where players can build  own  and monetize their gaming experiences… The SAND token is an ERC-20 utility token that is used for value transfers as well as staking and governance… Players can create digital assets in the form of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs)  upload them to the marketplace  and integrate into games with Game Maker.“And here is the how The Sandbox team describes SAND and LAND:“SAND is the utility token used throughout The Sandbox ecosystem as the basis for transactions and interactions. It is an ERC-20 utility token built on the Ethereum blockchain. There is a finite supply of 3 000 000 000 SAND...“The Sandbox Metaverse is made up of LANDS  that are parts of the world  owned by players to create and monetize experiences. There will only ever be 166 464 LANDS available  which can be used to host games  build multiplayer experiences  create housing  or offer social experiences to the community.“What Are ETPs?ETPs are “collateralized  non-interest paying debt securities designed to replicate the performance of an underlying asset and in the case of 21Shares’s ETPs  its products “replicate the performance of the crypto asset (Bitcoin  Ethereum  Ripple  Bitcoin Cash) or the index it tracks (HODL5  BIT10  ABBA).”Here is how 21Shares explains the difference between ETPs and ETFs:“Although ETPs are structured and operate very similarly to traditional Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)  the primary difference between the two is that ETPs are debt securities issued by a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) instead.“21Shares Launches a $SAND ETPAccording to a press release shared with CryptoGlobe  the new ETP — called 21Shares The Sandbox ETP (Ticker: SAND) — “marks the 30th cryptocurrency ETP offered by 21Shares ” and will be “cross-listed on Euronext Paris and Amsterdam.” 21Shares says that it “offers the most extensive crypto product suite of any issuer worldwide  in CHF  EUR  GBP and USD  across Europe.”Hany Rashwan  CEO and co-founder of 21Shares  had this to say:“The launch of our 30th product is an important milestone in our history as an innovator in the crypto industry. It is testament to the quality of the team we have built  and our position at the forefront of the acceleration of the global blockchain movement  that we have achieved this growth in scale in four years. We are committed to making crypto accessible for everyone and continuing to offer best-in-class products to our investors is true to that vision. This is just the beginning.“Here are some product details:VALOR: 117736100ISIN: CH1177361008Bloomberg: SAND BWFee: 2.5%Custody: CoinbaseMarket Maker: Lang & SchwarzHSBC Joins The Sandbox MetaverseOn March 16  financial services giant HSBC and Ethereum-powered play-to-earn (P2E) game The Sandbox announced “a new partnership that will open up a host of opportunities for virtual communities across the world to engage with global financial services providers and sports communities in The Sandbox metaverse.”According to a blog post published by The Sandbox team on March 15  this partnership will “see the global financial services provider acquire a plot of LAND  virtual real estate in The Sandbox metaverse  which will be developed to engage and connect with sports  esports and gaming enthusiasts.”Suresh Balaji  Chief Marketing Officer  Asia-Pacific  HSBC  had this to say:“The metaverse is how people will experience Web3  the next generation of the Internet — using immersive technologies like augmented reality  virtual reality and extended reality.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) has expanded the marketing authorization for Dupixent® (dupilumab) in the European Union. Dupixent is now also approved in children aged 6 to 11 years as an add-on maintenance treatment for severe asthma with type 2 inflammation characterized by raised blood eosinophils and/or raised fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO)  who are inadequately controlled with medium to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus another medicinal product for maintenance treatment.""Today's approval in Europe recognizes the benefits of Dupixent in helping children living with the profound effects of severe asthma  including unpredictable asthma attacks  routine disruption to daily activities and the use of systemic steroids that can impede children's growth "" said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. ""Dupixent is the only treatment available that specifically blocks two key drivers of type 2 inflammation  IL-4 and IL-13  which our trials show plays a major role in childhood asthma  as well as in related conditions such as chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis and the often co-morbid condition  atopic dermatitis. In clinical trials  Dupixent significantly reduced asthma attacks  helped children breathe better and improved their health-related quality of life. We also remain committed to investigating Dupixent in other conditions where type 2 inflammation may significantly impact patients' lives  including eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria.""Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases in children. Up to 85% of children with asthma may have type 2 inflammation and are more likely to have higher disease burden. Despite treatment with current standard-of-care ICS and bronchodilators  these children may continue to experience serious symptoms such as coughing  wheezing and difficulty breathing. Severe asthma may impact children's developing airways and cause potentially life-threatening exacerbations. Children with severe asthma also may require the use of multiple courses of systemic corticosteroids that carry significant risks. Uncontrolled severe asthma can interfere with day-to-day activities  like sleeping  attending school and playing sports.Dupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. By demonstrating significant clinical benefit together with a decrease in type 2 inflammation following IL-4 and IL-13 blockade with Dupixent  the Dupixent Phase 3 clinical program has established that IL-4 and IL-13 are key drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases for which Dupixent is approved including asthma  atopic dermatitis and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  as well as investigational diseases such as eosinophilic esophagitis and prurigo nodularis  which have been studied in Phase 3 trials.""We are excited to bring the well-established safety and efficacy profile of Dupixent to even younger patients living with uncontrolled severe asthma in Europe. In addition to greatly reducing severe asthma attacks and improving lung function  patients in our clinical trials also reduced their oral corticosteroid use. This is particularly meaningful as these are medicines that can carry significant safety risks if used long term "" said Naimish Patel  M.D. Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation at Sanofi. ""This approval underscores our continued commitment to bringing Dupixent to as many patients as possible suffering from the negative effects of severe asthma with the hope of improving their quality of life.""The EC decision is based on pivotal data from the Phase 3 VOYAGE trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent combined with standard-of-care asthma therapy in 408 children with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma.Two pre-specified populations with evidence of type 2 inflammation were evaluated for the primary analysis: 1) patients with baseline blood eosinophils (EOS) ≥300 cells/μl (n=259) and 2) patients with either baseline FeNO ≥20 parts per billion (ppb) or baseline blood EOS ≥150 cells/μl (n=350). Patients who added Dupixent to standard-of-care in these two groups  respectively  experienced:Substantially reduced rates of severe asthma attacks  with a 65% and 59% average reduction over one year compared to placebo (0.24 and 0.31 events per year for Dupixent vs. 0.67 and 0.75 for placebo  respectively).Improved lung function observed as early as two weeks and sustained for up to 52 weeks  measured by percent predicted FEV 1 (FEV 1 pp).(FEV pp). At 12 weeks  patients taking Dupixent improved their lung function by 5.32 and 5.21 percentage points compared to placebo  respectively.Improved asthma control  with 81% and 79% of patients reporting a clinically meaningful improvement at 24 weeks  based on disease symptoms and impact compared to 64% and 69% of placebo patients  respectively.Improved health-related quality of life  with 73% and 73% of patients reporting a clinically meaningful improvement at 24 weeks  compared to 63% and 65% of placebo patients  respectively.Reduced systemic corticosteroid use by an average of 66% and 59% over one year compared to placebo (0.27 and 0.35 courses per year for Dupixent vs. 0.81 and 0.86 for placebo  respectively).The safety results from the trial were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in patients aged 12 years and older with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. The overall rates of adverse events were 83% for Dupixent and 80% for placebo. Adverse events that were more commonly observed with Dupixent compared to placebo included injection site reactions (18% Dupixent  13% placebo)  viral upper respiratory tract infections (12% Dupixent  10% placebo) and eosinophilia (7% Dupixent  1% placebo). Helminth infections were also more commonly observed with Dupixent in patients aged 6 to 11 years and were reported in 2% of Dupixent patients and 0% of placebo patients.About the LIBERTY ASTHMA VOYAGE TrialThe Phase 3 randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent (100 mg or 200 mg every two weeks  based on weight tier) combined with standard-of-care asthma therapy in 408 children aged 6 to 11 years with uncontrolled moderate-to-severe asthma. More than 90% of children in the trial had at least one concurrent atopic medical condition such as allergic rhinitis and atopic dermatitis.The primary endpoint was the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations over one year  and the key secondary endpoint was the change from baseline in percentage of predicted pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 (FEV 1 pp) at week 12. The FEV 1 pp seeks to evaluate a patient's change in lung function compared to their predicted lung function based on age  height  sex and ethnicity to account for children's growing lung capacity at different stages of development. Additional secondary endpoints included responder rates for asthma control as measured by a ≥0.5 improvement on the Asthma Control Questionnaire-7 Interviewer Administered (ACQ-7-IA; 7-point scale) and health-related quality of life as measured by a ≥0.5 improvement on the Pediatric Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire with Standardized Activities-Interviewer Administered (PAQLQ(S)-IA; 7-point scale).About DupixentDupixent is also approved in Europe  U.S.  Japan and other countries around the world for use in certain patients with asthma  specific patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis as well as CRSwNP in different age populations. Dupixent is also approved in one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries around the world  and more than 400 000 patients have been treated globally.Dupixent is an injection under the skin (subcutaneous injection) at different injection sites. In the EU for pediatric patients aged 6 to 11 years  Dupixent dosing is based on weight tier (100 mg every two weeks or 300 mg every four weeks for children ≥15 to <30 kg  200 mg every two weeks or 300 mg every four weeks for children ≥30 to <60 kg and 200 mg every two weeks for children ≥60 kg) and is supplied as a pre-filled syringe. It is also available as a pre-filled pen for adolescents (12 to 17 years) and adults at 200 and 300 mg doses. Dupixent is intended for use under the guidance of a healthcare professional and can be given in a clinic or at home by self-administration after training by a healthcare professional. In children younger than 12 years of age  Dupixent should be administered by a caregiver if given at home.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately a quarter of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies currently available. This includes Dupixent  REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and InmazebTM (atoltivimab  maftivimab  and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes including pediatric atopic dermatitis (6 months to 5 years of age  Phase 3)  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation (Phase 3)  eosinophilic esophagitis (Phase 3)  bullous pemphigoid (Phase 3)  prurigo nodularis (Phase 3)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (Phase 3)  chronic inducible urticaria-cold (Phase 3)  chronic rhinosinusitis without nasal polyposis (Phase 3)  allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (Phase 3)  allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (Phase 3) and peanut allergy (Phase 2). These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. IndicationsDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 years of age and older with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies. DUPIXENT can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with atopic dermatitis under 6 years of age.with other asthma medicines for the maintenance treatment of moderate-to-severe eosinophilic or oral steroid dependent asthma in adults and children 6 years of age and older whose asthma is not controlled with their current asthma medicines. DUPIXENT helps prevent severe asthma attacks (exacerbations) and can improve your breathing. DUPIXENT may also help reduce the amount of oral corticosteroids you need while preventing severe asthma attacks and improving your breathing. DUPIXENT is not used to treat sudden breathing problems. It is not known if DUPIXENT is safe and effective in children with asthma under 6 years of age.with other medicines for the maintenance treatment of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP) in adults whose disease is not controlled.

Subject to the shareholder approval  the effective date of these guidelines will be applied retrospectively to 1 January 2022. The intention of the Board of Directors is that these remuneration guidelines will remain in place for four years from the date of approval. The guidelines remain as per those approved last year with exception that we are increasing the minimum shareholding requirement for Executive Management to 2 times annual net base salary in line with our new executive LTIP strategy and the proposed introduction of a new stock options plan as set out in Item 24.Remuneration principles to support Kindred's long-term business strategy and sustainabilityA successful implementation of our remuneration policy will ensure that Kindred can attract and retain the best people  enabling us to execute our business strategy and serve our long-term interests  including our sustainability goals. The policy of the Board is to attract  retain and motivate the best management by rewarding them with competitive compensation packages linked to the Group's financial and strategic objectives. The compensation packages are designed to be competitive  but importantly  also fair and reasonable in comparison with companies of a similar size  industry and international scope  and to strike the appropriate balance between risk and reward.The short-term and long-term incentive plans are designed to support key business strategies and financial objectives and contribute to creating strong  sustainable performance for the Group. The performance measures used for short and long-term incentive plans are closely linked to our strategic objectives for sustainable growth. Performance measures as well as any corresponding targets are reviewed annually by the Committee to ensure that they continue to drive the right behaviours in executive managers and create value for our shareholders.Remuneration guidelines by elementThe components of remuneration for the Executive Management comprise base salary  short-term and long-term incentive plans  pension and other benefits. The remuneration guidelines do not apply to share-based incentive plans  which are subject to a separate resolution at the Annual General Meetings.In the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary levels  incentive structures and employment conditions for other employees of the company have also been considered.Base salaryExecutive managers receive base salaries based on position  responsibilities  performance and competencies.Short-term incentivesShort-term incentives for the Group typically take the form of annual bonuses and are paid in cash. Maximum variable cash-based incentives are capped at 150 percent of base salary.Awards for any short-term incentive plans are contingent on financial measures such as for example EBITDA (aggregated across the Group)  as well as customer experience  sustainability measures and business critical objectives. The Remuneration Committee selects the performance measures  targets and relative weightings at the start of each year to ensure strong alignment with business strategy and that targets are sufficiently stretching. The measures and targets are then reviewed and approved by the Board. Achievement of targets is assessed and formal approval for payment of awards is sought following the publication of the relevant period's financial results.Long-term incentivesThe long-term incentive incentives align the interests of executives with those of shareholders by granting performance shares and share options as a reward for delivery of long-term performance objectives  and for creating value for stakeholders. Performance measures  weightings and targets for these selected measures are set at the start of the 3-year performance/vesting period by the Remuneration Committee to ensure they continue to support Kindred's long-term strategy. The measures and targets are then reviewed and approved by the Board. Performance measures may include  but are not limited to  financial and share-price related measures.PensionPension arrangements for the CEO and the other members of the Executive Management  are provided in the form of defined contribution plans  are competitive and appropriate in context of the market practice in the applicable country of executives' employment or residence and total remuneration.Other benefitsOther benefits that may be provided are in accordance with market practice in the applicable country of executives' employment or residence and may change from time to time. Executive Management members may be eligible for beneﬁts such as health insurance  life insurance  travel allowance  relocation support (where applicable)  and to participate in whatever all-employee plans may be offered at any given point.Share Ownership GuidelineThe Board of Directors believes that the Executive Management members will most effectively pursue the long-term interests of our shareholders if they are shareholders themselves. As a result  we introduced share ownership guidelines which require that the CEO and other Executive Management members need to build up and maintain a minimum shareholding of 2 times net base annual salary to comply with this guideline.Employment contract  termination of employment and severance payExecutive contracts typically have an indefinite duration but may be offered on occasion for fixed term. Upon termination of employment  the notice period may not exceed twelve months. Fixed cash salary during the notice period and any severance pay may not  on a combined basis  exceed an amount equivalent to two years' salary.Upon termination of employment a non-compete clause may restrict the employee from engaging in a competing business. The non-compete clause restriction covers no more than twelve months following termination of employment. During the non-compete clause period Kindred may pay the former employee an amount corresponding to no more than 60 per cent of twelve months' salary.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the remuneration guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors decision to propose remuneration guidelines for the CEO and the Executive Management. Proposal for new remuneration guidelines shall be prepared at least every fourth year and submitted to the Annual General Meeting. The remuneration guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor the annual implementation of these guidelines. In order to avoid any conflict of interest  remuneration is managed through well-defined processes ensuring no individual is involved in the decision-making process related to their own remuneration.Malus & ClawbackThe Board of Directors  under exceptional circumstances  may limit or cancel payments of variable remuneration provided that such actions are deemed reasonable (malus). The Board of Directors shall also have the possibility  under applicable law or contractual provisions and subject to the restrictions that may apply under law or contract  to in whole or in part reclaim variable remuneration paid on incorrect grounds (clawback).Deviation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to deviate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if there in an individual case are special circumstances where a deviation is necessary in order to serve the Company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in respect to remuneration-related matters for the CEO and the Executive Management. This includes any resolutions to temporarily deviate from the guidelines.Agenda item 24Stock option plan for executive managementThe Board of Directors has reviewed remuneration for the executive management team and concluded that the Company would benefit from an introduction of a stock option to complement the current performance share plan to further increasing the top management's alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. The Board proposes that the 2022 Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' proposal regarding a stock option plan to the key executives in Kindred Group which will be used in conjunction with the existing performance share plan (PSP). This means that the long- term incentive plan structure from 2022 and onwards will be split between performance shares and stock options  as outlined below.The proposed plan design is a three-year stock option plan where each stock option entitles the participant to purchase one Kindred SDR at a price of 120% of the Kindred SDR price at the grant date. The options will be granted freely in other locations outside of Sweden (employee stock options)  while participants in Sweden will purchase the warrants at market value. The premium for the warrants in Sweden will be fully subsidised through an additional salary payment  and the subsidy is paid upfront and structured as a retention tool by requiring the participants to pay back the subsidy if they leave the company before exercise. All options can be exercised after the maturity date three years after grant. The total value of the allocation of both stock options and PSP shares will be equivalent to the annual fixed salary for each participant  and divided equally between the two instruments (i.e. 50% stock options / 50% PSP shares).The suggested stock option plan may in total comprise no more than 0 5% of all issued shares in Kindred  and on an accumulated basis the three outstanding plans of 2022-2025 will amount to around 1.4% of dilution. The total estimated cost (including IFRS2) of the 2022 stock option plan is 3.9 GBP millions but will be compensated by a saving of 3.5 GBP millions from 50% a lower allocation of PSP shares to senior executives already mandated by earlier AGMs.Agenda item 25Acquisition of Own SharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition of shares/SDR's shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares/SDRs to all shareholders. The purchases may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on actual market price and terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company's annual report and accounts.The objective of the purchase is to achieve added value for the Company's shareholders (including through the implementation of the share buy-back program previously announced)1 and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company's capital structure.Following the purchase  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or issue to employees under a Share Option programme (including  if approved  the stock option plan subject of agenda item 24) or Share Performance Scheme.Once purchased under the Maltese Companies Act further shareholder approval will be required before those shares could be cancelled only. Shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to the Company's share buy-back program will be cancelled (refer to Agenda item 25). A separate authorisation for such cancellation is being recommended pursuant to Resolution (s);If used as consideration for an acquisition  the intention would be that the actual Shares/SDRs would be offered to any potential transferor.Agenda item 26Share cancellationThe directors may decide to cancel all or some of shares/SDRs acquired pursuant to the buy-back program.The Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) stipulates that an extraordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company is required in order to approve the reduction in the issued share capital of the Company.Such resolution needs to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in Malta  who will publish details of such reduction. Creditors of the Company will then have a period of three months in which they can contest the reduction in capital. Upon the lapse of the three-month period  assuming that no contestations are received  the reduction in share capital can become effective.In order to reflect the changes in the issued share capital  a revised memorandum of association of the Company indicating the reduced number of shares then in issue in the capital of the Company will need to be submitted to the Registrar of Companies.The reduction in issued share capital will take place at such intervals and in such amounts (subject to the maximum amount of GBP 14 375) as the directors shall determine from time to time.Agenda item 27Share issueThe objectives of the authorisation to be granted in terms of this resolution are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares/SDRs on each issue date that will be used in determining the price at which shares/SDRs will be issued  should be the same as the market value of the shares/SDRs listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. A cap of 23 million ordinary shares/SDRs in the Company is being requested in connection with this authorisation. The cap will be reduced by the amount of any shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to Resolution (r) (but excluding shares / SDRs not already bought back by the Company on the date of the adoption of the resolution).The Annual Report in English together with other documents regarding the AGM are available on the Company's website www.kindredgroup.com /AGM .For information on how personal data are processed please seehttps://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfBy order of the BoardKindred Group plcMalta  April 2022NOTE1.

Subject to the shareholder approval  the effective date of these guidelines will be applied retrospectively to 1 January 2022. The intention of the Board of Directors is that these remuneration guidelines will remain in place for four years from the date of approval. The guidelines remain as per those approved last year with exception that we are increasing the minimum shareholding requirement for Executive Management to 2 times annual net base salary in line with our new executive LTIP strategy and the proposed introduction of a new stock options plan as set out in Item 24.Remuneration principles to support Kindred's long-term business strategy and sustainabilityA successful implementation of our remuneration policy will ensure that Kindred can attract and retain the best people  enabling us to execute our business strategy and serve our long-term interests  including our sustainability goals. The policy of the Board is to attract  retain and motivate the best management by rewarding them with competitive compensation packages linked to the Group's financial and strategic objectives. The compensation packages are designed to be competitive  but importantly  also fair and reasonable in comparison with companies of a similar size  industry and international scope  and to strike the appropriate balance between risk and reward.The short-term and long-term incentive plans are designed to support key business strategies and financial objectives and contribute to creating strong  sustainable performance for the Group. The performance measures used for short and long-term incentive plans are closely linked to our strategic objectives for sustainable growth. Performance measures as well as any corresponding targets are reviewed annually by the Committee to ensure that they continue to drive the right behaviours in executive managers and create value for our shareholders.Remuneration guidelines by elementThe components of remuneration for the Executive Management comprise base salary  short-term and long-term incentive plans  pension and other benefits. The remuneration guidelines do not apply to share-based incentive plans  which are subject to a separate resolution at the Annual General Meetings.In the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary levels  incentive structures and employment conditions for other employees of the company have also been considered.Base salaryExecutive managers receive base salaries based on position  responsibilities  performance and competencies.Short-term incentivesShort-term incentives for the Group typically take the form of annual bonuses and are paid in cash. Maximum variable cash-based incentives are capped at 150 percent of base salary.Awards for any short-term incentive plans are contingent on financial measures such as for example EBITDA (aggregated across the Group)  as well as customer experience  sustainability measures and business critical objectives. The Remuneration Committee selects the performance measures  targets and relative weightings at the start of each year to ensure strong alignment with business strategy and that targets are sufficiently stretching. The measures and targets are then reviewed and approved by the Board. Achievement of targets is assessed and formal approval for payment of awards is sought following the publication of the relevant period's financial results.Long-term incentivesThe long-term incentive incentives align the interests of executives with those of shareholders by granting performance shares and share options as a reward for delivery of long-term performance objectives  and for creating value for stakeholders. Performance measures  weightings and targets for these selected measures are set at the start of the 3-year performance/vesting period by the Remuneration Committee to ensure they continue to support Kindred's long-term strategy. The measures and targets are then reviewed and approved by the Board. Performance measures may include  but are not limited to  financial and share-price related measures.PensionPension arrangements for the CEO and the other members of the Executive Management  are provided in the form of defined contribution plans  are competitive and appropriate in context of the market practice in the applicable country of executives' employment or residence and total remuneration.Other benefitsOther benefits that may be provided are in accordance with market practice in the applicable country of executives' employment or residence and may change from time to time. Executive Management members may be eligible for beneﬁts such as health insurance  life insurance  travel allowance  relocation support (where applicable)  and to participate in whatever all-employee plans may be offered at any given point.Share Ownership GuidelineThe Board of Directors believes that the Executive Management members will most effectively pursue the long-term interests of our shareholders if they are shareholders themselves. As a result  we introduced share ownership guidelines which require that the CEO and other Executive Management members need to build up and maintain a minimum shareholding of 2 times net base annual salary to comply with this guideline.Employment contract  termination of employment and severance payExecutive contracts typically have an indefinite duration but may be offered on occasion for fixed term. Upon termination of employment  the notice period may not exceed twelve months. Fixed cash salary during the notice period and any severance pay may not  on a combined basis  exceed an amount equivalent to two years' salary.Upon termination of employment a non-compete clause may restrict the employee from engaging in a competing business. The non-compete clause restriction covers no more than twelve months following termination of employment. During the non-compete clause period Kindred may pay the former employee an amount corresponding to no more than 60 per cent of twelve months' salary.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the remuneration guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors decision to propose remuneration guidelines for the CEO and the Executive Management. Proposal for new remuneration guidelines shall be prepared at least every fourth year and submitted to the Annual General Meeting. The remuneration guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor the annual implementation of these guidelines. In order to avoid any conflict of interest  remuneration is managed through well-defined processes ensuring no individual is involved in the decision-making process related to their own remuneration.Malus & ClawbackThe Board of Directors  under exceptional circumstances  may limit or cancel payments of variable remuneration provided that such actions are deemed reasonable (malus). The Board of Directors shall also have the possibility  under applicable law or contractual provisions and subject to the restrictions that may apply under law or contract  to in whole or in part reclaim variable remuneration paid on incorrect grounds (clawback).Deviation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to deviate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if there in an individual case are special circumstances where a deviation is necessary in order to serve the Company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in respect to remuneration-related matters for the CEO and the Executive Management. This includes any resolutions to temporarily deviate from the guidelines.Agenda item 24Stock option plan for executive managementThe Board of Directors has reviewed remuneration for the executive management team and concluded that the Company would benefit from an introduction of a stock option to complement the current performance share plan to further increasing the top management's alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. The Board proposes that the 2022 Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' proposal regarding a stock option plan to the key executives in Kindred Group which will be used in conjunction with the existing performance share plan (PSP). This means that the long- term incentive plan structure from 2022 and onwards will be split between performance shares and stock options  as outlined below.The proposed plan design is a three-year stock option plan where each stock option entitles the participant to purchase one Kindred SDR at a price of 120% of the Kindred SDR price at the grant date. The options will be granted freely in other locations outside of Sweden (employee stock options)  while participants in Sweden will purchase the warrants at market value. The premium for the warrants in Sweden will be fully subsidised through an additional salary payment  and the subsidy is paid upfront and structured as a retention tool by requiring the participants to pay back the subsidy if they leave the company before exercise. All options can be exercised after the maturity date three years after grant. The total value of the allocation of both stock options and PSP shares will be equivalent to the annual fixed salary for each participant  and divided equally between the two instruments (i.e. 50% stock options / 50% PSP shares).The suggested stock option plan may in total comprise no more than 0 5% of all issued shares in Kindred  and on an accumulated basis the three outstanding plans of 2022-2025 will amount to around 1.4% of dilution. The total estimated cost (including IFRS2) of the 2022 stock option plan is 3.9 GBP millions but will be compensated by a saving of 3.5 GBP millions from 50% a lower allocation of PSP shares to senior executives already mandated by earlier AGMs.Agenda item 25Acquisition of Own SharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition of shares/SDR's shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares/SDRs to all shareholders. The purchases may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on actual market price and terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company's annual report and accounts.The objective of the purchase is to achieve added value for the Company's shareholders (including through the implementation of the share buy-back program previously announced)1 and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company's capital structure.Following the purchase  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or issue to employees under a Share Option programme (including  if approved  the stock option plan subject of agenda item 24) or Share Performance Scheme.Once purchased under the Maltese Companies Act further shareholder approval will be required before those shares could be cancelled only. Shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to the Company's share buy-back program will be cancelled (refer to Agenda item 25). A separate authorisation for such cancellation is being recommended pursuant to Resolution (s);If used as consideration for an acquisition  the intention would be that the actual Shares/SDRs would be offered to any potential transferor.Agenda item 26Share cancellationThe directors may decide to cancel all or some of shares/SDRs acquired pursuant to the buy-back program.The Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) stipulates that an extraordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company is required in order to approve the reduction in the issued share capital of the Company.Such resolution needs to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in Malta  who will publish details of such reduction. Creditors of the Company will then have a period of three months in which they can contest the reduction in capital. Upon the lapse of the three-month period  assuming that no contestations are received  the reduction in share capital can become effective.In order to reflect the changes in the issued share capital  a revised memorandum of association of the Company indicating the reduced number of shares then in issue in the capital of the Company will need to be submitted to the Registrar of Companies.The reduction in issued share capital will take place at such intervals and in such amounts (subject to the maximum amount of GBP 14 375) as the directors shall determine from time to time.Agenda item 27Share issueThe objectives of the authorisation to be granted in terms of this resolution are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares/SDRs on each issue date that will be used in determining the price at which shares/SDRs will be issued  should be the same as the market value of the shares/SDRs listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. A cap of 23 million ordinary shares/SDRs in the Company is being requested in connection with this authorisation. The cap will be reduced by the amount of any shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to Resolution (r) (but excluding shares / SDRs not already bought back by the Company on the date of the adoption of the resolution).The Annual Report in English together with other documents regarding the AGM are available on the Company's website www.kindredgroup.com /AGM .For information on how personal data are processed please seehttps://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfBy order of the BoardKindred Group plcMalta  April 2022NOTE1.

The guidelines are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the Annual General Meeting 2022. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the general meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityAAK's business strategy is described on AAK's website  www.aak.com.A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. To this end  it is necessary that the company offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the company to offer the executive management a competitive total remuneration.Warrants programs have been implemented in the company for senior executives and key employees within the AAK Group. The programs have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. For more information regarding the programs  see AAK's Annual Report 2021  note 8. The Board proposes the Annual General Meeting 2022 to resolve on the implementation of a new subscription warrants program for senior executives and key employees within the AAK Group (Incentive Program 2022/2027) to replace Incentive Program 2021/2026 resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting 2021. In total  Incentive Program 2022/2027 comprises approximately 50 senior executives and key employees within the Group. The program entails that the participants are offered to acquire subscription warrants at market value  with the option price in part subsidized by AAK. The term of the subscription warrants is five years. The program is clearly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the company's long-term value creation  including its sustainability. The general meeting resolves on implementation of the program and the program is therefore excluded from these guidelines.Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.Types of remuneration  etc.The remuneration shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally  the general meeting may - irrespective of these guidelines - resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration.The satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a period of one or several years. The annual variable cash remuneration may amount to not more than 120 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.Pension entitlements for senior executives shall apply from the age of 60 years at the earliest. For the CEO  pension benefits  including health insurance (Sw. sjukförsäkring)  shall be premium defined. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 30 percent of the fixed annual cash salary. For other senior executives  pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be premium defined unless the individual concerned is subject to defined benefit pension under mandatory collective agreement provisions. Variable cash remuneration shall qualify for pension benefits to the extent required by applicable mandatory collective agreement provisions. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 30 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.Other benefits may include  for example  life insurance  medical insurance (Sw: sjukvårdsförsäkring) and company cars. Such benefits may amount to not more than 10 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.For employments governed by rules other than Swedish  duly adjustments may be made for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines.Termination of employmentThe notice period may not exceed 12 months if notice of termination of employment is made by the company. Fixed cash salary during the period of notice and severance pay may together not exceed an amount equivalent to the fixed cash salary for two years. The period of notice may not exceed six months without any right to severance pay when termination is made by the executive.In addition  remuneration for any commitment to restrict competition can be paid. Such remuneration shall compensate for any loss of income and shall only be paid to the extent that the former executive has no right to severance pay. The remuneration shall be based on the fixed cash salary at the time of termination and shall be paid during the period the non-compete restriction applies  which shall not exceed 12 months after the termination of employment.Criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration  etc.The variable cash remuneration shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria which can be financial or non-financial. They can also be individualized  quantitative or qualitative objectives. The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  by for example being clearly linked to the business strategy or promote the executive's long-term development.The criteria mainly applied are linked to the development of operating profit  return on capital employed and earnings per share. The criteria shall also be linked to the fulfilment of predetermined sustainability criteria (ESG - Environmental  Social and Governance). The criteria thereby contribute to the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability.To which extent the criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration has been satisfied shall be evaluated/determined when the measurement period has ended. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable cash remuneration to the CEO and other executives. For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the company.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable. The increase of the gap between the remuneration to senior executives and remuneration to other employees will be disclosed in the remuneration report.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the executive management  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the company. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent in relation to the company and company management. The CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters. The Board of Directors shall annually draw up a remuneration report that shall be presented to the Annual General Meeting for approval.Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.Description of material changes of the guidelines and how the shareholders' opinions are consideredNo material amendments have been made to the guidelines. In relation to the guidelines for remuneration to senior executives adopted on the Annual General Meeting 2021  the guidelines have been adjusted so that the annual variable cash remuneration may amount to maximum 120 percent instead of 110 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.No remarks on the remuneration guidelines have emerged.Proposal of the Board of Directors for implementation of a long-term incentive program including resolutions on (A) issue of subscription warrants series 2022/2027 and (B) transfer of subscription warrants series 2022/2027 (Incentive Program 2022/2027) to replace Incentive Program 2021/2026 resolved by the Annual General Meeting 2021 (item 16)The Annual General Meeting in the company held on May 7  2021 resolved on a long-term incentive program for senior executives and certain key employees within the AAK Group including a directed issue of subscription warrants and approval of transfer of subscription warrants. Since no subscription warrants have been subscribed for or transferred to participants in the program  the Board of Directors has deemed it appropriate to propose to the Annual General Meeting to resolve to replace the incentive program resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting 2021 with a new long-term incentive program for senior executives and certain key employees within the AAK Group (""Incentive Program 2022/2027"") including resolutions on (A) a directed issue of subscription warrants series 2022/2027 and (B) approval of transfer of subscription warrants in Incentive Program 2022/2027 on essentially the following terms and conditions.A. Issue of subscription warrants series 2022/2027The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves:that the company shall issue a maximum of five million (5 000 000) subscription warrants entitling to subscription for new shares in AAK AB by which the share capital may be increased by a total of maximum SEK 8 333 333.33   whereby it is noted that the amount exceeding the quota value shall be transferred to the non-restricted share premium account; that the issue is made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and the right to subscribe for the subscription warrants shall be granted to AAK Invest AB  a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAK AB; that the subscription warrants shall be issued free of charge; that subscription for the subscription warrants shall be made on August 31  2022 at the latest  with a right for the Board of Directors to prolong this time limit; that each subscription warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in AAK AB with a quota value of SEK 1.67 ; that subscription for shares in AAK AB by exercise of the subscription warrants may take place during the period from and including September 1  2025 up to and including August 31  2027 ; that the subscription price per share shall correspond to 120 percent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for the share in the company during the period from and including May 5  2022 up to and including May 18  2022   but not lower than the share's quota value; and that shares that have been issued by virtue of the subscription warrants  will entitle to dividend for the first time on the first record date for dividend occurring after subscription of shares through exercise of subscription warrants has been executed.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is that AAK AB wishes to introduce an incentive program for senior executives and key employees within the Group  whereby they will be offered the opportunity to take part in a value increase of the company's share. This is expected to increase the interest in the company's development and to stimulate a continued company loyalty over the forthcoming years. An incentive program is also expected to contribute to the possibilities to recruit and retain competent  motivated and committed employees.B. Transfer of subscription warrants in Incentive Program 2022/2027Incentive Program 2022/2027 shall principally be carried out in accordance with what is stated below.The subscription warrants shall towards payment be transferred by AAK Invest AB  on one or several occasions  to senior executives and key employees within the AAK Group  in accordance with the guidelines stated below. AAK Invest AB shall otherwise dispose of the subscription warrants for the fulfilment of the obligations under Incentive Program 2022/2027. Transfer in accordance with item B.1 shall be made at a market value at the time of transfer  which shall be determined by an independent valuation institute in accordance with the Black & Scholes valuation method. The valuation model is based on the variables risk-free interest rate  volatility  the term of the subscription warrants  expected share dividends during the term of the subscription warrants  the current share price  and the subscription price for shares when exercising the subscription warrants (strike price). The company will by means of a cash bonus subsidize part of the participants' acquisition of warrants through payment to the participants of an extra cash bonus that  after individual tax  corresponds to maximum 65 percent of the amount invested by the respective participant in Incentive Program 2022/2027 up to the offered level in accordance with the guidelines below. Only premiums for warrants up to and including the offered level for each participant in accordance with the guidelines below are subsidized. This bonus will be paid out with one fourth (1/4) annually starting one year after acquisition  and with the last payment approximately four (4) years after the acquisition and requires that before each payment the respective participant  with certain exceptions  is still an employee of the AAK Group and still holds the acquired warrants or  where applicable  the shares subscribed through exercising the warrants. The Board of Directors may  if deemed necessary in individual cases  resolve on alternative payment schedules or that bonus under certain circumstances will not be paid or may be reclaimed  subject to the limitations which may follow from applicable law. The Board of Directors of AAK AB shall be entitled to decide on the allotment of subscription warrants to approximately 50 senior executives and key employees within the Group in accordance with the following guidelines:Category Position Number of subscription warrants I CEO 500 000 II Member of Group management (10 persons) 300 000 III Directly reporting to theGroup management (approximately 30 persons) 90 000 IV Other senior executives and key employees(approximately 10 persons) 30 000The participants can choose to apply for a lower number of subscription warrants than set out above. If the total number of subscription warrants that the entitled senior executives and key employees wish to acquire exceeds the maximum number of subscription warrants that can be issued  reduction shall be made proportionally to each person's quantity in relation to the guidelines set forth above. There will be no guaranteed allotment. A participant has the right to subscribe for a larger number of warrants than set out in the guidelines above and may be allotted additional warrants corresponding to a maximum of 100 percent of what is set out in the guidelines above if full subscription in the program has not been made. If such oversubscription is made  allotment shall be made to the oversubscribing participants pro rata in relation to the number of subscription warrants that they have been allotted in the first allotment. Any remaining warrants  which have not been allotted in accordance with the above  shall be reserved for future recruitment of persons within the above eligible categories  whereby the above guidelines for allotment shall be applicable. The reason why any future employees or promoted employees may be granted subscription warrants at such a time that the time between the allotment and the subscription period for shares may be less than three years  is that the Board of Directors deems it important that such employees  for the reasons applicable to Incentive Program 2022/2027 in general  are given the opportunity to take part in a value growth in the company's share already at the beginning of their employment.Dilution  effect on key ratios and costsAt full subscription of the proposed issue of subscription warrants  and full exercise of the subscription warrants  the share capital may be increased by a total of maximum SEK 8 333 333.33  which is equivalent to approximately 1.9 percent of the company's present share capital. This corresponds to a total dilution of maximum approximately 1.9 percent in relation to the share capital on a fully diluted basis  calculated as the number of new shares in proportion to the number of existing and new shares.Other important key ratios will  at full subscription of the proposed issue and full exercise of all subscription warrants issued in the program  be affected as follows (based on the corresponding key ratios in the year-end report for 2021 and a preliminary valuation of the future capital contribution within the scope of Incentive Program 2022/2027)- earnings per share: reduction by SEK 0.13 from SEK 6.71 to SEK 6.58;- equity per share: increase by SEK 3.03 from SEK 45.58 to SEK 48.61; it being assumed that the warrant holders have exercised the warrants for subscription of new shares by the end of the first quarter 2022.The above is subject to re-calculations of the subscription warrants in accordance with the customary terms of re-calculation in the complete terms and conditions.The subscription warrant program is expected to have a marginal impact on the company's financial ratios. Therefore  no measures to secure the program are planned to take place. The total costs associated with the subscription warrant program  including the directed issue  the subsequent transfer of warrants and the subsidy  assuming full participation  is expected to amount to approximately SEK 150 million  which is distributed over the term of the program of five (5) years. The amount includes estimated costs relating to social security contributions and administrative costs for the program.Preparation of the proposalThe warrants program has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and the Board with advice from external experts. The proposal has been resolved upon by the Board. The CEO has not participated in the preparation of the proposal.Previous incentive programs in AAKFor a description of AAK's other share-related incentive programs  please see the company's Annual Report 2021  note 8. Apart from the program presented therein  there are no other share-related incentive programs in AAK.Majority requirementsThe proposal of the Board of Directors pursuant to item 16 A-B above requires a resolution by the general meeting supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of both the number of votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.Proposal regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issues (item 17)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to  on one or several occasions during the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  resolve on new issues of shares.

By resolutions in accordance with the authorization  the number of shares may be increased by a number corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) percent of the number of outstanding shares in the company at the time of when the Board of Directors first uses the authorization.The purpose of any deviation from the shareholders' preferential right as set out above is to ensure financing of acquisitions of companies  part of companies or businesses or to strengthen the company's capital base and equity/assets ratio. Such issues of shares may not require amendment of the Articles of Association applicable from time to time. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  share issues by virtue of the authorization shall be made on market conditions.

Bolagsverket).The resolution requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.Proposal regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase and transfer of the company's own shares (item 18)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to  on one or several occasions during the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on repurchase and transfer of the company's own shares.

Transfers of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer in connection with acquisitions may be made at a market value assessed by the Board of Directors. The purpose of the authorizations is to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value and to enable acquisition opportunities by financing acquisitions with the company's own shares.The resolution requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.C.

The changes shall be applicable on agreements entered into and changes to existing agreements after the annual general meeting. Besides the aforementioned  the adopted guidelines shall remain unchanged.Item 14. Resolution on implementation of a long-term incentive programme for senior management and other key individuals by way of (i) a directed issue of warrants and (ii) approval of transfer of warrants The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on implementation of a long-term incentive programme (""Warrant programme 2022/2025"") for senior management and other key individuals by way of (i) a directed issue of warrants and (ii) approval of transfer of warrants on the terms and conditions set forth below. The warrants shall entitle to subscription of new shares in the company.Background and reason for proposalAs of today  there are two share related incentive programmes for senior management and other key individuals. Please refer to ""Existing share related incentive programmes"" below for more information. The board of directors is of the opinion that share related incentive programmes strengthen the retention of those participating and motivates them to create shareholder value. The board of directors assess that these objectives are in line with all shareholders' interests and annually evaluates whether to propose share related incentive programs at the annual general meeting.This proposal has been presented in order to enable an increased commitment for senior management and other key individuals already participating in the existing incentive programmes as well as to enable participation in a share related incentive programme for persons within the aforementioned categories (incl. new-recruitments) not participating in the existing incentive programmes.The incentive programme shall encompass existing and future senior management and other key individuals of the company group as set forth below (the ""Participants""). Board members of the company will not be allowed to participate.Terms and conditions for the issue of warrants1. The company shall issue no more than 150 076 warrants of which no more than 136 834 warrants of series 2022/2025:A and no more than 13 242 warrants of series 2022/2025:B. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new share in the company  each with a quotient value of SEK 0.50. If all warrants are subscribed  transferred to and exercised by the Participants for subscription of new shares  the company's share capital will increase by SEK 75 038 of which SEK 68 417 in relation to warrants of series 2022/2025:A and SEK 6 621 in relation to warrants of series 2022/2025:B (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with customary terms and conditions to be applicable in relation to the warrants).2. The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  only be subscribed for by the company and/or its subsidiaries after which they are to be transferred to the Participants in accordance with the resolution adopted by the general meeting and instructions from the company's board of directors. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the warrants are to be used within the proposed incentive programme.QleanAir AB • Box 1178 Torggatan 13 • 171 54 Solna SwedenPress Release08 April 2022 15:30:00 CEST3. Subscription of warrants shall be made on a subscription list on 15 June 2022 at the latest. The board of directors shall be entitled to prolong the subscription period.4. The company is not to pay anything for the warrants. The subscription price to be paid by a subsidiary for each warrant shall correspond to the theoretical market value of the warrants  calculated by an independent valuation agent engaged by the company by use of the Black & Scholes valuation model. The period of measurement for such calculation shall correspond to the period of measurement of the Exercise Price (as defined below) in accordance with item 6 below. Payment is to be made in connection with subscription of warrants and not later than on 15 June 2022. The board of directors shall be entitled to prolong the time period for payment.5. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the period from and including 1 June 2025 until and including 31 December 2025. Subscription of new shares may however not take place during so-called closed periods according to the EU Market Abuse Regulation  or otherwise in breach of relevant insider rules and regulations (including the company's internal guidelines in this respect). Warrants that have not been exercised for subscription of new shares by 31 December 2025 shall lapse.6. Each warrant shall entitle the warrant holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the company at a subscription price per share (the ""Exercise Price"") corresponding to 130 percent of the volume weighted average trading price for the company's share on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market during a period of ten (10) trading days immediately following the annual general meeting. If no trading price is recorded for a particular trading day within the specified period  such day shall not be taken into account  but the period shall instead be extended forwards in time with the number of succeeding trading days required for the period to comprise ten (10) trading days with a recorded trading price. Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account. The Exercise Price thus calculated shall be rounded off to the nearest whole SEK 0.01  whereupon SEK 0.005 shall be rounded upwards.7. Warrants of series 2022/2025:A shall also be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Schedule A to the board of directors' complete proposal and warrants of series 2022/2025:B shall also be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in Schedule B to the board of directors' complete proposal.8. The chairman of the board of directors  the CEO or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorised to make any minor adjustments required to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Transfer of warrants to the ParticipantsThe warrants are to be transferred to the Participants against a premium payable by the Participants corresponding to the theoretical market value of the warrants as of the date of transfer  calculated by an independent valuation agent engaged by the company by use of the Black & Scholes valuation model. Warrants may be transferred to the Participants free-of-charge provided that it does not entail negative tax consequences for the company group (only applicable with respect to Participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden). The market value is preliminary estimated to SEK 2.95 per warrant  based on a market value of the underlying share corresponding to SEK 39.50  assuming an Exercise Price of SEK 51.34.The board of directors of the company shall resolve upon allocation to Participants in accordanceQleanAir AB • Box 1178 Torggatan 13 • 171 54 Solna Sweden",neutral,0.03,0.88,0.09,negative,0.04,0.38,0.58,True,English,"['ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING', 'QLEANAIR AB', 'NOTICE', 'PUBL', 'Swedish Central Securities Depository', 'Livförsäkringsbolaget Skandia', 'Anna af Petersens', 'long-term incentive programme', 'Oskar Börjesson', 'Bengt Engström', 'consolidated financial statements', 'P.O.

Grant Thornton Sweden AB has informed that Per Kjellander will continue to be appointed as the responsible auditor.Item 13: Resolution on amendment of the Articles of AssociationThe board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves to change the company's company name from Polygiene AB to Polygiene Group AB and that the following provisions in the Articles of Association regarding the company's share capital and the number of shares also are amended as follows.§ 1 Company nameCurrent wordingThe company name is Polygiene AB. The company is a public company.Proposed wordingThe company name is Polygiene Group AB. The company is a public company.§ 4 Share capitalCurrent wordingThe share capital shall not be less than SEK 1 300 000 and shall not exceed SEK 5 200 000.Proposed wordingThe share capital shall not be less than SEK 3 600 000 and shall not exceed SEK 14 400 000.§ 5 Number of sharesCurrent wordingThe number of shares shall not be less than 13 000 000 and shall not exceed 52 000 000.Proposed wordingThe number of shares shall not be less than 36 000 000 and shall not exceed 144 000 000.The company's CEO shall be authorized to make minor formal adjustments of the resolution which may be required for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket).Item 14: Resolution on authorization regarding issuesThe board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors  up until the next annual shareholders' meeting  at one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions regarding contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions  to issue shares  convertibles and/or warrants. The reason for why a deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights should be possible is to enable the company to source working capital  to be able to execute acquisitions of companies or operating assets as well as to enable new issues to industrial partners within the framework of partnerships and alliances. The total number of shares that may be issued (alternatively be issued through conversion of convertibles and/or exercise of warrants) pursuant to the authorization shall not exceed 4 058 554 shares  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 10 per cent calculated on the current number of shares. In case the authorization is used for a new issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the issue shall be made on market terms.The company's CEO shall be authorized to make minor formal adjustments of the resolution which may be required for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Item 15: Resolution on implementation of a warrant program by way of (A) directed issue of warrants; and (B) approval of transfer of warrantsThe board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves to implement a warrant program for employees and consultants in the company based on issue and transfer of warrants (the ""Warrants Program 2022/2025"").To implement the Warrants Program 2022/2025  the board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves on (A) directed issue of warrants; and (B) approval of transfer of warrants  on the following terms and conditions:Directed issue of warrantsA maximum of 300 000warrants shall be issued for the Warrants Program 2022/2025.With deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the right to subscribe for the warrants shall only vest in a wholly owned subsidiary to the company (the ""Subsidiary""). The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the warrants shall be used within the Warrants Program 2022/2025.The Subsidiary's subscription shall be made at the latest on 30 June 2022  with a right for the board of directors to prolong the subscription period.Over subscription cannot occur.The warrants shall be issued to the Subsidiary against cash consideration which shall correspond to the warrant's fair market value calculated in accordance with the Black Scholes formula. The calculation of the fair market value of the warrants shall be established by ÖhrlingsPricewaterhouseCoopers AB in connection with the expiration of the measurement period on 20 May 2022.Payment shall be made in connection with subscription.Each warrant shall entitle to subscription of one share in the company. Subscription of shares by virtue of the warrants may be effected as from 1 June 2025 up to and including 30 June 2025.The subscription price per share shall correspond to 200 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official price list for shares in the company during the period as from and including 12 May 2022 to and including 20 May 2022.The subscription price shall be rounded to the nearest whole öre  whereupon 0.5 öre shall be rounded upwards. The amount that exceeds the share quotient value shall be added to the free share premium reserve. The subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles right to subscribe for are subject to customary recalculation in the event of a split-up or consolidation of shares  rights issue etc.The shares issued upon utilization of a warrant shall confer right to dividends the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately following effectuation of subscription to such extent that the share has been recorded in the company's share ledger as interim share.In case all warrants are utilized for subscription of new shares  the share capital will increase with SEK 30 000.Transfer of warrantsThe Warrants Program 2022/2025 shall principally be carried out in accordance with what is stated below.The Subsidiary shall have the right  on one or several occasions  to transfer the warrants to employees and consultants in the company in accordance with the terms and guidelines set forth below. Transfer to participants under the Warrants Program 2022/2025 shall be made against cash consideration which shall correspond to the fair market value of the warrant calculated in accordance with the above. According to a preliminary valuation  the market value of the warrants corresponds to approximately SEK 0.88 per warrant (assuming a share price of SEK 23.50  a subscription price of SEK 47 per share  a risk free interest of 0.84 per cent and a volatility of 30 per cent)  calculated in accordance with the Black Scholes formula.The board of directors of the company shall resolve upon allotment to participants in the Warrants Program 2022/2025  whereby participants in each category listed below can be offered up to the maximum of the number of warrants listed below:CEO a maximum of 100 000 warrantsOther senior executives a maximum of 40 000 warrants per person(5 persons)Other employees/consultants a maximum of 20 000 warrants per person(approximately 40 persons)Allotment is estimated to occur on 15 June 2022 at the latest.A participant can subscribe for a lower number of warrants compared to what is offered to the participant. Over subscription cannot occur.Right to allotment in the Warrants Program 2022/2025 requires that the participant at the relevant time of allotment at the latest  holds a position in the company or has signed an agreement regarding it and has not  at such time  informed or been informed that the employment or assignment will be terminated.For participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden  it is implied that transfer of warrants is legally possible and that transfer  in the board of director's opinion  can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial efforts at their established fair market value. The board of directors shall be authorized to adjust the terms and conditions of the Warrants Program 2022/2025 to the extent required in order for allotment of warrants to participants in other jurisdictions  to the extent practically possible  to be carried out under the same conditions imposed by the Warrants Program 2022/2025.Other information regarding the Warrants Program 2022/2025The reasons for the implementation of the Warrants Program 2022/2025 and the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights are to be able to create possibilities for the company to retain competent staff through the offering of a long term ownership engagement for the employees and consultants in the company. Such ownership engagement is expected to stimulate the employees and consultants in the company to an increased interest for the business and the earnings trend as well as to increase the feeling of connectedness with the company.Since the warrants in the Warrants Program 2022/2025 will be transferred to the participants at the fair market value  the company's assessment is that the company will not incur any social costs in relation to Warrants Program 2022/2025. The costs related to Warrants Program 2022/2025 will hence only be composed of limited costs for implementation and administration of the program.Per the date of the notice  the number of shares in the company amounts to 36 526 989.In case all warrants issued within the Warrants Program 2022/2025 are utilized for subscription of new shares  a total of 300 000 new shares will be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.81 per cent of the company's share capital and votes after full dilution  calculated on the number of shares that will be added upon full utilization of all warrants issued under the Warrants Program 2022/2025. The dilution would only have had a marginal impact on the key figure earnings per share for the full year 2021.There is currently incentive programs in the form of three warrants programs outstanding in the company pursuant to which in the aggregate 900 000 new shares may be issued. If all existing incentive programs that are outstanding and the proposed Warrants Program 2022/2025 are exercised in full  in the aggregate 1 200 000 shares will be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3.18 per cent of the company's share capital and votes after full dilution  calculated on the number of shares that will be added upon full exercise of all outstanding incentive program and the proposed Warrants Program 2022/2025.The above calculations regarding dilution are subject to re-calculation of the warrants in accordance with the customary recalculation terms included in the applicable warrant terms.The proposal of the Warrants Program 2022/2025 has been prepared by the board of directors together with external consultants.The board of directors' proposal in accordance with Sections A-B above shall be resolved upon as one resolution by the meeting.The Chairman of the board of directors shall be authorized to make minor formal adjustments of the resolution which may be required for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or Euroclear Sweden AB.Particular majority requirementsFor valid resolutions on the proposals pursuant to items 13 and 14  the proposals have to be supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the meeting. For a valid resolution on the proposal pursuant to item 15  the proposal has to be supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the meeting.Shareholders' right to informationThe board of directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believes that it can be done without significant harm to the company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of items on the agenda  circumstances that can affect the assessment of the company's or its subsidiaries financial position and the company's relation to other companies within the group.

The guidelines are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the Annual General Meeting 2022. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the general meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityAAK's business strategy is described on AAK's website  www.aak.com.A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. To this end  it is necessary that the company offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the company to offer the executive management a competitive total remuneration.Warrants programs have been implemented in the company for senior executives and key employees within the AAK Group. The programs have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. For more information regarding the programs  see AAK's Annual Report 2021  note 8. The Board proposes the Annual General Meeting 2022 to resolve on the implementation of a new subscription warrants program for senior executives and key employees within the AAK Group (Incentive Program 2022/2027) to replace Incentive Program 2021/2026 resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting 2021. In total  Incentive Program 2022/2027 comprises approximately 50 senior executives and key employees within the Group. The program entails that the participants are offered to acquire subscription warrants at market value  with the option price in part subsidized by AAK. The term of the subscription warrants is five years. The program is clearly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the company's long-term value creation  including its sustainability. The general meeting resolves on implementation of the program and the program is therefore excluded from these guidelines.Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.Types of remuneration  etc.The remuneration shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally  the general meeting may - irrespective of these guidelines - resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration.The satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a period of one or several years. The annual variable cash remuneration may amount to not more than 120 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.Pension entitlements for senior executives shall apply from the age of 60 years at the earliest. For the CEO  pension benefits  including health insurance (Sw. sjukförsäkring)  shall be premium defined. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 30 percent of the fixed annual cash salary. For other senior executives  pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be premium defined unless the individual concerned is subject to defined benefit pension under mandatory collective agreement provisions. Variable cash remuneration shall qualify for pension benefits to the extent required by applicable mandatory collective agreement provisions. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 30 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.Other benefits may include  for example  life insurance  medical insurance (Sw: sjukvårdsförsäkring) and company cars. Such benefits may amount to not more than 10 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.For employments governed by rules other than Swedish  duly adjustments may be made for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines.Termination of employmentThe notice period may not exceed 12 months if notice of termination of employment is made by the company. Fixed cash salary during the period of notice and severance pay may together not exceed an amount equivalent to the fixed cash salary for two years. The period of notice may not exceed six months without any right to severance pay when termination is made by the executive.In addition  remuneration for any commitment to restrict competition can be paid. Such remuneration shall compensate for any loss of income and shall only be paid to the extent that the former executive has no right to severance pay. The remuneration shall be based on the fixed cash salary at the time of termination and shall be paid during the period the non-compete restriction applies  which shall not exceed 12 months after the termination of employment.Criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration  etc.The variable cash remuneration shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria which can be financial or non-financial. They can also be individualized  quantitative or qualitative objectives. The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  by for example being clearly linked to the business strategy or promote the executive's long-term development.The criteria mainly applied are linked to the development of operating profit  return on capital employed and earnings per share. The criteria shall also be linked to the fulfilment of predetermined sustainability criteria (ESG - Environmental  Social and Governance). The criteria thereby contribute to the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability.To which extent the criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration has been satisfied shall be evaluated/determined when the measurement period has ended. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable cash remuneration to the CEO and other executives. For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the company.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable. The increase of the gap between the remuneration to senior executives and remuneration to other employees will be disclosed in the remuneration report.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the executive management  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the company.

The Board of Directors shall annually draw up a remuneration report that shall be presented to the Annual General Meeting for approval.Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.Description of material changes of the guidelines and how the shareholders' opinions are consideredNo material amendments have been made to the guidelines. In relation to the guidelines for remuneration to senior executives adopted on the Annual General Meeting 2021  the guidelines have been adjusted so that the annual variable cash remuneration may amount to maximum 120 percent instead of 110 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.No remarks on the remuneration guidelines have emerged.Proposal of the Board of Directors for implementation of a long-term incentive program including resolutions on (A) issue of subscription warrants series 2022/2027 and (B) transfer of subscription warrants series 2022/2027 (Incentive Program 2022/2027) to replace Incentive Program 2021/2026 resolved by the Annual General Meeting 2021 (item 16)The Annual General Meeting in the company held on May 7  2021 resolved on a long-term incentive program for senior executives and certain key employees within the AAK Group including a directed issue of subscription warrants and approval of transfer of subscription warrants. Since no subscription warrants have been subscribed for or transferred to participants in the program  the Board of Directors has deemed it appropriate to propose to the Annual General Meeting to resolve to replace the incentive program resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting 2021 with a new long-term incentive program for senior executives and certain key employees within the AAK Group (""Incentive Program 2022/2027"") including resolutions on (A) a directed issue of subscription warrants series 2022/2027 and (B) approval of transfer of subscription warrants in Incentive Program 2022/2027 on essentially the following terms and conditions.A. Issue of subscription warrants series 2022/2027The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves:that the company shall issue a maximum of five million (5 000 000) subscription warrants entitling to subscription for new shares in AAK AB by which the share capital may be increased by a total of maximum SEK 8 333 333.33  whereby it is noted that the amount exceeding the quota value shall be transferred to the non-restricted share premium account; that the issue is made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and the right to subscribe for the subscription warrants shall be granted to AAK Invest AB  a wholly-owned subsidiary of AAK AB; that the subscription warrants shall be issued free of charge; that subscription for the subscription warrants shall be made on August 31  2022 at the latest  with a right for the Board of Directors to prolong this time limit; that each subscription warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in AAK AB with a quota value of SEK 1.67; that subscription for shares in AAK AB by exercise of the subscription warrants may take place during the period from and including September 1  2025 up to and including August 31  2027; that the subscription price per share shall correspond to 120 percent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for the share in the company during the period from and including May 5  2022 up to and including May 18  2022  but not lower than the share's quota value; and that shares that have been issued by virtue of the subscription warrants  will entitle to dividend for the first time on the first record date for dividend occurring after subscription of shares through exercise of subscription warrants has been executed.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is that AAK AB wishes to introduce an incentive program for senior executives and key employees within the Group  whereby they will be offered the opportunity to take part in a value increase of the company's share. This is expected to increase the interest in the company's development and to stimulate a continued company loyalty over the forthcoming years. An incentive program is also expected to contribute to the possibilities to recruit and retain competent  motivated and committed employees.B. Transfer of subscription warrants in Incentive Program 2022/2027Incentive Program 2022/2027 shall principally be carried out in accordance with what is stated below.The subscription warrants shall towards payment be transferred by AAK Invest AB  on one or several occasions  to senior executives and key employees within the AAK Group  in accordance with the guidelines stated below. AAK Invest AB shall otherwise dispose of the subscription warrants for the fulfilment of the obligations under Incentive Program 2022/2027. Transfer in accordance with item B.1 shall be made at a market value at the time of transfer  which shall be determined by an independent valuation institute in accordance with the Black & Scholes valuation method. The valuation model is based on the variables risk-free interest rate  volatility  the term of the subscription warrants  expected share dividends during the term of the subscription warrants  the current share price  and the subscription price for shares when exercising the subscription warrants (strike price). The company will by means of a cash bonus subsidize part of the participants' acquisition of warrants through payment to the participants of an extra cash bonus that  after individual tax  corresponds to maximum 65 percent of the amount invested by the respective participant in Incentive Program 2022/2027 up to the offered level in accordance with the guidelines below. Only premiums for warrants up to and including the offered level for each participant in accordance with the guidelines below are subsidized. This bonus will be paid out with one fourth (1/4) annually starting one year after acquisition  and with the last payment approximately four (4) years after the acquisition and requires that before each payment the respective participant  with certain exceptions  is still an employee of the AAK Group and still holds the acquired warrants or  where applicable  the shares subscribed through exercising the warrants. The Board of Directors may  if deemed necessary in individual cases  resolve on alternative payment schedules or that bonus under certain circumstances will not be paid or may be reclaimed  subject to the limitations which may follow from applicable law. The Board of Directors of AAK AB shall be entitled to decide on the allotment of subscription warrants to approximately 50 senior executives and key employees within the Group in accordance with the following guidelines:Category Position Number of subscription warrants I CEO 500 000 II Member of Group management (10 persons) 300 000 III Directly reporting to theGroup management (approximately 30 persons) 90 000 IV Other senior executives and key employees(approximately 10 persons) 30 000The participants can choose to apply for a lower number of subscription warrants than set out above. If the total number of subscription warrants that the entitled senior executives and key employees wish to acquire exceeds the maximum number of subscription warrants that can be issued  reduction shall be made proportionally to each person's quantity in relation to the guidelines set forth above. There will be no guaranteed allotment. A participant has the right to subscribe for a larger number of warrants than set out in the guidelines above and may be allotted additional warrants corresponding to a maximum of 100 percent of what is set out in the guidelines above if full subscription in the program has not been made. If such oversubscription is made  allotment shall be made to the oversubscribing participants pro rata in relation to the number of subscription warrants that they have been allotted in the first allotment. Any remaining warrants  which have not been allotted in accordance with the above  shall be reserved for future recruitment of persons within the above eligible categories  whereby the above guidelines for allotment shall be applicable. The reason why any future employees or promoted employees may be granted subscription warrants at such a time that the time between the allotment and the subscription period for shares may be less than three years  is that the Board of Directors deems it important that such employees  for the reasons applicable to Incentive Program 2022/2027 in general  are given the opportunity to take part in a value growth in the company's share already at the beginning of their employment.Dilution  effect on key ratios and costsAt full subscription of the proposed issue of subscription warrants  and full exercise of the subscription warrants  the share capital may be increased by a total of maximum SEK 8 333 333.33  which is equivalent to approximately 1.9 percent of the company's present share capital. This corresponds to a total dilution of maximum approximately 1.9 percent in relation to the share capital on a fully diluted basis  calculated as the number of new shares in proportion to the number of existing and new shares.Other important key ratios will  at full subscription of the proposed issue and full exercise of all subscription warrants issued in the program  be affected as follows (based on the corresponding key ratios in the year-end report for 2021 and a preliminary valuation of the future capital contribution within the scope of Incentive Program 2022/2027)- earnings per share: reduction by SEK 0.13 from SEK 6.71 to SEK 6.58;- equity per share: increase by SEK 3.03 from SEK 45.58 to SEK 48.61; it being assumed that the warrant holders have exercised the warrants for subscription of new shares by the end of the first quarter 2022.The above is subject to re-calculations of the subscription warrants in accordance with the customary terms of re-calculation in the complete terms and conditions.The subscription warrant program is expected to have a marginal impact on the company's financial ratios. Therefore  no measures to secure the program are planned to take place. The total costs associated with the subscription warrant program  including the directed issue  the subsequent transfer of warrants and the subsidy  assuming full participation  is expected to amount to approximately SEK 150 million  which is distributed over the term of the program of five (5) years. The amount includes estimated costs relating to social security contributions and administrative costs for the program.Preparation of the proposalThe warrants program has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and the Board with advice from external experts. The proposal has been resolved upon by the Board. The CEO has not participated in the preparation of the proposal.Previous incentive programs in AAKFor a description of AAK's other share-related incentive programs  please see the company's Annual Report 2021  note 8. Apart from the program presented therein  there are no other share-related incentive programs in AAK.Majority requirementsThe proposal of the Board of Directors pursuant to item 16 A-B above requires a resolution by the general meeting supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of both the number of votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.Proposal regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issues (item 17)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to  on one or several occasions during the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  resolve on new issues of shares. The authorization shall also include the right to resolve on new issues of shares with terms concerning issues in kind  offset rights or other terms stated in Chapter 13  Section 5  first paragraph  6 in the Swedish Companies Act. By resolutions in accordance with the authorization  the number of shares may be increased by a number corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) percent of the number of outstanding shares in the company at the time of when the Board of Directors first uses the authorization.The purpose of any deviation from the shareholders' preferential right as set out above is to ensure financing of acquisitions of companies  part of companies or businesses or to strengthen the company's capital base and equity/assets ratio. Such issues of shares may not require amendment of the Articles of Association applicable from time to time. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  share issues by virtue of the authorization shall be made on market conditions. In accordance with the conditions set out above  the Board of Directors shall be authorized to resolve on other terms as considered necessary by the Board to carry out the issues.The Board of Directors further proposes that the Managing Director  or anyone appointed by the Managing Director  shall have the right to make any adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket).The resolution requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.Proposal regarding authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase and transfer of the company's own shares (item 18)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to  on one or several occasions during the period up until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on repurchase and transfer of the company's own shares. Repurchase of shares may be made at a maximum of so many shares that the company's holding does not exceed two (2) percent of the total number of shares in the company from time to time.

Transfer may be made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right on Nasdaq Stockholm as well as to third parties in connection with acquisition of a company or a business. Payment for transferred shares can be made in cash  through an issue in kind or set-off. Transfers of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Transfer in connection with acquisitions may be made at a market value assessed by the Board of Directors. The purpose of the authorizations is to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value and to enable acquisition opportunities by financing acquisitions with the company's own shares.The resolution requires approval from shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting in order to be valid.C.

Subject to the shareholder approval  the effective date of these guidelines will be applied retrospectively to 1 January 2022. The intention of the Board of Directors is that these remuneration guidelines will remain in place for four years from the date of approval. The guidelines remain as per those approved last year with exception that we are increasing the minimum shareholding requirement for Executive Management to 2 times annual net base salary in line with our new executive LTIP strategy and the proposed introduction of a new stock options plan as set out in Item 24.Remuneration principles to support Kindred's long-term business strategy and sustainabilityA successful implementation of our remuneration policy will ensure that Kindred can attract and retain the best people  enabling us to execute our business strategy and serve our long-term interests  including our sustainability goals. The policy of the Board is to attract  retain and motivate the best management by rewarding them with competitive compensation packages linked to the Group's financial and strategic objectives. The compensation packages are designed to be competitive  but importantly  also fair and reasonable in comparison with companies of a similar size  industry and international scope  and to strike the appropriate balance between risk and reward.The short-term and long-term incentive plans are designed to support key business strategies and financial objectives and contribute to creating strong  sustainable performance for the Group. The performance measures used for short and long-term incentive plans are closely linked to our strategic objectives for sustainable growth. Performance measures as well as any corresponding targets are reviewed annually by the Committee to ensure that they continue to drive the right behaviours in executive managers and create value for our shareholders.Remuneration guidelines by elementThe components of remuneration for the Executive Management comprise base salary  short-term and long-term incentive plans  pension and other benefits. The remuneration guidelines do not apply to share-based incentive plans  which are subject to a separate resolution at the Annual General Meetings.In the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary levels  incentive structures and employment conditions for other employees of the company have also been considered.Base salaryExecutive managers receive base salaries based on position  responsibilities  performance and competencies.Short-term incentivesShort-term incentives for the Group typically take the form of annual bonuses and are paid in cash. Maximum variable cash-based incentives are capped at 150 percent of base salary.Awards for any short-term incentive plans are contingent on financial measures such as for example EBITDA (aggregated across the Group)  as well as customer experience  sustainability measures and business critical objectives. The Remuneration Committee selects the performance measures  targets and relative weightings at the start of each year to ensure strong alignment with business strategy and that targets are sufficiently stretching. The measures and targets are then reviewed and approved by the Board. Achievement of targets is assessed and formal approval for payment of awards is sought following the publication of the relevant period's financial results.Long-term incentivesThe long-term incentive incentives align the interests of executives with those of shareholders by granting performance shares and share options as a reward for delivery of long-term performance objectives  and for creating value for stakeholders. Performance measures  weightings and targets for these selected measures are set at the start of the 3-year performance/vesting period by the Remuneration Committee to ensure they continue to support Kindred's long-term strategy. The measures and targets are then reviewed and approved by the Board. Performance measures may include  but are not limited to  financial and share-price related measures.PensionPension arrangements for the CEO and the other members of the Executive Management  are provided in the form of defined contribution plans  are competitive and appropriate in context of the market practice in the applicable country of executives' employment or residence and total remuneration.Other benefitsOther benefits that may be provided are in accordance with market practice in the applicable country of executives' employment or residence and may change from time to time. Executive Management members may be eligible for beneﬁts such as health insurance  life insurance  travel allowance  relocation support (where applicable)  and to participate in whatever all-employee plans may be offered at any given point.Share Ownership GuidelineThe Board of Directors believes that the Executive Management members will most effectively pursue the long-term interests of our shareholders if they are shareholders themselves. As a result  we introduced share ownership guidelines which require that the CEO and other Executive Management members need to build up and maintain a minimum shareholding of 2 times net base annual salary to comply with this guideline.Employment contract  termination of employment and severance payExecutive contracts typically have an indefinite duration but may be offered on occasion for fixed term. Upon termination of employment  the notice period may not exceed twelve months. Fixed cash salary during the notice period and any severance pay may not  on a combined basis  exceed an amount equivalent to two years' salary.Upon termination of employment a non-compete clause may restrict the employee from engaging in a competing business. The non-compete clause restriction covers no more than twelve months following termination of employment. During the non-compete clause period Kindred may pay the former employee an amount corresponding to no more than 60 per cent of twelve months' salary.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the remuneration guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors decision to propose remuneration guidelines for the CEO and the Executive Management. Proposal for new remuneration guidelines shall be prepared at least every fourth year and submitted to the Annual General Meeting. The remuneration guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor the annual implementation of these guidelines. In order to avoid any conflict of interest  remuneration is managed through well-defined processes ensuring no individual is involved in the decision-making process related to their own remuneration.Malus & ClawbackThe Board of Directors  under exceptional circumstances  may limit or cancel payments of variable remuneration provided that such actions are deemed reasonable (malus). The Board of Directors shall also have the possibility  under applicable law or contractual provisions and subject to the restrictions that may apply under law or contract  to in whole or in part reclaim variable remuneration paid on incorrect grounds (clawback).Deviation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to deviate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if there in an individual case are special circumstances where a deviation is necessary in order to serve the Company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in respect to remuneration-related matters for the CEO and the Executive Management. This includes any resolutions to temporarily deviate from the guidelines.Agenda item 24Stock option plan for executive managementThe Board of Directors has reviewed remuneration for the executive management team and concluded that the Company would benefit from an introduction of a stock option to complement the current performance share plan to further increasing the top management's alignment with long-term shareholder value creation. The Board proposes that the 2022 Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' proposal regarding a stock option plan to the key executives in Kindred Group which will be used in conjunction with the existing performance share plan (PSP). This means that the long- term incentive plan structure from 2022 and onwards will be split between performance shares and stock options  as outlined below.The proposed plan design is a three-year stock option plan where each stock option entitles the participant to purchase one Kindred SDR at a price of 120% of the Kindred SDR price at the grant date. The options will be granted freely in other locations outside of Sweden (employee stock options)  while participants in Sweden will purchase the warrants at market value. The premium for the warrants in Sweden will be fully subsidised through an additional salary payment  and the subsidy is paid upfront and structured as a retention tool by requiring the participants to pay back the subsidy if they leave the company before exercise. All options can be exercised after the maturity date three years after grant. The total value of the allocation of both stock options and PSP shares will be equivalent to the annual fixed salary for each participant  and divided equally between the two instruments (i.e. 50% stock options / 50% PSP shares).The suggested stock option plan may in total comprise no more than 0 5% of all issued shares in Kindred  and on an accumulated basis the three outstanding plans of 2022-2025 will amount to around 1.4% of dilution. The total estimated cost (including IFRS2) of the 2022 stock option plan is 3.9 GBP millions but will be compensated by a saving of 3.5 GBP millions from 50% a lower allocation of PSP shares to senior executives already mandated by earlier AGMs.Agenda item 25Acquisition of Own SharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the acquisition of shares/SDR's shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm or via an offer to acquire the shares/SDRs to all shareholders. The purchases may take place on multiple occasions and will be based on actual market price and terms  prevailing regulations and the capital situation at any given time. Notification of any purchase will be made to Nasdaq Stockholm and details will appear in the Company's annual report and accounts.The objective of the purchase is to achieve added value for the Company's shareholders (including through the implementation of the share buy-back program previously announced)1 and to give the Board increased flexibility with the Company's capital structure.Following the purchase  the intention of the Board would be to either cancel  use as consideration for an acquisition or issue to employees under a Share Option programme (including  if approved  the stock option plan subject of agenda item 24) or Share Performance Scheme.Once purchased under the Maltese Companies Act further shareholder approval will be required before those shares could be cancelled only. Shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to the Company's share buy-back program will be cancelled (refer to Agenda item 25). A separate authorisation for such cancellation is being recommended pursuant to Resolution (s);If used as consideration for an acquisition  the intention would be that the actual Shares/SDRs would be offered to any potential transferor.Agenda item 26Share cancellationThe directors may decide to cancel all or some of shares/SDRs acquired pursuant to the buy-back program.The Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the laws of Malta) stipulates that an extraordinary resolution of the shareholders of the Company is required in order to approve the reduction in the issued share capital of the Company.Such resolution needs to be filed with the Registrar of Companies in Malta  who will publish details of such reduction. Creditors of the Company will then have a period of three months in which they can contest the reduction in capital. Upon the lapse of the three-month period  assuming that no contestations are received  the reduction in share capital can become effective.In order to reflect the changes in the issued share capital  a revised memorandum of association of the Company indicating the reduced number of shares then in issue in the capital of the Company will need to be submitted to the Registrar of Companies.The reduction in issued share capital will take place at such intervals and in such amounts (subject to the maximum amount of GBP 14 375) as the directors shall determine from time to time.Agenda item 27Share issueThe objectives of the authorisation to be granted in terms of this resolution are to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and to enable the Company to use its own financial instruments for payment in kind or through a set-off to a selling partner in connection with any business acquisitions the Company may undertake or to settle any deferred payments in connection with business acquisitions. The market value of the shares/SDRs on each issue date that will be used in determining the price at which shares/SDRs will be issued  should be the same as the market value of the shares/SDRs listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. A cap of 23 million ordinary shares/SDRs in the Company is being requested in connection with this authorisation. The cap will be reduced by the amount of any shares/SDRs bought back pursuant to Resolution (r) (but excluding shares / SDRs not already bought back by the Company on the date of the adoption of the resolution).The Annual Report in English together with other documents regarding the AGM are available on the Company's website www.kindredgroup.com /AGM .For information on how personal data are processed please seehttps://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdfBy order of the BoardKindred Group plcMalta  April 2022NOTE1.

2524,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.bollyinside.com/news/deutsche-boerses-clearstream-charges-by-defunct-maple-bank-over-tax-scandal,Deutsche Boerse’s Clearstream charges by defunct Maple Bank over tax scandal,10 hours ago,Deutsche Boerse AG’s Clearstream unit  the focal settlement agent for exchanging German offers  was sued for around 27 million euros ($29 million) by the administrator of defunct Maple Bank in a claim connected to the Cum-Ex tax scandal. The suit is forthcoming at the Frankfurt Regional Court  a representative for the tribunal affirmed  in light of inquiries from Bloomberg News. The case  which was documented last year  is likewise looking for a declaratory ruling that Clearstream should cover expected additional damages  she said. No consultation has yet been booked. Maple Bank was attacked by prosecutors in 2015 as one of the different probes into an enormous tax scam that sparked outrage in Germany.A spokeswoman for Maple administrator Michael Frege declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Deutsche Boerse confirmed the case but declined to comment further.A year later  the nation’s financial regulator Bafin closed the bank because it couldn’t shoulder the bill levied by tax authorities  which asked for the return of money Maple made with Cum-Ex. The Canadian parent company went into liquidation in 2016.Cum-Ex transactions took advantage of a now-abandoned method of taxing dividends  generating multiple tax refunds through a combination of short sales and share lending. In Germany  the practice ended in 2012 when the nation revised its rules  but the scam may have cost taxpayers more than 10 billion euros. German prosecutors are now probing about 1 500 people.A banker at a Bonn Cum-Ex trial said that Clearstream even had a separate account  “KD111 ” to handle the so-called dividend compensation payments  a key element of Cum-Ex. Cologne prosecutors raided the unit’s offices in 2019.Since Clearstream is the depository for most shares of companies listed in Germany  it centrally settles transactions in these securities. That means virtually all Cum-Ex deals targeting the German treasury ran through its systems.If the Maple suit is successful  other financial players involved in the scam — and hit by hefty tax bills — might copy the idea and turn to Clearstream to pick up the tab.News Summary:,negative,0.02,0.12,0.87,negative,0.01,0.21,0.78,True,English,"['defunct Maple Bank', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Clearstream charges', 'tax scandal', 'The Canadian parent company', 'focal settlement agent', 'Frankfurt Regional Court', 'dividend compensation payments', 'multiple tax refunds', 'hefty tax bills', 'other financial players', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'Bonn Cum-Ex trial', 'Cum-Ex tax scandal', 'enormous tax scam', 'defunct Maple Bank', 'tax authorities', 'financial regulator', 'German offers', '27 million euros', 'Bloomberg News', 'declaratory ruling', 'additional damages', 'different probes', 'Michael Frege', 'short sales', 'share lending', '10 billion euros', 'separate account', 'key element', 'most shares', 'Cum-Ex deals', 'German treasury', 'News Summary', 'German prosecutors', 'Cologne prosecutors', 'Maple administrator', 'Cum-Ex transactions', 'Maple suit', 'Clearstream unit', 'Cum-Ex.', 'claim', 'representative', 'tribunal', 'light', 'inquiries', 'case', 'consultation', 'outrage', 'Germany', 'spokeswoman', 'nation', 'Bafin', 'return', 'money', 'liquidation', 'advantage', 'method', 'dividends', 'practice', 'rules', 'taxpayers', '1,500 people', 'banker', 'offices', 'depository', 'companies', 'securities', 'systems', 'idea', 'tab']",2022-04-08,2022-04-08,bollyinside.com

The assumptions in each of the examples are purely hypothetical and do not relate to the expected performance of the Reference Stock. The hypothetical terms do not purport to be representative of every possible scenario concerning increases or decreases in the price of the Reference Stock on the Valuation Date relative to its price on the Trade Date. We cannot predict the actual performance of the Reference Stock.The table below illustrates the Payment at Maturity of the Notes (excluding the final Coupon)  assuming a hypothetical Initial Stock Price of $100  a Barrier Price of $60  an initial investment of $10 000 and a hypothetical Physical Delivery Amount of 100 (which is $10 000 divided by $100). For this purpose  we have assumed that the Notes are not automatically called  and there will be no anti-dilution adjustments to the Final Stock Price and no market disruption events. Hypothetical Final Stock Prices are shown in the first column on the left. The second column shows the Payment at Maturity (as a percentage of the principal amount). The third column shows the Physical Delivery Amount (if payable) as a number of shares of the Reference Stock. The fourth column shows the Cash Delivery Amount  should we elect to deliver the Cash Delivery Amount instead of the Physical Delivery Amount.Hypothetical Final Stock Price Payment at Maturity as Percentage of Principal Amount Physical Delivery Amount as Number of Shares of the Reference Stock Cash Delivery Amount $150.00 100.00% n/a n/a $125.00 100.00% n/a n/a $100.00 100.00% n/a n/a $90.00 100.00% n/a n/a $80.00 100.00% n/a n/a $70.00 100.00% n/a n/a $60.00 100.00% n/a n/a $59.99 Physical Delivery Amount or Cash Settlement Amount 100 $5 999 $50.00 Physical Delivery Amount or Cash Settlement Amount 100 $5 000 $40.00 Physical Delivery Amount or Cash Settlement Amount 100 $4 000 $30.00 Physical Delivery Amount or Cash Settlement Amount 100 $3 000 $20.00 Physical Delivery Amount or Cash Settlement Amount 100 $2 000 $0 Physical Delivery Amount or Cash Settlement Amount 100 $0The Payments at Maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on hypothetical prices of the Reference Stock that may not be achieved on the Valuation Date  and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The hypothetical Initial Stock Price is not the expected actual Initial Stock Price; the actual Initial Stock Price will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement. The actual market value of your Notes on the Maturity Date or at any other time  including any time you may wish to sell your Notes  may bear little relation to the hypothetical Payments at Maturity shown above  and those amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the Notes or on an investment in the Reference Stock. Please read “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes” and “Hypothetical Returns on Your Notes” in the accompanying product prospectus supplement.Auto-Callable Fixed Coupon Barrier Notes Royal Bank of CanadaHypothetical Examples of Amounts Payable at MaturityThe following hypothetical examples illustrate how the total returns set forth in the table above are calculated. In addition to the hypothetical returns  an investor would have received the periodic Coupon Payments over the term of the Notes.Example 1 : The price of the Reference Stock increases by 25% from the Initial Stock Price to a Final Stock Price of $125.00. Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Barrier Price  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Coupon Payment  a cash payment of $10 000 per Note  despite the 25% appreciation in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 2: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 10% from the Initial Stock Price to a Final Stock Price of $90.00. Because the Final Stock Price is greater than the Barrier Price  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Coupon Payment  a cash payment of $10 000 per Note  despite the 10% decline in the price of the Reference Stock.Example 3: The price of the Reference Stock decreases by 60% from the Initial Stock Price to a Final Stock Price of $40.00. Because the Final Stock Price is less than the Barrier Price  the investor receives at maturity  in addition to the final Coupon Payment  100 shares of the Reference Stock at maturity  or at our option  the Cash Delivery Amount. The value of these shares as of the Valuation Date is calculated as follows:Physical Delivery Amount x Final Stock Price = 100 x $40.00 = $4 000.00As of the Valuation Date  the value of these shares will be $4 000 per $10 000 in principal amount of the Notes  representing a 60% loss of your principal amount. Even with the interest payable over the term of the Notes  you would lose a significant portion of your initial investment.* * *The Payments at Maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on theoretical prices of the Reference Stock that may not be achieved on the Valuation Date and on assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your Notes on the Maturity Date or at any other time  including any time you may wish to sell your Notes  may bear little relation to the hypothetical Payments at Maturity shown above  and those amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the Notes.Auto-Callable Fixed Coupon Barrier Notes Royal Bank of CanadaSELECTED RISK CONSIDERATIONSAn investment in the Notes involves significant risks. Investing in the Notes is not equivalent to investing directly in the Reference Stock. These risks are explained in more detail in the section “Additional Risk Factors Specific to Your Notes” in the product prospectus supplement. In addition to the risks described in the prospectus supplement and the product prospectus supplement  you should consider the following:Risks Relating to the Terms of the Notes• You May Lose Some or All of the Principal Amount at Maturity — Investors in the Notes could lose all or a substantial portion of their principal amount if there is a decline in the closing price of the Reference Stock between the Trade Date and the Valuation Date. If the Notes are not automatically called  and the Final Stock Price is less than the Barrier Price  the value of the shares or the amount of cash that you receive at maturity will represent a loss of your principal that is proportionate to the decline in the closing price of the Reference Stock from the Trade Date to the Valuation Date. If we deliver shares of the Reference Stock to you  they may further decline in value between the Valuation Date and the maturity date. The rate of interest payable on the Notes may not be sufficient to compensate for any such loss.• The Notes Are Subject to an Automatic Call — If on any Call Observation Date  beginning in October 2022  the closing price of the Reference Stock is greater than or equal to the Initial Stock Price  then the Notes will be automatically called. If the Notes are automatically called  then  on the applicable Call Settlement Date  for each $10 000 in principal amount  you will receive $10 000 plus the Coupon otherwise due on the applicable Call Settlement Date. You will not receive any Coupons after that payment. You may be unable to reinvest your proceeds from the automatic call in an investment with a return that is as high as the return on the Notes would have been if they had not been called.• The Call Feature Limits Your Potential Return — The return potential of the Notes is limited to the pre-specified Coupon Rate  regardless of the appreciation of the Reference Stock. If the Notes are called  you will not receive any Coupon Payments after the applicable Coupon Payment Date. Since the Notes could be called as early as October 2022  the total return on the Notes could be limited. As a result  the return on an investment in the Notes could be less than the return on a direct investment in the Reference Stock.• Your Return May Be Lower than the Return on a Conventional Debt Security of Comparable Maturity — The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you purchased one of our conventional senior interest bearing debt securities.• Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Changes in Our Credit Ratings Are Expected to Affect the Market Value of the Notes — The Notes are our senior unsecured debt securities. As a result  the amount due on any relevant payment date is dependent upon our ability to repay our obligations on that date. This will be the case even if the price of the Reference Stock increases after the Trade Date. No assurance can be given as to what our financial condition will be during the term of the Notes.Risks Relating to the Secondary Market for the Notes• There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes-Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses — There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. RBCCM and our other affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. RBCCM or any of our other affiliates may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and asked prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.Auto-Callable Fixed Coupon Barrier Notes Royal Bank of CanadaRisks Relating to the Initial Estimated Value of the Notes• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Will Be Less than the Price to the Public —The initial estimated value that will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement for the Notes does not represent a minimum price at which we  RBCCM or any of our affiliates would be willing to purchase the Notes in any secondary market (if any exists) at any time. If you attempt to sell the Notes prior to maturity  their market value may be lower than the price you paid for them and the initial estimated value. This is due to  among other things  changes in the price of the Reference Stock  the borrowing rate we pay to issue securities of this kind  and the inclusion in the price to the public of the underwriting discount and the estimated costs relating to our hedging of the Notes. These factors  together with various credit  market and economic factors over the term of the Notes  are expected to reduce the price at which you may be able to sell the Notes in any secondary market and will affect the value of the Notes in complex and unpredictable ways. Assuming no change in market conditions or any other relevant factors  the price  if any  at which you may be able to sell your Notes prior to maturity may be less than your original purchase price  as any such sale price would not be expected to include the underwriting discount and the hedging costs relating to the Notes. In addition to bid-ask spreads  the value of the Notes determined by RBCCM for any secondary market price is expected to be based on the secondary rate rather than the internal funding rate used to price the Notes and determine the initial estimated value. As a result  the secondary price will be less than if the internal funding rate was used. The Notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments. Accordingly  you should be able and willing to hold your Notes to maturity.• The Initial Estimated Value of the Notes that We Will Provide in the Final Pricing Supplement Will Be an Estimate Only  Calculated as of the Time the Terms of the Notes Are Set —The initial estimated value of the Notes will be based on the value of our obligation to make the payments on the Notes  together with the mid-market value of the derivative embedded in the terms of the Notes. See “Structuring the Notes” below. Our estimate will be based on a variety of assumptions  including our credit spreads  expectations as to dividends  interest rates and volatility  and the expected term of the Notes. These assumptions are based on certain forecasts about future events  which may prove to be incorrect. Other entities may value the Notes or similar securities at a price that is significantly different than we do.The value of the Notes at any time after the Trade Date will vary based on many factors  including changes in market conditions  and cannot be predicted with accuracy. As a result  the actual value you would receive if you sold the Notes in any secondary market  if any  should be expected to differ materially from the initial estimated value of your Notes.Risks Relating to Conflicts of Interest and Our Trading Activities• Our Business Activities May Create Conflicts of Interest — We and our affiliates expect to engage in trading activities related to the Reference Stock that are not for the account of holders of the Notes or on their behalf. These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders’ interests in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for their customers and in accounts under their management. These trading activities  if they influence the share price of the Reference Stock  could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes. We and one or more of our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with the Reference Stock Issuer  including making loans to or providing advisory services. These services could include investment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These activities may present a conflict between our or one or more of our affiliates’ obligations and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to the Reference Stock. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the price of the Reference Stock  and  therefore  the market value of the Notes .• You Must Rely on Your Own Evaluation of the Merits of an Investment Linked to the Reference Stock — In the ordinary course of their business  our affiliates may have expressed views on expected movements inAuto-Callable Fixed Coupon Barrier Notes Royal Bank of Canadathe Reference Stock  and may do so in the future. These views or reports may be communicated to our clients and clients of our affiliates. However  these views are subject to change from time to time. Moreover  other professionals who transact business in markets relating to the Reference Stock may at any time have significantly different views from those of our affiliates. For these reasons  you are encouraged to derive information concerning the Reference Stock from multiple sources  and you should not rely solely on views expressed by our affiliates.Risks Relating to the Reference Stock• Owning the Notes Is Not the Same as Owning the Reference Stock — The return on your Notes is unlikely to reflect the return you would realize if you actually owned shares of the Reference Stock. For instance  you will not receive or be entitled to receive any dividend payments or other distributions on the Reference Stock during the term of your Notes. As an owner of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or any other rights that holders of the Reference Stock may have. Furthermore  the Reference Stock may appreciate substantially during the term of the Notes  while your potential return will be limited to the Coupon Payments.• There Is No Affiliation Between the Reference Stock Issuer and RBCCM  and RBCCM Is Not Responsible for any Disclosure by the Reference Stock Issuer — We are not affiliated with the Reference Stock Issuer. However  we and our affiliates may currently  or from time to time in the future engage  in business with the Reference Stock Issuer. Nevertheless  neither we nor our affiliates assume any responsibilities for the accuracy or the completeness of any information that any other company prepares. You  as an investor in the Notes  should make your own investigation into the Reference Stock. The Reference Stock Issuer is not involved in this offering and has no obligation of any sort with respect to your Notes. The Reference Stock Issuer has no obligation to take your interests into consideration for any reason  including when taking any corporate actions that might affect the value of your Notes.• The Payments on the Notes Are Subject to Postponement Due to Market Disruption Events and Adjustments —The payment at maturity and the Valuation Date are subject to adjustment as described in the product prospectus supplement. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see “General Terms of the Notes—Consequences of Market Disruption Events” in the product prospectus supplement.Auto-Callable Fixed Coupon Barrier Notes Royal Bank of CanadaINFORMATION REGARDING THE REFERENCE STOCK ISSUERThe Reference Stock is registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”).

The closing price of the Reference Stock on April 6  2022 was $39.74. The red line represents a hypothetical Barrier Price of $23.84  which is equal to 60% of the closing price of the Reference Stock on April 6  2022 (rounded to two decimal places). The actual Barrier Price will be based on the closing price of the Reference Stock on the Trade Date.We obtained the historical information below from Bloomberg Financial Markets  without independent investigation.PAST PERFORMANCE IS NOT INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS .Auto-Callable Fixed Coupon Barrier Notes Royal Bank of CanadaSUPPLEMENTAL DISCUSSION OF U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCESThe following disclosure supplements  and to the extent inconsistent supersedes  the discussion in the product prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021 under “Supplemental Discussion of U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” (including the opinion of our special U.S. tax counsel  Ashurst LLP)  which applies to the Notes.By purchasing a Note  each holder agrees (in the absence of a change in law  an administrative determination or a judicial ruling to the contrary) to treat the Notes as an investment unit consisting of (i) a non-contingent debt instrument issued by us to you (the “Debt Portion”) and (ii) a put option with respect to the Reference Stock written by you and purchased by us (the “Put Option”). With respect to the Coupon Payments you receive  [•]% of each [•]% Coupon Payment will be treated as an interest payment  and [•]% of each [•]% Coupon Payment will be treated as payment for the Put Option for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However  the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in the Notes are uncertain and the IRS could assert that the Notes should be taxed in a manner that is different from that described in the preceding sentence.Under Section 871(m) of the Code  a “dividend equivalent” payment is treated as a dividend from sources within the United States. Such payments generally would be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax if paid to a non-U.S. holder. Under U.S. Treasury Department regulations  payments (including deemed payments) with respect to equity-linked instruments (“ELIs”) that are “specified ELIs” may be treated as dividend equivalents if such specified ELIs reference  directly or indirectly  an interest in an “underlying security ” which is generally any interest in an entity taxable as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes if a payment with respect to such interest could give rise to a U.S. source dividend. However  the IRS has issued guidance that states that the U.S. Treasury Department and the IRS intend to amend the effective dates of the U.S. Treasury Department regulations to provide that withholding on dividend equivalent payments will not apply to specified ELIs that are not delta-one instruments and that are issued before January 1  2023. Based on our determination that the Notes are not delta-one instruments  non-U.S. holders should not be subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments  if any  under the Notes. However  it is possible that the Notes could be treated as deemed reissued for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the occurrence of certain events affecting the Reference Stock or the Notes  and following such occurrence the Notes could be treated as subject to withholding on dividend equivalent payments. Non-U.S. holders that enter  or have entered  into other transactions in respect of the Reference Stock or the Notes should consult their tax advisors as to the application of the dividend equivalent withholding tax in the context of the Notes and their other transactions. If any payments are treated as dividend equivalents subject to withholding  we (or the applicable withholding agent) would be entitled to withhold taxes without being required to pay any additional amounts with respect to amounts so withheld..Auto-Callable Fixed Coupon Barrier Notes Royal Bank of CanadaSUPPLEMENTAL PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment for the Notes on or about April 18  2022  which is the third (3rd) business day following the Trade Date (this settlement cycle being referred to as “T+3”). See “Plan of Distribution” in the prospectus dated September 14  2021. For additional information as to the relationship between us and RBCCM  please see the section “Plan of Distribution—Conflicts of Interest” in the prospectus.We expect to deliver the Notes on a date that is greater than two business days following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Exchange Act  trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two business days  unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers who wish to trade the Notes more than two business days prior to the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.In the initial offering of the Notes  they will be offered to investors at a purchase price equal to par  except with respect to certain accounts as indicated on the cover page of this document.The value of the Notes shown on your account statement may be based on RBCCM’s estimate of the value of the Notes if RBCCM or another of our affiliates were to make a market in the Notes (which it is not obligated to do). That estimate will be based upon the price that RBCCM may pay for the Notes in light of then prevailing market conditions  our creditworthiness and transaction costs. For a period of approximately 6 months after the issue date of the Notes  the value of the Notes that may be shown on your account statement may be higher than RBCCM’s estimated value of the Notes at that time. This is because the estimated value of the Notes will not include the underwriting discount and our hedging costs and profits; however  the value of the Notes shown on your account statement during that period may initially be a higher amount  reflecting the addition of the underwriting discount and our estimated costs and profits from hedging the Notes. This excess is expected to decrease over time until the end of this period. After this period  if RBCCM repurchases your Notes  it expects to do so at prices that reflect their estimated value.We may use this terms supplement in the initial sale of the Notes. In addition  RBCCM or another of our affiliates may use this terms supplement in a market-making transaction in the Notes after their initial sale. Unless we or our agent informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this terms supplement is being used in a market-making transaction.Auto-Callable Fixed Coupon Barrier Notes Royal Bank of CanadaSTRUCTURING THE NOTESThe Notes are our debt securities  the return on which is linked to the performance of the Reference Stock. As is the case for all of our debt securities  including our structured notes  the economic terms of the Notes reflect our actual or perceived creditworthiness at the time of pricing. In addition  because structured notes result in increased operational  funding and liability management costs to us  we typically borrow the funds under these Notes at a rate that is more favorable to us than the rate that we might pay for a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security of comparable maturity. Using this relatively lower implied borrowing rate rather than the secondary market rate  is a factor that is likely to reduce the initial estimated value of the Notes at the time their terms are set. Unlike the estimated value that will be set forth on the cover page of the final pricing supplement  any value of the Notes determined for purposes of a secondary market transaction may be based on a different funding rate  which may result in a lower value for the Notes than if our initial internal funding rate were used.In order to satisfy our payment obligations under the Notes  we may choose to enter into certain hedging arrangements (which may include call options  put options or other derivatives) on the issue date with RBCCM or one of our other subsidiaries. The terms of these hedging arrangements take into account a number of factors  including our creditworthiness  interest rate movements  the volatility of the Reference Stock  and the tenor of the Notes. The economic terms of the Notes and their initial estimated value depend in part on the terms of these hedging arrangements.The lower implied borrowing rate is a factor that reduces the economic terms of the Notes to you. The initial offering price of the Notes also reflects the underwriting discount and our estimated hedging costs. These factors result in the initial estimated value for the Notes on the Trade Date being less than their public offering price.

2531,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.bollyinside.com/news/deutsche-boerses-clearstream-charges-by-defunct-maple-bank-over-tax-scandal,Deutsche Boerse’s Clearstream charges by defunct Maple Bank over tax scandal,10 hours ago,Deutsche Boerse AG’s Clearstream unit  the focal settlement agent for exchanging German offers  was sued for around 27 million euros ($29 million) by the administrator of defunct Maple Bank in a claim connected to the Cum-Ex tax scandal. The suit is forthcoming at the Frankfurt Regional Court  a representative for the tribunal affirmed  in light of inquiries from Bloomberg News. The case  which was documented last year  is likewise looking for a declaratory ruling that Clearstream should cover expected additional damages  she said. No consultation has yet been booked. Maple Bank was attacked by prosecutors in 2015 as one of the different probes into an enormous tax scam that sparked outrage in Germany.A spokeswoman for Maple administrator Michael Frege declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Deutsche Boerse confirmed the case but declined to comment further.A year later  the nation’s financial regulator Bafin closed the bank because it couldn’t shoulder the bill levied by tax authorities  which asked for the return of money Maple made with Cum-Ex. The Canadian parent company went into liquidation in 2016.Cum-Ex transactions took advantage of a now-abandoned method of taxing dividends  generating multiple tax refunds through a combination of short sales and share lending. In Germany  the practice ended in 2012 when the nation revised its rules  but the scam may have cost taxpayers more than 10 billion euros. German prosecutors are now probing about 1 500 people.A banker at a Bonn Cum-Ex trial said that Clearstream even had a separate account  “KD111 ” to handle the so-called dividend compensation payments  a key element of Cum-Ex. Cologne prosecutors raided the unit’s offices in 2019.Since Clearstream is the depository for most shares of companies listed in Germany  it centrally settles transactions in these securities.

Radboud University Medical Center (RUMC) in Nijmegen  one of the largest centres of excellence in the Netherlands for adrenal diseases  treated the first patient with primary aldosteronism with the Ga-68-based diagnostic PENTIXAFOR as part of the CASTUS study.Developed by PentixaPharm  PENTIXAFOR is an innovative imaging PET tracer that targets the chemokine-4 receptor (CXCR4) and is used to diagnose various oncological and inflammatory diseases. The Ga-68-based PET radiodiagnostic is expected to have the potential to significantly improve the diagnosis of these disorders and to direct patients to the appropriate therapy.Primary aldosteronism (PA)  also known as Conn's disease  is an abnormality of the adrenal gland characterised by either a unilateral aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia (BAH). Regardless of the location of the pathological tissue  adrenal tumours cause hypersecretion of aldosterone  which leads to hypertension and is therefore closely associated with high vascular morbidity. The prevalence of PA in patients with hypertension  about 20 million patients in Germany  is about 5.9 %. The number of unreported cases is even higher due to the complicated and invasive standard diagnosis by adrenal vein sampling (AVS).The CASTUS study is a clinical research programme aiming to evaluate the accuracy of PENTIXAFOR in the diagnosis of primary aldosteronism. The Ga-68-based PET radiodiagnostic will be used to detect the unilateral or bilateral nature of aldosterone hypersecretion in primary aldosteronism. This distinguishing feature determines patient management and medical therapy. Compared to the previous diagnostic procedure  in which hormone levels are measured on the adrenal gland using a complex invasive catheterisation procedure  PENTIXAFOR is a non-invasive diagnostic method. In order to investigate the potential of PENTIXAFOR  the RUMC is recruiting up to 300 patients.RUMC has started imaging the first patient with PENTIXAFOR with great success. High-resolution images show the potential of the non-invasive PET radiodiagnostic PENTIXAFOR. One of the investigators of the CASTUS study  Professor J. F. Langenhuijsen explained: 'The high sensitivity of PENTIXAFOR allows us to determine the location of the adrenal tumour much more accurately and may replace the previous  invasive gold standard AVS for diagnosis in the future. Further studies are needed to determine the promising prognostic value of PENTIXAFOR at baseline or during treatment evaluation.''The fact that one of the leading centres in the Netherlands  such as RUMC  has decided to work on PENTIXAFOR itself shows the great interest in finding a new diagnostic for adrenal disease and could pave the way for additional therapeutic alternatives. The CASTUS trial provides PentixaPharm with the opportunity to enter another therapeutic area in addition to its core development strategy in oncology ' commented Dr Hakim Bouterfa  founder and managing director of PentixaPharm GmbH. 'We are pleased to have Professor J. F. Langenhuijsen  Professor J. Deinum and Professor M. Gotthardt as principal investigators for this study.'Eckert & Ziegler (ISIN DE0005659700  TecDAX)  the owner of the rights to the underlying [68Ga]Ga-PentixaFor PET compound  is supporting the RUMC team by providing PENTIXAFOR. In return  Eckert & Ziegler receives access to the study results. PENTIXAFOR is being developed by Eckert & Ziegler subsidiary PentixaPharm GmbH as a highly sensitive diagnostic for a portfolio of haemato-oncological malignancies  including myeloma and lymphoma.In 2021  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gave Eckert & Ziegler the green light to jump directly into a phase III clinical trial for PENTIXAFOR  allowing the company to save a number of time-consuming evaluation steps. Since end of December  the Phase III study design has been submitted for review in Amsterdam. However  the EMA recently had to postpone the start of the review  which was scheduled for March 7  2022  by two months because an 'exceptionally high number of applications' faced a pool of reviewers decimated by Corona and its processing capacities were insufficient. The phase III clinical trial is expected to start approximately 5 months after the start of the review and will include about 500 patients in a PAN cancer trial with European participation.The CASTUS study is sponsored by ZonMW  the Dutch national organisation for health research and innovation in healthcare.About Eckert & Ziegler.Eckert & Ziegler Strahlen- und Medizintechnik AG with more than 900 employees is one of the world's largest providers of isotope-related components for nuclear medicine and radiation therapy.

Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases – including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure – with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed €3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR® is estimated to be over €5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.The alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload (congestion) through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.Story continuesIn the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints  rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life as well as a mean survival probability of 70% at 12 months post-implantation (compared to 50% survival rate for refractory ascites patients in the published literature). All patients have been implanted with the alfapump and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines. Over 900 alfapump systems have been implanted to date.Sequana Medical has combined its proven alfapump and proprietary DSR therapy  and is developing the alfapump DSR  a breakthrough approach to fluid overload due to heart failure. Top-line results of the RED DESERT study and interim results of the SAHARA DESERT study indicate that repeated DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients is able to safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate persistent congestion and restore euvolemia  improve cardio-renal status and restore diuretic response for months post-treatment. Reporting of top-line data for SAHARA DESERT is planned for H2 2022.Sequana Medical is headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

TG4050 is currently being evaluated in two ongoing multicenter Phase I trials in patients with ovarian cancer and head and neck cancer. In a poster presentation  Transgene will discuss how these new data further demonstrate the ability of this neoantigen cancer vaccine to induce strong immune responses  targeting patient-specific mutations  that are expected to translate into clinical benefit for patients.These results will be presented during a late-breaking poster session at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) meeting on April 12  2022  in New Orleans  Louisiana  USA.New immune cell response data confirm the ability of this individualized vaccine to effectively prime the immune systemTransgene is presenting a comprehensive set of immunological data. Circulating immune cells quantification (in particular monocytes  DC  NK cells  subcells of CD8  CD4  Treg) and expression of immune checkpoints (ICOS and PD1) suggest that the vaccine is able to effectively induce innate and adaptive immune responses in patients.All evaluable patients developed a robust T-cell responses against multiple targeted neoantigens (median of 10 positive responses per patient). T-cell responses were observed for class I and class II epitopes  they consisted of de novo responses and amplifications of preexisting responses.New clinical data obtained from patients treated with TG4050 provide a positive update on the two ongoing trialsIn the head and neck trial  patients have been randomized to immediatly receive vaccination with TG4050 (early treatment arm  arm A) or at relapse (delayed vaccination arm  arm B). All patients randomized to arm A (n=7) are stable as of mid-March 2022. In arm B (n=6)  two patients have recently experienced relapse.In the ovarian trial (n=4)  one patient treated after an elevation of CA-125 experienced a normalization of CA-125 without clinical progression for 9 months until death from an unrelated chronic illness. Another patient was treated upon onset of radiological evidence of relapse and was stable for 11.4 months.To date  the vaccine has been well tolerated and no related Serious Adverse Events have been reported across the two studies.In both clinical studies  enrollment and patient dosing are progressing in line with our expectations. Overall  Transgene plans to treat 13 patients in the ovarian cancer trial and 30 patients in the head and neck trial.Poster title: Phase I trials of personalized cancer vaccine TG4050 in surgically treated high-risk head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and relapsing ovarian cancer (OvC) patientsSession title : Phase I Clinical Trials 2: Phase I Clinical Trials 2 Poster and abstract number : CT182: CT182 Date  time  location : Tuesday  April 12  2022  9:00 AM - 12:30 PM CDT  Board 7  Section 33: Tuesday  April 12  2022  9:00 AM - 12:30 PM CDT  Board 7  Section 33 Authors : M.

A personalized treatment is created for each patient after they complete surgery and while they receive an adjuvant therapy. Half of the participants receive their vaccine immediately after they complete their adjuvant treatment. The other half is given TG4050 as an additional treatment at the time of recurrence of the disease. This randomized study is evaluating the treatment benefits of TG4050 in patients who have a high risk of relapse. Up to 30 patients will receive TG4050 in France  in the UK and in the USA. The principal investigator of the trial is Prof. Christian Ottensmeier  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncologist at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre and Professor of Immuno-Oncology at the University of Liverpool. In France  the clinical trial is being conducted at Institut Curie  Paris by Prof. Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  Head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i)  and at the IUCT-Oncopole  Toulouse by Prof. Jean-Pierre Delord. In the USA  the trial is being led by Dr. Yujie Zhao  MD  PhD  at the Mayo Clinic. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.In parallel  a Phase I clinical trial of TG4050 is enrolling patients with ovarian cancer. This second trial is including patients at the time of asymptomatic relapse after surgery and first-line chemotherapy. Dr. Matthew Block  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncology  Consultant Immunology and Associate Professor of Oncology at the Mayo Clinic (USA) is the principal investigator of the trial; in France  the trial is being conducted by Prof. Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  at Institut Curie and by Dr. Alexandra Martinez  MD  Associate Head of Surgical Department  at IUCT-Oncopole. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.First positive preliminary clinical data generated in the first patients treated with TG4050 were announced in November 2021.

Profit from recurring operations was €75.2m  down 33.8%  representing a current operating margin of 8.2%  comparable to pre-crisis results. This level of profitability continues to position AKWEL as one of the best-performing European auto parts manufacturers.AKWEL generated a free cash flow of €57.1m in 2021  leading to a positive net cash position of €98.2m. The distribution of a dividend maintained at €0.45 per share will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.Production uncertainties remain high on commodities and components and an inflationary global environment reinforced by the geopolitical situation. AKWEL  which has no direct exposure to the Ukraine-Russia region  anticipates a moderate increase in its business  with profitability likely to continue to be penalised by the lack of visibility  rising purchasing prices  and the difficulty of quickly passing on major increases in energy and transport costs.

2557,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.marketsmedia.com/euronext-focuses-on-borsa-italiana-integration/,Euronext Focuses on Borsa Italiana Integration,5 hours ago,Daily Email Feature Euronext Focuses on Borsa Italiana IntegrationStéphane Boujnah  chief executive and chairman of Euronext  said large clients are co-locating ahead of the migration of its core data centre from the UK to Italy and the exchange and infrastructure group has bold ambitions for its index business.On 29 April 2021 Euronext announced the closure of the acquisition of Borsa Italiana from the London Stock Exchange Group for a final consideration of €4.4bn  and added new capabilities in fixed income trading  clearing and the consolidation of a central securities depository.Boujnah told Markets Media: “The integration of Borsa Italiana is proceeding very well and we have three major group ongoing projects. The first is the migration of the core data centre to Bergamo in Italy  which is the physical centre of the exchange where trading and the matching of orders happens.”The second project is the migration of the Italian cash and derivatives markets from the London Stock Exchange Group technology to Euronext’s proprietary Optiq trading platform during the first semester of 2023. The third migration is the transition of clearing operations from LCH SA in France to Euronext Clearing at the end of 2023 or the beginning of 2024.He continued that Euronext was founded to be the backbone of the Capital Markets Union  to connect local economies in Europe with global markets and to finance the real economy. The group’s vision is to deploy a single liquidity pool  enabled by a single book and powered by a single technology platform  Optiq.“This is a scalable model implemented within our framework of federal governance and our European college of supervisors ” Boujnah added. “We welcomed the Irish stock exchange in 2018  Oslo Bors in 2019  Nord Pool and VP Securities in 2020. We are now integrating Borsa Italiana which has changed the size of the group.”The migration of the data centre was driven by Brexit  by Euronext wanting to be close to a market where it has large operations  and also by environmental  social and governance (ESG) drivers as the new data centre is mainly powered by hydroelectric plants and photovoltaic panels.“Large clients are co-locating and in the process of migrating their servers ahead of the migration date  6 June 2022 ” said Boujnah. “This will take place just 14 months after closing the acquisition of Borsa Italiana  and this will be an important step for cost and revenue synergies.”He added that after the migrations  operations for the full value chain will be in Euronext’s hands which is a fundamental facilitator for developing new products.Euronext has been the only market infrastructure that did not directly manage its clearing activities for its listed derivatives markets. Since 2003 Euronext has used LCH SA  the Paris-based clearing house owned by LSEG  to clear most of its cash and derivatives trading flows and had a revenue sharing agreement.As part of its new three-year strategic plan  Growth for Impact 2024  Euronext announced in November 2021 that it will grow Borsa Italiana’s CC&G into Euronext Clearing  which will be positioned as a European clearing house.LCH SA’s agreement with Euronext to clear financial and commodity derivatives ran until 2027 but Euronext had limited early termination rights  one of which is exercisable with an earliest effective date of January 2024.ESGBoujnah said the group’s ESG strategy is notably related to financing the real economy as it has almost 1 500 listings of small and medium-sized enterprises. He added: “We are soon going to release a programme called Fit for 1.5 degree with targets for a massive reduction of carbon footprint by 2030.”The Fit for 1.5 degree ESG strategy will include detailed science-based targets for carbon footprint reduction.In addition  Boujnah sees opportunities for the index business to help accelerate the transition to a sustainable economy. “We have very wide and bold ambitions for our index business  because asset managers want more ESG indices ” he said.The AEX ESG Index is due to launch on Euronext Amsterdam in the second quarter of this year. The new index will identify the 25 companies that demonstrate the best ESG practices from the 50 constituents of the AEX and AMX indices and combine measurement of economic performance with ESG impacts in line with the UN Global Compact principles.As part of the strategy to offer ESG versions national flagship indices  Euronext also launched the CAC 40 ESG in France in March 2021 and the MIB ESG in Italy in October 2021.“We have very successful activities in ESG bonds ” added Boujnah. “Euronext Dublin is the leading platform and will position their offering for international issuers.”Euronext also has its own self-imposed targets of reducing emissions  such as encouraging employees to take the train instead of systematically taking the plane and powering the new data centre with renewable energy.Digital assetsThe group also believes in staying very close to the digital asset market  but does not have any ambition to enter the direct retail segment or to launch a crypto trading platform.“We spend a lot of time and resources finding a way to make sure that digital assets are leveraged in the best way to become relevant ” added Boujnah.He continued that regulation of digital assets is improving but that  in general  when it comes to accountability and systemic risks  European regulators prefer a centralized system they know rather than a distributed system they do not know.Financial resultsEuronext reported record quarterly revenue of €370.1m in the last three months of 2021 with Borsa Italiana contributing €127m. Non-volume related revenue accounted for the majority  55%  of total revenue and income  slightly up compared to last year  while at the same time the trading business has been growing.[Q4 and full year 2021 results] Euronext delivered a record performance during Q4 of 2021  marking a dynamic year for the group with more than 40% of growth in revenue  EBITDA and almost 20% increase of adjusted EPS in 2021. Read the press release: https://t.co/zOqm7DIXg3 pic.twitter.com/fXARd6CANF — Euronext (@euronext) February 10  2022For the full-year 2021  Euronext reported 46.9% revenue growth to approximately €1.3bn. The exchange delivered €10.1m of run-rate synergies at the end of 2021  eight months after the completion of the Borsa Italiana acquisition  and is committed to deliver €100m of run-rate synergies by 2024.Boujnah said in the results call: “This is the combination of strong organic growth and combination of the Borsa Italiana Group. 2021 has been a strong year and 2022 is a year of transformational projects for Euronext.”,neutral,0.04,0.92,0.04,mixed,0.52,0.31,0.17,True,English,"['Borsa Italiana Integration', 'Euronext', 'three major group ongoing projects', 'ESG versions national flagship indices', 'London Stock Exchange Group technology', 'UN Global Compact principles', 'new three-year strategic plan', 'proprietary Optiq trading platform', 'The AEX ESG Index', 'Irish stock exchange', 'single technology platform', 'Daily Email Feature', 'full value chain', 'early termination rights', 'direct retail s', 'central securities depository', 'earliest effective date', 'best ESG practices', 'core data centre', 'Capital Markets Union', 'single liquidity pool', 'Paris-based clearing house', 'new data centre', 'detailed science-based targets', 'European clearing house', 'derivatives trading flows', 'revenue sharing agreement', 'carbon footprint reduction', 'Stéphane Boujnah', 'digital asset market', '1.5 degree ESG strategy', 'Borsa Italiana Integration', 'ESG indices', 'global markets', 'new index', 'The Fit', 'AMX indices', 'leading platform', 'new capabilities', 'physical centre', 'single book', 'new products', 'infrastructure group', 'European college', 'Nord Pool', 'VP Securities', 'revenue synergies', 'massive reduction', 'asset managers', 'ESG impacts', 'CAC 40 ESG', 'MIB ESG', 'ESG bonds', 'Digital assets', 'derivatives markets', 'index business', 'commodity derivatives', 'Markets Media', 'clearing activities', 'chief executive', 'large clients', 'bold ambitions', 'final consideration', 'fixed income', 'second project', 'first semester', 'LCH SA', 'local economies', 'real economy', 'scalable model', 'Oslo Bors', 'hydroelectric plants', 'photovoltaic panels', 'important step', 'fundamental facilitator', 'market infrastructure', 'CC&G', 'medium-sized enterprises', 'sustainable economy', 'second quarter', 'economic performance', 'successful activities', 'international issuers', 'renewable energy', 'ESG Boujnah', 'migration date', 'clearing operations', 'large operations', 'Italian cash', 'federal governance', 'Euronext Clearing', 'third migration', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Euronext Dublin', 'chairman', 'UK', 'Italy', '29 April 2021', 'closure', 'acquisition', 'consolidation', 'Bergamo', 'matching', 'orders', 'transition', 'France', 'end', 'beginning', 'backbone', 'vision', 'framework', 'supervisors', 'Brexit', 'social', 'drivers', 'process', 'servers', 'place', 'cost', 'migrations', 'hands', 'LSEG', 'part', 'Growth', 'November', 'financial', 'January', '1,500 listings', 'small', 'programme', 'addition', 'opportunities', 'wide', '25 companies', '50 constituents', 'measurement', 'line', 'March', 'October', 'offering', 'emissions', 'employees', 'train', 'plane']",2022-04-08,2022-04-08,marketsmedia.com

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces new data from the pivotal Phase II/III trial ...","LEIDEN  Netherlands  April 1  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Pharming Group N.V. (""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces new data from the pivotal Phase II/III trial of leniolisib for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3KÎ´) syndrome (APDS)  a primary immunodeficiency. Principal Investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  shared the findings in a presentation at the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) 2022 Annual Meeting.As announced on February 2  2022  the multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized  Phase III portion of the clinical trial  conducted by Novartis  met its co-primary endpoints  which evaluated reduction in lymph node size and correction of immunodeficiency. The shrinking of lymphadenopathy lesions and increased proportion of naÃ¯ve B cells are important in this population  as they indicate a reduction in APDS disease markers. Presented for the first time at CIS  the co-primary endpoints at day 85 after baseline demonstrated:In the index lymphadenopathy lesions  a statistically significant adjusted mean change in the log10 transformed sum of product of diameters (SPD) of -0.30 among patients who received leniolisib compared with -0.06 among patients who received placebo (95% CI: -0.37  -0.11; p=0.0012).From a baseline level of Ë48%  an increase of 34.76% in the proportion of naÃ¯ve B cells in patients who received leniolisib versus a -5.37% decrease in patients who received placebo (95% CI: 28.51  51.75; pË0.0001).The study drug was well-tolerated. There were no adverse events that led to discontinuation of study treatment  there were no deaths  and the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was lower in the leniolisib group than in the placebo group. None of the SAEs were suspected to be related to study treatment.Charlotte Cunningham-Rundles  M.D.  Ph.D.  David S. Gottesman Professor of Immunology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York  said:""It is great news that leniolisib has achieved such positive results in this Phase III study in APDS. It is extremely encouraging to see that this medication is capable of targeting the cause of this difficult disease  both improving care and reducing patients' symptoms. Progress toward a treatment that is tailor-made for our patients with APDS is a milestone we have long awaited.""Pharming plans to begin submitting global regulatory filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.Anurag Relan  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:""Pharming is delighted that leniolisib achieved significance in both co-primary endpoints and was well tolerated in these APDS patients  as the product's approval would address an unmet need for those with this rare disease  who currently rely on supportive therapies such as antibiotics and immunoglobulin replacement therapy. In addition to working closely with regulatory authorities across the globe to make leniolisib available to immunologists  hematologists  and their patients  we will continue to develop this treatment through our open-label extension study and two additional studies that will enroll children under the age of 12  as well as potentially extending the geographic reach of the product.""About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase Î´ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3KÎ´ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3KÎ´ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT (via PDK1) and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3KÎ± and PI3KÎ²  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Káº and PI3KÎ³ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Káº in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Káº is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both the Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and the Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V. is a global  commercial stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative protein replacement therapies and precision medicines for the treatment of rare diseases and unmet medical needs.The flagship of our portfolio is our recombinant human C1 esterase inhibitor (rhC1INH) franchise. C1INH is a naturally occurring protein that down regulates the complement and contact cascades in order to control inflammation in affected tissues.Our lead product  RUCONEST ®  is the first and only plasma-free rhC1INH protein replacement therapy. It is approved for the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks. We are commercializing RUCONEST ® in the United States  the European Union and the United Kingdom through our own sales and marketing organization  and the rest of the world through our distribution network.In addition  we are investigating the clinical efficacy of rhC1INH in the treatment of further indications  including pre-eclampsia  acute kidney injury and severe pneumonia as a result of COVID-19 infections.We are also studying our oral precision medicine  leniolisib (a phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta  or PI3K delta  inhibitor)  for the treatment of activated PI3K delta syndrome  or APDS. World-wide rights for leniolisib were licensed from Novartis AG in 2019. Leniolisib met both of its primary end points in a registration enabling Phase 2/3 study in the United States and Europe. We are targeting global regulatory filings for leniolisib from Q2 2022 onwards.Additionally  we entered into a strategic collaboration with Orchard Therapeutics to research  develop  manufacture and commercialize OTL-105  a newly disclosed investigational ex-vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy for the treatment of HAE.Furthermore  we are leveraging our transgenic manufacturing technology to develop next-generation protein replacement therapies  most notably for Pompe disease  which is currently in preclinical development.Forward-looking StatementsThis press release contains forward-looking statements  including with respect to timing and progress of Pharming's preclinical studies and clinical trials of its product candidates  Pharming's clinical and commercial prospects  Pharming's ability to overcome the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic to the conduct of its business  and Pharming's expectations regarding its projected working capital requirements and cash resources.

Smart technology reminds the patient to take their medication and notifies them when their sharps bin is nearing capacity. The full sharps bin is then collected from the patient's home  undergoes a validated washing regime and can then be returned to the patient for re-use  ensuring an environmentally friendly service for patients ” the stock market statement from HealthBeacon said.“We need to take better care of our planet ” said Varadkar.“This generation should aim to pass it on to the next in a better condition than we inherited it. A big part of this involves using fewer of the earth's resources and recycling  repairing and reusing materials more often. It's called the circular economy. Medical waste I know can be a particular challenge given the need to make sure quality and safe standards are high and consistent and sterile to prevent infection but there are solutions. I'm really happy to officially open this Green Labs facility from HealthBeacon ” he added.Jim Joyce  the co-founder and chief executive officer of HealthBeacon  said it was regrettable that billions of injectable waste devices and hundreds of millions of sharps bins end up in household trash  landfills or incineration facilities.“Today  in partnership with Novartis in Ireland we are taking a major step in reversing those unsustainable practices by launching our new EPA licensed Green Labs facility.

Circulating immune cells quantification (in particular monocytes  DC  NK cells  subcells of CD8  CD4  Treg) and expression of immune checkpoints (ICOS and PD1) suggest that the vaccine is able to effectively induce innate and adaptive immune responses in patients.All evaluable patients developed a robust T-cell responses against multiple targeted neoantigens (median of 10 positive responses per patient). T-cell responses were observed for class I and class II epitopes  they consisted of de novo responses and amplifications of preexisting responses.New clinical data obtained from patients treated with TG4050 provide a positive update on the two ongoing trialsIn the head and neck trial  patients have been randomized to immediatly receive vaccination with TG4050 (early treatment arm  arm A) or at relapse (delayed vaccination arm  arm B). All patients randomized to arm A (n=7) are stable as of mid-March 2022. In arm B (n=6)  two patients have recently experienced relapse.In the ovarian trial (n=4)  one patient treated after an elevation of CA-125 experienced a normalization of CA-125 without clinical progression for 9 months until death from an unrelated chronic illness. Another patient was treated upon onset of radiological evidence of relapse and was stable for 11.4 months.To date  the vaccine has been well tolerated and no related Serious Adverse Events have been reported across the two studies.In both clinical studies  enrollment and patient dosing are progressing in line with our expectations. Overall  Transgene plans to treat 13 patients in the ovarian cancer trial and 30 patients in the head and neck trial.Poster title: Phase I trials of personalized cancer vaccine TG4050 in surgically treated high-risk head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) and relapsing ovarian cancer (OvC) patientsSession title : Phase I Clinical Trials 2: Phase I Clinical Trials 2 Poster and abstract number : CT182: CT182 Date  time  location : Tuesday  April 12  2022  9:00 AM - 12:30 PM CDT  Board 7  Section 33: Tuesday  April 12  2022  9:00 AM - 12:30 PM CDT  Board 7  Section 33 Authors : M.

A personalized treatment is created for each patient after they complete surgery and while they receive an adjuvant therapy. Half of the participants receive their vaccine immediately after they complete their adjuvant treatment. The other half is given TG4050 as an additional treatment at the time of recurrence of the disease. This randomized study is evaluating the treatment benefits of TG4050 in patients who have a high risk of relapse. Up to 30 patients will receive TG4050 in France  in the UK and in the USA. The principal investigator of the trial is Prof. Christian Ottensmeier  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncologist at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre and Professor of Immuno-Oncology at the University of Liverpool. In France  the clinical trial is being conducted at Institut Curie  Paris by Prof. Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  Head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i)  and at the IUCT-Oncopole  Toulouse by Prof. Jean-Pierre Delord. In the USA  the trial is being led by Dr. Yujie Zhao  MD  PhD  at the Mayo Clinic. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.In parallel  a Phase I clinical trial of TG4050 is enrolling patients with ovarian cancer. This second trial is including patients at the time of asymptomatic relapse after surgery and first-line chemotherapy. Dr. Matthew Block  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncology  Consultant Immunology and Associate Professor of Oncology at the Mayo Clinic (USA) is the principal investigator of the trial; in France  the trial is being conducted by Prof. Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  at Institut Curie and by Dr. Alexandra Martinez  MD  Associate Head of Surgical Department  at IUCT-Oncopole. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility and biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine.First positive preliminary clinical data generated in the first patients treated with TG4050 were announced in November 2021.

2568,EuroNext,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/akropolis-group-increased-revenue-ebitda-165000750.html,Akropolis Group increased its revenue  EBITDA and portfolio value last year,Akropolis Group  leader in the development and management of shopping and entertainment centres in the Baltic States  based on its audited consolidated financial results  has received revenue of EUR 81 million and earned profit of EUR 57.,AKROPOLIS GROUP UABAkropolis Group  leader in the development and management of shopping and entertainment centres in the Baltic States  based on its audited consolidated financial results  has received revenue of EUR 81 million and earned profit of EUR 57.2 million EBITDA (Earnings before tax  interest  depreciation and amortisation) last year  which is  respectively  5% and 6% more than in 2020.The group announced its last year’s audited results and revealed that it saw a positive change in all key financial indicators in 2021. After the acquisition of the shopping centre Alfa in Riga last November  the fair value of Akropolis Group portfolio grew by 28% to EUR 1.023 billion in 2021. This year  shopping centre Alfa was fully integrated into the structure of Akropolis Group  changing its name into Akropole Alfa.“For the most part of the first half of the last year  very strict pandemic restrictions were applied for shopping centres – only stores selling basic necessities and points of services were operating in all Akropolis  which resulted in lower visitor footfall. The second half of the year was far better – as the restrictions were being eased-up  we achieved a clear recovery of visitor footfall and tenants’ turnovers. In some months of the second half  even record turnovers of tenants were reached ” says Manfredas Dargužis  CEO of Akropolis Group.The last year turnover of Akropolis tenants (including the results of the shopping centre Akropole Alfa from December 2021) grew by 7% to EUR 667 million  however  due to imposed pandemic control measures  the visitor footfall was still smaller than a year ago – the shopping centres had over 27 million visitors  which is 9% less than in 2020.The consolidated rent income of Akropolis Group increased by 3% to EUR 57.3 million. The occupancy rate at Akropolis centres managed from the beginning of the year remained very high at 99% last year.According to M. Dargužis  Akropolis centres passed the coronavirus pandemic test by successfully adapting to the restrictions that were imposed  regularly updating the choice of shops operating in the shopping centres and by creating safe conditions for visiting of the shopping centres.Story continues“Even under the most restrictive conditions we remained optimistic and continued to pursue our main goal of maintaining the market leadership of the group. Our results and business resilience have been positively evaluated by the financial markets: last June Akropolis Group successfully placed its debut EUR 300 million 5-year eurobond issue  which is quoted on Nasdaq Vilnius and Euronext Dublin stock exchanges ” the CEO of Akropolis Group says.Last year  international credit rating agencies Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings have assigned Akropolis Group long-term issuer ratings for the first time – BB+ with a long-term stable outlook and BB+ with a long-term negative outlook (changed into stable outlook in October 2021)  respectively.The group  which manages shopping and entertainment centres and real estate  resumed the development of the multifunctional complex Akropolis Vingis in Vilnius last year. The Vilnius Regional Council of Architects gave a positive assessment of the pre-design proposal of the updated architectural concept.With focus on ESG topic within the company group  last August Akropolis in Vilnius  Klaipėda and Šiauliai were certified according to the international BREEAM in-use standard.Akropolis Group will not pay dividends to the shareholder this year.Full financial reports of Akropolis Group for 2021 can be found on the website of the company.For more information:Dominykas MertinasHead of Marketing and Communication DepartmentAKROPOLIS GROUP  UAB+370 64027001dominykas.mertinas@akropolis.ltAttachment,neutral,0.09,0.85,0.05,mixed,0.42,0.2,0.38,True,English,"['Akropolis Group', 'portfolio value', 'revenue', 'EBITDA', 'debut EUR 300 million 5-year eurobond issue', 'Akropolis Group long-term issuer ratings', 'Euronext Dublin stock exchanges', 'S&P Global Ratings', 'international credit rating agencies', 'multifunctional complex Akropolis Vingis', 'The Vilnius Regional Council', 'long-term negative outlook', 'Manfredas Dargužis', 'pandemic control measures', 'consolidated rent income', 'M.
