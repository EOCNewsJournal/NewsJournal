More infoBrussels vowed to reduce the EU's ""excessive dependence"" on the City and its ‚Ç¨660 trillion (¬£563trillion) clearing market but the European Banking Federation (EBF) has now said the European Commission's proposal would cause ""serious market disruption"".Clearing houses act as middlemen in derivatives trades between banks. Since the 2008 financial crisis  they are a vital part of the financial system. The City is Europe's largest centre for clearing activity  with London Stock Exchange's LCH unit in London clearing about 90 percent of euro interest rate derivatives. Brexit made clearing a strong battleground. In line with Brussels' desire for control over euro-denominated trades to build ""strategic autonomy"" in capital markets  after the UK's departure it insisted EU banks would be shut out of London  with an initial deadline of January 2020. This was however repeatedly pushed back over concerns about financial stability and reduced access to products such as mortgages. Brexit LIVE: ‚ÄòSome isolation  some clown!‚Äô Brexit-bashers savaged as UK takes centre stageMcGuinness  executive EU Commission financial services chief  wants less EU 'dependence' on UKIn January  Mairead McGuinness  financial services chief at the executive European Commission  was forced to allow EU-based banks and money managers to clear trades in London until June 2025 after failing to persuade banks and their customers to shift the activity from the UK capital to Deutsche Boerse's Eurex in Frankfurt fast enough. An abrupt end to cross-border clearing would have disrupted markets  but EU officials believe three years will be long enough to allow the build-up of European capacity to replace the trade. After Ms McGuinness launched a consultation for measures to lower the EU's reliance ""on systemic third-country clearinghouses and to improve the attractiveness of EU-based clearing houses""  the EBF advised against the ""forced relocation"" plans.City of London: Europe's largest centre for clearing activityThe trade body said: ""EBF would like to highlight that any forced relocation strategy or other coercive measures will not achieve  and would likely undermine  the objective of a competitive and resilient EU clearing [market]."" The federation concluded: ""We ask the European Commission to only consider measures that make clearing in the EU more attractive  without disproportionally undermining other market participants that are key to the fair and efficient provision of clearing services."" In a speech at the European Central Bank in Frankfurt on Wednesday  Ms McGuinness  an Irish conservative  compared the EU's dependence on the City of London with its reliance on Russian oil and gas.Trending",negative,0.02,0.12,0.86,mixed,0.09,0.14,0.77,True,English,"['¬£560trillion London market', 'EU plot', 'hammerblow', 'Europe', 'banks', 'attack', 'executive EU Commission financial services chief', 'euro interest rate derivatives', 'executive European Commission', 'top politics stories', 'systemic third-country clearinghouses', 'serious market disruption', 'other market participants', 'forced relocation"" plans', 'European Central Bank', 'other coercive measures', 'centre stage McGuinness', 'European Banking Federation', 'London Stock Exchange', ""less EU 'dependence"", 'EU-based clearing houses', 'clearing services', '2008 financial crisis', 'financial system', 'financial stability', 'derivatives trades', 'European capacity', 'relocation strategy', 'clearing market', 'largest centre', 'Mairead McGuinness', 'Ms McGuinness', 'Jacob Rees-Mogg', 'Invalid email', '3rd parties', 'More info', 'excessive dependence', 'vital part', 'LCH unit', 'strong battleground', 'strategic autonomy', 'initial deadline', 'EU-based banks', 'money managers', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'abrupt end', 'EU officials', 'three years', 'efficient provision', 'Irish conservative', 'Russian oil', 'cross-border clearing', 'euro-denominated trades', 'capital markets', 'EU banks', 'trade body', 'Brexit LIVE', 'The City', 'UK capital', 'sign-up', 'content', 'ways', 'understanding', 'adverts', 'time', 'Brussels', '‚Ç¨660 trillion', 'EBF', 'proposal', 'middlemen', 'activity', '90 percent', 'desire', 'control', 'departure', 'January', 'concerns', 'access', 'products', 'mortgages', 'isolation', 'clown', 'Brexit-bashers', 'June', 'customers', 'Eurex', 'Frankfurt', 'build-up', 'consultation', 'reliance', 'attractiveness', 'objective', 'competitive', 'fair', 'speech', 'Wednesday', 'gas', 'Trending']",2022-04-10,2022-04-10,express.co.uk

2616,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.etfstrategy.com/21shares-launches-worlds-first-sandbox-crypto-etp-10339/,21Shares launches world's first 'Sandbox' crypto ETP,1 day ago,ETF STRATEGY NEWS! ETF Strategy is delighted to announce the launch of ETF Strategy Hub (hub.etfstrategy.com)  an on-demand repository of webcasts  videos  podcasts and white papers. Debuting with Special Series on Technology & Innovation in China and the Digital Economy.Digital asset ETP specialist 21Shares has launched the world‚Äôs first crypto ETP providing direct exposure to SAND  the native token underpinning The Sandbox metaverse.The 21Shares The Sandbox ETP has been listed on BX Swiss (SAND BW) and Euronext Amsterdam (ASAND NA) in US dollars and on Euronext Paris (ASAND FP) in euros.The Sandbox is a decentralized virtual world wherein participants can create and monetize artistic content and gaming experiences. The Sandbox metaverse can be accessed via mobile phone or PC and currently has more than two million registered users.There are three main functionalities within The Sandbox ‚Äì VoxEdit  Marketplace  and Game Maker ‚Äì which collectively provide a complete toolkit for user-generated content.VoxEdit is a convenient voxel (a voxel is a single 3D unit of graphic information) modeling platform allowing users to create 3D objects such as avatars  animals  vehicles  and so forth. Created objects  known as ASSETS  are uploaded onto The Sandbox Marketplace and sold as non-fungible tokens.The Game Maker streamlines the creation of interactive games and experiences using visual scripting tools. Users wishing to create games will typically purchase LAND  another non-fungible token that designates land ownership within The Sandbox.SAND is a token built on the battle-tested Ethereum blockchain that forms the basis for all transactions and interactions conducted within The Sandbox including accessing games and experiences and buying ASSETS and LAND.SAND is a governance token  allowing holders to participate in voting decisions related to the future development of The Sandbox. It also works off the proof-of-stake model  allowing SAND holders to earn staking rewards by staking their tokens in order to secure new transactions on the blockchain.With a market capitalization of $3.5 billion  SAND is currently the 39th largest cryptocurrency globally.The 21Shares The Sandbox ETP offers institutional investors easy access to the SAND token through a liquid  regulated vehicle without the technical challenges of setting up private keys or crypto wallets.It uses full direct  ‚Äòphysical‚Äô replication with each ETP share being 100% collateralized by a corresponding investment in SAND which is stored using an institutional-grade cold-storage custody solution provided by Coinbase.The ETP comes with an expense ratio of 2.50%.The 21Shares The Sandbox ETP represents the 30th crypto ETP to be introduced on the 21Shares platform with the firm‚Äôs suite collectively housing nearly $3bn in assets.Hany Rashwan  CEO and co-founder of 21Shares  said: ‚ÄúThe launch of our 30th product is an important milestone in our history as an innovator in the crypto industry. It is a testament to the quality of the team we have built  and our position at the forefront of the acceleration of the global blockchain movement  that we have achieved this growth in scale in four years.‚ÄúWe are committed to making crypto accessible for everyone and continuing to offer best-in-class products to our investors is true to that vision.

The data showed robust pre-clinical proof of concept with the potential to overcome common mechanisms of resistance to CAR T-cell therapies in relapsed or refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (r/r NHL)  such as single-antigen escape or tumor heterogeneity.UCART20x22 is Cellectis‚Äô first allogeneic dual CAR T-cell product candidate being developed for patients with r/r NHL. It features TALEN¬Æ-mediated disruptions of the TRAC gene (to reduce the risk of graft-versus-host disease) and of the CD52 gene (to permit use of a CD52-directed monoclonal antibody in patients‚Äô preconditioning) to enhance CAR T engraftment  expansion and persistence.Dual targeting of CD20 and CD22  both validated targets in B-cell malignancies  is designed to enhanced tumor cell killing and to prevent immune escape due to single-antigen targeting. UCART20x22 has the potential to offer an alternative to CD19-directed therapies and CD19 negative relapses.The poster presentation at AACR highlighted the following preclinical data:UCART20x22 showed strong activity against tumor cell lines expressing either a single antigen  CD20 or CD22  or both simultaneously.In vivo pre-clinical models demonstrate that UCART20x22 efficiently eradicates tumors expressing both or either antigen  and sustained presence of UCART20x22 cells was observed in the bone marrow after tumor clearance.In vitro assays against primary cells from Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma patients with diverse CD22 and CD20 antigen levels demonstrate that UCART20x22 has potent and specific cytotoxic activity.‚ÄúWe are very excited to share these encouraging preclinical data at AACR that support the transition of UCART20x22 into the clinic. Cellectis‚Äô UCART20x22 further validates CD20 and CD22 targets in B-cell malignancies  provides an opportunity to overcome some of the current challenges  and represents a potential therapeutic alternative to CD19-directed therapies.
