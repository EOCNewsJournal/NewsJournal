2625,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/india/how-indias-much-hyped-global-bond-index-inclusion-unraveled-8341921.html,How Indiaâs much-hyped global bond index inclusion unraveled,The timeline seemed so final that Citigroup Inc. advised its clients to buy Indian debt in anticipation that key tax exemptions would be announced to facilitate the change. Policy makers and analysts predicted inclusion as early as April 1  the start of the n…,For months  India prepared for a remarkable milestone: getting its bonds listed on global indexes. Inclusion was perceived as a crucial step change for the $1 trillion market. Banks penciled in inflows of as much as $40 billion for a country that has long lagged behind peers in tapping international wealth.The timeline seemed so final that Citigroup Inc. advised its clients to buy Indian debt in anticipation that key tax exemptions would be announced to facilitate the change. Policy makers and analysts predicted inclusion as early as April 1  the start of the new financial year.So it came as a shock when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman didn’t make any mention of it in her February budget speech. The sudden silence puzzled traders. Within a day  Citi reversed its buy-call. Local debt markets saw the sharpest sell-off in almost two years. It was as if a plan had never existed.In interviews  Indian officials who were part of discussions described how politics and contentious tax negotiations intertwined to stall progress. Bankers worried about volatile inflows. Powerful Hindu nationalist groups raised eleventh hour concerns that exempting foreigners from taxes would lead to discrimination against domestic investors  according to the people  who asked not to be identified citing privacy rules.Now  many believe inclusion isn’t likely for at least a year. Officials say a path forward isn’t possible until Group of 20 nations reach a consensus on a country’s right to tax capital gains  another pressure point for India.“From India’s perspective  we are losing an opportunity to tap a pool of liquidity and an investor base ” said Nagaraj Kulkarni  Senior Asia Rates Strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. “From a foreign investors’ perspective  India is one of the largest EM bond markets that is yet to be included in major bond indexes.”With inclusion shelved  “investors lose out on a relatively high-yielding market that also offers risk diversification benefits ” he said.The challenges facing India are partly structural.Global investors want India to get its bonds on international clearing platforms  which help settle securities transactions. For that to happen  Euroclear  one of the major ones  has pushed India to exempt the transactions from taxes to avoid compliance issues. Other countries using the platform follow that policy.In India  progress seemed steady. In September  a senior official from the finance ministry said most of the work had been done. Tax authorities appeared ready to exempt these transactions  according to a person familiar with the matter. Morgan Stanley predicted inclusion to some indexes as early as the second quarter of 2022. FTSE Russell put India on its watchlist.Sitharaman was supposed to reveal the change in the Feb. 1 budget talk. Euroclear expected the tweak right up until the speech  according to a finance ministry official.When she said nothing  Euroclear was caught off-guard  the official said. So was the market: Citi quickly reversed its buy-call on India long bonds. Traders called the ministry searching for answers.Euroclear didn’t reply to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for India’s finance ministry didn’t respond to an email seeking clarification.In hindsight  officials said India’s reversal connects to an October announcement from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  the Paris-based group that develops international fiscal policy.To address tax avoidance issues  the OECD helped broker an agreement with 136 countries to implement a global minimum rate. India  which is a member of the group  took the position that countries had the right to tax capital gains based on the location of underlying assets.That created an optics problem. In discussions about index inclusion  the finance ministry had carved out a path to exempt international bond transactions from taxes. Now  Indian authorities had put forward a different perspective at public OECD forums. Around the beginning of 2022  the tax department  worried about this contradiction  made a decision not to follow through with the exemption  people familiar with the matter said.Meanwhile  in January  Hindu nationalist groups linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party met with senior government officials. They argued that it was unfair for foreigners to receive tax waivers when local investors did not get similar benefits.These groups have enjoyed increasing clout since Modi rose to power in 2014  partly because they can influence local businesses -- his party’s traditional vote bank. Every year  they hold informal discussions with the government ahead of the budget  one person said. In 2019  when the groups opposed a plan to issue a dollar-denominated sovereign bond  the proposal was scrapped. Their opposition contributed to the transfer of a top bureaucrat who supported it.“There is no reason why we should give advantages to foreign investors ” Ashwani Mahajan  one of the leaders of Swadeshi Jagran Manch  a Hindu nationalist group  told Bloomberg a few days before the February budget speech.For now  index inclusion appears all but impossible in the short term.In a recent interview with Bloomberg  Ajay Seth  the secretary of India’s economic affairs ministry  said index providers made last minute requests. Other officials said Euroclear kept moving its goal post  including tax changes beyond the capital gains issue.The inclusion delay has already impacted India’s bond market. In recent months  yields rose amid a surge in global crude prices. Key banks are adjusting interest rates to keep pace with inflation. That’s a concern for the government as it plans to borrow a record amount from the markets to bridge a wide fiscal gap.“With a large supply looming  yields on government securities are likely to harden once next fiscal’s borrowing commences in April ” said Aditi Nayar  chief economist at ICRA Ltd.  the local unit of Moody’s Investors Service. “If there are concrete steps toward bond index inclusion during the year  it could help to cap yields.”Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox  investments  taxes,neutral,0.06,0.67,0.27,negative,0.01,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['global bond index inclusion', 'Indiaâ', 'Senior Asia Rates Strategist', 'largest EM bond markets', 'Prime Minister Narendra Modi', 'Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman', 'Powerful Hindu nationalist groups', 'dollar-denominated sovereign bond', 'eleventh hour concerns', 'Standard Chartered Plc', 'traditional vote bank', 'Swadeshi Jagran Manch', 'international clearing platforms', 'key tax exemptions', 'new financial year', 'contentious tax negotiations', 'risk diversification benefits', 'Local debt markets', 'Feb. 1 budget talk', 'global minimum rate', 'tax avoidance issues', 'public OECD forums', 'international fiscal policy', 'international bond transactions', 'crucial step change', 'February budget speech', 'major bond indexes', 'senior government officials', 'finance ministry official', 'foreign investors’ perspective', 'India long bonds', 'senior official', 'international wealth', 'Indian debt', 'a year', 'compliance issues', 'Tax authorities', 'tax department', 'tax waivers', 'similar benefits', 'global indexes', 'Global investors', 'local investors', 'local businesses', 'remarkable milestone', 'Citigroup Inc.', 'Policy makers', 'sudden silence', 'sharpest sell-off', 'two years', 'domestic investors', 'privacy rules', 'capital gains', 'pressure point', 'investor base', 'Nagaraj Kulkarni', 'Morgan Stanley', 'second quarter', 'FTSE Russell', 'multiple requests', 'October announcement', 'Economic Co-operation', 'underlying assets', 'optics problem', 'Indian authorities', 'different perspective', 'increasing clout', 'top bureaucrat', 'Ashwani Mahajan', 'Indian officials', 'securities transactions', 'Paris-based group', '$1 trillion market', 'high-yielding market', 'volatile inflows', 'one person', 'Other countries', 'informal discussions', 'index inclusion', '136 countries', 'months', 'Banks', 'country', 'peers', 'timeline', 'clients', 'anticipation', 'analysts', 'April', 'start', 'shock', 'mention', 'traders', 'day', 'buy-call', 'plan', 'interviews', 'politics', 'progress', 'Bankers', 'foreigners', 'taxes', 'discrimination', 'people', 'path', '20 nations', 'consensus', 'right', 'opportunity', 'pool', 'liquidity', 'Singapore', 'challenges', 'Euroclear', 'September', 'work', 'matter', 'watchlist', 'tweak', 'guard', 'answers', 'comment', 'spokesperson', 'email', 'clarification', 'hindsight', 'reversal', 'Organisation', 'Development', 'agreement', 'member', 'position', 'location', 'beginning', 'contradiction', 'decision', 'January', 'party', 'proposal', 'transfer', 'reason', 'advantages', 'leaders', 'Bloomberg']",2022-04-11,2022-04-11,moneycontrol.com

The guidelines shall be applicable to compensation that is agreed and amendments made to previously agreed compensation  subsequent to the adoption of the guidelines at the Annual General Meeting 2022. The guidelines do not include compensation resolved by the Annual General Meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the Company's business strategy  long-term interest and sustainabilityThe Company's business strategy is to discover new drug candidates with the help of ISP (Integrative Screening Process) and develop them into a so-called clinical ""Proof of Concept"" when clear indications of efficacy  tolerability and safety are achieved and thereafter seek partnership with international pharmaceutical companies for further development  registration and marketing.For further detailed information about the Company's business strategy please refer to the Company's annual reports and the website.The work with drug development takes a long time which means that continuity as well as low employee turnover are important. Successful implementation of the Company's business strategy and safeguarding of the Company's long-term interest  including concern for the sustainability of the business  therefore assumes that the Company is able to recruit and retain qualified employees. To achieve this  it is necessary that the Company can offer good working conditions with competitive levels of compensation. These guidelines enables the Company's executives to be offered a competitive total compensation.Forms of compensation etc.In the Company  the market compensation consists of fixed cash salary  pension benefits and other benefits. In addition and independently of these guidelines  the Annual General Meeting may resolve on  for example  share and share price-related compensation.Cash variable compensation can be paid in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made at the individual level as compensation for extraordinary work effort in addition to the person's ordinary duties. Such compensation may not be paid more than twice a year and per individual and may not exceed an amount in total corresponding to 25 percent of the fixed annual cash salary. Decision on such compensation shall be made by the board of directors on the proposal of the remuneration committee.The pension premiums for defined contribution pensions for the CEO and management group in the company vary greatly depending on  among other things  age  previous salary and employment conditions.For the CEO  pension benefits  including health insurance  must be defined-contribution. Any variable cash compensation shall not be pension-based. The pension premiums for defined-contribution pensions may amount to a maximum of 40 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.For other senior executives  pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be defined-contribution unless the executive is covered by a defined-benefit pension in accordance with mandatory collective agreement provisions. Variable cash compensation shall be pension-based to the extent it follows from mandatory collective agreement provisions that are applicable to the executive. The pension premiums for defined-contribution pensions may amount to a maximum of 40 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.Other benefits may include  among other things  life insurance  health insurance and car benefit. Such benefits may amount in total to a maximum of 10 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.Termination of employmentUpon termination of employment  the notice period may not exceed twelve months. Fixed cash salary during the notice period and severance pay may not exceed an amount in total corresponding to the fixed cash salary for two years. In the event of termination on the part of the executive  the termination period may be not exceed 18 months for the CEO and no longer than six months for the other senior executives.In addition  compensation may be paid for any undertaking to restrict competition. Such compensation shall compensate for any loss of income and shall only be paid to the extent that the previous executive is not entitled to severance pay. The compensation shall be based on the fixed cash salary at the time of termination and shall be paid during the period the undertaking regarding restriction of competition applies  which shall be no longer than six months after the termination of employment.Salary and terms of employment for employeesIn preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these compensation guidelines  salary and terms of employment for the Company's employees have been taken into consideration through information about employees' total compensation  compensation components and the increase and rate of increase over time has formed part of the remuneration committee's and Board of Directors' basis for decision in the evaluation of the equity of the guidelines and the restrictions that follow as a result of these. The development of the gap between compensation for senior executives and compensation for other employees will be detailed in the remuneration report.The decision-making process to establish  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a remuneration committee. The committee's duties include preparing the Board of Director's decision on proposed guidelines for compensation to senior executives. The Board of Directors shall prepare proposals for new guidelines at least every four years and submit the proposal for resolution at the Annual General Meeting.

During consideration of and decisions on compensation-related issues by the Board of Directors  neither the CEO nor other persons in the company management shall attend  insofar as they are affected by the issues.Deviation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may decide to temporarily deviate from the guidelines in whole or in part  if in an individual case if there are special reasons to do so and a deviation is necessary to meet the Company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the Company's economic viability. As stated above  it is part of the remuneration committee's duties to prepare Board of Directors' decisions in compensation issues  which include decisions regarding deviations from the guidelines.Description of important changes to the guidelines and how the shareholders' views have been taken into account.These guidelines correspond to the guidelines adopted at the 2020 Annual General Meeting19.

2628,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/how-india-s-much-anticipated-global-bond-index-inclusion-unraveled-122041100134_1.html,How India's much-anticipated global bond index inclusion unraveled,Inclusion was perceived as a crucial step change for the $1 trillion market.,For months  India prepared for a remarkable milestone: getting its bonds listed on global indexes. Inclusion was perceived as a crucial step change for the $1 trillion market.

Acquisition of Savings Shares shall be made through the company on Nasdaq Stockholm within twenty trading days from when the outcome of the variable cash remuneration program has been established and the participants have informed Eolus whether they want to participate in the Share Savings Program.Provided that the participant still holds all of the Savings Shares and is still employed within the Eolus group three years after the acquisition of Savings Shares  Eolus will remunerate the participant with an amount corresponding to the cost for acquiring the number of Eolus shares corresponding to half of the number of Savings Shares (“Matching Shares”). Acquisition of Matching Shares shall be made through the company on Nasdaq Stockholm within twenty trading days from the date falling three years after the acquisition of Savings Shares.In order to ensure that the participant’s financial situation as far as possible shall remain unchanged  the number of Matching Shares shall be subject to customary recalculation should the company’s share capital increase or decrease  convertible debt instruments or options be issued or the company be liquidated or merged  or any similar changes to the company occur.Should the participant be prohibited from acquiring Savings Shares due to possession of inside information  the Board of Directors may in individual cases prolong or postpone the above mentioned investment period  although not beyond the next AGM. The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed conditions and the administration of the Share Savings Program 2022 within the terms and conditions set forth above  and may also make such minor adjustments and applications as may be appropriate for legal or administrative reasons.Based on the assumptions of maximum outcome in the variable cash remuneration program  full investments by the entitled participants and an unchanged share price at the time of delivery of the Matching Shares  Eolus’ costs relating to the Share Savings Program 2022 are estimated to amount to a maximum of SEK 2 2 million. Assuming a 25 per cent increase in Eolus’ share price at the time of delivery of Matching Shares  Eolus’ costs relating to the Share Savings Program 2022  including employer contributions  are estimated to amount to a maximum of SEK 2 8 million and assuming a 50 per cent increase in the share price at such time  the costs are estimated to amount to a maximum of SEK 3 3 million  including employer contributions. The Share Savings Program 2022 does not result in any dilution of the holdings of the company’s shareholders and is not deemed to affect any performance measure important for Eolus. No measures have been taken to hedge Eolus’ costs against its own share price in connection with the purchase of Matching shares.The proposal on Share Savings Program 2022 has been prepared by the Board of Directors and the Remuneration Committee. In the company  similar share savings programs for the financial years 2021  2019/2020 and 2018/2019 relating to the variable cash remuneration have previously been adopted. By requiring  as described above  that the participants make an own investment in Eolus shares and thereby reconciling the employees’ and the shareholders’ interests of a long-term increase of the company’s value  the Share Savings Program 2022 is expected to enhance Eolus’ possibilities to recruit and retain competent employees while at the same time promoting Eolus’ business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability.The proposal must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast at the general meeting.Available documentationThe following documentation will be held available at the company and on the company’s website at least three weeks ahead of the AGM. The documentation will also be sent  without any cost for the recipients  to shareholders who so request and provide their address or e-mail address: (i) the accounting material and the auditor’s report  (ii)  the statement by the auditor on the compliance of the resolved guidelines for remuneration to senior executives  (iii) remuneration report  (iv) the complete proposal of the Board of Directors with respect to appropriation of profit and the Board of Directors’ motivated statement thereon  and (v) the complete proposal of the Board of Directors with respect to the long-term share savings program.Number of shares and votes in the companyAt the time of issue of this convening notice  the total number of shares in the company amounts to 24 907 000  of which 1 285 625 shares are Class A shares and 23 621 375 shares are Class B shares.

The sudden silence puzzled traders. Within a day  Citi reversed its buy-call. Local debt markets saw the sharpest sell-off in almost two years. It was as if a plan had never existed.In interviews  Indian officials who were part of discussions described how politics and contentious tax negotiations intertwined to stall progress. Bankers worried about volatile inflows. Powerful Hindu nationalist groups raised eleventh hour concerns that exempting foreigners from taxes would lead to discrimination against domestic investors  according to the people  who asked not to be identified citing privacy rules.Now  many believe inclusion isn’t likely for at least a year. Officials say a path forward isn’t possible until Group of 20 nations reach a consensus on a country’s right to tax capital gains  another pressure point for India.“From India’s perspective  we are losing an opportunity to tap a pool of liquidity and an investor base ” said Nagaraj Kulkarni  Senior Asia Rates Strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. “From a foreign investors’ perspective  India is one of the largest EM bond markets that is yet to be included in major bond indexes.”With inclusion shelved  “investors lose out on a relatively high-yielding market that also offers risk diversification benefits ” he said.The challenges facing India are partly structural.Global investors want India to get its bonds on international clearing platforms  which help settle securities transactions. For that to happen  Euroclear  one of the major ones  has pushed India to exempt the transactions from taxes to avoid compliance issues. Other countries using the platform follow that policy.In India  progress seemed steady. In September  a senior official from the finance ministry said most of the work had been done. Tax authorities appeared ready to exempt these transactions  according to a person familiar with the matter. Morgan Stanley predicted inclusion to some indexes as early as the second quarter of 2022. FTSE Russell put India on its watchlist.Sitharaman was supposed to reveal the change in the Feb. 1 budget talk. Euroclear expected the tweak right up until the speech  according to a finance ministry official.When she said nothing  Euroclear was caught off-guard  the official said. So was the market: Citi quickly reversed its buy-call on India long bonds. Traders called the ministry searching for answers.Euroclear didn’t reply to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for India’s finance ministry didn’t respond to an email seeking clarification.In hindsight  officials said India’s reversal connects to an October announcement from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  the Paris-based group that develops international fiscal policy.To address tax avoidance issues  the OECD helped broker an agreement with 136 countries to implement a global minimum rate. India  which is a member of the group  took the position that countries had the right to tax capital gains based on the location of underlying assets.That created an optics problem. In discussions about index inclusion  the finance ministry had carved out a path to exempt international bond transactions from taxes. Now  Indian authorities had put forward a different perspective at public OECD forums. Around the beginning of 2022  the tax department  worried about this contradiction  made a decision not to follow through with the exemption  people familiar with the matter said.Meanwhile  in January  Hindu nationalist groups linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party met with senior government officials. They argued that it was unfair for foreigners to receive tax waivers when local investors did not get similar benefits.These groups have enjoyed increasing clout since Modi rose to power in 2014  partly because they can influence local businesses -- his party’s traditional vote bank. Every year  they hold informal discussions with the government ahead of the budget  one person said. In 2019  when the groups opposed a plan to issue a dollar-denominated sovereign bond  the proposal was scrapped. Their opposition contributed to the transfer of a top bureaucrat who supported it.“There is no reason why we should give advantages to foreign investors ” Ashwani Mahajan  one of the leaders of Swadeshi Jagran Manch  a Hindu nationalist group  told Bloomberg a few days before the February budget speech.For now  index inclusion appears all but impossible in the short term.In a recent interview with Bloomberg  Ajay Seth  the secretary of India’s economic affairs ministry  said index providers made last minute requests. Other officials said Euroclear kept moving its goal post  including tax changes beyond the capital gains issue.The inclusion delay has already impacted India’s bond market . In recent months  yields rose amid a surge in global crude prices. Key banks are adjusting interest rates to keep pace with inflation. That’s a concern for the government as it plans to borrow a record amount from the markets to bridge a wide fiscal gap.“With a large supply looming  yields on government securities are likely to harden once next fiscal’s borrowing commences in April ” said Aditi Nayar  chief economist at ICRA Ltd.  the local unit of Moody’s Investors Service. “If there are concrete steps toward bond index inclusion during the year  it could help to cap yields.”,neutral,0.07,0.72,0.21,negative,0.02,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['global bond index inclusion', 'India', 'Senior Asia Rates Strategist', 'largest EM bond markets', 'Prime Minister Narendra Modi', 'Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman', 'Powerful Hindu nationalist groups', 'dollar-denominated sovereign bond', 'eleventh hour concerns', 'Standard Chartered Plc', 'traditional vote bank', 'Swadeshi Jagran Manch', 'international clearing platforms', 'key tax exemptions', 'new financial year', 'contentious tax negotiations', 'risk diversification benefits', 'Feb. 1 budget talk', 'Local debt markets', 'global minimum rate', 'tax avoidance issues', 'public OECD forums', 'February budget speech', 'international fiscal policy', 'international bond transactions', 'crucial step change', 'major bond indexes', 'senior government officials', 'finance ministry official', 'foreign investors’ perspective', 'India long bonds', 'senior official', 'international wealth', 'Indian debt', 'a year', 'compliance issues', 'Tax authorities', 'tax department', 'tax waivers', 'similar benefits', 'global indexes', 'Global investors', 'local investors', 'local businesses', 'remarkable milestone', 'Citigroup Inc.', 'Policy makers', 'sudden silence', 'sharpest sell-off', 'two years', 'domestic investors', 'privacy rules', 'capital gains', 'pressure point', 'investor base', 'Nagaraj Kulkarni', 'Morgan Stanley', 'second quarter', 'FTSE Russell', 'multiple requests', 'October announcement', 'Economic Co-operation', 'underlying assets', 'optics problem', 'Indian authorities', 'different perspective', 'increasing clout', 'top bureaucrat', 'Ashwani Mahajan', 'Indian officials', 'securities transactions', 'Paris-based group', '$1 trillion market', 'high-yielding market', 'volatile inflows', 'one person', 'Other countries', 'informal discussions', 'index inclusion', '136 countries', 'months', 'Banks', 'country', 'peers', 'timeline', 'clients', 'anticipation', 'analysts', 'April', 'start', 'shock', 'mention', 'traders', 'day', 'buy-call', 'plan', 'interviews', 'politics', 'progress', 'Bankers', 'foreigners', 'taxes', 'discrimination', 'people', 'path', '20 nations', 'consensus', 'right', 'opportunity', 'pool', 'liquidity', 'Singapore', 'challenges', 'Euroclear', 'September', 'work', 'matter', 'watchlist', 'tweak', 'guard', 'answers', 'comment', 'spokesperson', 'email', 'clarification', 'hindsight', 'reversal', 'Organisation', 'Development', 'agreement', 'member', 'position', 'location', 'beginning', 'contradiction', 'decision', 'January', 'party', 'proposal', 'transfer', 'reason', 'advantages', 'leaders', 'Bloomberg']",2022-04-11,2022-04-11,economictimes.indiatimes.com

The Notes are not secured debt. You should carefully consider whether the Notes are suited to your particular circumstances. This pricing supplement should be read together with the accompanying prospectus  dated September 14  2021  and the accompanying prospectus supplement  dated September 14  2021. The information in the accompanying prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement is supplemented by  and to the extent inconsistent therewith replaced and superseded by  the information in this pricing supplement. This section describes certain significant risks relating to an investment in the Notes. We urge you to read the following information about these risks  together with the other information in this pricing supplement and the accompanying prospectus and accompanying prospectus supplement  before investing in the Notes.Investors Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Market Perceptions About Our Creditworthiness May Adversely Affect the Market Value of the Notes.Investors are dependent on our ability to pay all amounts due on the Notes on the interest payment dates and at maturity  and  therefore  investors are subject to our credit risk and to changes in the market’s view of our creditworthiness. Any decrease in the market’s view on or confidence in our creditworthiness is likely to adversely affect the market value of the Notes.The Market Value of the Notes May Be Influenced by Unpredictable Factors.The market value of your Notes may fluctuate between the date you purchase them and the Maturity Date. Several factors  many of which are beyond our control  will influence the market value of the Notes. Factors that may influence the market value of the Notes include:· supply and demand for the Notes  including inventory positions with the underwriters or any other market-maker;· interest rates in the market and expectations about future interest rates;· the creditworthiness of the Bank;· the time remaining to the maturity of the Notes; and· economic  financial  political  regulatory or judicial events that affect financial markets generally.The Notes Will Not Be Listed on Any Securities Exchange and Secondary Trading May Be Limited.The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Therefore  there may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The underwriters may  but are not obligated to  make a market in the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market  it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because we do not expect that other broker-dealers will participate significantly in the secondary market for the Notes  the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price  if any  at which the underwriters are willing to transact. If at any time the underwriters were not to make a market in the Notes  it is likely that there would be no secondary market for the Notes. Accordingly  you should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity.P- 5Senior Floating Rate Notes Due April 14  2025Royal Bank of CanadaWe or Our Designee Will Make Determinations with respect to the Notes.We or our designee will make certain determinations with respect to the Notes as further described under the caption “Specific Terms of the Notes.” In addition  if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred  we or our designee will make certain determinations with respect to the Notes in our or our designee’s sole discretion as further described under the section “Description of the Notes We May Offer—Interest Rates—SOFR Index Notes” in the accompanying prospectus supplement  dated September 14  2021. Any of these determinations may adversely affect the value of the Notes  the return on the Notes and the price at which you can sell such Notes. Moreover  certain determinations may require the exercise of discretion and the making of subjective judgments  such as with respect to Compounded SOFR Index or the occurrence or non-occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event and any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes. These potentially subjective determinations may adversely affect the value of the Notes  the return on the Notes and the price at which you can sell such Notes. For further information regarding these types of determinations  see “Description of the Notes We May Offer—Interest Rates—SOFR Index Notes” in the accompanying prospectus supplement  dated September 14  2021.P- 6Senior Floating Rate Notes Due April 14  2025Royal Bank of CanadaSPECIFIC TERMS OF THE NOTESPlease note that in this section entitled “Specific Terms of the Notes ” references to “holders” mean those who own Notes registered in their own names  on the books that we or the trustee maintain for this purpose  and not those who own beneficial interests in Notes registered in street name or in Notes issued in book-entry form through DTC or another depositary.

This discussion is only applicable to you if you are a U.S. holder (as defined in the accompanying prospectus).

Under this characterization  you should include the interest payments on the Notes in ordinary income at the time you receive or accrue such payments  depending on your method of accounting for tax purposes  and recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or retirement of your Notes equal to the difference between the amount you realize on the sale or retirement  excluding any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest (which should be treated as interest payments)  and your tax basis in your Notes.For a further discussion of the variable rate debt instrument rules  please see the discussion under the heading “Tax Consequences—United States Taxation—Original Issue Discount—Variable Rate Debt Securities” in the accompanying prospectus.P- 10Senior Floating Rate Notes Due April 14  2025Royal Bank of CanadaCANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONSFor a discussion of the Canadian federal income tax consequences of owning the Notes  please see the section “Tax Consequences— Canadian Taxation” in the accompanying prospectus  dated September 14  2021 and the section “Certain Income Tax Consequences—Canadian Taxation” in the accompanying prospectus supplement  dated September 14  2021.BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR CONSIDERATIONSA fiduciary of a pension  profit-sharing or other employee benefit plan (a “plan”) subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  as amended (“ERISA”)  should consider the fiduciary standards of ERISA in the context of the plan’s particular circumstances before authorizing an investment in the debt securities.Any purchaser or holder of debt securities or any interest therein will be deemed to have represented (both on behalf of itself and any plan) by its purchase and holding of the debt securities that either (1) it is not a plan and is not purchasing those debt securities on behalf of or with “plan assets” of any plan or (2) the purchase and holding of the debt securities will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code.

The underwriters and those dealers may resell the Notes to other dealers at a reallowance discount that will not exceed 0.050% of their principal amount. After the initial offering of the Notes  the concession and reallowance discounts on the Notes may change. The offering of the Notes by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.We estimate that the total offering expenses for the Notes  excluding underwriting discounts and commissions  will be approximately $41 603.P- 12Senior Floating Rate Notes Due April 14  2025Royal Bank of CanadaSubject to the terms and conditions of the terms agreement  the underwriters have agreed to purchase the Notes as principal  for their own account at a purchase price equal to the issue price specified on the front cover of this pricing supplement  less an underwriting discount of 0.150%.

2633,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.natlawreview.com/article/russian-sanctions-how-will-they-impact-credit-default-swaps,Russian Sanctions and Global Financial Impact of Sovereign Debt,5 hours ago,Monday  April 11  2022Economic sanctions against Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine have had a broad impact on the global economy and have raised the question of whether Russia will be able to meet its obligations on foreign denominated bonds. If Russia defaults on its bonds  credit default swaps meant to protect investors from a Russian default may not work as planned because of these sanctions.At the end of last year  Russia had $40 billion in foreign currency sovereign debt  half of which is owed to foreign investors. While U.S. sanctions allow for Russia to continue to make debt payments at least through the end of May 2022  Russian restrictions on allowing foreign exchange transactions could force a default on bonds that do not allow for payment in Rubles. On Monday  April 4  2022  the U.S. Treasury restricted U.S. banks from processing payments on Russian bonds  increasing the risk of a default.Credit default swaps are meant to help investors receive near full recovery in the event of a default on the underlying debt. Payments under credit default swaps are owed to the purchaser of the credit default swap when a “Credit Event” has occurred. Credit Events include: a failure to make a payment under the debt (following any applicable grace period)  insolvency of the issuer  debt restructuring and repudiation of the debt. There are approximately $4.5 billion in credit default swaps tied to Russian government debt and another $1.5 billion in derivative indices  according to JPMorgan.Escalating western sanctions against Russia have raised questions about whether Russia will be able to meet its obligations under its sovereign debt  whether credit default swaps will be triggered if Russia does not meet the terms of its obligations and whether sanctions will interfere with the settlement of credit default swaps if a Credit Event is triggered.Will credit default swaps be triggered if Russia does not meet the terms of its obligations?Russia’s decision in March to pay some of its foreign debtors in Rubles could have triggered a Credit Event. ISDA’s Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee (the “DC”) applies the terms of market-standard credit derivatives to specific cases  and makes a factual determination as to whether a Credit Event or other events under a credit default swap have occurred and other issues. The DC determined that payment of obligations in Rubles  when not the original currency of denomination of the debt  would not constitute a Credit Event where the underlying debt allows for payment in Rubles. However  certain of Russia’s bonds do not provide for payment in Rubles. A failure by Russia to make a payment under the terms of the bonds (whether by failing to make a payment entirely  or by making a payment in Rubles when not permitted under the terms of the debt) would most likely constitute a Credit Event  triggering credit default swaps referencing Russian debt.For the time being  Russia has avoided defaulting on its foreign currency debt  making $732 million in coupon payments on US Dollar denominated bonds in the month of March 2022. Russia owed approximately $2 billion on a bond that came due on Monday  April 4  2022  and owes another $84 million in interest payments on a second bond. The recent U.S. Treasury restrictions on U.S. banks processing Russian government debt effectively blocked the payment on both bonds. A failure by the Russian government to find another way to make the payments within the thirty day grace period provided for in the bonds would likely constitute a default under the bonds and trigger a Credit Event under credit default swaps referencing Russian sovereign debt.What debt will be “deliverable” under credit default swaps?The settlement of a credit default swap requires the delivery (for physical settlement) or pricing (for cash settlement) of debt that meets certain characteristics  including Not Domestic Currency (i.e.  payable in a currency other than the Ruble)  Not Domestic Law (i.e.  governed by non-Russian law) and Not Domestic Issuance (i.e.  not issued primarily in the Russian market). Additionally  the obligation must be payable in a G-7 currency and transferable to institutional investors without contractual or regulatory restrictions. The DC has determined that non-Ruble denominated debt that allows for payment in Rubles will not meet the Not Domestic Currency test and therefore will not be “deliverable” for settlement under credit default swaps. Similarly  if the Russian government decides to make a payment in Rubles under G-7 denominated debt  such debt may no longer be considered “deliverable”. Additionally  on March 25  2022  ISDA published “Additional Provisions for Certain Russian Entities: Excluded Obligations and Excluded Deliverable Obligations” (the “Protocol”) which contains new terms that can be added to existing or new credit derivatives transactions. The new terms in the Protocol provide that a default under certain Russian sovereign debt (“Restricted Debt”) will not trigger a Credit Event under credit default swap transactions and exclude such debt from the definition of “deliverable” obligations. In an FAQ released in conjunction with the publication of the Protocol  ISDA noted that it would be impractical to hold a settlement auction referencing Restricted Debt.Will sanctions interfere with the settlement of credit default swaps?Sanctions could prevent certain bonds from being delivered in the event a credit default swap is triggered and/or misalign the pricing mechanism for settlement of credit default swaps. The expected recovery under credit default swaps is usually determined using an auction process based on bonds that are “deliverable” under the terms of the credit default swaps. The auction process relies on the existence of a secondary trading market for the debt. Russia has blocked offshore settlement of bonds through Euroclear which would make certain bonds  which by their terms are to settle in Russia  untradeable. Further sanctions could also impact whether other Russian bonds are tradeable and eligible to be delivered under credit default swap contracts. If fewer bonds are deemed “deliverable” under the terms of the credit default swap  the auction price is likely to be higher (as more parties bid on fewer bonds)  leading to a lower recovery for credit default swap buyers and a possible loss on the bonds that the purchase of the credit default swaps was meant to avert. One solution would be to circumvent the auction process entirely  leaving parties to the credit default swaps to agree to a cash price to close out the swap. This could potentially result in different recoveries for different market participants.Credit default swap buyers should carefully review the terms of their contracts to determine whether they will be required to physically deliver the underlying debt to receive the expected payout under the terms of their credit default swap contracts and determine whether they will be able to deliver the debt.,neutral,0.04,0.48,0.48,negative,0.01,0.17,0.82,True,English,"['Global Financial Impact', 'Russian Sanctions', 'Sovereign Debt', 'recent U.S. Treasury restrictions', 'thirty day grace period', 'Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee', 'US Dollar denominated bonds', 'new credit derivatives transactions', 'credit default swap transactions', 'foreign currency sovereign debt', 'applicable grace period', 'U.S. banks', 'foreign exchange transactions', 'market-standard credit derivatives', 'U.S. sanctions', 'Certain Russian Entities', 'credit default swaps', 'Domestic Currency test', 'Escalating western sanctions', 'G-7 denominated debt', 'foreign denominated bonds', 'foreign currency debt', 'Russian sovereign debt', 'Ruble denominated debt', 'Russian government debt', 'Excluded Deliverable Obligations', 'Not Domestic Currency', 'Russian restrictions', 'G-7 currency', 'regulatory restrictions', 'Russian default', 'foreign debtors', 'Credit Events', 'original currency', 'Domestic Law', 'Domestic Issuance', 'Russian debt', 'Russian law', 'Russian market', 'foreign investors', 'underlying debt', 'debt restructuring', 'Restricted Debt', 'Economic sanctions', 'broad impact', 'global economy', 'last year', 'full recovery', 'derivative indices', 'specific cases', 'factual determination', 'other events', 'other issues', 'Additional Provisions', 'Russian bonds', 'new terms', 'Excluded Obligations', 'The DC', 'debt payments', 'coupon payments', 'interest payments', 'second bond', 'institutional investors', 'physical settlement', 'cash settlement', 'Monday', 'April', 'result', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'question', 'end', 'half', 'May', 'Rubles', 'processing', 'risk', 'purchaser', 'failure', 'insolvency', 'issuer', 'repudiation', 'JPMorgan', 'decision', 'March', 'ISDA', 'denomination', 'time', 'month', 'way', 'delivery', 'pricing', 'characteristics', 'contractual', 'Protocol', 'existing']",2022-04-11,2022-04-11,natlawreview.com

The nomination committee's complete proposals  including a presentation of the proposed members of the board of directors and an assessment of their independence in relation to the company  the executive management and the company's major shareholders  are available on the company's website (www.storskogen.com). Resolution on implementation of an employee stock option plan etc.  item 11 The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to establish an employee stock option plan  also known as Employee Stock Option Plan 2022 (""ESOP 2022"") directed to senior executives and other key employees of the group. The purpose of the ESOP 2022 is to ensure that the company has the appropriate tools to attract and retain the right talent to the group  to increase the motivation amongst the ESOP-participants (as defined below)  increase their loyalty to the company and align their interests with that of the company's shareholders as well as to promote an individual shareholding in the company and thereby promote shareholder value and the long-term value growth of the company. The board of directors proposes that ESOP 2022 is established in accordance with the following principal terms and conditions. The board of directors shall be responsible for the details and management of ESOP 2022 within the framework of its proposal. Approval for admission to participate in ESOP 2022 is at the sole discretion of the board of directors (primarily acting through its remuneration committee). ESOP 2022 is directed to up to 137 full-time employed senior executives and other key employees of the group (the ""ESOP-participants""). The maximum number of shares of series B (""B-shares"") in the company available under the programme shall be 16 891 002. Subject to the terms and conditions of ESOP 2022  the company will grant options (the ""Options"")  free of charge  to the ESOP-participants in a number allocated by the board of directors pursuant to the principles described below. The date of grant of Options for each participant is referred to as the ""Date of Grant"". The intention is to launch ESOP 2022 and grant the Options to ESOP-participants in a first tranche not later than 10 June 2022 and in a second tranche not later than 30 November 2022 . The Options will  subject to the terms and conditions of ESOP 2022  vest on the third anniversary of the Date of Grant (the ""Vesting Date"") in a number dependant on  e.g.  the level of fulfilment of the performance criterion as set out below. The period from and including the Date of Grant to the Vesting Date is referred to as the ""Vesting Period"". Vested Options will be available for an exercise period of three months after determination by the board of directors of the number of vested Options (if any). Any vested Options not exercised by an ESOP-participant will automatically terminate and be forfeited. Employees in the categories below are eligible for participation in ESOP 2022. The maximum number of Options that an ESOP-participant will be entitled to be allotted depends on which category such person belongs to: Employee (category) Total # of Options per category (maximum) # of Options per ESOP-participant (maximum) # of ESOP-participants (maximum) CEO 558 270 558 270 1 Members of the group management 1 825 206 406 740 6 Senior key employees of the group 3 668 000 326 987 14 Other senior key employees of the group 4 747 986 167 481 38 Mid key employees of the group 2 267 800 76 750 50 Base key employees of the group 781 144 47 201 28 Total (maximum) 13 848 406 N/A 137 The price payable per B-share upon exercise of an Option (the ""Exercise Price"") shall (prior to any re-calculations) correspond to the volume weighted average price for the company's B-share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the trading days falling within a period of ten (10) banking days immediately prior to the Date of Grant. The number of B-shares in the company which can be delivered following exercise of the Options  and the Exercise Price  may be re-calculated by the board of directors in the event of share issues  share splits  reversed share splits  dividends in-kind or similar events. Following the Vesting Period  each Option entitles the ESOP-participant to exercise one (1) Option in order to acquire one (1) B-share in the company against payment of the Exercise Price subject to the terms of ESOP 2022. These terms include: Performance criterion: The number of Options available for exercise depends on the level of fulfilment of the stipulated performance criterion. If the ESOP-participant is offered to participate in ESOP 2022 in May 2022   the performance criterion is based on the increase in adjusted EBITA for the last twelve months as stated in the financial report for the period 1 January- 31 March 2025 in comparison with the adjusted EBITA for the last twelve months stated in the financial report for the period 1 January- 31 March 2022 . If the ESOP-participant is offered to participate in ESOP 2022 in November 2022   the performance criterion is based on the increase in adjusted EBITA for the last twelve months as stated in the financial report for the period 1 January- 30 September 2025 in comparison with the adjusted EBITA for the last twelve months stated in the financial report for the period 1 January- 30 September 2022 . If the adjusted EBITA from 2022 to 2025 during the relevant period has: decreased or increased by 50 per cent or less  no Options shall have vested for ESOP-participants; increased by 100 per cent or more than 100 per cent  the maximum number of Options will have vested for the ESOP-participants; and increased by more than 50 per cent  but the increase is less than 100 per cent  the vesting of Options of the ESOP-participants will be linear in relation to the vesting set out in (i) and (ii). Any Options that are not vested will immediately be deemed forfeited without consideration. Continued employment: The terms of ESOP 2022 include a condition of the ESOP-participant's continued employment within the group during the Vesting Period (under certain conditions  the ESOP-participant may have a right to some of the Options even if the employment has been terminated before the end of the Vesting Period and the board of directors shall furthermore be authorised to waive the employment condition under extraordinary circumstances  for example  if the ESOP-participant's employment is terminated as a result of long-term illness). The profit (before tax) of the value of the B-shares in the company  which can be delivered upon exercise of Options to ESOP-participants  less the Exercise Price for these Options may not exceed the following levels. Employee (category) Maximum profit (before tax) of the value of B-shares by the end of the Vesting Period  less the Exercise Price  as a percentage of fixed yearly remuneration when the ESOP-participant received the offer to participate in ESOP 2022 CEO  members of the group management and senior key employees of the group 200% Other senior key employees of the group 150% Mid key employees of the group and base key employees of the group 100% Subject to the above principal conditions  the company shall  following payment by the ESOP-participant of the Exercise Price  procure that B-shares corresponding to the number of exercised Options (if any) are delivered to the ESOP-participants not later than 60 days after expiry of the exercise period (the exercise period is three months following the Vesting Date). The board of directors shall be entitled to postpone such date if  among other things  the ESOP-participant is not permitted to acquire shares during this period. An ESOP-participant's participation in ESOP 2022 requires that it is legally possible and appropriate in the jurisdiction in which such ESOP-participant is resident and that such participation  in the board of director's opinion  is deemed possible with reasonable administrative and financial costs. If significant changes occur in the company or in the market  or in the event the costs for ESOP 2022 significantly exceed the estimated costs  and this  in the opinion of the board of directors  results in a situation where the conditions for allotment of B-shares based upon exercised Options become unreasonable  the board of directors is entitled to make adjustments to ESOP 2022  including  among other things  to resolve on a reduced allotment of B-shares  or to not allot any B-shares at all. In the event that delivery of B-shares to an ESOP-participant cannot take place under applicable law or at reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative effort  the board of directors of the company may pay a part of or the entire allotment to such ESOP-participant in cash instead of with B-shares. The board of directors of the company may also retain allotted B-shares and settle a part of the allotment in cash in order to facilitate the payment of the ESOP-participants' tax liabilities. Issue and transfer of warrants The board of directors proposes  for the purposes of (1) securing delivery of B-shares to the ESOP-participants 2022 when exercising their Options  and (2) securing and covering costs that may be triggered by ESOP 2022 (e.g.  social security charges and taxes)  that the annual general meeting resolves on (i) a directed issue of warrants in accordance with the below terms  and (ii) transfer of warrants to ESOP-participants (or a third party) or to cover social security costs and taxes under ESOP 2022 in accordance with the below terms and conditions. Issue of warrants The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants in accordance with the below: Warrants shall be issued in series 2022/2026  comprising a maximum of 16 891 002 warrants for ESOP 2022 (in total  a maximum of 20 031 166 warrants of series 2022/2026 shall be issued which also includes warrants for LTIP 2022 (as defined below))  of which each warrant entitles to subscription for one (1) B-share in the company. Entitled to subscribe for the warrants is - with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right - the company itself. The reason for deviating from the shareholders' preferential right is to secure delivery of B-shares to the participants of ESOP 2022 (and of LTIP 2022)  and secure and cover costs that may be triggered by ESOP 2022 (and by LTIP 2022) for the purposes of enabling the company to establish and implement and ESOP 2022 (and LTIP 2022). The warrants shall be issued without consideration. Subscription for the warrants shall be made on a separate subscription list on 30 June 2022 at the latest. The board of directors may prolong the subscription period. There may be no over-subscription. The subscription price for each B-share upon subscription of B-shares by exercise of the warrants shall be equal to the quota value of the B-share at the time of subscription of the B-share. The share capital may following exercise of warrants be increased with a maximum of SEK 8 445.501 (based on the number of warrants of series 2022/2026 which are being issued for ESOP 2022). Subscription for B-shares by exercise of warrants can be made during the subscription period from and including 1 January 2023 up to and including 30 June 2026 . The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are set out in ""Terms and conditions for warrants of series 2022/2026 regarding subscription for B-shares in Storskogen Group AB (publ) "". Shares which are issued after subscription will entitle to dividends for the first time at the record date for dividends occurring immediately thereafter. A transcript of the company's articles of association is held available at the company's office. Transfer of warrants The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting approves: The transfer of not more than 13 848 406 warrants to participants in ESOP 2022 (or a designated third party) in connection with the delivery of B-shares to participants in ESOP 2022. Transfers of not more than 3 042 596 warrants to cover social security costs and taxes under ESOP 2022. Estimated costs for ESOP 2022 The costs for ESOP 2022 are based on the IFRS 2 reporting standards and will be amortised over the period during which the Options are earned. The board of directors has made a preliminary cost calculation for ESOP 2022  which is based on an Exercise Price of SEK 25.00   that the maximum number of Options is vested following the Vesting Period and that each ESOP-participant exercises a maximum number of Options. On the basis of the above assumptions  the preliminary value of each Option has  using the Black and Scholes method  been set at SEK 5.02 . The value of the Options has been calculated on the basis of a share price of SEK 25.00 at the establishment of ESOP 2022 and an estimate of the future volatility of the company's B-share of 30 per cent. Based on the assumptions set forth above  the total costs for ESOP 2022 are estimated amount to approximately SEK 69 million   excluding costs for social security charges. The costs for social security charges on the basis of an annual total shareholder return of the company's B-share of 26 per cent until the time for allocation (which corresponds to a total shareholder return of approximately 100 per cent during the Vesting period) is approximately SEK 76 million . Based on the same assumptions as above  but provided that 50 per cent of the number of Options are vested following the Vesting Period and that each ESOP-participant exercises the maximum number of vested Options  the expected costs for ESOP 2022 amount to approximately SEK 35 million   excluding costs for social security charges. The costs for social security charges are estimated to approximately SEK 29 million   based on an annual total shareholder return of Storskogen's B-share of approximately 21 per cent (which corresponds to a total shareholder return of 75 per cent during the Vesting Period). Effects on key ratios The group's operating profit for the financial year 2021 amounted to approximately SEK 1 406 million (approximately SEK 774 million for the financial year 2020). The estimated costs for ESOP 2022 of approximately SEK 145 million in accordance with the above  correspond to approximately 10 per cent of the group's operating profit for the financial year 2021. The group's equity as of 31 December 2021 amounted to approximately SEK 16 588 million . The cost for ESOP 2022 of approximately SEK 145 million correspond to approximately 0.9 per cent of the equity. The estimated costs for ESOP 2022 of approximately SEK 63 million   at 50 per cent of the number of Options vested according to the above  correspond to approximately 4 per cent of the group's operating profit for the financial year 2021. The estimated costs for ESOP 2022 of approximately SEK 63 million correspond to approximately 0.4 per cent of the equity  according to the above. Dilution effect For the purpose of ensuring delivery of B-shares upon exercise of the options and hedging social security costs under ESOP 2022  the company will issue not more than 16 891 002 warrants without consideration to the company itself. At the end of the Exercise Period  some of the warrants will be converted into B-shares and transferred to ESOP-participants that have exercised their Options. Assuming full vesting  the increase in the company's share capital will not amount to more than SEK 8 445.501 . If all Options are exercised  the total number of B-shares under ESOP 2022 will amount to not more than 16 891 002. If all Options are exercised  there will consequently be a dilution effect for the company's current shareholders of approximately 1.0 per cent of the total number of shares and approximately 0.6 per cent of the total number of votes in the company. Full allotment under both LTIP 2022 and ESOP 2022  would mean that the total number of B-shares under both programmes amount to not more than 20 031 166. In the event of full allotment under both programmes  there will consequently be a dilution effect for the company's current shareholders of approximately 1.2 per cent of the total number of shares and approximately 0.7 per cent of the total number of votes in the company. Preparation of the proposal The proposal on ESOP 2022 has been prepared by the board of directors' remuneration committee and has been resolved by the board of directors of the company. Alexander Murad Bjärgård is an employee of the company and it is proposed that he be offered to participate in ESOP 2022 in his role as a management person. Alexander Murad Bjärgård has not participated in the preparation of the proposal or in the board of directors' resolution regarding the proposal. Majority requirement A resolution to approve this proposal under item 11 is valid only where supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths of both the shares voted for and of the shares represented at the meeting. Outstanding share related incentive programmes For information about other share related incentive programmes in the company  please refer to the company's annual report for 2021 under ""Principles for remuneration to the board and group management - Incentive programme"". Principal terms of the programmes are also available on the company's website (www.storskogen.com). Other than as described therein  there are no other share related incentive programmes in the company. Authorisation The board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  is authorised to undertake such minor adjustments in the resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear and shall have the right to undertake such minor adjustments to the resolution that are required pursuant to applicable foreign rules and laws. Resolution on implementation of a share savings programme etc.  item 12 The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to establish a share savings program  also known as Long Term Incentive Programme 2022 (""LTIP 2022"") directed to certain employees of the group. The purpose of LTIP 2022 is to encourage a broad shareholding amongst the group's employees  maintain competent employees  facilitate recruitment  increase the alignment of interest between the employees and the company's shareholders  encourage the company's long-term growth and increase motivation to reach or exceed the company's financial targets. The board of directors proposes that LTIP 2022 is established in accordance with the following principal terms and conditions. LTIP 2022 is directed to up to 176 full-time employed key employees of the group (the ""LTIP-participants""). Participation in LTIP 2022 requires the LTIP-participants to either (i) make own investments in the company's shares of series B (""B-shares"") at market price at Nasdaq Stockholm  or (ii) allocate B-shares already held by the LTIP-participant to LTIP 2022 that have not previously been allocated as savings shares under LTIP 2021 (""Savings Shares""). Each LTIP-participant can  as a maximum  allocate such number of Savings Shares as set out in this proposal. The board of directors may  however  set the limit to a lower number than as set out below for certain LTIP-participants. Acquisitions of Savings Shares must be made not later than on 15 July 2022 if the LTIP-participant is offered to participate in LTIP 2022 in May 2022 and not later than 15 December 2022 if the LTIP-participant is offered to participate in LTIP 2022 in November 2022 . If applicable insider rules and regulations prevent an LTIP-participant from acquiring Savings Shares in the company during the period  the board of directors has the right to postpone the last day of investment for such LTIP-participant. If the LTIP-participant chooses to allocate already held B-shares as Savings Shares  this must be done not later than the date of acquisition stated above. Subject to: the LTIP-participant (i) not disposing of its Saving Shares during the period commencing on 10 June 2022 if the LTIP-participant is offered to participate in LTIP 2022 in May 2022   alternatively not disposing of its Saving Shares during the period commencing on 30 November 2022 if the LTIP-participant is offered to participate in LTIP 2022 in November 2022   and ending on the date which occurs three (3) years thereafter (the ""Retention Period"") and (ii) not later than 15 July 2022 have proven that it holds the correct number of Savings Shares if the LTIP-participant was offered to participate in LTIP 2022 in May 2022   alternatively ; not later than 15 December 2022 have proven that it holds the correct number of Savings Shares if the LTIP-participant was offered to participate in LTIP 2022 in November 2022   the LTIP-participant's continued employment within the group during the Retention Period (under certain conditions  the LTIP-participant may have a right to some of the Performance Shares (as defined below) even if the employment has been terminated before the end of the Vesting Period and the board of directors shall furthermore be authorised to waive the employment condition under extraordinary circumstances  for example  if the LTIP-participant's employment is terminated as a result of long-term illness); and subject to the performance criteria set out below are satisfied  each Saving Share will entitle the LTIP-participant to an additional two to three B-shares in the company (""Performance Shares"")  in each case free of charge. The Performance Shares are subject to the following two performance criteria during the Retention Period  of which each performance criterion can result in a maximum allocation of 50 per cent of the total number of Performance Shares: The first performance criterion is based on the total shareholder return in the company (that is  the sum of the price change and reinvested dividends for the B-share) during the period commencing on 31 May 2022 if the LTIP-participant is offered to participate in LTIP 2022 in May 2022 and the period commencing on 18 November 2022 if the LTIP-participant is offered to participate in LTIP 2022 in November 2022 and ending on the last day of each respective Vesting Period (the ""TSR Period""). If the total shareholder return in the company during the TSR Period is: 50 per cent or less  the LTIP-participants will not be entitled to any Performance Shares; 100 per cent or higher  50 per cent of the maximum number of Performance Shares will be allocated to the LTIP-participants; and higher than 50 per cent but lower than 100 per cent  the allocation of Performance Shares to the LTIP-participants will be linear in relation to the allocation set out in (i) and (ii) above. If the LTIP-participant is offered to participate in LTIP 2022 in May 2022   the second performance criterion is based on the increase in adjusted EBITA for the last twelve months as stated in the financial report for the period 1 January- 31 March 2025 in comparison with the adjusted EBITA for the last twelve months stated in the financial report for the period 1 January- 31 March 2022 . If the LTIP-participant is offered to participate in LTIP 2022 in November 2022   the second performance criterion is based on the increase in adjusted EBITA for the last twelve months as stated in the financial report for the period 1 January- 30 September 2025 in comparison with the adjusted EBITA for the last twelve months stated in the financial report for the period 1 January- 30 September 2022 . If the adjusted EBITA from 2022 to 2025 for the relevant period has: decreased or increased by 50 per cent or less  the LTIP-participants will not be entitled to any Performance Shares; increased by 100 per cent or more than 100 per cent  50 per cent of the maximum number of Performance Shares will be allocated to the LTIP-participants; and increased by more than 50 per cent  but the increase is less than 100 per cent  the allocation of Performance Shares to the LTIP-participants will be linear in relation to the allocation set out in (i) and (ii) above. In aggregate  a maximum of 2 433 904 Performance Shares may be allotted to the LTIP-participants. The maximum number of Performance Shares that an LTIP-participant will be entitled to receive for each Saving Share and the possible investment in Savings Shares depends on which category such LTIP-participant belongs to: Category Maximum # LTIP-participants in each category Maximum # of Performance Shares per Savings Share Maximum # of Savings Shares per LTIP-participant in each category CEO and other key employees in business units/subsidiaries with an EBITA of SEK 20 million or more during 2021 88 3 11 520 CEO and other key employees in business units/subsidiaries with an EBITA of less than SEK 20 million during 2021 88 2 9 536 The number of Performance Shares to be allotted (if any) may be re-calculated by the board of directors in the event of share issues  share splits  reversed share splits  dividends in-kind or similar events. If significant changes occur in the company or in the market  or in the event the costs for LTIP 2022 significantly exceed the estimated costs  and this  in the opinion of the board of directors  results in a situation where the conditions for allotment of Performance Shares become unreasonable  the board of directors is entitled to make adjustments to LTIP 2022  including  among other things  to resolve on a reduced allotment of Performance Shares  or to not allot any Performance Shares at all. Participation in LTIP 2022 requires that it is permitted and appropriate with regard to applicable laws and regulations in the jurisdiction in which the relevant LTIP-participant is resident and that the board of directors deems it feasible at reasonable administrative and financial costs. In the event delivery of Performance Shares to an LTIP-participant cannot take place under applicable law or at reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative effort  the company may pay a part of or the entire allotment to such LTIP-participant in cash instead of with B-shares. The company may also retain allotted Performance Shares and settle a part of the allotment in cash in order to facilitate the payment of the LTIP-participants' tax liabilities. The board of directors is responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2022. Accordingly  the board of directors is to prepare and execute any necessary agreements and otherwise manage and administer LTIP 2022. Issue and transfer of warrants The board of directors proposes  for the purposes of (1) securing delivery of B-shares to the participants of LTIP 2022 at exercise of the Performance Share rights  and (2) securing and covering costs that may be triggered by LTIP 2022 (e.g.  social security charges and taxes)  that the annual general meeting resolves on (x) a directed issue of warrants in accordance with the below terms  and (y) transfer of warrants to LTIP-participants (or a third party) or to cover social security costs and taxes under LTIP 2022 in accordance with the below terms and conditions. Issue of warrants The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants in accordance with the below: Warrants shall be issued in series 2022/2026  comprising a maximum of 3 140 164 warrants for LTIP 2022 (in total  a maximum of 20 031 166 warrants of series 2022/2026 shall be issued which also includes warrants for ESOP 2022)  of which each warrant entitles to subscription for one (1) B-share in the company. Entitled to subscribe for the warrants is - with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right - the company itself. The reason for deviating from the shareholders' preferential right is to secure delivery of shares to the participants of LTIP 2022 (and of ESOP 2022)  and secure and cover costs that may be triggered by the LTIP 2022 (and by ESOP 2022) for the purposes of enabling the company to establish and implement LTIP 2022 (and ESOP 2022). The warrants shall be issued without consideration. Subscription for the warrants shall be made on a separate subscription list on 30 June 2022 at the latest. The board of directors may prolong the subscription period. There may be no over-subscription. The subscription price for each B-share upon subscription of B-shares by exercise of the warrants shall be equal to the quota value of the B-share at the time of subscription of the B-shares. The share capital may following subscription of B-shares by exercise of warrants be increased with a maximum of SEK 1 570.082 (based on the number of warrants of series 2022/2026 which are being issued for LTIP 2022). Subscription for B-shares by exercise of warrants can be made during the subscription period from and including 1 January 2023 up to and including 30 June 2026 . The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are set out in ""Terms and conditions for warrants of series 2022/2026 regarding subscription for B-shares in Storskogen Group AB (publ) "". Shares which are issued after subscription will entitle to dividends for the first time at the record date for dividends occurring immediately thereafter. A transcript of the company's articles of association is held available at the company's office. Transfer of warrants The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting approves: The transfer of not more than 2 433 904 warrants to participants in the LTIP 2022 (or a designated third party) in connection with the delivery of Performance Shares to participants in LTIP 2022. Transfers of not more than 706 260 warrants to cover social security costs and taxes under LTIP 2022. Estimated costs for LTIP 2022 The cost for LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 and will be amortised over the period during which the Performance Shares are earned  and the company's total cost for LTIP 2022 is not expected to exceed approximately SEK 72 million   assuming that 100 per cent of the maximum number of Performance Shares is allotted to the LTIP-participants and that the share price increase with a maximum of 100 per cent. Of these total costs  outgoing social security charges are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 35 million assuming a share price increase of 100 per cent during the vesting period of LTIP 2022 and approximately 29 per cent estimated average social security costs. Based on the same assumptions as above  but instead that 50 per cent of the maximum number of Performance Shares are allotted to LTIP-participants and that the share price increases with a maximum of 75 per cent  Storskogen's total cost for LTIP 2022 is not expected to exceed approximately SEK 37 million . Of these total costs  social security charges are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 15 million . Effects on key ratios The group's operating profit for the financial year 2021 amounted to approximately SEK 1 406 million (approximately SEK 774 million for the financial year 2020). The estimated costs for LTIP 2022 of approximately SEK 72 million in accordance with the first example above  correspond to approximately 5 per cent of the group's operating profit for the financial year 2021. The estimated costs for the share savings programme of SEK 37 million in accordance with the second example above  correspond to approximately 3 per cent of the operating profit for the financial year 2021. The group's equity as of 31 December 2021 amounted to approximately SEK 16 588 million . The estimated costs of LTIP 2022 of SEK 72 and 37 million  respectively  correspond to approximately 0.4 and 0.2 per cent of the equity  respectively. Dilution effect For the purpose of ensuring delivery of Performance Shares and hedging social security costs under LTIP 2022  the company will issue not more than 3 140 164 warrants without consideration to the company itself. At the end of the Retention Period  some of the warrants will be converted into B-shares and transferred to LTIP-participants that have been granted allotment. Assuming full allotment  the increase in the company's share capital will not amount to more than SEK 1 570.082 . Full allotment of Performance Shares would mean that the total number of shares under the programme will amount to not more than 3 140 164 B-shares. In the event of full allotment  there consequently will be a dilution effect for the company's current shareholders of approximately 0.2 per cent of the total number of shares and approximately 0.1 per cent of the total number of votes in the company. Full allotment under both LTIP 2022 and ESOP 2022 would mean that the total number of B-shares under both programmes amount to not more than 20 031 166. In the event of full allotment under both programmes  there will consequently be a dilution effect for the company's current shareholders of approximately 1.2 per cent of the total number of shares and approximately 0.7 per cent of the total number of votes in the company. Preparation of the proposal The proposal on LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the board of directors' remuneration committee and has been resolved by the board of directors of the company. Majority requirement A resolution to approve this proposal under item 12 is valid only where supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths of both the shares voted for and of the shares represented at the meeting. Outstanding share related incentive programmes For information about other share related incentive programmes in the company  please refer to the company's annual report for 2021 under ""Principles for remuneration to the board and group management - Incentive programme"". Principal terms of the programmes are also available on the company's website (www.storskogen.com). Other than as described therein  there are no other share related incentive programmes in the company. Authorisation The board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  is authorised to undertake such minor adjustments in the resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear and shall have the right to undertake such minor adjustments to the resolution that are required pursuant to applicable foreign rules and laws. Resolution on (a) a reduction of the share capital with redemption of 16 848 061 shares of series B and (b) a bonus issue  items 13(a)-(b) Background of the board of directors' proposal In connection with the admission to trading of the company's shares of series B on Nasdaq Stockholm  the company granted a so-called overallotment option to Carnegie Investment Bank AB (publ) (""Carnegie"")  J.P. Morgan Securities plc and Goldman Sachs Bank Europe SE (together  the ""Managers"")  which entitled the Managers  not later than 30 days from the first day of trading in the company's shares of series B on Nasdaq Stockholm  to acquire up to 52 205 241 shares of series B in the company to cover any overallotments or short positions in connection with the admission to trading of the company's shares of series B on Nasdaq Stockholm. In order to facilitate the overallotment option  the company issued 52 205 241 shares of series B to Carnegie  of which 35 357 180 shares of series B were exercised by the Managers under the overallotment option and the remaining 16 848 061 shares of series B were transferred back to the company by Carnegie without consideration. The board of directors now proposes that these 16 848 061 shares of series B shall be redeemed. Resolution on a reduction of the share capital with redemption of 16 848 061 shares of series B  item 13(a) The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a reduction of the share capital with redemption of shares on the following terms and conditions. The share capital is to be reduced by not more than SEK 8 424.0305 . The reduction of the share capital is to be effected with redemption of the 16 848 061 shares of series B that are held by the company. The purpose of the reduction is allocation to unrestricted shareholders' equity. The company may implement the resolution to reduce the share capital without authorisation from the Swedish Companies Registration Office since the company simultaneously carries out a bonus issue that increases the company's restricted shareholders' equity and share capital by SEK 16 600.734330 (see item 13(b) of the agenda). Combined  the actions under this item 13(a) and the bonus issue under item 13(b) of the agenda entail that neither the company's restricted shareholders' equity nor its share capital is reduced. Resolution on a bonus issue  item 13(b) The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a bonus issue on the following terms and conditions. The share capital is to be increased by SEK 16 600.734330 . No new shares are to be issued in connection with the increase of the share capital. The amount by which the share capital is to be increased shall be transferred to the share capital from unrestricted shareholders' equity. The purpose of the bonus issue is to restore the company's restricted equity and share capital after the proposed reduction of the share capital pursuant to item 13(a) of the agenda as well as to  in connection therewith  achieve a quotient value of the shares with a limited number of decimals. Majority requirements etc. The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting's resolutions pursuant to items 13(a)-(b) on the agenda shall be adopted as a joint resolution. Accordingly  the resolution is only valid where supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds of the votes cast and the shares represented at the annual general meeting. Resolution on an authorisation for the board of directors to resolve on issuances of shares of series B  warrants that may be exercised for subscription of shares of series B and/or convertibles that may be converted to shares of series B  item 14 The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorises the board of directors to  at one or several occasions during the period up until the next annual general meeting  resolve upon the issuance of shares of series B  convertibles that can be converted to shares of series B and/or warrants that can be exercised for subscription of shares of series B. Subscribed shares  convertibles or warrants shall be paid for in cash  by set-off or in-kind. The authorisation shall be limited so that the board of directors may not resolve upon issues of shares  convertibles of warrants that entail that the total number of shares that are issued  issued through conversion of convertibles or issued through exercise of warrants exceeds 10 per cent of the total number of shares of series B in the company at the time the board of directors exercises the authorisation for the first time. If the board of directors resolves on the issuance of shares  convertibles and/or warrants with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason for the deviation shall be to use shares as consideration (including earn-out consideration) in connection with  or as financing of  acquisitions of companies or businesses or for the company's operations in general. Majority requirements etc. A resolution pursuant to this item 14 is only valid where supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds of the votes cast and the shares represented at the annual general meeting. Resolution on an authorisation for the board of directors to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of treasury shares of series B  item 15 The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorises the board of directors to  at one or several occasions during the period up until the next annual general meeting  resolve upon acquisitions and transfers of shares of series B in the company on the following terms. Acquisitions may be made of a maximum of so many shares that the company's holding of treasury shares  following the acquisition  does not exceed ten per cent of all shares in the company.

Payment for treasury shares that are transferred may be made in cash  in-kind or by set-off. Transfers of treasury shares may be made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The reason for an acquisition or a transfer of treasury shares  and the reason for any transfer with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  shall be to: (a) optimise the company's capital structure or (b) use shares as consideration (including earn-out consideration) in connection with  or as financing of  acquisitions of companies or businesses.

The nomination committee's proposal on principles for appointment of a nomination committee (item 15) The nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting shall resolve on principles for appointment of a nomination committee for the annual general meeting 2023 in accordance with the below. The nomination committee shall be composed of the chairman of the board of directors together with one representative of each of the three largest shareholders  based on ownership in the company as of the expiry of the third quarter of the financial year. Should any of the three largest shareholders renounce its right to appoint one representative to the nomination committee  such right shall transfer to the shareholder who then in turn  after these three  is the largest shareholder in the company. The chairman of the board of directors shall convene the nomination committee. The member representing the largest shareholder shall be appointed chairman of the nomination committee  unless the nomination committee unanimously appoints someone else. Should a shareholder having appointed a representative to the nomination committee no longer be among the three largest shareholders  three months before the annual general meeting at the latest  the representative appointed by such shareholder shall resign and the shareholder who is then among the three largest shareholders shall have the right to appoint one representative to the nomination committee. However  unless there are special reasons otherwise  the already established composition of the nomination committee shall remain unchanged in case such change in the ownership is only marginal or occurs during the three-month period prior to the annual general meeting. Where a shareholder has become one of the three largest shareholders due to a material change in the ownership at a point in time falling later than three months before the annual general meeting  such shareholder shall in any event have the right to take part of the work of the nomination committee and participate in its meetings. Should a member resign from the nomination committee before his or her work is completed  the shareholder who has appointed such member shall appoint a new member  unless that shareholder is no longer one of the three largest shareholders  in which case the largest shareholder in turn shall appoint the substitute member. A shareholder who has appointed a representative to the nomination committee shall have the right to discharge such representative and appoint a new representative. Changes to the composition of the nomination committee shall be announced immediately. The term of office for the nomination committee ends when the next nomination committee has been appointed. On the nomination committee's meetings  it shall carry out the nomination committee's duties as set out in the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance. The board of directors' resolution proposals Election of one or two persons who shall approve the minutes of the meeting (item 2) Bertil Villard   or the person appointed by the board of directors if he has an impediment to attend  is proposed to be elected to approve the minutes together with the chairman. The task of approving the minutes also includes verifying the voting list and that the advance votes received are correctly stated in the minutes of the annual general meeting. Preparation and approval of the voting list (item 3) The voting list proposed for approval under item 3 of the agenda is the voting list drawn up by the company  based on the general meeting's share register and advance votes received  as verified and recommended by the person approving the minutes. Proposal regarding allocation of the company's profits or losses in accordance with the adopted balance sheet (item 8) The board of directors proposes that no dividends shall be paid for the financial year 2021 and that the company's results shall be carried forward. The board of directors' proposal on authorisation for the board of directors to resolve to issue shares and/or warrants and/or convertibles without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights (item 16) The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorises the board of directors to resolve to issue new shares and/or warrants and/or convertibles on one or several occasions until the next annual general meeting  without preferential rights for the shareholders  against cash payment or against payment through set-off or in kind  or otherwise on special conditions. The number of shares that may be issued and the number of shares that shall be possible to subscribe/convert may amount to the number of shares allowed by the articles of association  as amended from time to time. The purpose of the authorisation is to increase the financial flexibility of the company and the acting scope of the board of directors. The board of directors or the CEO shall have the right to make such minor adjustments in this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the authorisation with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The board of directors' proposal on authorisation for the board of directors to resolve upon issue of shares with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights (item 17) The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorises the board to resolve - at one or several occasions and for the time period until the next annual general meeting - to increase the company's share capital by new share issues  to the extent that it corresponds to a dilution of not more than 20 percent of the number of shares outstanding at the time of the notice of the annual general meeting  after full exercise of the hereby proposed authorisation. New share issues may be made with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions. Pursuant to Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act  the board of directors may not by virtue of this authorisation resolve on issues to board members in group companies  employees  etc. The purpose of the authorisation is to increase the financial flexibility of the company and the acting scope of the board. Should the board of directors resolve on an issue with deviation from the shareholder's preferential rights  the reason shall be to enable the company to finance the operations in a fast and efficient way  acquire companies  businesses or parts thereof and to enable a broadening of the ownership of the company. Upon such deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the new issue shall be made at market terms and conditions. The board of directors or the CEO shall have the right to make such minor adjustments in this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the authorisation with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The board of directors' proposal on amendments to the articles of association (item 18) The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolve on the adaption of new articles of association. The proposed amendments are as follows: 4 § Share capital Current wording: The share capital shall be not less than SEK 20 000 000 and not more than SEK 80 000 000 . Proposed wording: The share capital shall be not less than SEK 55 000 000 and not more than SEK 220 000 000 . 5 § Number of shares Current wording: The number of shares shall be not less than 40 000 000 and not more than 160 000 000. Proposed wording: The number of shares shall be not less than 110 000 000 and not more than 440 000 000 The board of directors' proposal to resolve on a long-term incentive program for the executive management in the form of warrants (item 19) The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 750 000 warrants within the scope of a long-term incentive program to the CEO and the other members of the executive management in Azelio  in total six persons. The incentive program entails that the CEO is offered to subscribe for not more than 250 000 warrants  and the other participants are each offered to subscribe for not more than 100 000 warrants  at market value calculated according to the Black & Scholes valuation formula. Subscription of the warrants shall be made within four weeks from the date of the resolution to issue warrants. Payment for the subscribed warrants shall be made within four weeks after subscription. The board of directors is entitled to extend the subscription period and time of payment. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share in Azelio for an exercise price of SEK 50 . Subscription of shares can be done during two periods  both during two weeks from the day of publication of the interim report for the period 1 January - 31 March 2025 as well as during two weeks from the day of publication of the interim report for the period 1 January - 30 June 2025 . The price per warrant upon transfer to the participants shall be established by the company  or by an independent appraiser or auditor firm retained by the company  and correspond to the market value of the warrant calculated in accordance with the Black & Scholes valuation formula. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants have been resolved by the board of directors and are available to the shareholders in accordance with the below. Scope and costs for the program  including subsidy by the company and effect on important key ratios and dilution Azelio shall partly subsidize the option premium to be paid by the participants for the subscription of warrants  in order to facilitate and promote a personal long-term interest in Azelio for senior executives. The subsidy shall  for the majority of participants  correspond to 50 percent of the option premium  post tax in the form of an additional cash payment. For two participants  the CEO and one other member of the executive management  the subsidy correspond to 75 percent of the option premium  post tax in the form of an additional cash payment. The company's cost for the subsidy (including social security contributions in relation hereto) is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 650 000   in total  based on a price of the company's shares of SEK 12 . Other than the above  the costs for the program include certain limited costs for administration of the program. The total cost  including the cost for the subsidy  for Azelio for the warrant program is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 750 000 during the term of the incentive program. According to a preliminary valuation  the market value of the warrants will correspond to approximately SEK 0.47 per warrant (assuming a price of the company's shares of SEK 12 per share) based on the Black & Scholes valuation formulae. In addition to this  the costs for the program have been estimated on the basis that all participants subscribe for their maximum allotment as set out above. The costs are expected to have a limited effect on Azelio's key ratios. Upon maximum allotment of warrants  not more than 750 000 shares will be allotted to participants under the incentive program  meaning a dilution effect of approximately 0.7 percent of the number of shares and votes in the company (based on the total number of shares in the company at the date of this notice). The board of directors considers the positive effects expected to result from the incentive program to outweigh the costs attributable to the program. The rationale for the incentive program The rationale for the incentive program is to retain a competent executive management team in the company by offering the members a long-term ownership commitment in the company and thereby the opportunity to participate in and promote a positive value development of the company's shares and to increase the member's sense of association with the company and its other shareholders. The board of directors considers that the implementation of the incentive program as described above is in the favour of the group and the shareholders in the company. Preparation of the proposal The incentive program has been prepared by the board of directors together with advisors. Other incentive programs For a description of Azelio's other share-related incentive programs  reference is made to the annual report 2021  note 25. The shareholders' resolution proposal The principal shareholder's proposal to resolve on a long-term incentive program for the board of directors in the form of warrants (item 20) The principal shareholder  Blue Marlin AB (the ""Principal Shareholder"")  proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 350 000 warrants within the scope of a long-term incentive program to all members of the board of directors in Azelio  save for Kent Janér  in total a maximum of six persons. The incentive program entails that the chairman of the board of directors is offered to subscribe for not more than 100 000 warrants and the five other participating members of the board of directors are each offered to subscribe for not more than 50 000 warrants  at market value calculated according to the Black & Scholes valuation formula. Subscription of the warrants shall be made within four weeks from the date of the resolution to issue warrants. Payment for the subscribed warrants shall be made within four weeks after subscription. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share in Azelio for an exercise price of SEK 70 . Subscription of shares can be done during two periods  both during two weeks from the day of publication of the interim report for the period 1 January - 31 March 2026 as well as during two weeks from the day of publication of the interim report for the period 1 January - 30 June 2026 . The price per warrant upon transfer to the participants shall be established by the Principal Shareholder  or by an independent appraiser or auditor firm retained by the Principal Shareholder  and correspond to the market value of the warrant calculated in accordance with the Black & Scholes valuation formula. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are available to the shareholders in accordance with the below. Scope and costs for the program  including subsidy by the company and effect on important key ratios and dilution As the offering of warrants to the members of the board of directors is based on market value the costs for the program are limited to costs for administration of the program. The total cost for Azelio for the warrant program is estimated not to exceed SEK 50 000 during the term of the incentive program. The costs are expected to have a limited effect on Azelio's key ratios. Upon maximum allotment of warrants  not more than 350 000 shares will be allotted to participants under the incentive program  meaning a dilution effect of approximately 0.3 percent of the number of shares and votes in the company (based on the total number of shares in the company at the date of this notice). The Principal Shareholder considers the positive effects expected to result from the incentive program to outweigh the costs attributable to the program. The rationale for the incentive program The rationale for the incentive program is to retain a competent board of directors in the company by offering the board members a long-term ownership commitment in the company and thereby the opportunity to participate in and promote a positive value development of the company's shares and to increase the board members' sense of association with the company. The Principal Shareholder considers that the implementation of the incentive program as described above is in the favour of the group and the shareholders in the company.

Acquisition of Matching Shares shall be made through the company on Nasdaq Stockholm within twenty trading days from the date falling three years after the acquisition of Savings Shares.In order to ensure that the participant's financial situation as far as possible shall remain unchanged  the number of Matching Shares shall be subject to customary recalculation should the company's share capital increase or decrease  convertible debt instruments or options be issued or the company be liquidated or merged  or any similar changes to the company occur.Should the participant be prohibited from acquiring Savings Shares due to possession of inside information  the Board of Directors may in individual cases prolong or postpone the above mentioned investment period  although not beyond the next AGM. The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed conditions and the administration of the Share Savings Program 2022 within the terms and conditions set forth above  and may also make such minor adjustments and applications as may be appropriate for legal or administrative reasons.Based on the assumptions of maximum outcome in the variable cash remuneration program  full investments by the entitled participants and an unchanged share price at the time of delivery of the Matching Shares  Eolus' costs relating to the Share Savings Program 2022 are estimated to amount to a maximum of SEK 2 2 million. Assuming a 25 per cent increase in Eolus' share price at the time of delivery of Matching Shares  Eolus' costs relating to the Share Savings Program 2022  including employer contributions  are estimated to amount to a maximum of SEK 2 8 million and assuming a 50 per cent increase in the share price at such time  the costs are estimated to amount to a maximum of SEK 3 3 million  including employer contributions. The Share Savings Program 2022 does not result in any dilution of the holdings of the company's shareholders and is not deemed to affect any performance measure important for Eolus. No measures have been taken to hedge Eolus' costs against its own share price in connection with the purchase of Matching shares.The proposal on Share Savings Program 2022 has been prepared by the Board of Directors and the Remuneration Committee. In the company  similar share savings programs for the financial years 2021  2019/2020 and 2018/2019 relating to the variable cash remuneration have previously been adopted. By requiring  as described above  that the participants make an own investment in Eolus shares and thereby reconciling the employees' and the shareholders' interests of a long-term increase of the company's value  the Share Savings Program 2022 is expected to enhance Eolus' possibilities to recruit and retain competent employees while at the same time promoting Eolus' business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability.The proposal must be supported by shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast at the general meeting.Available documentationThe following documentation will be held available at the company and on the company's website at least three weeks ahead of the AGM. The documentation will also be sent  without any cost for the recipients  to shareholders who so request and provide their address or e-mail address: (i) the accounting material and the auditor's report  (ii)  the statement by the auditor on the compliance of the resolved guidelines for remuneration to senior executives  (iii) remuneration report  (iv) the complete proposal of the Board of Directors with respect to appropriation of profit and the Board of Directors' motivated statement thereon  and (v) the complete proposal of the Board of Directors with respect to the long-term share savings program.Number of shares and votes in the companyAt the time of issue of this convening notice  the total number of shares in the company amounts to 24 907 000  of which 1 285 625 shares are Class A shares and 23 621 375 shares are Class B shares.

2637,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.natlawreview.com/article/russian-sanctions-how-will-they-impact-credit-default-swaps,Russian Sanctions: How Will They Impact Credit Default Swaps?,Economic sanctions against Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine have had a broad impact on the global economy and have raised the question of whether Russia will be able to meet its obligatio,Monday  April 11  2022Economic sanctions against Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine have had a broad impact on the global economy and have raised the question of whether Russia will be able to meet its obligations on foreign denominated bonds. If Russia defaults on its bonds  credit default swaps meant to protect investors from a Russian default may not work as planned because of these sanctions.At the end of last year  Russia had $40 billion in foreign currency sovereign debt  half of which is owed to foreign investors. While U.S. sanctions allow for Russia to continue to make debt payments at least through the end of May 2022  Russian restrictions on allowing foreign exchange transactions could force a default on bonds that do not allow for payment in Rubles. On Monday  April 4  2022  the U.S. Treasury restricted U.S. banks from processing payments on Russian bonds  increasing the risk of a default.Credit default swaps are meant to help investors receive near full recovery in the event of a default on the underlying debt. Payments under credit default swaps are owed to the purchaser of the credit default swap when a “Credit Event” has occurred. Credit Events include: a failure to make a payment under the debt (following any applicable grace period)  insolvency of the issuer  debt restructuring and repudiation of the debt. There are approximately $4.5 billion in credit default swaps tied to Russian government debt and another $1.5 billion in derivative indices  according to JPMorgan.Escalating western sanctions against Russia have raised questions about whether Russia will be able to meet its obligations under its sovereign debt  whether credit default swaps will be triggered if Russia does not meet the terms of its obligations and whether sanctions will interfere with the settlement of credit default swaps if a Credit Event is triggered.Will credit default swaps be triggered if Russia does not meet the terms of its obligations?Russia’s decision in March to pay some of its foreign debtors in Rubles could have triggered a Credit Event. ISDA’s Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee (the “DC”) applies the terms of market-standard credit derivatives to specific cases  and makes a factual determination as to whether a Credit Event or other events under a credit default swap have occurred and other issues. The DC determined that payment of obligations in Rubles  when not the original currency of denomination of the debt  would not constitute a Credit Event where the underlying debt allows for payment in Rubles. However  certain of Russia’s bonds do not provide for payment in Rubles. A failure by Russia to make a payment under the terms of the bonds (whether by failing to make a payment entirely  or by making a payment in Rubles when not permitted under the terms of the debt) would most likely constitute a Credit Event  triggering credit default swaps referencing Russian debt.For the time being  Russia has avoided defaulting on its foreign currency debt  making $732 million in coupon payments on US Dollar denominated bonds in the month of March 2022. Russia owed approximately $2 billion on a bond that came due on Monday  April 4  2022  and owes another $84 million in interest payments on a second bond. The recent U.S. Treasury restrictions on U.S. banks processing Russian government debt effectively blocked the payment on both bonds. A failure by the Russian government to find another way to make the payments within the thirty day grace period provided for in the bonds would likely constitute a default under the bonds and trigger a Credit Event under credit default swaps referencing Russian sovereign debt.What debt will be “deliverable” under credit default swaps?The settlement of a credit default swap requires the delivery (for physical settlement) or pricing (for cash settlement) of debt that meets certain characteristics  including Not Domestic Currency (i.e.  payable in a currency other than the Ruble)  Not Domestic Law (i.e.  governed by non-Russian law) and Not Domestic Issuance (i.e.  not issued primarily in the Russian market). Additionally  the obligation must be payable in a G-7 currency and transferable to institutional investors without contractual or regulatory restrictions. The DC has determined that non-Ruble denominated debt that allows for payment in Rubles will not meet the Not Domestic Currency test and therefore will not be “deliverable” for settlement under credit default swaps. Similarly  if the Russian government decides to make a payment in Rubles under G-7 denominated debt  such debt may no longer be considered “deliverable”. Additionally  on March 25  2022  ISDA published “Additional Provisions for Certain Russian Entities: Excluded Obligations and Excluded Deliverable Obligations” (the “Protocol”) which contains new terms that can be added to existing or new credit derivatives transactions. The new terms in the Protocol provide that a default under certain Russian sovereign debt (“Restricted Debt”) will not trigger a Credit Event under credit default swap transactions and exclude such debt from the definition of “deliverable” obligations. In an FAQ released in conjunction with the publication of the Protocol  ISDA noted that it would be impractical to hold a settlement auction referencing Restricted Debt.Will sanctions interfere with the settlement of credit default swaps?Sanctions could prevent certain bonds from being delivered in the event a credit default swap is triggered and/or misalign the pricing mechanism for settlement of credit default swaps. The expected recovery under credit default swaps is usually determined using an auction process based on bonds that are “deliverable” under the terms of the credit default swaps. The auction process relies on the existence of a secondary trading market for the debt. Russia has blocked offshore settlement of bonds through Euroclear which would make certain bonds  which by their terms are to settle in Russia  untradeable. Further sanctions could also impact whether other Russian bonds are tradeable and eligible to be delivered under credit default swap contracts. If fewer bonds are deemed “deliverable” under the terms of the credit default swap  the auction price is likely to be higher (as more parties bid on fewer bonds)  leading to a lower recovery for credit default swap buyers and a possible loss on the bonds that the purchase of the credit default swaps was meant to avert. One solution would be to circumvent the auction process entirely  leaving parties to the credit default swaps to agree to a cash price to close out the swap. This could potentially result in different recoveries for different market participants.Credit default swap buyers should carefully review the terms of their contracts to determine whether they will be required to physically deliver the underlying debt to receive the expected payout under the terms of their credit default swap contracts and determine whether they will be able to deliver the debt.,negative,0.02,0.45,0.54,negative,0.01,0.17,0.82,True,English,"['Credit Default Swaps', 'Russian Sanctions', 'recent U.S. Treasury restrictions', 'thirty day grace period', 'Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee', 'US Dollar denominated bonds', 'new credit derivatives transactions', 'credit default swap transactions', 'foreign currency sovereign debt', 'applicable grace period', 'U.S. banks', 'foreign exchange transactions', 'market-standard credit derivatives', 'U.S. sanctions', 'Certain Russian Entities', 'credit default swaps', 'Domestic Currency test', 'Escalating western sanctions', 'G-7 denominated debt', 'foreign denominated bonds', 'foreign currency debt', 'Russian sovereign debt', 'Ruble denominated debt', 'Russian government debt', 'Excluded Deliverable Obligations', 'Not Domestic Currency', 'Russian restrictions', 'G-7 currency', 'regulatory restrictions', 'Russian default', 'foreign debtors', 'Credit Events', 'original currency', 'Domestic Law', 'Domestic Issuance', 'Russian debt', 'Russian law', 'Russian market', 'foreign investors', 'underlying debt', 'debt restructuring', 'Restricted Debt', 'Economic sanctions', 'broad impact', 'global economy', 'last year', 'full recovery', 'derivative indices', 'specific cases', 'factual determination', 'other events', 'other issues', 'Additional Provisions', 'Russian bonds', 'new terms', 'Excluded Obligations', 'The DC', 'debt payments', 'coupon payments', 'interest payments', 'second bond', 'institutional investors', 'physical settlement', 'cash settlement', 'Monday', 'April', 'result', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'question', 'end', 'half', 'May', 'Rubles', 'processing', 'risk', 'purchaser', 'failure', 'insolvency', 'issuer', 'repudiation', 'JPMorgan', 'decision', 'March', 'ISDA', 'denomination', 'time', 'month', 'way', 'delivery', 'pricing', 'characteristics', 'contractual', 'Protocol', 'existing']",2022-04-11,2022-04-11,natlawreview.com

The guidelines shall be applicable to compensation that is agreed and amendments made to previously agreed compensation  subsequent to the adoption of the guidelines at the Annual General Meeting 2022. The guidelines do not include compensation resolved by the Annual General Meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the Company's business strategy  long-term interest and sustainabilityThe Company's business strategy is to discover new drug candidates with the help of ISP (Integrative Screening Process) and develop them into a so-called clinical ""Proof of Concept"" when clear indications of efficacy  tolerability and safety are achieved and thereafter seek partnership with international pharmaceutical companies for further development  registration and marketing.For further detailed information about the Company's business strategy please refer to the Company's annual reports and the website.The work with drug development takes a long time which means that continuity as well as low employee turnover are important. Successful implementation of the Company's business strategy and safeguarding of the Company's long-term interest  including concern for the sustainability of the business  therefore assumes that the Company is able to recruit and retain qualified employees. To achieve this  it is necessary that the Company can offer good working conditions with competitive levels of compensation. These guidelines enables the Company's executives to be offered a competitive total compensation.Forms of compensation etc.In the Company  the market compensation consists of fixed cash salary  pension benefits and other benefits. In addition and independently of these guidelines  the Annual General Meeting may resolve on  for example  share and share price-related compensation.Cash variable compensation can be paid in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made at the individual level as compensation for extraordinary work effort in addition to the person's ordinary duties. Such compensation may not be paid more than twice a year and per individual and may not exceed an amount in total corresponding to 25 percent of the fixed annual cash salary. Decision on such compensation shall be made by the board of directors on the proposal of the remuneration committee.The pension premiums for defined contribution pensions for the CEO and management group in the company vary greatly depending on  among other things  age  previous salary and employment conditions.For the CEO  pension benefits  including health insurance  must be defined-contribution. Any variable cash compensation shall not be pension-based. The pension premiums for defined-contribution pensions may amount to a maximum of 40 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.For other senior executives  pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be defined-contribution unless the executive is covered by a defined-benefit pension in accordance with mandatory collective agreement provisions. Variable cash compensation shall be pension-based to the extent it follows from mandatory collective agreement provisions that are applicable to the executive. The pension premiums for defined-contribution pensions may amount to a maximum of 40 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.Other benefits may include  among other things  life insurance  health insurance and car benefit. Such benefits may amount in total to a maximum of 10 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.Termination of employmentUpon termination of employment  the notice period may not exceed twelve months. Fixed cash salary during the notice period and severance pay may not exceed an amount in total corresponding to the fixed cash salary for two years. In the event of termination on the part of the executive  the termination period may be not exceed 18 months for the CEO and no longer than six months for the other senior executives.In addition  compensation may be paid for any undertaking to restrict competition. Such compensation shall compensate for any loss of income and shall only be paid to the extent that the previous executive is not entitled to severance pay. The compensation shall be based on the fixed cash salary at the time of termination and shall be paid during the period the undertaking regarding restriction of competition applies  which shall be no longer than six months after the termination of employment.Salary and terms of employment for employeesIn preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these compensation guidelines  salary and terms of employment for the Company's employees have been taken into consideration through information about employees' total compensation  compensation components and the increase and rate of increase over time has formed part of the remuneration committee's and Board of Directors' basis for decision in the evaluation of the equity of the guidelines and the restrictions that follow as a result of these. The development of the gap between compensation for senior executives and compensation for other employees will be detailed in the remuneration report.The decision-making process to establish  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a remuneration committee. The committee's duties include preparing the Board of Director's decision on proposed guidelines for compensation to senior executives. The Board of Directors shall prepare proposals for new guidelines at least every four years and submit the proposal for resolution at the Annual General Meeting.

During consideration of and decisions on compensation-related issues by the Board of Directors  neither the CEO nor other persons in the company management shall attend  insofar as they are affected by the issues.Deviation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may decide to temporarily deviate from the guidelines in whole or in part  if in an individual case if there are special reasons to do so and a deviation is necessary to meet the Company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the Company's economic viability. As stated above  it is part of the remuneration committee's duties to prepare Board of Directors' decisions in compensation issues  which include decisions regarding deviations from the guidelines.Description of important changes to the guidelines and how the shareholders' views have been taken into account.These guidelines correspond to the guidelines adopted at the 2020 Annual General Meeting19.

2640,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.livemint.com/news/india/how-india-s-much-hyped-global-bond-index-inclusion-unraveled-11649634409304.html,How India’s much-hyped global bond index inclusion unravelled,The timeline seemed so final that Citigroup Inc. advised its clients to buy Indian debt in anticipation that key tax exemptions would be announced to facilitate the change,"For months  India prepared for a remarkable milestone: getting its bonds listed on global indexes. Inclusion was perceived as a crucial step change for the $1 trillion market. Banks penciled in inflows of as much as $40 billion for a country that has long lagged behind peers in tapping global wealth.The timeline seemed so final that Citigroup Inc. advised its clients to buy Indian debt in anticipation that key tax exemptions would be announced to facilitate the change. Policy makers and analysts predicted inclusion as early as April 1  the start of the new financial year.So it came as a shock when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman didn’t make any mention of it in her February budget speech. The sudden silence puzzled traders. Within a day  Citi reversed its buy-call. Local debt markets saw the sharpest sell-off in almost two years. It was as if a plan had never existed.In interviews  Indian officials who were part of discussions described how politics and contentious tax negotiations intertwined to stall progress. Bankers worried about volatile inflows. Powerful Hindu nationalist groups raised eleventh hour concerns that exempting foreigners from taxes would lead to discrimination against domestic investors  according to the people  who asked not to be identified citing privacy rules.Now  many believe inclusion isn’t likely for at least a year. Officials say a path forward isn’t possible until Group of 20 Nations reach a consensus on a country’s right to tax capital gains  another pressure point for India.“From India’s perspective  we are losing an opportunity to tap a pool of liquidity and an investor base "" said Nagaraj Kulkarni  Senior Asia Rates Strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. “From a foreign investors’ perspective  India is one of the largest EM bond markets that is yet to be included in major bond indexes.""With inclusion shelved  “investors lose out on a relatively high-yielding market that also offers risk diversification benefits "" he said.An About-FaceThe challenges facing India are partly structural.Global investors want India to get its bonds on international clearing platforms  which help settle securities transactions. For that to happen  Euroclear  one of the major ones  has pushed India to exempt the transactions from taxes to avoid compliance issues. Other countries using the platform follow that policy.In India  progress seemed steady. In September  a senior official from the finance ministry said most of the work had been done. Tax authorities appeared ready to exempt these transactions  according to a person familiar with the matter. Morgan Stanley predicted inclusion to some indexes as early as the second quarter of 2022. FTSE Russell put India on its watchlist.Sitharaman was supposed to reveal the change in the Feb. 1 budget talk. Euroclear expected the tweak right up until the speech  according to a finance ministry official.When she said nothing  Euroclear was caught off-guard  the official said. So was the market: Citi quickly reversed its buy-call on India long bonds. Traders called the ministry searching for answers.Euroclear didn’t reply to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for India’s finance ministry didn’t respond to an email seeking clarification.What Went WrongIn hindsight  officials said India’s reversal connects to an October announcement from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  the Paris-based group that develops international fiscal policy.To address tax avoidance issues  the OECD helped broker an agreement with 136 countries to implement a global minimum rate. India  which is a member of the group  took the position that countries had the right to tax capital gains based on the location of underlying assets.That created an optics problem. In discussions about index inclusion  the finance ministry had carved out a path to exempt international bond transactions from taxes. Now  Indian authorities had put forward a different perspective at public OECD forums. Around the beginning of 2022  the tax department  worried about this contradiction  made a decision not to follow through with the exemption  people familiar with the matter said.Meanwhile  in January  Hindu nationalist groups linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s party met with senior government officials. They argued that it was unfair for foreigners to receive tax waivers when local investors did not get similar benefits.These groups have enjoyed increasing clout since Modi rose to power in 2014  partly because they can influence local businesses -- his party’s traditional vote bank. Every year  they hold informal discussions with the government ahead of the budget  one person said. In 2019  when the groups opposed a plan to issue a dollar-denominated sovereign bond  the proposal was scrapped. Their opposition contributed to the transfer of a top bureaucrat who supported it.“There is no reason why we should give advantages to foreign investors "" Ashwani Mahajan  one of the leaders of Swadeshi Jagran Manch  a Hindu nationalist group  told Bloomberg a few days before the February budget speech.Looking AheadFor now  index inclusion appears all but impossible in the short term.In an interview with Bloomberg last month  Ajay Seth  the secretary of India’s economic affairs ministry  said index providers made last minute requests. Other officials said Euroclear kept moving its goal post  including tax changes beyond the capital gains issue.The inclusion delay has already impacted India’s bond market. In recent months  yields rose amid a surge in global crude prices. Key banks are adjusting interest rates to keep pace with inflation. That’s a concern for the government as it plans to borrow a record amount from the markets to bridge a wide fiscal gap.“With a large supply looming  yields on government securities are likely to harden once next fiscal’s borrowing commences in April "" said Aditi Nayar  chief economist at ICRA Ltd.  the local unit of Moody’s Investors Service. “If there are concrete steps toward bond index inclusion during the year  it could help to cap yields.""This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

The board of directors believes that it is in the interest of all shareholders that senior executives  employees and other key individuals  which are assessed to be of importance for the development of the group have a long-term interest of a positive value growth in the Company's shares. A long-term ownership engagement is expected to stimulate increased interest in the business and the earnings development in general as well as increasing the motivation for the participants and aims to achieve increased alignment between the participant and the Company's shareholders. Furthermore  the program is expected to increase the possibility of recruiting competent personnel.In order to hedge the Company's obligations under the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 and hedge the ancillary costs  the board of directors also proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants  as well as an approval of transfer of warrants in accordance items 15a and 15b.Resolutions in accordance with items 15a and 15b below are taken as one decision and are thus conditional of each other.A presentation of other incentive programs  preparation of the proposal  costs for the programs and effects on key performance measures etc. are described below.Item 15a): Proposal regarding resolution to issue warrants employee stock optionsThe board of directors of the Company proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to establish Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 in accordance with the following main guidelines:The Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 shall consist of a maximum of 3 500 000 stock options.Each stock option confers the holder a right to acquire one new share in the Company against an exercise price corresponding to 130 percent of the average volume weighted price for the Company's share as quoted on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market during the period from and including 30 December 2022 up to and including 13 January 2023. The calculated exercise price shall be rounded off to nearest even hundredth of a SEK  whereupon SEK 0.005 will be rounded to SEK 0.01. The exercise price and number of shares that each stock option confers right to acquire may be re-calculated in the event of a bonus issue  reverse share split or share split  rights issue  etc.  whereby the re-calculation terms in the terms for Warrants 2022/2026 shall apply.The Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 shall be offered  at one or several occasions  to (i) all existing and future senior executives and other employees in the group's business in USA until and including 15 January 2023 and (ii) the existing and future key individuals that (personally or through companies) work in the group's business in Sweden  Denmark  Germany or USA as of the mentioned date and who are selected by the board of directors based on their importance for the group. Employees refers to full-time and part-time employees  but not hourly employees. A person who has entered into an employment agreement with the group but has not taken up his/her employment as of the mentioned date  shall not be regarded as an employee. An employee who has terminated the employment or has been dismissed by the mentioned date but is still employed  shall not be regarded as an employee.Senior executives and other employees within the Company and the group in Sweden  Denmark  Germany and USA will within the framework of Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 be offered stock options in three different categories in accordance with the following:A. The managing director may be offered a maximum of 700 000 stock options;B. Managers in the group consisting of up to four individuals  of which each may be offered a maximum of 500 000 stock options  totaling a maximum of 1 600 000 stock options;C. Key individuals in the group consisting of up to ten individuals  of which each may be offered a maximum of 200 000 stock options  totaling a maximum of 1 000 000 stock options; andD. Other employees and consultants in the group consisting of up to five individuals  of which each may be offered a maximum of 40 000 warrants  totaling a maximum of 200 000 warrants.Stock options offered to the categories above which are not accepted by the categories above  can later be offered to existing (who does not subscribe their full offered share) and future senior executives or other employees in the group in Sweden  Denmark  Germany and USA within the framework of the now proposed principles for allotment. Oversubscription may not occur. In the event that any individual within the abovementioned categories does not subscribe for their full share  such share may be transferred to another category.The Company's board of directors shall not be included in the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026.Notice of participation in the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 shall be received by the Company on 15 January 2023 at the latest  with a right for the board of directors to prolong the time limit. Allotment of stock options to participants shall take place as soon as possible after the expiration of the notification period.The allotted stock options will be vested over a three-year period in accordance with the following:a) 40 percent of the allotted stock options will be vesting on 31 January 2023; andb) 60 percent of the allotted stock options will be vesting in linear quarterly instalments from 1 February 2023 up to and including 1 March 2026.Vesting requires that the participant is still active within the group and that the employment has not been terminated as of the date when the respective vesting occurs. If a participant ceases to be an employee or terminates his/her employment with the group before a vesting date  the already vested stock options may be exercised at the ordinary time for exercise as described below  but further vesting will not take place. If the employee's employment ceases due to dismissal from the employer's side  however  also vested options will lapse  unless the board of directors decides otherwise on a case-by-case basis.The stock options shall not constitute securities and shall not be able to be transferred or pledged. However  in the event of death  the rights constituted by vested stock options shall accrue to the beneficiaries of the holder of the stock options.The stock options shall be allotted without consideration.The holder can exercise allotted and vested stock options during the period from the vesting date up to and including 31 May 2026. The board of directors has the right to limit the number of dates for delivery of shares during the exercise period.Participation in the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 requires that such participation is in accordance with applicable laws  as well as that such participation can be executed with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts according to the Company's assessment.The stock options shall be governed by separate agreements with each participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 within the above-mentioned substantial terms and guidelines. The board of directors has the right to  within the framework of the agreement with each participant  make the reasonable changes and adjustments of the terms and conditions of the stock options that are deemed suitable or appropriate as a result of local employment law or tax law or administrative conditions. This may mean  among other things  that continued vesting of stock options may take place in some cases when otherwise would not have been the case. The board of directors also has the right to advance vesting and the timing of exercise of stock options in certain cases  such as in the case of a public takeover offer  certain changes in ownership of the Company  liquidation  merger and similar measures. Finally  the board of directors has the right to  in extraordinary cases  limit the scope of  or prematurely terminate  the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 in whole or in part.Item 15b): Proposal regarding resolution to issue warrants and approval of transfer of warrantsIn order to enable the Company's delivery of shares under the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 as well as to hedge ancillary costs  primarily social security contributions  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants of series 2022/2026 as well as an approval of transfer of warrants of series 2022/2026.The board of directors of the Company proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 3 500 000 warrants  which may result in a maximum increase in the Company's share capital of SEK 30 000. The warrants shall entitle to subscription of new shares in the Company.The following terms shall apply to the issuance:The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be subscribed for by the Company and Acarix Incentives AB  reg. no 559102-0044  (the ""Subsidiary"") and any other group company.The warrants are issued at no consideration and shall be subscribed for through a separate subscription list no later than on 30 May 2022. The board of directors has the right to extend the time for subscription.Each warrant entitles to subscription of one new share in the Company during the period from 15 January 2023 up to an including 31 May 2026 or the earlier date set forth in the terms for the warrants.Each warrant entitles to subscribe for one new share in the Company against cash payment at a subscription price corresponding to 130 percent of the average volume weighted price for the Company's share as quoted on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market during the period from and including 30 December 2022 up to and including 13 January 2023. The calculated subscription price shall be rounded off to nearest even hundredth of a SEK  whereupon SEK 0.005 will be rounded to SEK 0.01. The subscription price may not be set below the shares' par value. Upon subscription of shares  the part of the subscription price that exceeds the quotient value of the previous shares shall be allocated to the non-restricted share premium fund.A new share subscribed for by exercise of a warrant has a right to dividends as of the first record day for dividends following registration of the new share issue with the Companies Registration Office and after the share has been registered in the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.The purpose of the issuance  and deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  is to  within the framework of Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026  secure delivery of shares to the participants of the program.The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are available at the Company at least three weeks prior to the meeting  including conditions regarding re-calculation  in certain cases  of the subscription price and the number of shares a warrant entitles to.The board of directors or a person nominated by it  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments as may be required in connection with registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and  if applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB.The board of directors further proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve that the Company  the Subsidiary  or any other group Company  may transfer warrants to the participants in the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 without consideration in connection with exercise of the stock options in accordance with the terms set out in item 15a or in another way dispose of the warrants in order to be able to secure the Company's commitments and costs in relation to the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026. The board of directors shall not have the right to dispose of the warrants for any other purpose than to secure the Company's commitments and costs in connection with the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026.Preparation of incentive programs etc. (it is noted that this is not a topic for resolution)Proposal on Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 has been prepared by external advisors in consultation with the remuneration committee and the board of directors.Valuation and Costs and effects on key figuresEmploye e Stock Option Program 2022/2026Costs related to Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 will be recognised in accordance with IFRS 2  which means that the stock options are expensed as personnel costs during the vesting period.Based on the assumption that 100 percent of the options in the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 will be allotted and an annual employee turnover rate of 10 percent  meaning that approximately 2 550 000 stock options will vest  the estimated total accounting salary costs for the options will amount to approximately SEK 720 000 during the time period 2022-2026  based on the actual value of the options at the time of calculation. The options do not have a market value since they are not transferable. However  the board of directors has calculated a theoretical value of the options in accordance with the Black Scholes formula. The calculations have been based on a by the board of directors estimated share price of SEK 0 68 per share  a risk-free interest rate of 0.95 percent and an assumed volatility of 40 percent. In accordance with this valuation  the value of the options in the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 is approximately SEK 0.14 per option. Limitations in the disposal rights have not been taken into consideration in the valuation.Upon a positive development of the share price  the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 may entail costs in the form of social security contributions. The total costs for social security contributions will depend on the employment form of the participant  the number of options that will be vested and on the value of the benefit that the participant finally will receive  i.e. on the value of the options when exercised 2024  but also in which countries the participants are resident and what rates that apply for social security contributions in these countries. Based on the assumption that all 3 500 000 options in Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 will be vested  an assumed share price of SEK 2 when the options are exercised and an assumed average social security rate of approximately 8.3 percent and an annual staff turnover of approximately 10 percent  the total costs for social security contributions will amount to approximately SEK 230 000.The Company's entire costs for social security contributions are proposed to be hedged through a directed issue of warrants in accordance with item 15b.The total cost for Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 will be distributed over the years 2022-2026. Since 40 percent of the options the first year and 60 percent vest in quarterly installments  the cost will be distributed unevenly over the period  with an emphasis at the beginning of the period.Given the above assumptions  including an assumed share price of 2 SEK at the time of exercise of the options  and that the program had been introduced in 2020 instead  it is calculated that the key figure earnings per share for full year 2021 would be unaffected.It shall be noted that all calculations above are preliminary  based on assumptions and are only intended to provide an illustration of what costs Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 may entail. Actual costs may therefore deviate from what has been stated above.Costs in the form of fees to external advisers and costs for administering Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 200 000.Other outstanding share based incentive programsThe Company has previously established three incentive program  warrant series 2021/2025 (""Incentive Program 2021/2025"")  warrant series 2020/2023 (""Incentive Program 2020/2023"") and employee stock options of series 2021/2024 (""Employee Stock Option Program 2021/2024"").There are 2 000 000 outstanding warrants under the Employee Stock Option Program 2021/2024. Each such warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new share in the Company during the period from 1 June 2025 up to and including 31 August 2025.There are 2 000 000 outstanding warrants under the Incentive Program 2021/2025. Each such warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new share in the Company during the period from 1 June 2025 up to and including 31 August 2025.There are 3 000 000 outstanding warrants under the Incentive Program 2020/2023. Each such warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new share in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 1 17 during the period from 1 August 2023 up to and including 1 October 2023.For more information  see the Company's annual report for 2020.DilutionThe total number of registered shares and votes at the time of this proposal amount to 251 972 194.In case all warrants issued under Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 are exercised for subscription of new shares  the number of shares and votes in the Company will increase with 3 500 000 (with reservation for any re-calculation in accordance with the warrant terms and conditions)  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.37 percent of the Company's share capital and votes (based on the current outstanding shares in the Company).The maximum dilution of Incentive Program 2020/2023  Warrant program 2021/2025  Employee Stock option Program 2021/2024 and Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2026 plus the other outstanding incentive programs in the Company is estimated to be a maximum of approximately 4.11 percent  assuming full subscription and exercise of all warrants offered and outstanding.Majority requirementsA resolution in accordance with item 14 requires support by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds of both the shares voted and of the shares represented at the general meeting.A resolution in accordance with item 15 requires support by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths of both the shares voted and of the shares represented at the general meeting  due to the fact that the issue and transfer of warrants is made to persons who belong to one or more of the categories according to Ch. 16 of the Swedish Companies Act.Number of shares and votesThe total number of shares and votes in the Company as of the date hereof amounts to 251 972 194. The Company holds no own shares.Further informationCopies of accounts  audit report  complete proposals  proxy forms  and other documents that shall be available in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act are available at the Company at Jungmansgatan 12  211 19 in Malmö and at the Company's website www.acarix.com  at least three (3) weeks in advance of the annual general meeting and will be sent to shareholders who request it and provide their e-mail or postal address.

2643,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.ndtv.com/business/how-governments-global-bond-index-inclusion-unraveled-report-2876993,How Government's Global Bond Index Inclusion Unraveled: Report,For months  India prepared for a remarkable milestone: getting its bonds listed on global indexes. Inclusion was perceived as a crucial step change for the $1 trillion market.,Many believe global bond index inclusion isnt likely for at least a year.For months  India prepared for a remarkable milestone: getting its bonds listed on global indexes. Inclusion was perceived as a crucial step change for the $1 trillion market. Banks penciled in inflows of as much as $40 billion for a country that has long lagged behind peers in tapping international wealth.The timeline seemed so final that Citigroup Inc. advised its clients to buy Indian debt in anticipation that key tax exemptions would be announced to facilitate the change. Policy makers and analysts predicted inclusion as early as April 1  the start of the new financial year.So it came as a shock when Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman didn't make any mention of it in her February budget speech. The sudden silence puzzled traders. Within a day  Citi reversed its buy-call. Local debt markets saw the sharpest sell-off in almost two years. It was as if a plan had never existed.In interviews  Indian officials who were part of discussions described how politics and contentious tax negotiations intertwined to stall progress. Bankers worried about volatile inflows. Powerful Hindu nationalist groups raised eleventh hour concerns that exempting foreigners from taxes would lead to discrimination against domestic investors  according to the people  who asked not to be identified citing privacy rules.Now  many believe inclusion isn't likely for at least a year. Officials say a path forward isn't possible until Group of 20 nations reach a consensus on a country's right to tax capital gains  another pressure point for India.“From India's perspective  we are losing an opportunity to tap a pool of liquidity and an investor base ” said Nagaraj Kulkarni  Senior Asia Rates Strategist at Standard Chartered Plc in Singapore. “From a foreign investors' perspective  India is one of the largest EM bond markets that is yet to be included in major bond indexes.”With inclusion shelved  “investors lose out on a relatively high-yielding market that also offers risk diversification benefits ” he said.An About-FaceThe challenges facing India are partly structural.Global investors want India to get its bonds on international clearing platforms  which help settle securities transactions. For that to happen  Euroclear  one of the major ones  has pushed India to exempt the transactions from taxes to avoid compliance issues. Other countries using the platform follow that policy.In India  progress seemed steady. In September  a senior official from the finance ministry said most of the work had been done. Tax authorities appeared ready to exempt these transactions  according to a person familiar with the matter. Morgan Stanley predicted inclusion to some indexes as early as the second quarter of 2022. FTSE Russell put India on its watchlist.Sitharaman was supposed to reveal the change in the February 1 budget talk. Euroclear expected the tweak right up until the speech  according to a finance ministry official.When she said nothing  Euroclear was caught off-guard  the official said. So was the market: Citi quickly reversed its buy-call on India long bonds. Traders called the ministry searching for answers.Euroclear didn't reply to multiple requests for comment. A spokesperson for India's finance ministry didn't respond to an email seeking clarification.Bloomberg LP is the parent company of Bloomberg Index Services Limited (BISL)  which administers indexes that compete with indexes from other providers.What Went WrongIn hindsight  officials said India's reversal connects to an October announcement from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  the Paris-based group that develops international fiscal policy.To address tax avoidance issues  the OECD helped broker an agreement with 136 countries to implement a global minimum rate. India  which is a member of the group  took the position that countries had the right to tax capital gains based on the location of underlying assets.That created an optics problem. In discussions about index inclusion  the finance ministry had carved out a path to exempt international bond transactions from taxes. Now  Indian authorities had put forward a different perspective at public OECD forums. Around the beginning of 2022  the tax department  worried about this contradiction  made a decision not to follow through with the exemption  people familiar with the matter said.Meanwhile  in January  Hindu nationalist groups linked to Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party met with senior government officials. They argued that it was unfair for foreigners to receive tax waivers when local investors did not get similar benefits.These groups have enjoyed increasing clout since Modi rose to power in 2014  partly because they can influence local businesses -- his party's traditional vote bank. Every year  they hold informal discussions with the government ahead of the budget  one person said. In 2019  when the groups opposed a plan to issue a dollar-denominated sovereign bond  the proposal was scrapped. Their opposition contributed to the transfer of a top bureaucrat who supported it.“There is no reason why we should give advantages to foreign investors ” Ashwani Mahajan  one of the leaders of Swadeshi Jagran Manch  a Hindu nationalist group  told Bloomberg a few days before the February budget speech.Looking AheadFor now  index inclusion appears all but impossible in the short term.In a recent interview with Bloomberg  Ajay Seth  the secretary of India's economic affairs ministry  said index providers made last minute requests. Other officials said Euroclear kept moving its goal post  including tax changes beyond the capital gains issue.The inclusion delay has already impacted India's bond market. In recent months  yields rose amid a surge in global crude prices. Key banks are adjusting interest rates to keep pace with inflation. That's a concern for the government as it plans to borrow a record amount from the markets to bridge a wide fiscal gap.“With a large supply looming  yields on government securities are likely to harden once next fiscal's borrowing commences in April ” said Aditi Nayar  chief economist at ICRA Ltd.  the local unit of Moody's Investors Service. “If there are concrete steps toward bond index inclusion during the year  it could help to cap yields.”,neutral,0.06,0.79,0.14,negative,0.01,0.14,0.84,True,English,"['Global Bond Index Inclusion', 'Government', 'Report', 'Senior Asia Rates Strategist', 'largest EM bond markets', 'Prime Minister Narendra Modi', 'Bloomberg Index Services Limited', 'Powerful Hindu nationalist groups', 'Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman', 'global bond index inclusion', 'dollar-denominated sovereign bond', 'eleventh hour concerns', 'Standard Chartered Plc', 'traditional vote bank', 'international clearing platforms', 'global minimum rate', 'key tax exemptions', 'contentious tax negotiations', 'risk diversification benefits', 'new financial year', 'Local debt markets', 'February 1 budget talk', 'tax avoidance issues', 'public OECD forums', 'international bond transactions', 'international fiscal policy', 'crucial step change', 'February budget speech', ""foreign investors' perspective"", 'major bond indexes', 'senior government officials', 'finance ministry official', 'India long bonds', 'senior official', 'Bloomberg LP', 'international wealth', 'Global investors', 'Indian debt', 'compliance issues', 'Tax authorities', 'tax department', 'tax waivers', 'similar benefits', 'global indexes', 'a year', 'local investors', 'local businesses', 'remarkable milestone', 'Citigroup Inc.', 'Policy makers', 'sudden silence', 'sharpest sell-off', 'two years', 'domestic investors', 'privacy rules', 'capital gains', 'pressure point', 'investor base', 'Nagaraj Kulkarni', 'Morgan Stanley', 'second quarter', 'FTSE Russell', 'multiple requests', 'parent company', 'other providers', 'October announcement', 'Economic Co-operation', 'underlying assets', 'optics problem', 'Indian authorities', 'different perspective', 'increasing clout', 'Indian officials', 'securities transactions', '$1 trillion market', 'high-yielding market', 'volatile inflows', 'one person', 'Other countries', 'Paris-based group', 'informal discussions', '136 countries', 'months', 'Banks', 'country', 'peers', 'timeline', 'clients', 'anticipation', 'analysts', 'April', 'start', 'shock', 'mention', 'traders', 'day', 'buy-call', 'plan', 'interviews', 'politics', 'progress', 'Bankers', 'foreigners', 'taxes', 'discrimination', 'people', 'path', '20 nations', 'consensus', 'right', 'opportunity', 'pool', 'liquidity', 'Singapore', 'Face', 'challenges', 'Euroclear', 'September', 'work', 'matter', 'watchlist', 'tweak', 'guard', 'answers', 'comment', 'spokesperson', 'email', 'clarification', 'BISL', 'hindsight', 'reversal', 'Organisation', 'Development', 'agreement', 'member', 'position', 'location', 'beginning', 'contradiction', 'decision', 'January', 'party', 'proposal']",2022-04-11,2022-04-11,ndtv.com

The Notes are not secured debt. You should carefully consider whether the Notes are suited to your particular circumstances. This pricing supplement should be read together with the accompanying prospectus  dated September 14  2021  and the accompanying prospectus supplement  dated September 14  2021. The information in the accompanying prospectus and the accompanying prospectus supplement is supplemented by  and to the extent inconsistent therewith replaced and superseded by  the information in this pricing supplement. This section describes certain significant risks relating to an investment in the Notes. We urge you to read the following information about these risks  together with the other information in this pricing supplement and the accompanying prospectus and accompanying prospectus supplement  before investing in the Notes.Investors Are Subject to Our Credit Risk  and Market Perceptions About Our Creditworthiness May Adversely Affect the Market Value of the Notes.Investors are dependent on our ability to pay all amounts due on the Notes on the interest payment dates and at maturity  and  therefore  investors are subject to our credit risk and to changes in the market’s view of our creditworthiness. Any decrease in the market’s view on or confidence in our creditworthiness is likely to adversely affect the market value of the Notes.The Market Value of the Notes May Be Influenced by Unpredictable Factors.The market value of your Notes may fluctuate between the date you purchase them and the Maturity Date. Several factors  many of which are beyond our control  will influence the market value of the Notes. Factors that may influence the market value of the Notes include:· supply and demand for the Notes  including inventory positions with the underwriters or any other market-maker;· interest rates in the market and expectations about future interest rates;· the creditworthiness of the Bank;· the time remaining to the maturity of the Notes; and· economic  financial  political  regulatory or judicial events that affect financial markets generally.The Notes Will Not Be Listed on Any Securities Exchange and Secondary Trading May Be Limited.The Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. Therefore  there may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The underwriters may  but are not obligated to  make a market in the Notes. Even if there is a secondary market  it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the Notes easily. Because we do not expect that other broker-dealers will participate significantly in the secondary market for the Notes  the price at which you may be able to trade your Notes is likely to depend on the price  if any  at which the underwriters are willing to transact. If at any time the underwriters were not to make a market in the Notes  it is likely that there would be no secondary market for the Notes. Accordingly  you should be willing to hold your Notes to maturity.P- 5Senior Floating Rate Notes Due April 14  2025Royal Bank of CanadaWe or Our Designee Will Make Determinations with respect to the Notes.We or our designee will make certain determinations with respect to the Notes as further described under the caption “Specific Terms of the Notes.” In addition  if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred  we or our designee will make certain determinations with respect to the Notes in our or our designee’s sole discretion as further described under the section “Description of the Notes We May Offer—Interest Rates—SOFR Index Notes” in the accompanying prospectus supplement  dated September 14  2021.

Moreover  certain determinations may require the exercise of discretion and the making of subjective judgments  such as with respect to Compounded SOFR Index or the occurrence or non-occurrence of a Benchmark Transition Event and any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes.

If you are not a U.S. holder  please consult your own tax advisor.In the opinion of our counsel  Sullivan & Cromwell LLP  your Notes should be treated as variable rate debt instruments for United States federal income tax purposes. Under this characterization  you should include the interest payments on the Notes in ordinary income at the time you receive or accrue such payments  depending on your method of accounting for tax purposes  and recognize capital gain or loss on the sale or retirement of your Notes equal to the difference between the amount you realize on the sale or retirement  excluding any amounts attributable to accrued but unpaid interest (which should be treated as interest payments)  and your tax basis in your Notes.For a further discussion of the variable rate debt instrument rules  please see the discussion under the heading “Tax Consequences—United States Taxation—Original Issue Discount—Variable Rate Debt Securities” in the accompanying prospectus.P- 10Senior Floating Rate Notes Due April 14  2025Royal Bank of CanadaCANADIAN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONSFor a discussion of the Canadian federal income tax consequences of owning the Notes  please see the section “Tax Consequences— Canadian Taxation” in the accompanying prospectus  dated September 14  2021 and the section “Certain Income Tax Consequences—Canadian Taxation” in the accompanying prospectus supplement  dated September 14  2021.BENEFIT PLAN INVESTOR CONSIDERATIONSA fiduciary of a pension  profit-sharing or other employee benefit plan (a “plan”) subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  as amended (“ERISA”)  should consider the fiduciary standards of ERISA in the context of the plan’s particular circumstances before authorizing an investment in the debt securities.Any purchaser or holder of debt securities or any interest therein will be deemed to have represented (both on behalf of itself and any plan) by its purchase and holding of the debt securities that either (1) it is not a plan and is not purchasing those debt securities on behalf of or with “plan assets” of any plan or (2) the purchase and holding of the debt securities will not constitute a non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or the Internal Revenue Code.

(“FINRA”).The underwriters may sell the Notes to certain dealers at the public offering price  less a concession that will not exceed 0.100% of their principal amount. The underwriters and those dealers may resell the Notes to other dealers at a reallowance discount that will not exceed 0.050% of their principal amount. After the initial offering of the Notes  the concession and reallowance discounts on the Notes may change. The offering of the Notes by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.We estimate that the total offering expenses for the Notes  excluding underwriting discounts and commissions  will be approximately $41 603.P- 12Senior Floating Rate Notes Due April 14  2025Royal Bank of CanadaSubject to the terms and conditions of the terms agreement  the underwriters have agreed to purchase the Notes as principal  for their own account at a purchase price equal to the issue price specified on the front cover of this pricing supplement  less an underwriting discount of 0.150%. To the extent the underwriters resell Notes to a broker or dealer less a concession equal to the entire underwriting discount  such broker or dealer may be deemed to be an “underwriter” of the Notes as such term is defined in the Securities Act of 1933  as amended. The underwriters have advised us that  if they are unable to sell all the Notes at the public offering price  the underwriters propose to offer the Notes from time to time for sale in negotiated transactions or otherwise  at prices to be determined at the time of sale.In the future  the underwriters may repurchase and resell the Notes in market-making transactions. For more information about the plan of distribution  the Distribution Agreement (of which the terms agreement forms a part) and possible market-making activities; see “Supplemental Plan of Distribution” in the accompanying prospectus supplement dated September 14  2021.We expect that delivery of the Notes will be made against payment therefor on April 14  2022  which is the fifth scheduled business day following the trade date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934  trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle no later than two business days after the trade date  unless the parties to any such trade expressly agree otherwise at the time of the trade. Accordingly  purchasers who wish to trade Notes on any date more than two business days prior to delivery of the Notes hereunder will be required  by virtue of the fact that the Notes will initially settle in five business days (T + 5) to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.Conflicts of InterestRBC Capital Markets  LLC is our affiliate  and is deemed to have a conflict of interest under FINRA Rule 5121. Accordingly  the offering of the Notes will conform to the requirements of FINRA Rule 5121. The underwriters  with the exception of Westpac Banking Corporation  Desjardins Securities Inc. and Swedbank AB (publ)  are members of FINRA. RBC Capital Markets  LLC is not permitted to sell the Notes to an account over which it exercises discretionary authority without the prior specific written approval of the account holder.The underwriters and their respective affiliates are full service financial institutions engaged in various activities  which may include securities trading  commercial and investment banking  financial advisory  investment management  investment research  principal investment  hedging  financing and brokerage activities. Certain of the underwriters and their respective affiliates have  from time to time  performed  and may in the future perform  various financial advisory and investment banking services for the Bank  for which they received or will receive customary fees and expenses.In the ordinary course of their various business activities  the underwriters and their respective affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers  and such investment and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Bank.

More infoBrussels vowed to reduce the EU's ""excessive dependence"" on the City and its €660 trillion (£563trillion) clearing market but the European Banking Federation (EBF) has now said the European Commission's proposal would cause ""serious market disruption"".Clearing houses act as middlemen in derivatives trades between banks. Since the 2008 financial crisis  they are a vital part of the financial system. The City is Europe's largest centre for clearing activity  with London Stock Exchange's LCH unit in London clearing about 90 percent of euro interest rate derivatives. Brexit made clearing a strong battleground. In line with Brussels' desire for control over euro-denominated trades to build ""strategic autonomy"" in capital markets  after the UK's departure it insisted EU banks would be shut out of London  with an initial deadline of January 2020. This was however repeatedly pushed back over concerns about financial stability and reduced access to products such as mortgages. Brexit LIVE: ‘Some isolation  some clown!’ Brexit-bashers savaged as UK takes centre stageMcGuinness  executive EU Commission financial services chief  wants less EU 'dependence' on UKIn January  Mairead McGuinness  financial services chief at the executive European Commission  was forced to allow EU-based banks and money managers to clear trades in London until June 2025 after failing to persuade banks and their customers to shift the activity from the UK capital to Deutsche Boerse's Eurex in Frankfurt fast enough. An abrupt end to cross-border clearing would have disrupted markets  but EU officials believe three years will be long enough to allow the build-up of European capacity to replace the trade. After Ms McGuinness launched a consultation for measures to lower the EU's reliance ""on systemic third-country clearinghouses and to improve the attractiveness of EU-based clearing houses""  the EBF advised against the ""forced relocation"" plans.City of London: Europe's largest centre for clearing activityThe trade body said: ""EBF would like to highlight that any forced relocation strategy or other coercive measures will not achieve  and would likely undermine  the objective of a competitive and resilient EU clearing [market]."" The federation concluded: ""We ask the European Commission to only consider measures that make clearing in the EU more attractive  without disproportionally undermining other market participants that are key to the fair and efficient provision of clearing services.""

PXL770 is a novel  first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator that is preparing to enter into a Phase 2a clinical Proof-of-Concept (POC) biomarker study midyear  subject to additional financing.Poxel CEO  Thomas Kuhn  commented: ""Having PXL770 awarded Fast Track Designation by the FDA soon after our other promising product  PXL065  is a strong recognition of the potential of both our programs in adrenoleukodystrophy  a significant unmet medical need. Poxel aims at developing innovative treatments to improve the life of patients with serious and rare chronic diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  and the Fast Track Designation could offer PXL770 the ability to substantially accelerate the approval timeline in ALD. We are preparing the next steps to initiate our two Phase 2a clinical studies midyear  with results anticipated early 2023.”Fast Track Designation (FTD)FTD is designed to expedite development of pharmaceutical products which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs in serious or life-threatening conditions.FTD provides Poxel with substantially enhanced access to FDA  including opportunities for face-to-face meetings and written consultations throughout the remaining development of PXL770.Drugs with FTD are eligible to apply for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review at the time of a New Drug Application (NDA) submission  which may result in faster product approval.FTD also allows for 'rolling review'  whereby Poxel may submit completed sections of the NDA as they become available  rather than at the end of development.Next StepsThe Phase 2a clinical POC biomarker studies for Poxel’s two products  PXL770 and PXL065  in X-linked ALD are  subject to additional financing  anticipated to begin midyear  with results anticipated early 2023.Fast Track DesignationIntroduced under the FDA Modernization Act (1997)  Fast Track Designation (FTD) may be awarded by the FDA to investigational drugs which treat a serious or life-threatening condition  and which fill an unmet medical need. Filling an unmet medical need is defined as providing a therapy where none exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially better than available therapy. The FDA notes that 'the purpose of the Fast Track program is to get important new drugs to the patient earlier1”. FTD must be requested by the sponsor company and must be accompanied by a detailed review of both preclinical and clinical data.The key benefits of FTD comprise enhanced access to the FDA  with regular and more frequent opportunities for consultation and discussion. In addition  drugs with FTD may be eligible for Accelerated Approval  in which a new medicine is approved prior to the availability of definitive data  and Priority Review  in which the standard 10-month review process is reduced to six months. Drugs with FTD may also enter a 'rolling review' of their NDA submission  in which sections are submitted and reviewed as they become available  substantially expediting the approval process.About ALDX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an orphan neurometabolic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene which encodes for a key protein that is required for metabolism of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) by peroxisomes (cellular organelles). ALD is the most common leukodystrophy with a prevalence similar to hemophilia – up to 1/10 000 individuals in the general population have ALD [https://rarediseases.org]. Forms of this disease include cerebral ALD (C-ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) which is the most common form – typically occurring in adolescence through adulthood. AMN is characterized by chronic and progressive distal axonopathy involving the long tracts of the spinal cord and to a lesser extent the peripheral nerves resulting in progressive stiffness and weakness in the legs  impaired gait and balance  incontinence  and loss of sensation. Nearly all men with a diagnosis of ALD will develop AMN  and many women also present with features of AMN with a later onset. C-ALD is characterized by inflammatory demyelination of cells in the brain and typically afflicts children  but many men with AMN may also develop cerebral disease; these white matter brain lesions lead to severe neurologic deficits and death. There are no approved medicines for ALD (other than glucocorticoid supplements for associated adrenal insufficiency). C-ALD when first detected in early childhood  can be treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. HSCT is currently limited to early stage of C-ALD and this procedure is at risk of severe adverse reactions.About Poxel SAPoxel is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative treatments for chronic serious diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and rare disorders. Poxel has clinical and earlier-stage programs from its adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator and deuterated TZD platforms targeting chronic and rare metabolic diseases. For the treatment of NASH  PXL065 (deuterium-stabilized R-pioglitazone) is in a streamlined Phase 2 trial (DESTINY-1). PXL770  a first-in-class direct AMPK activator  has successfully completed a Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of NASH  which met its objectives. For the rare inherited metabolic disorder  adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD)  the company intends to initiate Phase 2a proof of concept studies with PXL065 and PXL770 in patients with adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). TWYMEEG® (Imeglimin)  Poxel’s first-in-class lead product that targets mitochondrial dysfunction  has been approved and launched for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in Japan.

The data were published via E-Poster presentation at the 2022 Annual Meeting of the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR)  held April 8-13  2022  by researchers from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson).“We believe that the potential immune priming effect of radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 could prove to be a game-changer for cancer immunotherapy ” said Laurent Levy  co-founder and chairman of the executive board at Nanobiotix. “Our view is that while new immunotherapy treatment modalities with the potential to improve outcomes for patients continue to emerge  they remain reliant upon an underlying immune response. This new preclinical gene expression data showing that the addition of NBTXR3 enhanced activity in key immune pathways associated with innate and adaptive immunity  and outperformed all other combinations in efficacy  survival  and induction of long-term anti-cancer memory  adds to a growing body of support for NBTXR3 as a product candidate that could potentially help expand the benefits of immunotherapy to larger share of the patients we serve.”PRECLINICAL DATA ON IMMUNOTHERAPY BLOCKADE PLUS RADIOTHERAPY-ACTIVATED NBTXR3Previously reported preclinical and clinical data evaluating NBTXR3 in combination with diverse immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) including anti-PD-1  anti-CTLA-4  anti-LAG-3  and anti-TIGIT suggest that  after activation by radiotherapy  the radioenhancer may induce an “immune priming” effect that could help improve and expand the benefits of ICIs to more patients.This new analysis  presented at AACR  assessed immune gene expression associated with multiple combinations of NBTXR3  anti-PD-1  anti-LAG-3  and anti-TIGIT.Key Findings Include:The Combination therapy outperformed all other tested treatment regimens in efficacy  survival  and induction of long-term anti-cancer memoryThe Combination therapy significantly promoted the upregulation of mRNA transcripts involved in innate immunity  the humoral response  B cell function  dendritic cell function  and antigen processing within primary  irradiated tumors relative to untreated controlsWithin non-irradiated tumors  the Combination therapy produced elevations in multiple immune-related pathways that were significantly higher than those produced by other treatment combinations and these pathways included both adaptive and innate immunity; B  T  natural killer  and dendritic cell function; and antigen processingThe Combination therapy promoted immune activation at the irradiated site  abscopal immune responses are improved with the addition of LAG-3 and TIGIT to PD-1 and radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3  and the data suggest that the Combination therapy may be effective against metastatic cancers***About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product  composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physics-based mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly  with immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company sponsored phase I clinical study  evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC and for patients with lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy  either naïve or resistant to prior PD-1 (either primary or secondary as per SITC criteria).Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in strategic collaborations to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2021  the Company entered into an additional strategic collaboration agreement with LianBio to support its global phase III study in Asia along with four future registrational studies.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

With this agreement  concluded after several weeks of intensive work  the Group would exit(1) in an effective and orderly manner from Russia  ensuring continuity for its employees and clients.This contemplated transaction  which remains subject to the approval of the relevant regulatory and anti-trust authorities  will be conducted in compliance with the legal and regulatory obligations in force. The closing of this operation should occur in the coming weeks.The impact of the disposal of Rosbank and the Group’s Russian insurance activities on the Group's CET1 ratio is expected to be around 20 basis points based on the net value of the disposed assets as of December 31  2021(2). It would mainly result from the impact of the write-off of the net book value of the disposed assets  largely offset by  on the one hand  the deconsolidation of the local exposure to Russia (~EUR 15.4 billion of exposure at default as of December 31  2021(3)) and on the other  a payment in favor of Societe Generale including notably the repayment by the purchaser of the subordinated debt granted by Societe Generale to its subsidiary.Pro-forma this transaction  the Group’s CET 1 ratio would remain comfortably above the Group’s guidance. As a reminder  the Group's CET1 ratio was 13.7% as of December 31  2021  i.e. 470 basis points above the minimum regulatory requirement.This contemplated disposal would lead to the accounting in the Group’s income statement(4) of the following main items:the write-off of the net book value of the divested activities (~EUR 2 billion ( 5 ) );an exceptional non-cash item with no impact on the Group’s capital ratio (~EUR 1.1 billion(5))  which corresponds to the normative reversal of the conversion reserve in the Group’s income statement.Story continuesThe Group confirms its distribution policy for the 2021 financial year i.e. the cash dividend of EUR 1.65 per share  subject to the approval of the Combined General meeting of shareholders on 17 May 2022  and the announced share buyback program for an amount of approximately EUR 915 million(6).(1) ALD Automotive OOO  which operates in Russia and through its branches in Kazakhstan  and ALD Belarus LLC no longer conclude any new commercial transactions.(2) Value as of December 31  2021 based on a EUR/RUB exchange rate of 85.(3) Equivalent to ~EUR 10.7 billion of Risk Weighted Asset as of December 31  2021.(4) Accounted in “net profit or loss on other assets”.(5) Based on non-audited estimated data as of February 28  2022 and a EUR/RUB exchange rate of 92. The final impact would be calculated based on the data and the foreign exchange rate at the closing date. The accounting period would depend on the closing date.(6) Subject to usual approvals from ECB and Combined General meeting.Press Contacts:Societe GeneraleJean-Baptiste Froville_+33 1 58 98 68 00_ jean-baptiste.froville@socgen.comFanny Rouby_+33 1 57 29 11 12_ fanny.rouby@socgen.comSociete GeneraleSociete Generale is one of the leading European financial services groups.

The companies have signed a cooperation agreement to that effect. The cooperation is a response to growing global demand for the import and storage of green energy. This quarter  work will be started on the basic design of the import terminal. The terminal  that will operate on the Maasvlakte under the name ACE Terminal  will be operational from 2026.Green hydrogen is seen as an essential element of the future renewable energy mix. Demand for green hydrogen is growing in the energy sector  the transport sector and the petrochemical industry  both in the Netherlands and Germany. An import terminal for green ammonia will make a vital contribution to the import of hydrogen  an essential link in the hydrogen chain  alongside hydrogen production  transport and storage. A reliable logistic chain is essential for developing the market for green hydrogen and for achieving the climate goals for 2030 and 2050.Ammonia as hydrogen carrierIn addition to the production of green hydrogen in the Netherlands  there will also be demand in Northwestern Europe for the large-scale import of green hydrogen  in order to meet future demand. Green ammonia as a hydrogen carrier will play a vital role. Reacting green hydrogen with nitrogen forms green ammonia  allowing the hydrogen to be efficiently and safely transported in large volumes. The ammonia can then be stored and converted again to green hydrogen. Green ammonia is also immediately usable as CO2-free fuel for example for shipping or as a raw material for example for the production of fertiliser.Strategic locationAt the intended location on Rotterdam’s Maasvlakte  vessels from all over the world can moor to discharge green ammonia  and in the initial phase possibly also blue ammonia. Use can be made of the existing infrastructure and the logistic facilities of the Port of Rotterdam. The site offers space for the development of an installation for converting ammonia into hydrogen. In the future  this installation will be connected to the national hydrogen network of Gasunie  that can serve the future hydrogen market in Northwestern Europe.Joining forcesOn the Maasvlakte  HES operates a strategic location with quayside capacity and direct access from the sea. Gasunie has at this location infrastructure of existing storage tanks and a system of pipelines. Vopak  with six ammonia terminals around the world  has extensive experience in the safe storage of ammonia. By joining forces  an attractive starting point will be established from which within just a few years  the partners will be able to realise the import location for green ammonia in Rotterdam. The eventual investment decision still has to be taken  and will be based among others on customer contracts and the necessary permits  including the EIA procedure.Market consultationThe service proposition will entail an independent open access terminal infrastructure  in which the partners will not own the green ammonia. A market consultation procedure is soon to be launched  in which interested parties can announce their interest in the supply  storage and transhipment of green ammonia and hydrogen. Initial discussions are already underway with international market parties.-----Story continuesAbout HES InternationalContributing to the world of tomorrow  that’s what we do at HES.

This center will provide real-time protection against cyber-attacks in the country and across the African continent as a whole.The digital transformation of African societies  as illustrated by the extensive use of mobile payments across the continent  and the rise in teleworking due to the health crisis  have had a major impact on Africa's vulnerability to cyber-attacks. While businesses  administrations and individuals are becoming increasingly connected  this trend must be accompanied by an increase in the level of protection in order to tackle the multiplication and sophistication of attacks. Outside the financial sector  all sectors are affected  including the most important ones  such as government services but also water distribution  energy and telecommunications.Furthermore  a new legal framework is driving African businesses to equip themselves with a means of supervision in the field of cybersecurity.

There are six SOCs located in Canada  France  Hong Kong  the Netherlands  the United Kingdom and now Morocco  and they currently form an international network operating according to the ""follow the sun"" model which offers continuous support to more than a hundred clients around the world  with an unequaled level of responsiveness and flexibility.""Thales is proud to be able to strengthen its expertise and know-how in the field of cybersecurity in Morocco.

The publication “A Randomized  Controlled Comparison of NCX 470 (0.021%  0.042% and 0.065%) and Latanoprost 0.005% in Patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension: The Dolomites Study”» is available by clicking here. NCX 470 is currently in two Phase 3 clinical trials.Dolomites was a dose-response Phase 2 clinical trial comparing three concentrations of NCX 470 ophthalmic solution (0.021%  0.042%  and 0.065%) to latanoprost ophthalmic solution  0.005% in 433 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Aligned with previously reported topline results on Dolomites  NCX 470 0.065% achieved statistical superiority compared to latanoprost 0.005% at all time-matched points measured on day 28  with a peak improvement in intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering of 1.4 mmHg greater than latanoprost. All tested concentrations of NCX 470 were statistically non-inferior to latanoprost and the dose response of NCX 470 showed improved IOP lowering with each incremental concentration. NCX 470 was safe and well-tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events and no evidence of treatment-related systemic side effects.“As presented at the American Glaucoma Societyin February 2020 by Dr David Wirta  the Dolomites Phase 2 data demonstrate that NCX 470  a monotherapy with a dual mechanism of action  has the potential to be a new standard of care for reducing intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.” said Doug Hubatsch  Chief ScientificOfficer of Nicox. “We are pleased to be able to share the results of this Phase 2trial in apeer-reviewed publication with the international glaucoma community.We are looking forward to the results of the subsequent Phase 3trials of NCX 470 – Mont Blanc and Denali – which use a higher dose of NCX 470  based on the results of an initial adaptive design dose-ranging phaseof the Mont Blanc trial.”NCX 470 is currently enrolling patients in two multi-regional Phase 3 glaucoma clinical trials  Mont Blanc and Denali. The objective of these two trials is to demonstrate statistically superior IOP lowering of once-daily dosed NCX 470 ophthalmic solution 0.1% over latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% (first marketed as Xalatan)  the most prescribed prostaglandin analog in the U.S. for patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. About NCX 470 NCX 470 is a novel  potential best-in-class  nitric oxide (NO)-donating prostaglandin analog in development to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Glaucoma is a group of ocular diseases in which the optic nerve is injured  leading to peripheral and  ultimately  central visual field loss and it can eventually lead to blindness if not treated. It is frequently linked to abnormally high IOP (~90% of patients) due to blockage or malfunction of the eye’s aqueous humor drainage system in the front of the eye. In 2020  worldwide sales of treatments targeting glaucoma were over $6.0 billion out of a $24.3 billion worldwide market for ophthalmic drugs.NCX 470 is designed to release both bimatoprost and NO following instillation into the eye. Bimatoprost  marketed under the brand name LUMIGAN® by Allergan  Inc.  is one of the leading products in the class of prostaglandin analogs  the most widely used class of drugs for IOP-lowering in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.

The presentation will review pre-clinical data supporting THR-687 providing protection against retinal vascular permeability  inflammation and reactive gliosis in the diabetic rat.THR-687 is a highly selective pan-RGD integrin antagonist that is initially being developed as a potential first line therapy for DME patients and may have the potential to deliver improved treatment outcomes for patients with wet macular degeneration (wet AMD) and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (ME-RVO). Oxurion is currently evaluating THR-687 in a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial (“INTEGRAL”) in patients with DME. Part A dose optimization data from the INTEGRAL trial is anticipated in the first half of 2022. If successful  the efficacy and safety of THR-687 versus aflibercept (the current standard of care) will be evaluated in Part B of the INTEGRAL Phase 2 clinical trial in both treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients with DME. The pre-clinical data supports the view that THR-687 provides protection in the diabetic rat against retinal vascular permeability  inflammation and reactive gliosis.Details of the presentation:TITLE: THR-687  a potent pan-RGD integrin antagonist  protects against retinal vascular permeability  inflammation and reactive gliosis in the diabetic ratPRESENTER: Tine Van Bergen  Senior Scientist  Oxurion NVPRESENTATION DATE AND TIME: Tuesday  May 3  2022  12:47 p.m. ETStory continuesAbout OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is a biopharmaceutical company developing next generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies  which are designed to better preserve vision in patients with retinal vascular disorders including diabetic macular edema (DME)  the leading cause of vision loss in diabetic patients worldwide as well as other conditions  including wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (ME-RVO).

2687,EuroNext,Bing API,https://us.acrofan.com/detail.php?number=645424,Genomic Vision Announces New Financing Line with Winance  Subject to Prior Approval of the Company's Shareholders,Genomic Vision (FR0011799907 – GV – the “Company”) (Paris:GV)  a biotechnology company that develops tools and services dedicated to the analysis and control of changes in the genome  today announces the implementation of a new financing line with Winance providing for the provision ,"BAGNEUX  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Genomic Vision (FR0011799907 – GV – the “Company”) (Paris:GV)  a biotechnology company that develops tools and services dedicated to the analysis and control of changes in the genome  today announces the implementation of a new financing line with Winance providing for the provision  subject to the prior approval of the Company's shareholders and the conditions for drawing down each tranche (in particular that the share price is not lower than the nominal value)  of a maximum of 15 financing tranches of €2 million each  i.e. up to €30 million. This financing line is intended to enable the Company to finance its activities and development over at least the next three years.In order to limit the risk that the share price would fall below the nominal value  with the consequence of suspending any drawdown under the financing facility  the extraordinary general meeting would also be asked to reduce the nominal value of a share of the Company to 0.01 euro. The Company invites all its shareholders to attend this general meeting in order to express their opinion on the resolutions to be presented. In this respect  and given the difficulty of reaching a sufficient quorum  the Company will apply to the Commercial Court for the appointment of an ad-hoc proxy to represent shareholders who are not present or represented at this General Meeting.As of the date of this press release  the Company has a cash position of €1.2 million  giving it a cash horizon at the end of May 2022  in the absence of an additional drawdown on the financing line set up in June 2020  which the Company can no longer use.Dominique Remy-Renou  CEO and President of Genomic Vision  comments: “We are delighted to be continuing our cooperation with Winance  our long-standing financier  via this major agreement that could enable us to continue our development strategy and to reach a new milestone. The results obtained over the last two years by our R&D teams in the development of new products aimed notably at the bioproduction of innovative therapies and development of potential aging and cancer biomarkers should allow us to take up a position on these markets. The financial resources will be used to expand our services portfolio and accelerate the development of these new applications. We want to make the use of our technology more accessible and automated for our clients on the research  drug industry and in-vitro diagnostics markets. This ramping up will be supported by the implementation of a strengthened organization for our R&D teams and the deployment of a sales team to accelerate our growth driven by these markets that we believe are seeing substantial demand for innovative solutions”.Objectives of the operationThis financing that would be provided by Winance aims to meet the Company’s requirements  which have been evaluated at approximately €30 million for the coming three years. These investment and growth financing requirements are based on the following key strategic priorities:- 48% would be devoted to the consolidation and strengthening of the R&D teams  the continuation of ongoing projects and the expansion of the portfolio of applications:1/Development of new high value-added solutions meeting the needs of the following markets:Genome analysis and editing  and bioproduction Research: fundamental and clinical focusing on oncology and age-related illnesses In-vitro diagnostics: HPV  FSHD and other new tests to come.2/ Improvement in the performances of the instrumentation to make it more accessible:Development of integrated systems  from the preparation of samples to the delivery and interpretation of results Automation of the instrumentation to allow its use in routine procedures.- 27% would be devoted to the consolidation and strengthening of the Sales  Support & Marketing teams:Broadening of the field coverage to meet international market needs  primarily in the United States and Europe Signing of structuring partnerships with third parties to diversify our expertise and accelerate our programs.- The remaining 25% would be devoted to covering running costs  external expenses and more generally expenses not assigned to the various elements listed above including executive compensation.The Company would be committed to draw the first four tranches of OCABSA convertible notes with warrants  representing a total net receipt of  subject to the conditions precedent indicated in the contract being met1:8 million euros after the deduction of the entire commitment fee of Winance if it is paid in the form of additional convertible notes with warrants (see below for further information on this fee)  orof 5.9 million euros should Winance’s commitment fee be paid in cash The payment of these first four tranches would extend the Company’s financing horizon through to mid-2023.Previous contract signed with Winance in June 2020The current contract with Winance concerning financing of up to €12 million was only partially used to the tune of €6 million gross (€5.7 million net after the deduction of the commitment fee due with respect to this contract) and notably allowed the Company to:- Continue pre-existing projects and implement new R&D projects that are ongoing today - Identify and work with new partners for the production of our products - Put in place and accelerate the Services activity - Revitalize the management team and incorporate new talent - Lay the cornerstones of a highly ambitious new strategy.The purpose of this new financing contract is to replace the contract signed in 2020  which can no longer be used and in any case would have expired in June 2022. Prior to the announcement of the implementation of the previous contract on June 12  2020  the share price was €0.4 and the market capitalization was €19 million. These figures were €0.11 and €7 million respectively at April 8  2022  a total of 17.7 million shares  representing 35% of the share capital at the date of implementation of the first contract  being issued to date under this contract.Terms of the operationThe effective implementation of this financing line is subject to the prior approval of Genomic Vision’s shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting organized in early May 2022 (the “EGM”).Subject to the EGM’s approval  Genomic Vision’s Executive Board should decide to issue a minimum of four tranches and could opt for the issuance of a maximum of fifteen tranches of bonds convertible into ordinary shares to which a share subscription warrant is attached (the “Warrants” and  together with the shares to which they are attached  the “OCABSA” convertible notes with equity warrants)  of €2 million tranches (the amount of each tranche may be increased by mutual consent up to €4 million on the basis of the Company’s share price)  within the limit of a bond issue of up to €30 million over a 60-month period.The OCABSA would be subscribed to by Winance or any affiliated entity (together with its affiliated entities  the “Investor”) within the framework of an issue that would be reserved for the latter.The Investor is not intending to retain the shares issued with respect to the financing line or to become a significant shareholder in the Company  but to sell them on the market as soon as possible.The Investor has no vocation to preserve the titles and remain permanently shareholder of the company but to sell them progressively on the market over reasonable timeframe.The legal terms  the main characteristics of the various instruments and the Company and Investor’s main obligations are described in the Appendix to this press release.The issuance of one or more tranches of OCABSA convertible notes with warrants attached will result in the drawing up of a prospectus requiring a visa from the AMF stock market authority  insofar as the likely resulting number of shares would exceed 20% of the capital over 12 months.Indicative schedule of the operationMid-April 2022 Convening of the EGM to decide to reduce the nominal value of a share to 0.01 euro and to approve the reserved issue of OCABSA to the Investor Mid-May 2022 EGM Mid-May 2022 Genomic Vision Executive Board meeting to decide on the issuance of the first tranche of OCABSA  subject to the EGM’s approval Mid-May 2022 The Investor subscribes to the first tranche of OCABSA for €2 000 000The Company will publish another press release when the first tranche of OCABSA convertible notes with equity warrants attached is issued.AppendixLegal framework of the operationThe OCABSA would be issued in accordance with the provisions of article L. 225-138 of the French commercial code  with shareholders’ preferential subscription rights being waived in favor of Winance.Main characteristics of the notes convertible into sharesThe convertible notes will have to be subscribed to by the Investor within ten (10) working days of the Executive Board’s decision  subject to standard conditions being met  it being specified that the Company will have to comply with a cooling off period that may not exceed a number of trading days between two tranche drawdowns determined by the following formula:V / (k x T 60 Daily); where V=amount of the tranche envisaged  k=0 25; and T 60 Daily = Average daily volume over the previous 60 trading sessions.The convertible notes will have a nominal value of 1 euro each and will be subscribed to at 96% of their par value. They will bear no interest and will have a maturity of 24 months from their issuance. When they reach maturity  the convertible notes will automatically expire and will have to be reimbursed in cash at their nominal value.They will also have to be reimbursed should certain incidences of default (as defined in the issuance contract2) occur  with a penalty equal to 2% of their nominal value.The notes may be converted into Genomic Vision shares at their holder’s discretion according to the following conversion ratio:N = Vn / P“N” corresponding to the number of new Genomic Vision ordinary shares to be issued upon conversion of one convertible note“Vn” corresponding to the amount of debt represented by the convertible note (nominal value of one convertible note  i.e.1 euro);“P” corresponding to 92% of the lowest daily volume-weighted average price of a Genomic Vision share (as reported by Bloomberg  or any equivalent provider should no figure be published by Bloomberg) over the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the day the Company receives a request to convert the convertible note in question. P may not be lower than the nominal value of a Genomic Vision share  or €0.10 euro to date  it also being specified that the next Shareholders’ Meeting will be asked to reduce this nominal value to €0.01 (this is not a prerequisite for the implementation of the financing line).The convertible notes may not be divested by their holder without the Company’s prior consent  except for transfers to one or more of the Investor’s affiliates. Moreover  the convertible notes will not be the subject of a request for admission to trading on the Euronext regulated market in Paris and will therefore not be listed.Main characteristics of the warrants attached to the convertible notesThe share subscription warrants attached to the convertible notes will give the holder the right to subscribe to two (2) ordinary shares for every five (5) share subscription warrants.The warrants will immediately be detached from the notes. They may not be divested by their holder without the Company’s prior consent  except for transfers to one or more of the Investor’s affiliates. Furthermore  the share subscription warrants will not be the subject of a request for admission to trading on the Euronext regulated market in Paris and will therefore not be listed.The warrants can be exercised for a period of 5 years from their issuance (the “Exercise Period”).The strike price of each warrant (rounded to the nearest euro cent if necessary) will be equal to 130% of the lowest daily volume-weighted average price of a Genomic Vision share (as reported by Bloomberg  or any equivalent provider should no figure be published by Bloomberg) over the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the issuance of the notes to which the warrant in question was attached  without the exercise price of a warrant able to be lower than the nominal value of a Company share.Based on a share price of 0.11 euros  the theoretical value of a warrant would be 0.078 euros.Commitment feeIn consideration of the Investor’s commitment to fund each drawdown on the financing line  the Company has agreed to pay the Investor a total commitment fee equal to €2.1 million that will be spread equally over the drawdown of the first four tranches of OCABSA convertible notes with equity warrants  payable via the offsetting of a portion of the subscription price of the OCABSA or via the issuance of additional OCABSA.New shares resulting from the conversion of notes or the exercise of warrantsThe new shares issued upon conversion of notes or exercise of warrants will carry immediate and current dividend rights (""jouissance courante""). They will carry the same rights as those attached to the Company’s ordinary shares and will be admitted to trading on the Euronext regulated market in Paris under the same listing line (ISIN FR0011799907).The Company will maintain an updated summary of the outstanding convertible notes and share subscription warrants and the number of shares in circulation on its website (www.genomicvision.com).Theoretical impact of the OCABSA issue based on the lowest daily volume-weighted average price of Genomic Vision shares over the ten trading days prior to April 11  2022  i.e. €0.11For guidance purposes  the impact of the issue of the first drawdown and of all the OCABSAs would be as follows:Impact of the issue on equity per share (based on equity as stated in the half-year accounts to June 30  2021 prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the number of shares making up the Company’s share capital at March 27  2022  i.e. 67 931 364 shares):Equity per share at June 30  2021 (in euros) Undiluted basis Diluted basis (*) 1st tranche all tranches 1sttranche all tranches Before the issue 0.06 0.15 After issuance of 20 000 000 (1st tranche) or 300 000 000 (all tranches) new shares resulting from the conversion of the convertible notes alone 0.07 0.09 0.14 0.11 After issuance of 8 000 000 (1st tranche) or 120 000 000 (all tranches) new shares resulting from the exercise of the warrants alone 0.06 0.11 0.15 0.14 After issuance of 28 000 000 (1st tranche) or 420 000 000 (all tranches) new shares resulting from the conversion of the convertible notes and exercise of the warrants 0.07 0.10 0.14 0.12 After issuance of 33 250 000 (1st tranche plus fee on first tranche) or 441 000 000 (all tranches and total fee) new shares resulting from the conversion of the convertible notes and exercise of the warrants 0.07 0.10 0.13 0.11Impact of the issue on the stake of a shareholder currently holding 1% of the Company’s share capital:Shareholder’s stake (%) Undiluted basis Diluted basis (*) 1st tranche all tranches 1st tranche all tranches Before the issue 1% 1% After issuance of 20 000 000 (1st tranche) or 300 000 000 (all tranches) new shares resulting from the conversion of the convertible notes alone 0.77% 0.18% 0.79% 0.20% After issuance of 8 000 000 (1st tranche) or 120 000 000 (all tranches) new shares resulting from the exercise of the warrants alone 0.89% 0.36% 0.90% 0.38% After issuance of 28 000 000 (1st tranche) or 420 000 000 (all tranches) new shares resulting from the conversion of the convertible notes and exercise of the warrants 0.71% 0.14% 0.73% 0.15% After issuance of 33 250 000 (1st tranche plus fee on first tranche) or 441 000 000 (all tranches and total fee) new shares resulting from the conversion of the convertible notes and exercise of the warrants 0.67% 0.13% 0.69% 0.15%(*) assuming full exercise of the share subscription warrants and “bons de souscription de parts de créateur d’entreprise” (Business Creator Share Warrants) issued and attributed by the Company  exercisable or not  giving the right to subscribe to 6 806 514 and 276 809 new shares respectively.The main risks associated with this financing are notably the following:the total amount of subscriptions to the convertible notes and the new shares the exercise of warrants would give right to is not guaranteed and will notably depend on market conditions at the time of each drawing; in particular  the drawings would be interrupted if the stock market price of a share of the Company fell below the par value;shareholders will see their stake in the Company diluted significantly as a result of the issuance of new shares issued upon conversion of the convertible notes and/or exercise of the warrants by the Investor – the dilution that could result from these issuances of new shares is illustrated above;the volatility and liquidity of the Company’s shares may fluctuate significantly;sales of the new shares issued upon conversion of the convertible notes and/or exercise of the warrants are likely to occur on the market very quickly after their issuance and to have a significant negative impact on the Company’s share price  as the Investor does not intend to remain a shareholder.in the absence of sufficient liquidity  Winance may no longer be able to sell the shares resulting from the conversion of the convertible bonds and/or the exercise of the warrants on the market  which would call into question this source of financing.***ABOUT WINANCEWinance is a global equity investor in SMEs that have a unique competitive advantage and a capacity to deliver short and long-term growth  in order to enable these companies to finance themselves competitively for growth and/or working capital needs.Website: www.winance.com***ABOUT GENOMIC VISIONGENOMIC VISION is a biotechnology company developing products and services dedicated to the analysis (structural and functional) of genome modifications as well as to the quality and safety control of these modifications  in particular in genome editing technologies and biomanufacturing processes.

This patent will protect the innovation that NFL-101 is based on through to 2036 in China.NFL Biosciences has adopted a knowledge management and protection strategy that led it to submit two patent families granting it exclusive rights to its drug candidate NFL-101. This product patent  initially registered and approved in France  concerns an “aqueous extract of tobacco leaves and its use for the treatment of dependence”. The innovation that NFL-101 is based on is therefore protected through to 2036 in France and the United States  with China to follow soon. National registration applications are also in the review phase in the following regions and countries: Japan  Canada  South Korea  Australia  Brazil  India  Indonesia  Israel  Mexico  Philippines  Eurasia  Saudi Arabia  United Arab Emirates and Nigeria.China is the country with the highest number of smokers worldwide  at over 300 million people  and around 50% of its male population smoke. If no action is taken  it is expected to see a 44% increase in smoking-related cancer deaths among men between 2020 and 2040  representing an excess mortality of 8.6 million deaths in 20 years1. Reducing smoking therefore involves significant stakes for the entire country and is an integral part of the Healthy China initiative  which aims to improve the Chinese population’s health and is targeting a 20% reduction in the overall smoking rate by 2030 for instance.Story continues“Nearly one of every three cigarettes smoked worldwide is smoked in China. Having a product patent will give us a strong level of protection as we move forward with our strategy over the coming years. This patent further strengthens the protection of the innovation behind our drug candidate NFL-101 in China  which is one of the core target markets with the global approach rolled out by NFL Biosciences. It was very important for us to have robust intellectual property in place on this high-potential market”  confirms Bruno Lafont  Chief Operating Officer and co-founder of NFL Biosciences.About NFL BiosciencesNFL Biosciences is a biopharmaceutical company based in the Montpellier area which develops botanical drug candidates for the treatment of addictions.

PXL770 is a novel  first-in-class direct adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activator that is preparing to enter into a Phase 2a clinical Proof-of-Concept (POC) biomarker study midyear  subject to additional financing.Poxel CEO  Thomas Kuhn  commented: ""Having PXL770 awarded Fast Track Designation by the FDA soon after our other promising product  PXL065  is a strong recognition of the potential of both our programs in adrenoleukodystrophy  a significant unmet medical need. Poxel aims at developing innovative treatments to improve the life of patients with serious and rare chronic diseases with metabolic pathophysiology  and the Fast Track Designation could offer PXL770 the ability to substantially accelerate the approval timeline in ALD. We are preparing the next steps to initiate our two Phase 2a clinical studies midyear  with results anticipated early 2023.""Fast Track Designation (FTD)FTD is designed to expedite development of pharmaceutical products which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs in serious or life-threatening conditions.FTD provides Poxel with substantially enhanced access to FDA  including opportunities for face-to-face meetings and written consultations throughout the remaining development of PXL770.Drugs with FTD are eligible to apply for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review at the time of a New Drug Application (NDA) submission  which may result in faster product approval.FTD also allows for 'rolling review'  whereby Poxel may submit completed sections of the NDA as they become available  rather than at the end of development.Next StepsStory continuesThe Phase 2a clinical POC biomarker studies for Poxel’s two products  PXL770 and PXL065  in X-linked ALD are  subject to additional financing  anticipated to begin midyear  with results anticipated early 2023.Fast Track DesignationIntroduced under the FDA Modernization Act (1997)  Fast Track Designation (FTD) may be awarded by the FDA to investigational drugs which treat a serious or life-threatening condition  and which fill an unmet medical need. Filling an unmet medical need is defined as providing a therapy where none exists or providing a therapy which may be potentially better than available therapy. The FDA notes that 'the purpose of the Fast Track program is to get important new drugs to the patient earlier1"". FTD must be requested by the sponsor company and must be accompanied by a detailed review of both preclinical and clinical data.The key benefits of FTD comprise enhanced access to the FDA  with regular and more frequent opportunities for consultation and discussion. In addition  drugs with FTD may be eligible for Accelerated Approval  in which a new medicine is approved prior to the availability of definitive data  and Priority Review  in which the standard 10-month review process is reduced to six months. Drugs with FTD may also enter a 'rolling review' of their NDA submission  in which sections are submitted and reviewed as they become available  substantially expediting the approval process.About ALDX-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is an orphan neurometabolic disease caused by mutations in the ABCD1 gene which encodes for a key protein that is required for metabolism of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA) by peroxisomes (cellular organelles). ALD is the most common leukodystrophy with a prevalence similar to hemophilia – up to 1/10 000 individuals in the general population have ALD [https://rarediseases.org]. Forms of this disease include cerebral ALD (C-ALD) and adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) which is the most common form – typically occurring in adolescence through adulthood. AMN is characterized by chronic and progressive distal axonopathy involving the long tracts of the spinal cord and to a lesser extent the peripheral nerves resulting in progressive stiffness and weakness in the legs  impaired gait and balance  incontinence  and loss of sensation. Nearly all men with a diagnosis of ALD will develop AMN  and many women also present with features of AMN with a later onset. C-ALD is characterized by inflammatory demyelination of cells in the brain and typically afflicts children  but many men with AMN may also develop cerebral disease; these white matter brain lesions lead to severe neurologic deficits and death. There are no approved medicines for ALD (other than glucocorticoid supplements for associated adrenal insufficiency). C-ALD when first detected in early childhood  can be treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
