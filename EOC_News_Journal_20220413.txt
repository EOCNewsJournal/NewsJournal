The shares will be repurchased in trading organised at Nasdaq Helsinki Oy’s regulated market at a price formed in public trading on the date of repurchase. The shares can be repurchased otherwise than in proportion to the existing shareholdings of the company’s shareholders. The shares will be repurchased using the company’s distributable unrestricted equity. This authorisation revokes prior authorisations granted to the board of directors to repurchase the company’s own shares. The authorisation is valid until the end of the annual general meeting of 2023  however  for a maximum of 18 months from the general meeting’s resolution on authorisation.The general meeting authorised the board of directors to decide  in one or more tranches  on the issuances of shares as well as on the issuances of option rights and other special rights entitling to shares as referred to in chapter 10  section 1 of the Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act as follows:The total maximum number of shares to be issued under the authorisation is 2 500 000 shares  which corresponds to approximately 10% of all the shares in the company. The board of directors decides on all the terms and conditions regarding the issuances of shares and the issuances of option rights and other special rights entitling to shares. The authorisation concerns both the issuance of new shares and the transfer of the company’s own shares.

The total maximum number of shares to be issued for the purpose of implementing the company’s incentive schemes is 250 000 shares  which corresponds to approximately 1% of all the shares in the company. For the avoidance of doubt  the above number of shares to be issued for the implementation of incentive schemes is included in the overall number of the issuance authorisation referred to in section 1 above.

The authorisation revokes prior share issue authorisations granted to the board of directors. The authorisation is valid until the end of the annual general meeting of 2023  however  for a maximum of 18 months from the general meeting’s resolution on share issue authorisation.Further information:Hannu NymanCFOhannu.nyman@eezy.fitel. +358 (0)50 306 9913,neutral,0.03,0.9,0.07,mixed,0.2,0.31,0.49,True,English,"['Annual General Meeting', 'Eezy Plc', 'Decisions', '12 April', 'Finnish Limited Liability Companies Act', 'shareholders’ pre-emptive subscription right', 'next annual general meeting', 'STOCK EXCHANGE RELEASE', 'Snellman Attorneys Ltd', 'Euroclear Finland Oy', 'Timo Mänty', 'KPMG Oy Ab', 'Mikko Wirén', 'reasonable traveling expenses', 'weighty financial reason', 'total maximum number', 'other special rights', 'Nasdaq Helsinki Oy', 'distributable unrestricted equity', 'consolidated financial statements', 'dividend record date', 'temporary act', 'Castrén', 'reasonable invoice', 'shareholder rights', 'option rights', 'meeting fee', 'committee meeting', 'financial year', 'Eezy Oyj', 'EEZY PLC', 'Eteläesplanadi', 'proxy representatives', 'governing bodies', 'shareholder register', 'Tapio Pajuharju', 'Kati Hagros', 'Liisa Harjula', 'Paul-Petteri Savolainen', 'Jarno Suominen', 'Mika Uotila', 'new member', 'other members', 'travelling policy', 'Esa Kailiala', 'existing shareholdings', 'directed issue', 'capital structure', 'remuneration report', 'first tranche', 'second tranche', 'monthly remuneration', 'The AGM', 'two tranches', 'following terms', 'public trading', 'prior authorisations', 'current auditor', 'responsible auditor', 'Eight members', 'share issues', 'directors’ committees', 'new shares', '2,500,000 shares', '12 APRIL', 'Decisions', '10:00 a', 'offices', 'company', 'advance', 'counterproposals', 'questions', 'notice', 'board', 'CEO', 'dividends', '26 April', '27 October', 'election', 'Story', 'chairperson', 'addition', 'accordance', 'practices', 'APA', 'fees', 'repurchase', 'conditions', 'market', 'price', 'proportion', '18 months', 'resolution', 'one', 'issuances', 'chapter', 'section', 'transfer', 'place', 'deviation', 'financing', 'implementation', 'merger', 'acquisition', 'development']",2022-04-12,2022-04-13,finance.yahoo.com

2702,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=367aab9b-6fb6-4f08-b30b-faa8c0109fdb,The Clearing and Settlement Process for Debt Securities: An Overview,1 day ago,Debt securities trading in the capital markets involves several steps before the electronic transfer of ownership from one owner to another finishes. For ownership to pass from the seller to the buyer  a “clearing” and “settlement” process must occur. The terms “clearing” and “settlement” are often used interchangeably. However  they represent distinct processes.Steps Involved in Clearing and SettlementOnce the parties execute a securities trade  the clearing and settlement processes begins. This involves several sequential actions.Confirmation : There is a confirmation of a sale of securities in a specified amount at a given price between the buyer and seller.: There is a confirmation of a sale of securities in a specified amount at a given price between the buyer and seller. Clearing : The buyer and the seller receive documentation to establish their obligations. The clearing process occurs before settlement begins.: The buyer and the seller receive documentation to establish their obligations. The clearing process occurs before settlement begins. Settlement : The settlement process involves the delivery of securities from the seller to the buyer and the delivery of funds from the buyer to the seller. While clearing and settlement can occur on the same day  the timing may be longer depending on the complexity of the transaction.: The settlement process involves the delivery of securities from the seller to the buyer and the delivery of funds from the buyer to the seller. While clearing and settlement can occur on the same day  the timing may be longer depending on the complexity of the transaction. Payment : Payment occurs through the Federal Reserve’s Fedwire system. The system assigns a reference number to confirm the receipt of funds.: Payment occurs through the Federal Reserve’s Fedwire system. The system assigns a reference number to confirm the receipt of funds. Delivery: DTC’s electronic book-entry system delivers and credits the appropriate account.Depository Trust Company (DTC)The Depository Trust Company   or DTC  is one the largest securities depositories in the world. The DTC facilitates the clearing and settlement of securities transactions. It does this by maintaining a “book-entry” system. This is an electronic method of recordkeeping  as opposed to issuing physical security certificates.Companies that are DTC eligible have access to Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) processing. This service enables companies  security holders  brokers  and other parties to electronically move securities between DTC participants in an expedited manner.The DTC also acts as a custodian and holds physical security certificates on behalf of brokers  dealers  and banks. The DTC designates Cede & Company as the custodial nominee for DTC. Debt securities are represented by the issuance of global notes  usually registered in the name of Cede & Company nominee for DTC.The DTC is a subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)  a securities holding company. Not all securities are eligible to settle through DTC. In order to be a DTC participant  a company  broker  bank  or other entity must have an account with DTC.Euroclear and ClearstreamIn Europe  the two largest clearing systems are Euroclear and Clearstream. Similar to the DTC in the United States  Euroclear and Clearstream provide settlement services for securities. Both services operate electronic book-entry transfer systems. This eliminates the need for physical certificates.A series of steps facilitate cross-market deals between DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream participants. The settlement process generally takes longer for cross-market trading.Trading Mechanics of Clearing and Settling Debt SecuritiesThere are two methods of transferring securities between brokers/dealers and the DTC—the Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian (DWAC) process and the Direct Registry System (DRS). Both use the FAST system. The electronic format of securities transfers provides investors with efficiency and cost savings.Both systems enable the holding of securities “on the books” of a transfer agent. A transfer agent is usually a trust company or bank that records transactions and maintains the financial records of investors. In other words  they act as an intermediary between the company’s registrar and investors.The Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian (DWAC) provides investors with efficiency and cost savings. As an electronic system for the transfer of shares  the DWAC process minimizes time lags. The fact that the DWAC process does not involve the transfer of physical certificates accelerates the settlement process.The Direct Registry System (DRS) also allows investors to hold their securities in book entry form with a transfer agent. This allows the seamless clearing and settling of shares in electronic form. The main distinguishing factor is that DWAC deposits require a Medallion Guaranteed Stock Power while DRS deposits are paperless. A Medallion Guaranteed Stock Power is a special certification stamp on a share certificate that confirms its authenticity. This medallion signature guarantee can be waived under certain circumstances.In order for a company to have its securities settle through the DTC  it must have a letter of representations on file. A letter of representations is a standardized agreement that outlines the terms under which the DTC will act as depository for the company.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,True,English,"['The Clearing', 'Settlement Process', 'Debt Securities', 'Overview', 'A Medallion Guaranteed Stock Power', 'The Direct Registry System', 'The Depository Trust Company', 'two largest clearing systems', 'electronic book-entry transfer systems', 'Fast Automated Securities Transfer', 'main distinguishing factor', 'special certification stamp', 'several sequential actions', 'book entry form', 'largest securities depositories', 'physical security certificates', 'electronic book-entry system', 'Debt securities trading', 'securities holding company', 'book-entry” system', 'physical certificates', 'two methods', 'electronic form', 'FAST system', 'electronic transfer', 'FAST) processing', 'security holders', 'electronic system', 'electronic method', 'cross-market trading', 'Trading Mechanics', 'transfer agent', 'Fedwire system', 'Company nominee', 'The Deposit/Withdrawal', 'capital markets', 'one owner', 'distinct processes', 'same day', 'Federal Reserve', 'reference number', 'expedited manner', 'custodial nominee', 'global notes', 'other entity', 'United States', 'cross-market deals', 'cost savings', 'financial records', 'other words', 'time lags', 'share certificate', 'The DTC', 'several steps', 'DWAC) process', 'DWAC process', 'DWAC deposits', 'securities trade', 'securities transfers', 'clearing process', 'Clearing Corporation', 'seamless clearing', 'appropriate account', 'other parties', 'settlement” process', 'settlement processes', 'DTC participants', 'DRS deposits', 'Clearstream participants', 'securities transactions', 'settlement services', 'DTC.', 'ownership', 'finishes', 'seller', 'buyer', 'terms', 'Confirmation', 'sale', 'amount', 'price', 'documentation', 'obligations', 'delivery', 'funds', 'timing', 'complexity', 'Payment', 'receipt', 'world', 'recordkeeping', 'Companies', 'access', 'brokers', 'custodian', 'behalf', 'dealers', 'banks', 'Cede', 'issuance', 'name', 'subsidiary', 'DTCC', 'order', 'Euroclear', 'Europe', 'Both', 'need', 'series', 'Settling', 'investors', 'efficiency', 'books', 'intermediary', 'registrar', 'shares']",2022-04-13,2022-04-13,lexology.com

2723,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4500927-more-than-just-oil-saudi-arabias-improved-credit-rating,More Than Just Oil: Saudi Arabia's Improved Credit Rating,As S&P stated  Saudi Arabia survived the “twin shocks” of the pandemic and the drop in oil demand and prices.,TexBr/iStock via Getty ImagesThe Russia-Ukraine war has thrown the commodities markets into chaos. At the beginning of March  oil hit $123 per barrel — up a staggering 68% this year.Since many assume the health of the Saudi economy is tied almost exclusively to this black gold  it came as little surprise when Standard & Poor’s (S&P) upgraded the country’s outlook from “stable” to “positive.” But contrary to the popular narrative  oil isn’t all that matters to the Saudi economy.As S&P stated  Saudi Arabia survived the “twin shocks” of the pandemic and the drop in oil demand and prices. As it guided OPEC through this volatile period  it stayed focused on achieving its Vision 2030 objectives despite the prevailing economic challenges.So what has changed? And is the Saudi economy on track to diversify away from oil?Oil Remains Central to the Saudi Economy  But Not Its VisionVision 2030’s goal is to reduce Saudi dependence on oil by directing investment toward other vital economic pillars and emerging sectors. This requires fundamental shifts in how businesses operate.Saudi Arabia’s crude petroleum and natural gas sector accounted for 28.1% of GDP in 2021. Real GDP expanded by 3.2% in 2021 after contracting by 4.1% in 2020. For Saudi Arabia to break even on its 2022 budget  the International Monetary Fund (IMF) estimates the price of oil needs to average $72.40 per barrel. The S&P projects an average of price $85 per barrel in 2022. That could mean a government budget surplus of 2.5% of GDP in 2022 — the first surplus since 2013.Break-Even Oil Price per Barrel to Balance 2022 National BudgetSource: IMFThe country can’t take current oil prices for granted. That’s why it is financing and developing these other sectors and building a more resilient and sustainable economy. In the past  such expenditures have been highly correlated with oil prices  but with its current plan  the government has adopted the long view and is looking beyond short-term oil price movements.Managing the Sovereign DebtSaudi Arabia established the National Debt Management Center in late 2015 to help ensure the country’s access to global debt markets as means of achieving the best possible cost structure to fund its budget deficit. Its efforts thus far have succeeded.Six years on  as of year-end 2021  around 60% of the SAR 938 billion in debt is SAR-denominated  while 40% is non-SAR. The Saudi public debt to GDP ratio is expected to continue its downward trend from 32.5% in 2019 to 25.4% in 2024  according to a Ministry of Finance (MoF) report. The MoF plans to build a unified sovereign asset and liability management framework to integrate the country’s financial and non-financial assets and liabilities.Looking ahead  the Saudi debt picture is likely to improve further. On 30 September 2021  FTSE Russell announced that the local currency Sukuk would be added to the FTSE Emerging Markets Government Bond Index (EMGBI)  effective April 2022. Around a third of Saudi Arabia’s current outstanding debt will be included in the index  which will make Saudi debt more investable and attractive while improving market liquidity.Improving International Investor AccessSaudi Arabia introduced its National Investment Strategy (NIS) in October 2021. A vital aspect of Vision 2030  the NIS seeks to make Saudi Arabia an investment hub through regulation and legislation  among other improvements to the investment landscape.The strategy seems to be working. Foreign direct investment (FDI) net inflows grew by 257.2% in 2021. The first half of fiscal 2021 broke records  the second half achieved 23.7% year-over-year gains.Among the NIS’s key goals is to increase FDI’s share of GDP from 1.5% in 2021 to 5.7% by 2030 and to accelerate overall domestic investment to SAR 1.65 trillion ($44 billion) by 2030 from SAR 600 billion ($16 billion) in 2021. From 2021 to 2030  the cumulative gross fixed capital foundation (GFCF) is expected to reach SAR 12.4 trillion ($3.3 trillion).In another major milestone  Clearstream  the post-trading services provider of Deutsche Börse Group  connected the Saudi capital markets to its network. Eligible clients no longer need to obtain “Qualified Foreign Investor” status to invest in the Saudi capital market (Sukuk/bonds and listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs)).Spearheading ESG InitiativesMoody’s current environmental  social  and governance (ESG) score for Saudi Arabia is moderately negative. The Saudi ESG Credit Impact Score (CIS-3) should improve  however  as the country expands its ESG coverage  implementation  and transparency.After all  the accelerating global momentum behind ESG measures has not gone unnoticed in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi Exchange (Tadawul) has issued ESG disclosure guidelines that set a clear  top-down tone. Given the global focus and increased ESG due diligence and regulations  the scope should widen materially. The Public Investment Fund (PIF) also unveiled its ESG strategy  which focuses on investing in renewable energy  water  and carbon management projects.Transforming the Financial Sector with Open BankingSaudi Arabia is also revolutionizing its banking sector. In the past  stability was the main priority. But the Saudi Central Bank (SAMA)’s “Open Banking Policy” will allow the country’s digitally literate population to safely share their banking data with third-party companies  thus expanding their access to integrated financial products and opening the door to fintech development in the country.SAMA will also launch the Open Data Platform  which will feature Saudi economic  financial  and monetary statistics and indicators. Users — business owners  researchers  entrepreneurs  and institutions — can export this data in various formats. The move should further improve the business climate and financial transparency in Saudi Arabia and increase the country’s appeal to investors.Creating Seedbeds for SMEs and FintechTo spur innovation  Saudi Arabia is empowering domestic small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and fintechs. The General Authority for Small and Medium Enterprises — “Monsha’at” — is building a competitive and healthy business environment to attract new entrants to the SME sector. To complement this ecosystem  it has developed various financing programs. “Kafala ” for example  is a loan guarantee initiative that helped more than 5 000 enterprises with SAR 10.2 billion ($2.7 billion) in guarantees in 2021. Vision 2030 seeks to raise the SME contribution to GDP from 20% to 35% by 2030.During the Global Entrepreneurship Congress (GEC) held in Riyadh last March  Saudi Arabia announced agreements and investment initiatives worth SAR 51.8 billion ($13.8 billion) across various industries. These initiatives along with the establishment of the new SME Bank will help the industry become an engine for economic growth. Indeed  according to the Global Competitiveness Center  Saudi Arabia is ranked 12th on the Availability of Venture Capital Index  which is among the most prominent sub-indicators.The fintech sector has lately enjoyed a concentrated push from the government. SAMA has licensed three digital banks during the past few months as well as three new fintech companies  issuing the first granted debt-based crowdfunding license and payment license. The country now boasts 17 fintech payment companies. Indeed  Saudi Arabia was recently ranked second in digital competitiveness among the G20 countries in 2021.Enhancing Strategic Support through the Public Investment Fund (PIF)The Saudi sovereign wealth fund provides strategic support to the economy and with a diversified investment portfolio of more than $500 billion in assets  serves as a national safety net.By 2025  the PIF hopes to expand its asset base to $1.1 trillion. Earlier this year  demonstrating its economic resilience and creditworthiness  the PIF received its first international credit ratings  earning an A1 issuer rating from Moody’s and a long-term issuer rating of A from Fitch.The PIF is also the primary force keeping Saudi Arabia’s “giga-projects” on track and partners with local businesses  establishing ventures  and founding enterprises to upgrade the standards of business conduct.Tapping Natural Resources and Mining OpportunitiesOil may still dominate the Saudi commodities sector  but exploration for other natural resources is ongoing. Forty-eight minerals have been found so far  including such important energy transition metals as copper and zinc.Saudi Arabia recently emphasized just how central mining investment is to its future. “[Mining is] becoming more and more essential for the advancement of manufacturing [and] energy” industries  according to Saudi industry and mineral resources minister Bandar Alkhorayef. And with an estimated $1.3 trillion in untapped minerals in Saudi Arabia  the goal is to scale the sector’s contributions to GDP from $17 billion in 2021 to $64 billion by 2030.Last January  Saudi Arabia hosted the debut Future Minerals Forum in Riyadh as part of its effort to become a regional leader in the mining sector.Saudi’s Grand Goals Are Finding RecognitionAmid its multifaceted campaign to diversify its economy  Saudi Arabia is at last earning recognition for its efforts. As the S&P report stated:“The positive outlook reflects our expectation of improving GDP growth and fiscal dynamics over the medium term  tied to the country’s emergence from the Covid-19 pandemic  improved oil sector prospects  and the government’s reform programs.”Moody’s upgraded the country’s outlook from “negative” to “stable” in November 2021. More such upgrades are likely on the way. But more important than the improved ratings themselves are the reasons behind them  specifically the country’s fiscal reforms.As the report stated  Moody’s view came down to the “government’s improving track record of fiscal policy effectiveness  evidenced by policy responses in periods of both low and high oil prices  that consistently demonstrate a commitment to fiscal consolidation and longer-term fiscal sustainability.”And if that wasn’t sufficient  the Vision framework helped grow non-oil revenues from less than 10% in 2015 to more than 18% in 2020 and helped reduce non-interest expenditures from 56% in 2015 to 53% in 2020. The growth of non-oil activities increased by 6.1% in 2021.While the recent spike in oil prices  may be good news for Saudi Arabia’s balance sheet  the country has demonstrated through its commitment to the Vision 2030 framework that its economic future will not be defined by the petroleum sector.Disclaimer: Please note that the content of this site should not be construed as investment advice  nor do the opinions expressed necessarily reflect the views of CFA Institute.Original PostEditor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.,neutral,0.22,0.72,0.05,mixed,0.11,0.18,0.71,True,English,"['Saudi Arabia', 'Credit Rating', 'Oil', 'The Saudi ESG Credit Impact Score', 'FTSE Emerging Markets Government Bond Index', 'cumulative gross fixed capital foundation', 'best possible cost structure', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'Qualified Foreign Investor” status', 'National Debt Management Center', 'other vital economic pillars', 'The Public Investment Fund', 'short-term oil price movements', 'Saudi capital markets', 'prevailing economic challenges', 'International Monetary Fund', 'liability management framework', 'carbon management projects', 'Foreign direct investment', 'natural gas sector', 'post-trading services provider', 'listed exchange-traded funds', 'clear, top-down tone', 'Spearheading ESG Initiatives', 'ESG disclosure guidelines', 'ESG due diligence', 'global debt markets', 'accelerating global momentum', 'The Saudi Exchange', '2022 National Budget Source', 'overall domestic investment', 'Saudi public debt', 'unified sovereign asset', 'International Investor Access', 'current outstanding debt', 'government budget surplus', 'Saudi debt picture', 'FDI) net inflows', 'National Investment Strategy', 'The S&P', 'Even Oil Price', 'ESG) score', 'current oil prices', 'emerging sectors', 'FTSE Russell', 'commodities markets', 'The MoF', 'Sovereign Debt', 'vital aspect', 'ESG coverage', 'ESG measures', 'ESG strategy', 'other sectors', 'current plan', 'other improvements', 'global focus', 'investment hub', 'investment landscape', 'first surplus', 'market liquidity', 'Saudi economy', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Saudi dependence', 'budget deficit', 'Getty Images', 'Russia-Ukraine war', 'black gold', 'little surprise', 'popular narrative', 'twin shocks', 'volatile period', 'fundamental shifts', 'crude petroleum', 'sustainable economy', 'long view', 'downward trend', 'MoF) report', 'non-financial assets', 'local currency', 'first half', 'second half', 'year gains', 'key goals', 'major milestone', 'Eligible clients', 'renewable energy', 'oil demand', 'Financial Secto', 'Real GDP', 'GDP ratio', 'Vision 2030 objectives', '2022 budget', 'TexBr', 'iStock', 'chaos', 'beginning', 'March', 'barrel', 'health', 'Standard', 'Poor', 'country', 'outlook', 'pandemic', 'drop', 'OPEC', 'track', 'businesses', 'IMF', 'average', 'Break', 'resilient', 'past', 'expenditures', 'means', 'efforts', 'year-end', 'SAR', 'Ministry', 'Finance', 'liabilities', '30 September', 'Sukuk', 'EMGBI', 'third', 'October', 'regulation', 'legislation', 'fiscal 2021', 'records', 'share', 'GFCF', 'Clearstream', 'network', 'ETFs', 'Moody', 'governance', 'implementation', 'transparency', 'Tadawul', 'scope', 'PIF', 'water']",2022-04-12,2022-04-13,seekingalpha.com
2724,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=367aab9b-6fb6-4f08-b30b-faa8c0109fdb,The Clearing and Settlement Process for Debt Securities: An Overview,1 day ago,Debt securities trading in the capital markets involves several steps before the electronic transfer of ownership from one owner to another finishes. For ownership to pass from the seller to the buyer  a “clearing” and “settlement” process must occur. The terms “clearing” and “settlement” are often used interchangeably. However  they represent distinct processes.Steps Involved in Clearing and SettlementOnce the parties execute a securities trade  the clearing and settlement processes begins. This involves several sequential actions.Confirmation : There is a confirmation of a sale of securities in a specified amount at a given price between the buyer and seller.: There is a confirmation of a sale of securities in a specified amount at a given price between the buyer and seller. Clearing : The buyer and the seller receive documentation to establish their obligations. The clearing process occurs before settlement begins.: The buyer and the seller receive documentation to establish their obligations. The clearing process occurs before settlement begins. Settlement : The settlement process involves the delivery of securities from the seller to the buyer and the delivery of funds from the buyer to the seller. While clearing and settlement can occur on the same day  the timing may be longer depending on the complexity of the transaction.: The settlement process involves the delivery of securities from the seller to the buyer and the delivery of funds from the buyer to the seller. While clearing and settlement can occur on the same day  the timing may be longer depending on the complexity of the transaction. Payment : Payment occurs through the Federal Reserve’s Fedwire system. The system assigns a reference number to confirm the receipt of funds.: Payment occurs through the Federal Reserve’s Fedwire system. The system assigns a reference number to confirm the receipt of funds. Delivery: DTC’s electronic book-entry system delivers and credits the appropriate account.Depository Trust Company (DTC)The Depository Trust Company   or DTC  is one the largest securities depositories in the world. The DTC facilitates the clearing and settlement of securities transactions. It does this by maintaining a “book-entry” system. This is an electronic method of recordkeeping  as opposed to issuing physical security certificates.Companies that are DTC eligible have access to Fast Automated Securities Transfer (FAST) processing. This service enables companies  security holders  brokers  and other parties to electronically move securities between DTC participants in an expedited manner.The DTC also acts as a custodian and holds physical security certificates on behalf of brokers  dealers  and banks. The DTC designates Cede & Company as the custodial nominee for DTC. Debt securities are represented by the issuance of global notes  usually registered in the name of Cede & Company nominee for DTC.The DTC is a subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (DTCC)  a securities holding company. Not all securities are eligible to settle through DTC. In order to be a DTC participant  a company  broker  bank  or other entity must have an account with DTC.Euroclear and ClearstreamIn Europe  the two largest clearing systems are Euroclear and Clearstream. Similar to the DTC in the United States  Euroclear and Clearstream provide settlement services for securities. Both services operate electronic book-entry transfer systems. This eliminates the need for physical certificates.A series of steps facilitate cross-market deals between DTC and Euroclear or Clearstream participants. The settlement process generally takes longer for cross-market trading.Trading Mechanics of Clearing and Settling Debt SecuritiesThere are two methods of transferring securities between brokers/dealers and the DTC—the Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian (DWAC) process and the Direct Registry System (DRS). Both use the FAST system. The electronic format of securities transfers provides investors with efficiency and cost savings.Both systems enable the holding of securities “on the books” of a transfer agent. A transfer agent is usually a trust company or bank that records transactions and maintains the financial records of investors. In other words  they act as an intermediary between the company’s registrar and investors.The Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian (DWAC) provides investors with efficiency and cost savings. As an electronic system for the transfer of shares  the DWAC process minimizes time lags. The fact that the DWAC process does not involve the transfer of physical certificates accelerates the settlement process.The Direct Registry System (DRS) also allows investors to hold their securities in book entry form with a transfer agent. This allows the seamless clearing and settling of shares in electronic form. The main distinguishing factor is that DWAC deposits require a Medallion Guaranteed Stock Power while DRS deposits are paperless. A Medallion Guaranteed Stock Power is a special certification stamp on a share certificate that confirms its authenticity. This medallion signature guarantee can be waived under certain circumstances.In order for a company to have its securities settle through the DTC  it must have a letter of representations on file. A letter of representations is a standardized agreement that outlines the terms under which the DTC will act as depository for the company.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,True,English,"['The Clearing', 'Settlement Process', 'Debt Securities', 'Overview', 'A Medallion Guaranteed Stock Power', 'The Direct Registry System', 'The Depository Trust Company', 'two largest clearing systems', 'electronic book-entry transfer systems', 'Fast Automated Securities Transfer', 'main distinguishing factor', 'special certification stamp', 'several sequential actions', 'book entry form', 'largest securities depositories', 'physical security certificates', 'electronic book-entry system', 'Debt securities trading', 'securities holding company', 'book-entry” system', 'physical certificates', 'two methods', 'electronic form', 'FAST system', 'electronic transfer', 'FAST) processing', 'security holders', 'electronic system', 'electronic method', 'cross-market trading', 'Trading Mechanics', 'transfer agent', 'Fedwire system', 'Company nominee', 'The Deposit/Withdrawal', 'capital markets', 'one owner', 'distinct processes', 'same day', 'Federal Reserve', 'reference number', 'expedited manner', 'custodial nominee', 'global notes', 'other entity', 'United States', 'cross-market deals', 'cost savings', 'financial records', 'other words', 'time lags', 'share certificate', 'The DTC', 'several steps', 'DWAC) process', 'DWAC process', 'DWAC deposits', 'securities trade', 'securities transfers', 'clearing process', 'Clearing Corporation', 'seamless clearing', 'appropriate account', 'other parties', 'settlement” process', 'settlement processes', 'DTC participants', 'DRS deposits', 'Clearstream participants', 'securities transactions', 'settlement services', 'DTC.', 'ownership', 'finishes', 'seller', 'buyer', 'terms', 'Confirmation', 'sale', 'amount', 'price', 'documentation', 'obligations', 'delivery', 'funds', 'timing', 'complexity', 'Payment', 'receipt', 'world', 'recordkeeping', 'Companies', 'access', 'brokers', 'custodian', 'behalf', 'dealers', 'banks', 'Cede', 'issuance', 'name', 'subsidiary', 'DTCC', 'order', 'Euroclear', 'Europe', 'Both', 'need', 'series', 'Settling', 'investors', 'efficiency', 'books', 'intermediary', 'registrar', 'shares']",2022-04-13,2022-04-13,lexology.com

2732,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://plainsmenpost.com/etf-march-round-up-crypto-and-nickel-on-top/,ETF March Round-up: Crypto and Nickel on Top,1 day ago,The top 20 list of exchange traded products is led in March by two 21Shares’ crypto ETPs. One is exposed to Aave  which is an open-source  decentralized lending protocol built on the Ethereum platform and Solana.Then there are four trackers exposed to nickel. The industrial metal  which used mainly to make stainless steel  coins and batteries  including those used in hybrid vehicles  experienced last month a “short squeeze”. This involves a sharp rise in the value of an asset that forces short investors – namely those who had bet on a fall in that same asset – to buy it to avoid losing everything  which of course pushes the price up even further.On March 8  nickel futures hit an all-time high of more than $100 000 per ton  with an intraday jump of 90%  forcing the London Metal Exchange to suspend trading for a week and introduce a series of trading limits once it reopened.Russia accounts for around 10% of global nickel production and traders are concerned that supplies could be severely constrained by Western sanctions on Moscow. “The risk that there could be another short squeeze in the near term remains high in the nickel market ” reads a recent note released by S&P Global Commodity Insight  “so we have increased our forecast for the price of this metal in 2022 by 46 % to $32 868 a tonne.”“A short-term risk of another short squeeze in the nickel market remains”  the note adds.The price of natural gas also continues to be affected by the war in Ukraine and geopolitical tensions. Indeed  traders fear that Russian gas supplies (which largely pass through Ukraine) could be cut off as the conflict escalates or that Russian gas supplied through other pipelines could be halted by Western sanctions. According to many experts  alternatives such as liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States would struggle to fill the hole left if Russian exports were to be cut off  in addition to the fact that prices would rise sharply.Finally  the general rise in commodity prices is benefiting exporting countries  especially Brazil  which is seeing the real recover against the US dollar  at its highest level for two years  and its domestic equity market outperform the emerging countries as a whole (ETFs exposed to Brazilian stocks are not included in the table  as they come just after the 15th position  with returns ranging from 15.2% to 16% in March).The LaggardsOn March 4  Euronext  Borsa Italiana  Deutsche Boerse and the London Stock Exchange suspended trading on several Russia ETFs until further notice. The move came after all ETF issuers offering exposure to Russia were forced to halt primary market trading after liquidity in the underlying holdings vanished. The Moscow Stock Exchange has been closed since February 28 (it partially reopened on March 24) after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions imposed by western economies sent markets into free fall. Those ETFs  therefore  were not considered for our rankings for the month.The bottom three podium is occupied by three trackers of the STOXX Europe 600 Retail Index (provided by Invesco  iShares and Lyxor). Stocks exposed to the retail sector have been particularly affected by the substantial failure of the peace negotiations between Moscow and kyiv and the uncertainty surrounding the development of the conflict  with fears of the possible economic consequences of Western sanctions on European economies weighing heavily.Chinese equities also struggled  hit by one of the most volatile months ever. Stocks suffered from a new wave of Coronavirus cases that shook the country last month and convinced the authorities in Beijing to opt for new lockdowns. According to Morningstar research  Chinese equities are trading on average at a 32% discount to fair value (in euros  as of April 7)  but inviting valuations alone are not a good reason to jump in.Over the past 20 years  Chinese equities have roughly matched the after-inflation return posted by the stronger developed markets  and they have exceeded those of stock market underperformers such as Japan  Spain  and Italy. However  given the high volatility of Chinese stocks  their risk/reward profile has been less attractive. Morningstar columnist John Rekenthaler looks at the problem with Chinese investing in his recent “What Went Wrong?” column.The Biggest ETFsAbove is an overview of the biggest European-domiciled ETPs in terms of assets  which could be more appropriate to consider among core holdings. Performances in March 2022 go from 4.67% of the iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (CSP1) and Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (VUSD)  down to the iShares Core € Corp Bond ETF (IEAC)  which lost 1.22% last month.MethodologyAccording to Morningstar data  there are about 73 percentage points between the best and worst performing European exchange-traded products (ETPs) in March  with returns for the month ranging from 57.2% to -16%.We have looked at the key trends in the third month of the year  excluding inverse and leveraged funds. These instruments  being purely passive products  reflect the evolution of the markets without the bias (good or bad) of an active manager.Monthly top and flop performers often coincide with very volatile and therefore risky products  which should play a satellite role in your portfolio.,neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,negative,0.01,0.1,0.88,True,English,"['March Round-up', 'ETF', 'Crypto', 'Nickel', 'Top', 'Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF', 'S&P Global Commodity Insight', 'iShares Core S&P 500 ETF', 'iShares Core € Corp Bond ETF', 'worst performing European exchange-traded products', 'open-source, decentralized lending protocol', 'STOXX Europe 600 Retail Index', 'two 21Shares’ crypto ETPs', 'The Moscow Stock Exchange', 'London Stock Exchange', 'global nickel production', 'possible economic consequences', 'stock market underperformers', 'biggest European-domiciled ETPs', 'bottom three podium', 'London Metal Exchange', 'domestic equity market', 'liquefied natural gas', 'stronger developed markets', 'The Biggest ETFs', 'primary market trading', 'Russian gas supplies', 'several Russia ETFs', 'ETF issuers', 'core holdings', 'European economies', 'commodity prices', 'two years', 'The Laggards', 'retail sector', 'passive products', 'three trackers', 'nickel market', 'Russian exports', 'top 20 list', 'Ethereum platform', 'four trackers', 'industrial metal', 'stainless steel', 'hybrid vehicles', 'short squeeze', 'sharp rise', 'short investors', 'nickel futures', 'time high', 'intraday jump', 'Western sanctions', 'near term', 'geopolitical tensions', 'other pipelines', 'many experts', 'United States', 'general rise', 'exporting countries', 'real recover', 'US dollar', 'highest level', 'emerging countries', '15th position', 'Borsa Italiana', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'underlying holdings', 'subsequent sanctions', 'western economies', 'substantial failure', 'peace negotiations', 'Chinese equities', 'volatile months', 'new wave', 'Coronavirus cases', 'new lockdowns', 'Morningstar research', 'good reason', 'past 20 years', 'inflation return', 'high volatility', 'risk/reward profile', 'Morningstar columnist', 'John Rekenthaler', 'Chinese investing', 'Morningstar data', '73 percentage points', 'key trends', 'leveraged funds', 'trading limits', 'same asset', 'recent note', 'short-term risk', 'Brazilian stocks', 'free fall', 'fair value', 'Chinese stocks', 'third month', 'March', 'Aave', 'Solana', 'coins', 'batteries', 'everything', 'ton', 'week', 'series', 'traders', 'forecast', 'Ukraine', 'conflict', 'alternatives', 'LNG', 'hole', 'addition', 'fact', 'table', 'returns', 'Euronext', 'notice', 'move', 'exposure', 'liquidity', 'February', 'invasion', 'rankings', 'Invesco', 'Lyxor', 'kyiv', 'uncertainty', 'development', 'fears', 'country', 'authorities', 'Beijing', '32% discount', 'euros', 'April', 'valuations', 'Japan', 'Spain', 'Italy', 'problem', 'overview', 'terms', 'assets', 'Performances', 'CSP', 'VUSD', 'IEAC', 'Methodology', 'best', 'inverse', 'instruments', 'evolution', '57.']",2022-04-13,2022-04-13,plainsmenpost.com

(NASDAQ: VEON) (Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a leading global provider of connectivity and digital services  today confirms that on 7 April 2022 VEON received notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (""Nasdaq"") that VEON is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5550(a)(2).The Minimum Bid Price notification has no immediate effect on the continued listing status of VEON's American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") on Nasdaq. Furthermore  VEON's business operations are not affected by the receipt of the notification.Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of USD 1.00 per share and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of VEON's ADSs for the 30 consecutive business days ended 6 April 2022  VEON no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement.In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A)  VEON has an initial grace period of 180 calendar days  or until 4 October 2022 (the ""Compliance Period"")  to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. During this time  VEON's common stock will continue to be listed and traded on Nasdaq. If  at any time during the Compliance Period  the bid price for VEON's ADSs closes at USD 1.00 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days  Nasdaq will provide notification to VEON that it complies with the minimum bid price requirement  unless Nasdaq exercises its discretion to extend this 10 day period requirement pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(F).In the event VEON does not regain compliance within the 180 calendar day Compliance Period and it complies with all other listing standards and requirements  VEON may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day Compliance Period.Story continuesVEON intends to monitor the closing bid price of its ADSs and may  if appropriate  consider available options to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. There can be no assurance that VEON will regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement during the Compliance Period  secure a second period of 180 days to regain compliance or maintain compliance with the other Nasdaq listing requirements.VEON is also listed on the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange and the Minimum Bid Price notification from Nasdaq does not affect VEON's compliance status with its Euronext Amsterdam listing.DisclaimerThis release contains ""forward-looking statements""  as the phrase is defined in Section 27A of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933  as amended  and Section 21E of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended.

KGL  the project developer  will retain the remaining 30% of the share capital of NewGen  which will be jointly owned by KGL and an investment vehicle that will allow for the inclusion of additional local investors. HDF Energy is thus leveraging its technological expertise in hydrogen  its know-how in the development of green energy plants and its local presence in the Caribbean.When completed  the 200+ Million USD NewGen plant will be the world largest clean hydrogen producing facility of its kind  using a smart combination of solar and energy efficiency-sourced power. It will competitively generate carbon-free hydrogen to meet 20% of the hydrogen requirement for an existing world-scale ammonia plant in the petrochemical hub of Point Lisas  Trinidad. Once up and running  the project will save approximately 200 000 t/CO2 per year.As a global pioneer in hydrogen power  HDF will add its in-depth experience in hydrogen technologies  procurement and project finance  to the Trinidad-specific energy and ammonia expertise contained within the KGL project development team. This is the third major investment in the Caribbean this last year for HDF  which announced hybrid “Renewstable®” baseload power plants using green hydrogen and solar power in French Guiana and Barbados alongside its regional partner and investor  RUBIS.Together  KGL and HDF will select the optimal electrolysis technology provider from a competitive evaluation process. KGL has also recently been granted the outline planning permission for the NewGen Project by the Ministry of Planning of Trinidad and Tobago  and has made progress in further confirming the economic and financial viability of NewGen.Commenting on the HDF majority acquisition  KGL’s Chairman Philip Julien said  “KGL welcomes this significant endorsement and investment in NewGen by HDF  and looks forward to our collaboration and sharing of expertise. Our partnership enables improved local access to international finance and technology  optimum opportunities for local ownership  and an acceleration of Trinidad and Tobago’s energy transition commitments.”Damien HAVARD  CEO of HDF Energy said: “We believe we have the ideal partners in Kenesjay Green  given their extensive knowledge of the industry  business acumen and their commitment to local development. Our investment in NewGen affirms our belief that Trinidad and Tobago’s energy industry offers a unique opportunity for the development of world scale and cost competitive carbon-free Hydrogen. This project demonstrates that green solutions can effectively support the transition of hydrocarbon-based economies like Trinidad and Tobago – and HDF is poised to be a part of leading the change.”ABOUT HDF ENERGYHDF Energy is a global pioneer in hydrogen energy.

2753,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volta-finance-limited-net-asset-161500734.html,Volta Finance Limited: Net Asset Value as at 31 March 2022,Volta Finance Limited (VTA / VTAS) – March 2022 monthly report NOT FOR RELEASE  DISTRIBUTION  OR PUBLICATION  IN WHOLE OR PART  IN OR INTO THE UNITED STATES ...,"Volta Finance LimitedVolta Finance Limited (VTA / VTAS) – March 2022 monthly reportNOT FOR RELEASE  DISTRIBUTION  OR PUBLICATION  IN WHOLE OR PART  IN OR INTO THE UNITED STATES*****Guernsey  12 April 2022AXA IM has published the Volta Finance Limited (the “Company” or “Volta Finance” or “Volta”) monthly report for March. The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYMarch saw a good recovery from the losses experienced in February following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. At the end of March  the fund gained 1.5% which leaves the year-to-date performance at -0.8% as some of the uncertainty from the invasion lingers and as consequences on the markets persist.Turning to the broad asset classes  the monthly performances** were: +1.0% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +1.4% for CLO equity tranches; +0.8% for CLO debt; +0.0% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (together representing 2.8% of NAV).In recent weeks  both the US and the European loan markets saw price increases. Relative to end-of-year levels  loan prices are now down by roughly 1% in the US and 1.5% in Europe on average. Similarly  the percentage of loans trading below 85% has barely increased  confirming our initial analysis that there are very few borrowers  both in the European and the US loan markets that have significant exposure (either revenue or production) to the countries directly involved in the crisis (Russia  Ukraine  and Belarus).The outlook for Volta turns principally  therefore  upon the macro-economic consequences of the war. Especially in Europe  a commodity crisis and the economic sanctions against Russia are increasing recession risks and we lack clarity regarding the length and strength of these issues. In the US  the focus is now more on the abrupt pivot from the US Federal Reserve with a heightened risk of policy error. The Fed is now expected to act rapidly and abruptly to fight against inflation. This is likely to impact housing affordability and household confidence is already declining.Story continuesWe clearly have entered into a period of more uncertainty and higher volatility in financial markets. As always  it may generate stress with a potential rise in default rates this year and next  but it should also generate opportunities (inside CLOs  buying loans at a discount or new loans with far higher spread and  for Volta being able to purchase BB CLO tranches at an attractive spread).When looking at the example of the US CLO market  since the Russian invasion on February 24th  the increase of CLO debt spreads (for AAA/AA/A tranches at least) is relatively modest (in the area of 15/20bps) thanks to the solid demand that persists for floating-rate instruments. So that the arbitrage for USD CLO Equity tranches is still good. There has been almost no increase in CCC loan buckets to date and we expect Volta's ongoing cashflows to stay high.For the 6 months ended March 2022  Volta received €21.3m interest and coupons representing a 16.4% annualized return on NAV. This strong cash flow continues to underpin Volta’s dividend (currently set at 8% of NAV per annum) and provides useful reinvestment opportunities. A dividend of €0.15 per share was declared in March and  at this level  has now almost fully regained the level of dividend payment before Covid. We do not anticipate any negative impacts on cash flows in the foreseeable future.As at the end of March 2022  Volta’s NAV was €258.3m or €7.06 per share ex-dividend.*It should be noted that approximately 8.3% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 2.0% as at 28 February 2022  5.7% as at 31 January 2022  and 0.6% as at 30 September 2021.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas Securities Services S.C.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Indeed  after a two-month shutdown at the beginning of the year (waiting for the renewal and extension of the operating permit) which represented a loss of 4 500 tons  the Sines unit produced 21 960 tons over the year  including a historical record of 13 889 tons in the second half.

This will lead to a delivery of the unit in May 2022. As of December 31  2021  the construction of the unit was 93% complete  corresponding to a turnover of €3.7M.The increase in personnel costs is €0.16 million. This is linked to the freezing of variable remuneration in 2020 and to general cost control.External expenses increased by €1.45 million  entirely attributable to the start-up of the Marseille unit.The financial result has deteriorated by €1 million  due to the entry into force in 2022  on the basis of the 2021 accounts  of the ""royalty fees"" on the loan from the European Investment Bank.

The change in cash flow is analyzed as follows:It should be noted that the closing cash position is impacted by the change in operating working capital. Indeed  the first payment related to the sale of the Scarabox® (2.4M€) as well as the reimbursement of the 2020 research tax credit (0.4M€) were received at the beginning of 2022  and not at the end of 2021 as expected.Finally  it is recalled that the parent company  Ecoslops SA  has completed at the end of October 2021 a capital increase in cash with cancellation of the preferential subscription right of 6.1 M€ (net of fees and commissions).PerspectivesRegarding P2R  Ecoslops is engaged in discussions about possible locations in the ports of Antwerp  Singapore and the Suez Canal (for the latter  the prerequisite is the installation of a collection station for marine residues). Even if the commercial process has been slowed down by the health crisis  the group's ambition is to sign one of these three projects in 2022. In this respect  in October 2021 the group signed a partnership agreement with Mercuria Energy Group  the purpose of which is to study together the feasibility of port infrastructure projects for the collection and recycling of hydrocarbon residues in the Middle East and South East Asia.For the Sines unit in Portugal  the company plans to produce around 25 000 tonnes in 2022.For the Marseille unit  after a start of operation in 2021 which produced 1 500 tons  the objective for 2022 is to continue to make the installation reliable and to gradually increase its capacity in order to produce 10 000 tons  then to reach full capacity in the following years.Regarding the Scarabox®  Ecoslops continues to develop a portfolio of prospects  the most advanced of which are located on the African continent. To accelerate the commercial development and to gain a foothold on this virgin market  the group has signed a technical and commercial partnership with Greenflow  a company offering feedstock treatment equipment upstream of the Scarabox® vacuum distillation column. The objective for 2022 is to contract two new sales. It is reminded that the Group's strategy is to be a minority shareholder in Scarabox® projects in order to guarantee a long term technical and industrial support to the customer companies. In this perspective  the group has taken in February 2022 a 17% stake in the capital of Valtech Energy for an amount of 600k€.ESGThe results of the Gaïa Research 2021 evaluation campaign (covering the year 2020) were published in February 2022 and confirmed the group's continued progress in terms of ESG performance. With an overall score of 68/100  an increase of 5 points compared to the previous year  the group ranks 12th /140 on the scope of companies with less than €150 million in turnover (compared to 12th / 78 in the previous campaign). With a score of 85/100 for environmental criteria  the company is above the industry sector benchmark (61/100 on average)  as well as in the social field with 70/100 (compared to 59/100 for the benchmark)  and is progressing in terms of governance with 64/100 (within the benchmark average).The Ecoslops Group is committed to continuous improvement of its ESG performance.Financial calendarCombined Shareholders' Meeting : 9 June 2022Publication of half-yearly results: 21 September 2022A PROPOS D’ECOSLOPSEcoslops est cotée sur Euronext Growth à ParisCode ISIN : FR0011490648 - Mnémonique : ALESA / éligible PEA-PME.Contact Relations investisseurs : info.esa@ecoslops.com - +33 (0)1 83 64 47 43Ecoslops fait entrer le pétrole dans l’économie circulaire grâce à une technologie innovante  permettant de produire du carburant et du bitume léger à partir de résidus pétroliers.

In this respect  in October 2021 the group signed a partnership agreement with Mercuria Energy Group  the purpose of which is to study together the feasibility of port infrastructure projects for the collection and recycling of hydrocarbon residues in the Middle East and South East Asia.For the Sines unit in Portugal  the company plans to produce around 25 000 tonnes in 2022.For the Marseille unit  after a start of operation in 2021 which produced 1 500 tons  the objective for 2022 is to continue to make the installation reliable and to gradually increase its capacity in order to produce 10 000 tons  then to reach full capacity in the following years.Regarding the Scarabox®  Ecoslops continues to develop a portfolio of prospects  the most advanced of which are located on the African continent. To accelerate the commercial development and to gain a foothold on this virgin market  the group has signed a technical and commercial partnership with Greenflow  a company offering feedstock treatment equipment upstream of the Scarabox® vacuum distillation column. The objective for 2022 is to contract two new sales. It is reminded that the Group's strategy is to be a minority shareholder in Scarabox® projects in order to guarantee a long term technical and industrial support to the customer companies. In this perspective  the group has taken in February 2022 a 17% stake in the capital of Valtech Energy for an amount of 600k€.ESGThe results of the Gaïa Research 2021 evaluation campaign (covering the year 2020) were published in February 2022 and confirmed the group's continued progress in terms of ESG performance. With an overall score of 68/100  an increase of 5 points compared to the previous year  the group ranks 12th /140 on the scope of companies with less than €150 million in turnover (compared to 12th / 78 in the previous campaign). With a score of 85/100 for environmental criteria  the company is above the industry sector benchmark (61/100 on average)  as well as in the social field with 70/100 (compared to 59/100 for the benchmark)  and is progressing in terms of governance with 64/100 (within the benchmark average).The Ecoslops Group is committed to continuous improvement of its ESG performance.Financial calendarCombined Shareholders' Meeting : 9 June 2022Publication of half-yearly results: 21 September 2022A PROPOS D’ECOSLOPSEcoslops est cotée sur Euronext Growth à ParisCode ISIN : FR0011490648 - Mnémonique : ALESA / éligible PEA-PME.Contact Relations investisseurs : info.esa@ecoslops.com - +33 (0)1 83 64 47 43Ecoslops fait entrer le pétrole dans l’économie circulaire grâce à une technologie innovante  permettant de produire du carburant et du bitume léger à partir de résidus pétroliers.

Together these indicate that the alfapump can not only dramatically reduce the need for therapeutic paracentesis and improve the quality of life for patients with recurrent or refractory liver ascites  but also the twelve-month survival compares favourably with the published literature. Having completed patient enrolment and implants  we are on track to report the study primary endpoint towards year-end. This study is an important step in bringing the alfapump to North American patients  our key growth market  and we currently foresee Premarket Approval submission to the FDA in mid-2023.Story continues“The clinical story for DSR as a heart failure therapy continues to build. Topline data from RED DESERT demonstrated that repeated DSR therapy can safely manage the fluid and sodium balance in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients  as well as improve their cardio-renal status and durably restore their diuretic response. With this evidence  we progressed into decompensated heart failure patients in our SAHARA DESERT study  and the interim results show the ability of DSR to rapidly eliminate persistent congestion  in addition to the benefits shown in RED DESERT.“We are making good progress with our proprietary DSR Infusate 2.0  a sodium-free dextrose / icodextrin solution that we anticipate to have a superior therapeutic and safety profile as well as robust Intellectual Property protection. Pre-clinical activities are underway to support its use in MOJAVE DESERT  a phase 1b/2a study in the U.S. evaluating short-term DSR therapy in decompensated heart failure patients anticipated to start in the second half of this year.”2021 Highlightsalfapump in liver diseasePOSEIDON – Strong progress and derisking of North American pivotal study of the alfa pump in recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis Completed patient enrolment in December 2021  with 71 patients enrolled in the Pivotal Cohort. Reported a second interim analysis in July 2021 on 26 patients from the Roll-In Cohort  reaffirming the previous positive efficacy results and providing longer-term evidence of the reduction in therapeutic paracentesis (TP) and continued improvements in quality of life. Data from this Roll-In Cohort substantially exceeded the primary endpoints as defined for the Pivotal Cohort in the study 1   demonstrating: over 90% reduction in mean frequency of TP versus baseline (versus primary endpoint of at least 50% reduction)  all patients having at least a 50% reduction in mean frequency of TP per month versus baseline (versus primary endpoint of at least 50% of patients)  clinically important improvement in quality of life maintained even up to 12 months post-implantation  and safety profile in line with expectations.Key Opinion Leader (KOL) event endorsed alfa pump market potential Hosted a KOL event in July 2021 with two leading KOLs from the Mayo Clinic Arizona  Hugo E. Vargas  M.D. and Grace Knuttinen  M.D.  Ph.D.  who discussed the impact of ascites on patients' quality of life and the limitations of current treatment options  along with their experience of alfa pump implantation.DSR in heart failureRED DESERT – Clinical proof-of-concept of repeated alfa pump DSR therapy in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients Reported strong top-line results in May 2021 in eight euvolemic heart failure patients on high dose diuretics  demonstrating that alfa pump DSR (i) is highly effective at safely managing fluid and sodium balance  (ii) dramatically improved diuretic response and the benefit was maintained in long-term follow-up  and (iii) significantly improved cardio-renal function. Following the six-week study  patients continued to be followed for up to 19 months 2 . All patients had a reduction in their oral loop diuretic dose ranging from 40% to 96% at their last visit within the follow-up period (9-19 months after last DSR treatment in the study)  showing significant durability to the improvement in diuretic responsiveness following alfa pump DSR therapy. Dr. Testani presented these results as a late-breaker at the European Society of Cardiology's Heart Failure 2021 Online Congress and they were selected as one of the highlights of the Congress.SAHARA DESERT – Strong interim results of ongoing safety and feasibility study of alfa pump DSR in decompensated diuretic-resistant heart failure patients with persistent congestion Reported positive interim results from six patients in December 2021. This analysis showed that alfa pump DSR can (i) safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate persistent congestion and restore euvolemia in diuretic-resistant heart failure patients  (ii) considerably benefit their cardio-renal status  and (iii) dramatically improve their diuretic responsiveness for months post-treatment.Key DSR and alfa pump DSR patents granted in U.S. and Europe Key patents were granted in the U.S. and European Union in January 2021  covering the alfa pump DSR and its method of operation.DSR development programme on track Made strong progress in the Chemistry  Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) and pre-clinical development work of Sequana Medical's proprietary DSR Infusate 2.0  a second generation infusate with a superior therapeutic and safety profile as well as robust Intellectual Property (IP) protection to drive a high margin recurring revenue stream to accompany alfa pump DSR sales. Expanded the DSR development programme with short-term DSR therapy (without the alfa pump) to derisk the regulatory process  support faster adoption of the DSR therapy in the clinical community  expand potential market opportunity and target earlier entry into the U.S. market.CorporateMedical Device Single Audit Program (MDSAP) certification Received MDSAP certification from Sequana Medical's auditing organisation British Standards Institution (BSI) in November 2021  thereby expanding the Company's Quality Management System (QMS) towards the U.S. and Canada within the scope of design  development  production and distribution of active implantable pump systems to transport fluids within the body.Jackie Fielding appointed as independent Non-Executive Director Appointed Jackie Fielding as independent Non-Executive Director of the Company  a former Vice President of medical technology company Medtronic and ex-head of their UK and Ireland business  effective as of 1 September 2021.€22.5 million raised in an equity placement Raised €22.5 million in February 2021 in an equity placement via an accelerated book building offering from existing investors and new local and international life sciences investors and industry experts.Cash position of €9.6 million at the end of December 2021  compared to €11.0 million at the end of December 2020.Post-period eventsEuropean Medical Device Regulation (MDR) certification Received MDR certification from the Company’s Notified Body  BSI  in February 2022  confirming that its QMS and alfa pump system are compliant with the latest regulatory standards required for medical devices in Europe. alfa pump is one of the first novel Class III active implantable medical devices to be certified.€28.4 million raised in an equity placement Raised €28.4 million in March 2022 in an equity placement via an accelerated book building offering from a new investor  Partners in Equity V B.V. and existing shareholders  extending the cash runway into Q2 2023.Completion of alfa pump implantations in POSEIDON and encouraging survival data at 12 months vs. published literature Announced completion of alfa pump implantations in the POSEIDON pivotal study in April 2022 and reported a preliminary interim analysis 3 of patient survival in the Roll-In cohort indicating a 70% survival rate at one year post-implantation  comparing favourably to published literature of only 50% survival for refractory ascites patients after one year. 4Outlook for 20222022 is on track to be a landmark year for Sequana Medical with the primary endpoint read-out of POSEIDON  the North American pivotal study of the alfapump expected in Q4 2022 and the start of MOJAVE DESERT  the first U.S. study with the Company's proprietary DSR Infusate 2.0 in decompensated heart failure patients  as well as other key value drivers throughout the year.POSEIDON – North American pivotal study of the alfa pump in recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis: Reporting of primary endpoint planned for Q4 2022 Premarket Approval (PMA) submission to the U.S. FDA expected in mid-2023SAHARA DESERT – phase 2a safety and feasibility study of alfa pump DSR in decompensated heart failure patients:Completion of patient enrolment expected in H1 2022 Reporting of top-line data expected in H2 2022MOJAVE DESERT – phase 1b/2a safety and feasibility study in the U.S. of short-term DSR therapy using the proprietary DSR Infusate 2.0 in decompensated heart failure patients:Study due to commence before end of yearDetailed financial reviewin Thousand Euros FY 2021 FY 2020 Change Revenue 371 963 -62% Cost of goods sold (77) (202) -62% Gross margin 294 761 -61% Sales & Marketing (2 079) (2 322) -10% Clinical (7 798) (6 108) +28% Quality & Regulatory (3 215) (2 232) +44% Supply Chain (2 716) (1 636) +66% Engineering (3 206) (1 859) +72% General & Administration (5 098) (4 417) +15% Other income 1 205 41 N.M.

Fluid overload is a frequent complication of many large diseases – including advanced liver disease driven by NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis)-related cirrhosis and heart failure – with diuretic resistance being widespread. The U.S. market for the alfapump resulting from NASH-related cirrhosis is forecast to exceed €3 billion annually within the next 10-20 years. The heart failure market for DSR and the alfapump DSR® is estimated to be over €5 billion annually in the U.S. and EU5 by 2026.The alfapump is Sequana Medical's unique  fully implanted wireless device that automatically pumps fluid from the abdominal cavity into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination. DSR is Sequana Medical's proprietary approach to managing sodium and fluid overload (congestion) through use of a sodium-free infusate administered into the abdominal cavity.In the U.S.  the Company's key growth market  the alfapump has been granted breakthrough device designation by the FDA for recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. Interim data from the ongoing North American pivotal study (POSEIDON) showed positive outcomes against all primary endpoints  rapid and persistent clinically important improvement in quality of life as well as a mean survival probability of 70% at 12 months post-implantation (compared to 50% survival rate for refractory ascites patients in the published literature). All patients have been implanted with the alfapump and primary endpoint reporting is planned for Q4 2022. This study is intended to support a future marketing application of the alfapump in the U.S. and Canada. In Europe  the alfapump is CE-marked for the management of refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and malignant ascites and is included in key clinical practice guidelines.

These updated Euronext Growth Rules are available from the Euronext website here and replace the previous version of the Euronext Growth Rules published on 9 November 2020.BackgroundSince the acquisition of the Irish Stock Exchange plc by the pan-European stock exchange operator Euronext  issuers admitted to the Euronext Growth Market operated by Euronext Dublin (“Euronext Growth Dublin”) have been required to comply with the harmonised rules in Part I of the Euronext Growth Rules (“Part I”) (which apply to issuers admitted to all Euronext Growth markets throughout Europe) along with the additional rules for Euronext Growth Dublin in Part II of the Euronext Growth Rules (“Part II”) (which set out specific rules for admission and continuing obligations for issuers admitted to Euronext Growth Dublin).In May 2021  Euronext Dublin announced a review of the Euronext Growth Rules citing a number of factors including the migration of Euronext Dublin issuers to Euronext’s pan-European trading platform Optiq  Brexit and the CSD migration from CREST to Euroclear Bank and the fact that the FCA is currently in the process of reviewing the London Stock Exchange’s listing rules. A consultation paper was issued by Euronext Dublin on 19 May 2021 and the amended rules were published on 21 March 2021.Euronext has stated that the main objectives of the review of the Euronext Growth Rules were:to have reasonably consistent regimes across Euronext Growth markets to enable current and future issuers to access one or more markets easily; to expand the advisory regime to enable approved Euronext advisors to support companies across Euronext’s European platforms; to enable international issuers and advisors to connect to the Irish market; and to streamline and align the existing rules with those of other Euronext jurisdictions  including by removal of rules that are covered in legislation and certain anomalies vis-à-vis other European exchanges  e.g. the class tests.The changes in the main relate to the Irish specific rules in Part II but Part I has also been amended to reflect that certain rules in Part I  previously switched off for Irish issuers  will now apply to Euronext Growth Dublin issuers also.Interestingly  a proposed change to Part I which would have explicitly allowed for the admission of special purpose acquisition companies (or SPACs) to Euronext Growth Dublin did not survive the consultation process and does not appear in the new version of the Euronext Growth Rules.Key changesThe key changes to the Euronext Growth Rules include:Admission processThe content requirements for the Information Document (also referred to as an Admission Document) required on first admission to trading have been amended. The content requirements are now set out in Appendix III of Part I and as a result are aligned with the Euronext Growth markets in other jurisdictions.Euronext Dublin will now also perform a review of the Information Document for completeness  consistency and comprehensibility pursuant to Rule 3.1.2 of Part I. Previously  the Euronext Growth Advisor was responsible for confirming to Euronext Dublin that the Information Document complied with the relevant requirements of the Euronext Growth Rules.For new applicants to Euronext Growth Dublin  the requirement to make a Schedule One announcement has been removed. Going forward  an applicant will be required to make an intention to float announcement and publish an Information Document only.Disclosure of Corporate TransactionsThe rules setting out conditions which issuers must comply with before entering into substantial transactions (a transaction exceeding 10% under any of the class tests)  related party transactions (a transaction with a related party exceeding 5% of any of the class tests) and transactions resulting in a fundamental change of business (a disposal or disposals exceeding 75% under any of the class tests) have been removed in their entirety.The deletion of these requirements was addressed in a feedback statement released by Euronext. Regarding the deletion of the rules relating to substantial transactions  Euronext reasoned that issuers must still comply with their obligations under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU 596/2014) (“MAR”) and substantial transactions would often amount to inside information requiring disclosure to the market as soon as possible. In regards to related party transactions and in particular the removal of the requirement for the directors of an issuer to state that the transaction is fair and reasonable as far as shareholders are concerned  Euronext noted that directors have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of shareholders in any event and related party transactions have to be disclosed in the issuer’s financial statements where they affect the issuer’s financial position.The requirement that the completion of a reverse takeover be subject to the consent of shareholders at general meeting  notification of the transaction to the market and the publication of an Information Document in respect of the proposed enlarged entity is maintained. The concept of a fundamental change in business has been retained as a test for assessing whether a transaction is a reverse takeover  alongside the alternative test that the consideration exceed 100% of market capitalisation.Euronext Growth AdvisorsThe Rules for Euronext Growth Advisors have been repealed and are replaced by the rules set out in Appendix IV of Part I which apply to advisors in other Euronext jurisdictions. As a result  Euronext Growth Advisors will now be known as Euronext Growth Listing Sponsors and will be subject to the pan-European rules of Book I.Half-year reportThe half year report must now be published within 4 months of the end of the second quarter of the financial year (previously required within 3 months).BrokerIssuers admitted to Euronext Growth Dublin are no longer required to retain a broker at all times (but we expect many issuers will continue to do so).Cash Shell CompaniesEuronext has extended the period during which an issuer may be a cash shell company (from 6 months to 12 months) before Euronext will consider suspending the issuer from trading.Other continuing obligationsCertain of the other continuing obligations for issuers on Euronext Growth Dublin have also been removed  including many of the miscellaneous disclosure requirements  such as the requirements to issue an RIS on the resignation  dismissal and appointment of directors  on changes to an accounting reference date  registered office or legal name and on payment of dividends. However  the requirement to disclose changes to the shareholdings of “significant shareholders” (shareholders over 3%) is retained. Similarly  the explicit requirement to have in place sufficient procedures  resources and controls to comply with the Euronext Growth Rules is deleted  as is the requirement to have in place a reasonable and effective share dealing policy (but this will not affect an issuer’s obligations to comply with MAR).CommentIssuers and their advisers (in particular Euronext Growth Listing Sponsors (formerly Euronext Growth Advisors)) should take note of these changes to ensure continuing compliance with the Euronext Growth Rules.,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.04,negative,0.02,0.13,0.85,True,English,"['Euronext Growth Markets Rule Book', 'Changes', 'Euronext Growth Markets Rule Book', 'pan-European stock exchange operator', 'Irish Stock Exchange plc', 'special purpose acquisition companies', 'updated Euronext Growth Rules', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Euronext Growth Dublin issuers', 'Euronext Growth Advisor', 'pan-European trading platform', 'Market Abuse Regulation', 'other European exchanges', 'related party transactions', 'other Euronext jurisdictions', 'Irish specific rules', 'Euronext Dublin issuers', 'Schedule One announcement', 'other jurisdictions', 'Irish market', 'Euronext website', 'Irish issuers', 'European platforms', 'additional rules', 'listing rules', 'existing rules', 'Corporate Transactions', 'substantial transactions', 'Euronext advisors', 'previous version', 'Euroclear Bank', 'consultation paper', 'consistent regimes', 'advisory regime', 'class tests', 'new version', 'Information Document', 'Appendix III', 'new applicants', 'feedback statement', 'inside information', 'fiduciary duty', 'best interest', 'financial statements', 'financial position', 'reverse takeover', 'general meeting', 'future issuers', 'international issuers', 'content requirements', 'relevant requirements', 'consultation process', 'Key changes', 'Admission Document', 'first admission', 'Part II', 'continuing obligations', 'CSD migration', 'main objectives', 'Part I.', 'fundamental change', 'Admission process', 'effect', '1 April', '9 November', 'Background', 'May', 'review', 'number', 'factors', 'Optiq', 'Brexit', 'CREST', 'FCA', 'amended', '21 March', 'current', 'removal', 'legislation', 'anomalies', 'SPACs', 'result', 'completeness', 'consistency', 'comprehensibility', 'intention', 'Disclosure', 'conditions', 'business', 'disposal', 'entirety', 'deletion', 'directors', 'shareholders', 'event', 'completion', 'consent', 'notification']",2022-04-13,2022-04-13,lexology.com

Global financial services linked to the Euroclear network worldwide can be accessed through the Euroclear account without the need to open new accounts for them in those markets.This step contributes to expanding the scope of international access to the Muscat Stock Exchange  attracting additional capital  and working to enhance the diversity of the investor base in the stock exchange and increase its efficiency  said Shaikh Abdullah bin Salim al Salmi (pictured)  CEO of the Capital Market Authority.He added that the agreement is part of ongoing efforts to enhance and develop the capital market in the Sultanate of Oman and enhance connectivity with the global financial markets  with a desire to attract more foreign capital and encourage the dual listing of local and those Omani securities issued and listed on external financial markets.The linkage will enable external investors to own the securities listed on the Muscat Stock Exchange through their accounts with Euroclear without the need to open accounts directly with the Muscat Clearing and Depository Company  thereby offering convenience and time savings as well.Al Salmi noted that the agreement will contribute  in the initial stages  the development and revitalisation of the Omani debt instruments market  which represents one of the objectives of the strategy approved by the Capital Market Authority. Cooperation with Euroclear during this initial phase is expected to enable full access to international investors who have accounts with Euroclear  allowing them to invest and trade in all securities listed on the Muscat Stock Exchange  not just debt instruments.Mohammed Abdulhadi  Acting General Manager of Muscat Clearing and Depository Company  said this cooperation will enable MCD to be the focal point for Euroclear transactions in the Sultanate of Oman.Bernard Ferran  General Manager of Euroclear Bank Operations in Europe  Middle East and Africa  said the opening of a Euroclear account in the Sultanate of Oman will enhance and raise the efficiency of cross-border transactions and settlements of securities.

In the next stage  we hope to provide full access to international investors with Euroclear accounts to invest and trade in any securities listed on the MSX  and not just fixed-income instruments with Eurobond or Sukuk structures.”,neutral,0.05,0.92,0.03,positive,0.68,0.29,0.03,True,English,"['CMA', 'pact', 'investors', 'MSX', 'His Excellency Abdullah Salem Al Salmi', 'new Euroclear international central securities depository', 'cross borders settlement efficiencies', 'The Capital Market Authority', 'other international financial markets', 'Depository Company SAOC', 'biggest settlement house', 'Mr. Mohammed Abdulhadi', 'secondary trading activities', 'Omani financial markets', 'global financial markets', 'new Euroclear account', 'Muscat Stock Exchange', 'Euroclear Bank SA/NV', 'existing Euroclear account', 'multi-currency fixed-income instruments', 'Euroclear Bank system', 'new initiative', 'international institutions', 'other countries', 'international investors', 'market players', 'international Eurobond', 'multi-currency Eurobonds', 'global connectivity', 'Omani issuers', 'Euroclear transactions', 'Euroclear system', 'Euroclear accounts', 'CSD) account', 'CSD account', 'one account', 'Muscat Clearing', 'Executive President', 'important initiative', 'continuous efforts', 'General Manager', 'sole point', 'cost-effective services', 'Bernard Ferran', 'Middle East', 'additional cost', 'cost-effective way', 'initial stage', 'issuers’ base', 'dual list', 'next stage', 'Omani companies', 'investors’ base', 'foreign investors', 'easier access', 'Sukuk structures', 'full access', 'MCD account', 'Oman government', 'MCD.', 'CMA', 'Belgium', 'Sultanate', 'part', 'collaboration', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'advancements', 'opening', 'MSX', 'hassle', 'fact', 'ease', 'primary', 'liquidity', 'local']",2022-04-13,2022-04-13,omanobserver.om

Resolution on guidelines for the appointment of and instructions for the nomination committeeThe nomination committee proposes that the general meeting resolves on new guidelines for the appointment of and instructions for the nomination committee in accordance with below. The new guidelines for the nomination committee shall apply until further notice until otherwise decided by the general meeting.Provisions on the establishment of a nomination committee can be found in the Code. The nomination committee is a body of the general meeting with the sole task of preparing the general meeting’s decision on electoral and remuneration issues and  where applicable  procedural issues of the next nomination committee. It is proposed that the nomination committee shall be comprised of three members to be appointed by the three largest shareholders by votes at the end of the third quarter each year and that the chairman of the board participates in the nomination committee meetings as adjunct member. Known groups of shareholders are to be included in the expression “the three largest shareholders by votes.” The chairman of the board shall annually contact the shareholders who are entitled to appoint a member.Should any of the entitled shareholders waive their right to appoint a member to the nomination committee  the right is transferred to the fourth largest shareholder by votes  and so on. There is however no need to contact more than five additional shareholders  unless the chairman of the board of directors finds that there are particular reasons to do so. When a shareholder is contacted with a request to appoint a member to the nomination committee the chairman of the board is to issue necessary rules of conduct such as final day to reply etc.The names of the members of the nomination committee and the names of the shareholders appointing members shall be made public no later than six months prior to the annual general meeting. The nomination committee appoints a chairman among its members. Should a member resign before the work of the nomination committee is concluded  and if deemed appropriate by the nomination committee  a replacement member shall be appointed by the shareholder that appointed the member who resigned  or  if that shareholder no longer represents one of the three largest shareholders by votes  by the shareholder representing such group. If a shareholder who has appointed a certain member has substantially decreased its shareholding in the Company  and the nomination committee does not deem it inappropriate in a view of a potential need of continuity prior to an impending general meeting  the member shall resign from the nomination committee and the nomination committee shall offer the largest shareholder who has not yet appointed a member of the nomination committee to appoint a new member.The nomination committee shall further be composed and perform such tasks that from time to time are stated in the Swedish Corporate Governance Code. The members of the nomination committee shall not receive remuneration from the company. Any costs incurred in connection with the work of the nomination committee shall be paid by the company  provided that they have been approved by the chairman of the board of directors.THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS’ PROPOSED RESOLUTIONSItem 7 c). Resolution in respect of allocation of the company’s profits or losses according to the adopted balance sheetThe board proposes that the general meeting allocates the company’s profits or losses in accordance with the board’s proposal in the annual report  meaning that no dividend shall be paid for the financial year 2021 and that the results shall be carried forward in new account.Item 12. Resolution on an authorisation for the board of directors to resolve upon capital increasesThe board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on an authorisation for the board of directors to – for the period up to the next annual general meeting  with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights and at one or more occasions – resolve upon issuance of new shares  warrants and/or convertible debentures. Payment may be made in cash  in kind  through set-off of claims or otherwise be conditional. The company’s share capital may by support of the authorisation be increased by an amount corresponding to not more than twenty (20) per cent of the share capital after such issue(s). Deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights shall be allowed in situations where a directed issue is deemed more appropriate for the company due to timing  commercial or similar reasons  and in order to enable acquisitions.The chairman of the board of directors  the CEO or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorised to make any minor adjustments required to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Item 14. Resolution on implementation of a long-term incentive programme through a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants to certain employees and consultantsThe board of directors in Hexicon AB (publ) proposes that the general meeting resolves on implementation of a long-term incentive programme (“Warrant programme 2022/2025”) for certain employees and consultants in the company and the company’s group by way of (i) a directed issue of warrants and (ii) approval of transfer of warrants as set forth below. The warrants shall entitle to subscription for new shares in the company.Background and reasonsThe proposal to launch an incentive programme by the issuance of warrants has been prepared and presented by the board of directors in order to strengthen the retention of the persons covered and to motivate them to create shareholder value. The board of directors assess that these objectives are in line with all shareholders’ interests.The programme encompasses certain employees and consultants of the group. Board members not employed by the group are not allowed to participate. Those entitled to participate in the incentive program are hereinafter referred to as “Participants”.Terms and conditions for the issue of warrants1. The company shall issue not more than 10 500 000 warrants. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new share in the company.2. The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  only be subscribed for by the company  after which the company is to transfer the warrants to the Participants in accordance with the resolution adopted by the general meeting and instructions from the board of directors of the company. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is that the warrants are to be used within the proposed incentive programme.3. Subscription for warrants shall be made on a separate subscription list following the general meeting’s issue resolution  but no later than 1 May 2022. The board of directors shall be entitled to prolong the subscription period.4. The warrants shall be issued without consideration (i.e. free of charge) to the company.5. If all issued warrants are subscribed for by the company  transferred to and exercised by the Participants for subscription of new shares  the company’s share capital will increase with SEK 105 000 (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with standard terms and conditions applicable to the warrants set out in an Appendix A).6. The warrants may be exercised for subscription for new shares during the period from and including 12 November 2025 until and including 12 February 2026. Subscription for new shares may however not take place during so-called closed periods according to the EU Market Abuse Regulation  or otherwise in breach of relevant insider rules and regulations (including the company’s internal guidelines in this respect). Warrants that have not been exercised for subscription of new shares by 12 February 2026 shall lapse.7. Each warrant shall entitle the warrant holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the company at a subscription price per share (the “Exercise Price”) corresponding to 150 percent of the volume weighted average trading price for the company’s share on Nasdaq First North Premier Growth Market during a period of five (5) trading days immediately following the annual general meeting. If no trading price is recorded for a particular trading day within the specified period  such day shall not be taken into account  but the period shall instead be extended forwards in time with the number of succeeding trading days required for the period to comprise fice (5) trading days with a recorded trading price. Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account. The Exercise Price thus calculated shall be rounded off to the nearest whole SEK 0.01  whereupon SEK 0.005 shall be rounded upwards. The exercise price may never be below the quotient value of the shares.8. The warrants will be subject to customary recalculation conditions set out in Appendix A.Allocation principles to be applied in relation to ParticipantsThe warrants are to be transferred to the Participants against a premium payable by the Participants corresponding to the theoretical market value of the warrants as of the date of transfer  calculated by an independent valuation agent engaged by the company by use of the Black & Scholes valuation model.The board of directors of the company shall resolve upon allocation to Participants in accordance with the guidelines set forth below. No Participant may be offered a higher number of warrants than the maximum allocation set forth below.Category Maximum number of warrants per Participant Maximum number of warrants within the respective category Management 600 000 3 000 000 Employees 250 000 4 500 000 Advisors consultants and new recruits 300 000 3 000 000 Total: - 10 500 000A Participant can choose to acquire a lower but not a higher number of warrants than offered to the ParticipantWarrant agreementsAll warrants will be governed by warrant agreements to be entered into between each Participant and the company in connection with the transfer of warrants from the company. The warrant agreement will include a so-called vesting structure  certain transfer restrictions and other terms and conditions customary for such agreements. According to the warrant agreements the total number of warrants granted to each Participant shall be vested in three equal parts on an annual basis (i.e. approximately 33% of the total number of warrants will be vested each year) and conditional upon continued assignments/employment with the Group. The warrant agreements shall be entered into with the Participants within six months from the resolution to implement this program and the vesting period until a share may be acquired may not be less than three years.Reasons for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rightsThe reasons for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is that the company wishes to offer warrants to certain employees and consultants of the group in order to strengthen the retention of the persons covered and to motivate them to contribute to the creation of shareholder value. Warrants granted under the incentive programme to the Participants are intended to align such individual’s and shareholder interests by attempting to create a direct relation between compensation and shareholder return. Participation in the incentive programme rewards overall corporate performance  as measured through the price of the shares in the company. In addition  the incentive programme enables the Participants to develop and maintain a significant ownership position in the company.Dilution  costs  etc.Upon full subscription  transfer and exercise of all 10 500 000 issued warrants; a total of 10 500 000 new shares will be issued in the company (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with standard terms and conditions applicable to the warrants as set forth in Appendix A). This would lead to a dilution corresponding to approx. 2.8 per cent of the total share capital and number of votes in the company (calculated as the maximum amount of share capital and number of shares/votes that may be issued  divided by the total share capital and the total number of shares/votes in the company after all warrants have been exercised). The dilution calculation described above does not consider the shares that may be issued in connection with an exercise of the warrants which have been issued in connection with the previous incentive programmes or as a result of the other resolutions proposed to be adopted by the annual general meeting.The incentive programme is expected to have a marginal effect on the company’s earnings per share. The market value of the warrants for the subscription period is estimated to SEK 0.76 per warrant (as per 8 April 2022)  in accordance with the preliminary valuation made based on a market value of the underlying share corresponding to SEK 2.38 (as per 8 April 2022). The Black & Scholes valuation model has been used for valuing the warrants  assuming a risk free interest of -0.93 per cent and a volatility of 65 per cent.There are costs associated with the incentive programme in respect of valuation  consultancy services and costs for registration and practical management of the programme. There should not be any security costs or similar payable by the company. Ongoing administration costs and other costs of the programme are minimal.Outstanding warrant programsFurthermore  there are 11 999 996 warrants outstanding under one (1) long-term incentive programme resolved at the extraordinary general meeting on 30 December 2020  comprising warrants issued to members of the board of directors  management  employees and new recruits. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the company at an exercise price of SEK 2.80 during the period from 30 June 2023 up to and including 30 December 2023.If all outstanding warrants under the above incentive programme were exercised for the subscription of new shares  the Company's share capital would increase by SEK 119 999.96 through the issuance of 11 999 996 new shares (subject to any recalculations in accordance with the terms of the warrants)  each with a quotient value of SEK 0.01 per share. This would represent a dilution equivalent to approximately 3.19 percent of the company's total share capital and number of shares and votes (calculated on the basis of the share capital (SEK 3 638 026.86) and the number of shares and votes (363 802 686) in the company as of today's date).Approval of transfer of warrants from the Subsidiary to ParticipantsA resolution to issue warrants in accordance with this proposal also includes an approval of the transfers of warrants from the company to the Participants.Preparation of the proposalThis proposal has been prepared by the board of directors together with external consultants. The final proposal has been presented by the board of directors.Majority requirementsThis proposal to adopt the incentive programme and to issue warrants  as well as the approval of the transfers of warrants from the company to the Participants  is governed by the provisions in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act  and a valid resolution therefore requires that the proposal is supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the meeting.MiscellaneousThe chairman of the board of directors  the CEO or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorised to make any minor adjustments required to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Particular majority requirementsA valid resolution under item 12 requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast and of the shares represented at the meeting. A valid resolution pursuant to item 14 requires the support of shareholders representing at least nine-tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Number of shares and votes in the companyThe total number of shares in the company at the time of issuance of this notice is 363 802 686. The company does not hold any of its own shares.Shareholders’ right to request informationPursuant to Chapter 7 section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)) the board of directors and the CEO are under a duty to  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believe that it can be done without material damage to the company  provide information at the meeting regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda or of the company’s economic situation. Such duty to provide information also comprises the company’s relation to the other group companies  the consolidated financial statements and such circumstances regarding subsidiaries which are set out in the foregoing sentence.DocumentationThe financial accounts  auditor’s report  complete proposals and other documents to be dealt with at the general meeting will be kept available at the company’s office not later than three weeks before the meeting.

2823,Clearstream,Google API,https://futurism.com/best-outdoor-tv-antennas,Best Outdoor TV Antennas in 2022,4 hours ago,While everyone is jumping on the streaming bandwagon  the best outdoor TV antennas provide access to plenty of channels  totally free of charge. These devices pull tons of channels out of the air  and in many cases are little more expensive than popular streaming devices. And unlike the run-of-the-mill antenna from the dark ages  these are actually incredibly easy to install. What channels are available? There’s the local channels including CBS  Fox  NBC  and ABC  but depending on the device and your location  you may be able to pull in select cable channels as well. Here’s our picks of the best outdoor TV antennas.— Best Overall: Antennas Direct ClearStream 4V TV Antenna— Best Motorized: PBD WA-2608 Digital Amplified Outdoor HDTV Antenna— Best Long Range: Five Star Yagi Satellite HDTV Antenna— Best 4K Support: LAVA HD2605 Outdoor HDTV Antenna— Best Multi-Directional: Antop AT-415B 720 UFO Dual Omni-Directional Outdoor HDTV AntennaHow We Selected the Best Outdoor TV AntennasTerrestrial TV has officially been totally digital for more than a decade now. Still  for some reason  much of the technology to pull channels out of thin air for you to watch still has a smack of retro to it. Here are some of the things we considered when picking the best outdoor TV antennas.Range: Outdoor antennas all have a range of use  usually measured in miles. A 60-mile antenna  for example  will capture channels in any given direction for up to 60 miles. Some can stretch farther than their given range  though  expect stuff to come in fuzzy. A comparable example of this is like when you’re channel surfing on FM radio during a road trip. A bangin’ classic rock station will eventually become static-y and unlistenable once you’re no longer within range of the station. If you’re smack dab in the middle of a busy city  there’s a good chance you won’t need anything more than an inexpensive indoor antenna for basic cable needs. If you live more than thirty miles from a Starbucks  it may be worth buying an antenna with a wider range.AdvertisementAdvertisementSetup: Even the more cumbersome outdoor TV antennas may not require special tools to install  but you will  at the very least  need to break out a ladder and climb on a roof. After all  installing it lower may not take full potential out of your outdoor antenna’s range capabilities. Could you farm out the work of installing these devices to someone? Certainly. But that can take buying an affordable outdoor TV antenna and make it expensive real quick. Handypersons expect to be paid for their labor  after all  unless you have really cool friends with tool belts. But whether or not you or a screwdriver-savvy person is installing it  it shouldn’t be difficult.Build Quality: Aesthetics for this sort of device shouldn’t matter. But a big honking thing that lives on your roof could be ugly enough to make your neighbors whisper about it behind your back. “Hey look  here comes ‘Ugly Roof Boy ’” or other equally hurtful jabs. No outdoor TV antenna looks fantastic  but some models are sleeker than others  and can easily be obfuscated behind a chimney. Nicer models tend to be flat and surprisingly modern looking  though nothing beats the range capabilities of one of the busier  wiry models.Maintenance: TV antennas aren’t exactly like cars that need regular tune-ups. However  TV signals vary in strength depending on many variables that can change as frequently as the weather. Coincidentally  the weather is one of these variables. The best antennas work through these obstructions  be they nature or man-made like trees and cellular signals. Having the option to rotate your antenna without having to climb on your roof is an excellent feature. If you can’t change an antenna’s direction at will  it better be strong enough to grab signals from within an upstairs balcony or attic. Nobody wants to climb a roof anytime a big game comes on.Best Outdoor TV Antennas: Reviews and RecommendationsBest Overall: Antennas Direct ClearStream 4V TV AntennaCrystal Clear Signal. Antennas DirectWhy It Made The Cut: ClearsStream 4V is one of the most attractive outdoor TV antennas  with impressive power and range  and is 4K ready.AdvertisementAdvertisementSpecs:— Dimensions: 20.1 inches L x 28.2 inches W x 6.3 inches D— Weight: 6 pounds— Operating Range: Up to 70 miles— Frequency: UHF/VHFPros:— Smartphone app helps maximize antenna range— Works with established cable in homes— Easy install on vertical and horizontal surfacesCons:— On the pricier side— Requires high mounting for optimal resultsEven if you are handy with tools and decide to install an outdoor TV antenna yourself  there’s a lot of guesswork when it comes to pointing it in the right direction to get as many channels as possible. Antenna’s Direct ClearStream 4V takes the guesswork out of installation  so you never have to mess with it ever again.AdvertisementAdvertisementUsing the Antenna Point app (available on Google Play and App Store)  you can be sure you position the ClearStream 4v Correctly to get as many as 60 channels across 70 miles. Users in the foothills of California recorded getting channels as far as the Bay Area  in fact. Not too shabby for a simple outdoor TV antenna. Plus  its design actually looks like something invented within the last decade  which is not something you can say about many outdoor TV antennas. Granted  you need to mount the device from 30 to 40 feet off the ground for the best results. After installing  ClearStream 4V works with the installed coaxial cable in your home. Using it alone is great  pairing it with an amplifier makes it unbeatable. It’s a little pricey  but nothing beats the security that comes with a stable signal.User-Friendly. PBDWhy It Made The Cut: Installing the PBD WA-2608 Digital Amplified Outdoor HDTV Antenna is as easy as watching classic reruns  and the motorized controls ensure you never have to touch it again.Specs:— Dimensions: 13 inches L x 17.5 inches W x 4.5 inches D— Weight: 6.4 pounds— Operating Range: Up to 150 miles— Frequency: UHF/VHFPros:— Weather resistant  with lightning protection— Easy controls— Above average rangeAdvertisementAdvertisementCons:— Supports only two televisions— Cheap constructionTV antennas may bring in a bevy of HD channels and come with space-age aesthetics  but in many cases  the technology is just like you remember it. Even some of the best outdoor TV antennas need adjusting now and then  which is pretty cumbersome to do  unless you get a motorized model like the PBD WA-2608 Digital Amplified Outdoor HDTV Antenna with Mounting Pole.This outdoor TV antenna is incredibly easy to install. Because it snaps into place  you won’t need any special tools. The 10-foot mount that comes with the device will give your antenna the extra vertical reach to make channels come in as clear as possible. Better yet  it’s motorized  so you can point it in whatever direction you like  using a handy remote control. This way  you can gauge which cardinal direction will bring in more channels. It covers a range of up to 150 miles  which becomes exponentially larger when you consider it can be pointed every which way. Despite some of the parts of the PBD antenna being cheap plastic  the device is weather resistant  even to lightning. True  it only works with two televisions at once  but that’s not something a coaxial splitter can’t solve.Best Long Range: Five Star Yagi Satellite HDTV AntennaUnmatched Range. Five StarWhy It Made The Cut: Five Star Yagi Satellite pulls channels as far away as 200 miles  for those living in the middle of nowhere.AdvertisementAdvertisementSpecs:— Dimensions: 7.64 inches L x 17.8 inches W x 5.87 inches D— Weight: 5.48 pounds— Operating Range: Up to 200 miles— Frequency: UHF/VHFPros:— Great Value— Unmatched range— Wind  UV  and water resistantCons:— Cumbersome assembly— Results may varyLiving close to a local TV channel affiliate makes channels come in crystal clear  usually with an inexpensive indoor TV antenna. For those who live in the boonies  far away from the din of the city  there’s the Five Star Yagi Satellite HD TV Antenna.AdvertisementAdvertisementThis powerful outdoor TV antenna stretches as far as 200 miles away  which should be more than enough range to reach at least a handful of channels. But that’s the floor  not the ceiling as far as channel availability is concerned. With that much range  you may be able to tap into as many as 50 channels  especially if you’re not terribly far away from a major metropolitan area. For an outdoor TV antenna at this price  it’s a pretty solid deal. Unfortunately  it’s not multi-directional  so it may require occasional re-orienting. However  because it’s so powerful  many users report that it works perfectly fine from an attic instead of a roof. Not a bad tradeoff. If you do decide to mount it outside  it’s totally weather-proof  whether we’re talking extreme wind  heat  or rain. Still  this antenna is very polarizing. Users either love it or hate it  so expect to fall into one of those camps  depending on where you live. The device also claims to come “pre-assembled ” which isn’t exactly accurate: it will still require a hands-on setup.Best 4K Support: LAVA HD2605 Outdoor HDTV Antenna Remote Controlled Rotation Long Range 4K TVHD Ready. LavaWhy It Made The Cut: LAVA Outdoor HDTV Antenna is user-friendly  and one of the easiest ways to get free 4K channels.Specs:— Dimensions: 12 inches L x 16 inches W x 5 inches D— Weight: 5.48 pounds— Operating Range: Up to 125 miles— Frequency: UHF/VHF/FMPros:— Supports up to eight televisions with the right splitter— Made to prioritize 4K channels— Built-in motor and pre-amplifierAdvertisementAdvertisementCons:— Incredibly slow motorAntennas are pretty lo-fi  but plenty of terrestrial channels are broadcast in 4K. If you have a fancy 4K television  the LAVA HD2605 Outdoor HDTV Antenna is an easy way to tap into free  high-def channels.LAVA outdoor TV antenna doesn’t simply provide great picture quality  it pulls in great audio too. It supports 1080p and 4K channels for every single room in your house. Up to eight televisions can be hooked up to this antenna  which should be more than enough for most homes. Setup is relatively simple  and like any great outdoor TV antenna  it’s motorized. However  the motor that rotates the antenna is a little sluggish. If patience isn’t one of your virtues  you may want to spend a little more. If you’re confident in the signal quality in your area  it should be fine. The range is listed as 125 miles  though some users have reported it picking up channels up to 150 miles away. LAVA’s built-in amplifier may have something to do with that.Out of this World. ANTOP AntennaWhy It Made The Cut: Why settle for one direction when you can have them all  with the Antop UFO Dual Omni-Directional Outdoor HDTV Antenna.AdvertisementAdvertisementSpecs:— Dimensions: 14.96 inches L x 14.96 inches W x 6 inches D— Weight: 4.94 pounds— Operating Range: Up to 65 miles— Frequency: UHF/VHFPros:— Full HD support— Blocks unwanted 3G and 4G signals— Offers seriously stable coverageCons:— Less range  despite its powerOut of all the outdoor TV antennas in this compilation  the Antop UFO Dual Omni-Directional Outdoor HDTV Antenna is easily the most unique looking. It’s not just form you can rely on  the spaceship design packs plenty of useful function as well.AdvertisementAdvertisementWhile other outdoor TV antennas have to be re-adjusted or rotated to pick up signals  the Antop UFO provides full 360-degree coverage vertically and horizontally  hence its 720 moniker. Like many great things  this comes with a catch. Its range may be more complete  but it’s a good bit shorter  topping out at 65 miles. Considering that the antenna covers 65 miles in every direction  this may be a fair trade. The signals coming in are amplified  and a 4G filter keeps other interference from messing up your reception. Because it’s so easy to set up  it works equally well on homes and RVs. Of course  the bevvy of channels that it does pull in will all be in glorious HD.Things to Consider Before Buying an Outdoor TV AntennaDo You Actually Need an Outdoor TV Antenna?This is an actual question you should ask yourself before deciding to buy or set up an outdoor TV antenna. If you have a cable subscription  you shouldn’t need one. Many channels that would come in using an antenna will be available via your cable box. Same goes if you’re using a live TV streaming service like Sling or Hulu with Live TV  though  channel availability will vary depending on your area and channel suite. If you live within the city limits  or less than 30 miles out  an inexpensive indoor antenna may be more than enough to get the channels you need. For those that live in rural areas  an outdoor TV antenna is more or less essential for grabbing terrestrial channels. Could you still use an outdoor TV antenna if you live within a city? Sure. Even if you’re close to the signals broadcasted by local network affiliates  you may be able to find even more channels available just out of range. Many of these outdoor antennas are relatively inexpensive and set up pretty quickly  so going channel hunting may be a fun Saturday afternoon adventure. Plus  given the fact that many cable providers compress their broadcasts to save on money  there’s a good chance that the channels you pull out of the air will be truly high definition.Location  Location  LocationDo you live in an area surrounded by trees? While trees and their positive environmental impact do much to improve your overall quality of life  they’re an awful hindrance when it comes to grabbing television signals. The list of obstructions don’t end there. Mountains  large concrete buildings  power lines  LTE cell towers  LED light bulbs  and weather can all negatively affect you tapping into channels near and far. One of the easiest ways to overcome these obstacles is to get as much latitude as possible when mounting your outdoor TV antenna. In general  the higher an antenna is mounted  the better the reception. Still  depending on where you live  it may be more prudent to simply drop the cash on a cable or live-streaming TV subscription.Should I Get an Amplifier?Every outdoor TV antenna here will grab channels. But will they come in crystal clear? Even the best antenna could use a boost  because  as previously stated  TV signals are fighting with plenty of obstructions. An easy  and more importantly  inexpensive fix is to plug your rig into an amplifier  which helps boost signals and clear up staticy channels. The GE Antenna Amplifier works great  and is incredibly cheap and easy to set up. You may not need it  though. Some outdoor TV antennas come with built-in amplifiers like the Antop AT-415B 720 UFO Dual Omni-Directional Outdoor HDTV Antenna.AdvertisementAdvertisementWays to Improve Your TV ReceptionThe most important thing you can do to improve television reception is picking the perfect place to mount it. The more height  the better  but ensure that wherever it is  that it has a clear view of the sky. Make sure there are no metal obstructions nearby  as they can mess with your antenna’s reception. Occasionally  companies cheap out on the coaxial cables that come packaged with outdoor TV antennas. Using better quality cables is an easy fix  and they come in varied lengths and sizes to suit your needs.FAQsQ: How does an outdoor antenna work?TV towers broadcast UHF and VHF signals. Your outdoor TV antenna snatches these signals out of the air and transmits them to your televisions.Q: Can I put an indoor TV antenna outside?Yes  an indoor TV antenna will work great outdoors  and in fact  will work better outdoors. In general  TV antennas will always operate better outdoors.Q: How do I get the best outdoor antenna reception?The ways to get the best reception out of your outdoor antenna are to direct it correctly  reduce interference  connect it with new cables  and use it in tandem with an amplifier.AdvertisementAdvertisementQ: Does aluminum foil boost antenna signal?Wrapping foil around your antenna increases its surface area  which does amplify your signal. However  it doesn’t look great  though looks are relative.Q: Can I install an outdoor TV antenna myself?You can easily install an outdoor antenna yourself  so long as you follow best safety practices when hopping onto a roof or balcony. Some antennas get decent reception from attics.Q: How high does my antenna need to be?For the best reception  an outdoor TV antenna needs to be placed more than 30 feet off the ground. The higher the placement  the better.Final Thoughts on Outdoor TV AntennasNothing beats free  especially when it comes to television. Grabbing free networks out of thin air is easily done  especially with a powerful outdoor TV antenna. Antennas Direct ClearStream 4V TV Antenna is our overall favorite  for its easy setup and stable signals. It’s 4K ready  and requires little to no maintenance. The Antop AT-415B 720 UFO Dual Omni-Directional Outdoor HDTV Antenna is also a fantastic option  with an inspired design that provides some serious reach.AdvertisementAdvertisementThis post was created by a non-news editorial team at Recurrent Media  Futurism’s owner.

STAHL order situation recovers in 2021  sales and earnings development impacted by Corona pandemic and supply bottlenecks,15 hours ago,"DGAP-News: R. Stahl AG / Key word(s): Annual Report/Annual ResultsThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.R. STAHL order situation recovers in 2021 - sales and earnings development impacted by Corona pandemic and supply bottlenecks - 2021 sales increase by €1.6 million or 0.7% to €248.1 million - EBITDA pre exceptionals declines slightly by €1.1 million to €17.9 million - margin decreases to 7.2% - Net profit down €1.4 million to €-4.9 million - Continued sound financial position with net debt of €18.3 million - Order intake increases by 5.4% to €261.3 million - Order backlog at the end of the year at €72.2 million - Outlook for 2022: Sales and EBITDA pre exceptionals expected to grow in a low double-digit percentageWaldenburg  13 April 2022 _ R. STAHL today publishes audited business figures for financial year 2021. As previously reported  sales increased by 0.7% (or €1.6 million) to €248.1 million and were thus within the adjusted forecast corridor. The recovery emerging over the course of the year is particularly noticeable in terms of order intake and order backlog  with order intake up by 5.4% year-on-year to €261.3 million and order backlog of €72.2 million was 11.8% above the prior-year figure at the end of the year. Continued strict cost and margin control only partially offset a decline in earnings figures due to the ongoing impact of the Corona pandemic. As a result  EBITDA pre exceptionals was down 5.6% year-on-year to €17.9 million  while net income fell to €-4.9 million from €-3.5 million in the previous year.""2021 was once again strongly impacted by the Corona pandemic; hopes for a decline in the incidence of infection and thus a revival of the global economy  boosted R. STAHL's order and sales situation  especially in the first half of the year. In the second half of the year  business was overshadowed by supply bottlenecks and  as a result  rising raw material prices. Delays in transport and acceptance of goods on the customer side also had an increasingly noticeable impact. The strategy we have consistently pursued in recent years and the strict cost control it entails are strengthening our resilience and mitigating the impact on the earnings side "" says Dr. Mathias Hallmann  CEO of R. STAHL.Sales development 2021 In the course of the year  the order situation was predominantly characterized by replacement and maintenance requirements. A positive effect on sales development  especially from the second quarter onwards  was the optimism that we had found the means to combat the pandemic. As a result  there was a noticeable increase in investment activity and  in particular  a revival of major projects. There were  however  distinct regional differences. In Germany  where R. STAHL traditionally benefits from a good market position in the chemical and pharmaceutical industries  sales increased by 7.2% to €67.1 million over the year as a whole. The Asia/Pacific region also closed out the year with a sales increase of 5.2%. In regions with a high share in the oil and gas industry  such as the Americas (-6.4%) or the Central Region (-3.5%) with a large share from Northern Europe  however  R. STAHL recorded declines in sales. On the one hand  this reflects the continuing high degree of uncertainty and thus the reluctance of the fossil energy industries to invest. On the other hand  the chemical and pharmaceutical industries are only slightly impacted by the Corona pandemic. The Group's order intake increased by 5.4% over the year as a whole to €261.3 million. The fourth quarter in particular stood out with an increase of 29.3% over the prior-year quarter.Development of the financial position and performance 2021 The impact of the stable but weak sales performance over the course of the year on the financial position and performance was held in check by cost adjustments. Declining other operating income and expenses of €1.7 million as a result of lower service and consulting fees and reduced exchange rate losses had a positive impact on earnings. An unchanged strong cost of materials ratio of 33.8% (2020: 33.7%) in relation to total performance and stable personnel expenses of €116.2 million (2020: €115.6 million) led to a moderate overall decline in EBITDA pre exceptionals to €17.9 million (2020: €19.0 million). Net profit decreased by €1.4 million to €-4.9 million (2020: €-3.5 million) and earnings per share to €-0.76 (2020: €-0.54). Alongside net income  higher investments  particularly in development projects and the long-term investment of cash and cash equivalents  resulted in negative free cash flow of €-6.3 million (2020: €5.7 million). Consequently  net debt (excluding lease liabilities) as of 31 December 2021 increased to €18.3 million (2020: €5.8 million). In contrast to the negative consolidated net income  the equity ratio as of 31 December 2021 increased to 20.2% (31 December 2020: 18.8%) due to a higher interest rate for the measurement of pension obligations.Outlook for financial year 2022 Buoyed by strong order intake in the fourth quarter of 2021 across all regions and industries  especially in terms of demand for advanced LED and automation solutions  we expect sales growth in the low double-digit range in 2022. The delivery of orders and thus the development ofsales will depend to a large extent on the availability of electronic components. We expect EBITDA pre exceptionals to also increase in the low double-digit percentage range. Strict cost control and margin protection will help to limit procurement risks. For 2022  we anticipate a slightly negative free cash flow and slightly higher net debt due to increasing investments in research & development and property  plant and equipment. There is currently considerable uncertainty regarding the recoverability of our 25% shareholding in ZAVOD Goreltex  Russia  which will likely have to be partially written off at the quarterly reporting date of 31 March 2022. As a consequence  this could lead to negative consolidated earnings in the mid to high single-digit million range.Key figures of R.

To be noted in particular the buoyancy of the Optical Transport activity which  in line with 2021  shows a strong increase over Q1 2022  thanks to the success of the 200 Gb/s and 400 Gb/s WDM systems.Profiting from the strength of its Services activity  its SDN (Software Defined Networks) solutions  the network function virtualization solutions  and the contribution of SixSq's activities  revenue generated by software and services rose by +64% over the quarter.The share of software and services continued to increase  and now accounts for 17% of the Group's quarterly revenue  versus 12% one year prior  and 14% for full year 2021.Solid momentum of international sales: growth of +54% in North AmericaThe quarter was marked by dynamic international growth of +34%.

2871,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/letter-veon-ceo-stakeholders-113200778.html,Letter from VEON CEO to stakeholders,Dear VEON stakeholder ,AMSTERDAM  April 13  2022 /PRNewswire/ --Dear VEON stakeholder I am writing you today to highlight the strategic progress we are making across our operations  as well as provide updates on a number of key issues for our Group.Liquidity and capital marketsWe continue to prioritize maintaining the Group's healthy liquidity. Our cash position at HQ level currently stands at around US$1.3 billion  which is deposited with international banks and fully accessible. In addition  around US$700 million remains available to VEON as part of a committed revolving credit facility  underwritten by a group of diversified lenders headquartered in the United States  Europe and Asia. VEON has no further material debt maturities at HQ level for the rest of 2022.Besides this HQ liquidity  our operating companies currently have a total cash position equivalent to over US$500 million. Considering the self-sufficient nature of each of our operating subsidiaries  VEON is well placed to weather the complex market conditions we currently face.VEON shares continue to trade on Nasdaq and on Euronext. Their market turnover in March was equal to more than two times our free float. Understandably  the price of VEON's shares has been impacted significantly by the deterioration in the geopolitical environment. While the price of our ADRs has recovered from the closing price low of US$0.26/share  it remains below the US$1/share minimum required by Nasdaq. As a result  VEON was notified on April 7  2022 that the Company no longer meets the exchange's Listing Rules  based on the closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days. These rules do provide for the resolution of the matter  should the closing bid price of the Company's security be at least US$1 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at any time during the 180-day period following the notification. Further extensions and other options will be available. As and when the current geopolitical volatility subsides  I am confident that VEON's share price will better reflect fair value.Story continuesCommitted to connectivityWe provide connectivity  access to information and other vital digital services to 220 million customers across nine countries. One third of VEON's customers are in Ukraine and Russia  where they are supported by 33 000 employees. Our top priority is to protect the safety and well-being of these employees and their families while they work hard to ensure that our subscribers can stay connected and access what is an essential humanitarian service.The outstanding job done by Kyivstar in maintaining connectivity and supporting its customers has been covered extensively  including in this article by Reuters . I want to applaud once again the extraordinary dedication of our team  who have worked tirelessly to keep the people of Ukraine connected  informed and safe. Kyivstar's technicians are currently repairing equipment in areas of the country that are now safe to enter  and 91% of all transmission sites are now operational.To maintain our high standards of service in Ukraine  Kyivstar's team have also overseen the construction of 121 new base stations in the western part of the country. Furthermore  to ensure essential connectivity in these challenging and unpredictable conditions  we are growing our partnership with Starlink.Kyivstar continues to serve its customers with roam like home – for free   which enables about 2 million subscribers to remain connected without additional roaming fees as they take refuge in European countries.Our core mission of providing customers with connectivity  access to information and other vital digital services applies to all of our markets. The humanitarian need for connectivity is as important as other basic needs such as food  water  shelter and health care.In Russia we are facing a new and challenging economic environment. The quality of our network remains a key focus  and Beeline continues to launch VoLTE in new regions  to build new LTE base stations and to progress in the fiberization of its transport infrastructure. While the pace of these developments has somewhat decelerated due to the current context  Beeline is proactively addressing market-wide component availability issues through cooperation with other major domestic telecom operators  building new supply chains and introducing flexible sourcing. Beeline's extensive 4G roll-out over the previous two years has proven vitally important  and I am pleased to note that the company's NPS trends continue improving  especially in Moscow.Continued growth across our footprintAmong other key developments from our operating companies  I would like to highlight:In Pakistan  Jazz's growing 4G penetration and digital services continue to contribute to customer loyalty  engagement and value generation  while enabling the broader digital transformation of Pakistan. For example  Jazz continues to support its B2B partners  including with a new cloud platform Garaj   which provides virtualized IT services to enterprises  including start-ups. I am also pleased to welcome Atyab Tahir as new CEO of JazzCash  the number one mobile banking services provider in the country that recently applied for a digital retail banking license.I recently visited our operations in Bangladesh and was impressed by the scale  scope and ambitions of our subsidiary Banglalink  the consistent winner of the Ookla 4G speed test over the last 2 years that recently purchased 40Mhz of 2300-band spectrum. This move doubles its frequency holding and ensures faster internet speeds and high-quality digital services for its almost 38 million customers. Banglalink is also expanding its digital experience offering beyond the significant success of Toffee  the top entertainment app in the country. In March the operator launched Bangladesh's first digital health aggregator Health Hub   which helps to make healthcare more affordable and accessible for millions of Bangladeshis.I also visited Uzbekistan at the end of March and was delighted to see the turnaround being achieved by Beeline  which reported double digit growth in the last two quarters of 2021. With Sherzod Shermatov  Minister for Development of Information Technologies and Communications  we jointly inaugurated a new 'hyper-speed' channel rolled out by Beeline to connect the two main cities of Tashkent and Samarkand at a speed of 600 Gbps. Building on these and other investments  Beeline continues to serve its customers with an exciting portfolio of offers  including their first digital operator service  which launched in March.I was with my team in Algeria last week. Our leading mobile operator Djezzy has had a strong start to the year  after delivering a good performance in 2021. The latest release of the Djezzy app includes new e-payment and subscription options as well as extended content access  stepping up the digital operator profile of the company. At the same time  the put exercise process is moving ahead well and we are currently in constructive dialogue with our partner to complete the transaction. Throughout this process  we remain committed to the stability of the company as well as its continued positive business performance.A global telco operator with the highest governance standardsVEON is a global telecoms group  providing customers in 9 countries essential connectivity as well as digital services ranging from entertainment to healthcare and banking. We remain committed to generating value for all our stakeholders and maintaining the highest level of governance  transparency and compliance. In this context  let me also once again welcome Michiel Soeting   former global lead partner from KPMG  who joined the VEON Board as a non-executive director and Chairman of the Audit & Risk Committee effective March 16  2022.As per our last update on March 15th  VEON is not the subject of any sanctions imposed by the European Union  the United States or the United Kingdom  and our counterparties' ability to continue to do business with us has not been impacted by these measures. The international community understands our position as an essential service provider  with regulators outlining their commitment to support sectors essential to humanitarian activities that support the flow of information and access to the internet.I will continue to keep you updated  and your feedback is most welcome.

Beeline's extensive 4G roll-out over the previous two years has proven vitally important  and I am pleased to note that the company's NPS trends continue improving  especially in Moscow.Continued growth across our footprintAmong other key developments from our operating companies  I would like to highlight:In Pakistan   Jazz's growing 4G penetration and digital services continue to contribute to customer loyalty  engagement and value generation  while enabling the broader digital transformation of Pakistan .

2874,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.uppermichiganssource.com/prnewswire/2022/04/13/letter-veon-ceo-stakeholders/,Letter from VEON CEO to stakeholders,,AMSTERDAM  April 13  2022 /PRNewswire/ --Dear VEON stakeholder I am writing you today to highlight the strategic progress we are making across our operations  as well as provide updates on a number of key issues for our Group.Liquidity and capital marketsWe continue to prioritize maintaining the Group's healthy liquidity. Our cash position at HQ level currently stands at around US$1.3 billion  which is deposited with international banks and fully accessible. In addition  around US$700 million remains available to VEON as part of a committed revolving credit facility  underwritten by a group of diversified lenders headquartered in the United States  Europe and Asia. VEON has no further material debt maturities at HQ level for the rest of 2022.Besides this HQ liquidity  our operating companies currently have a total cash position equivalent to over US$500 million. Considering the self-sufficient nature of each of our operating subsidiaries  VEON is well placed to weather the complex market conditions we currently face.VEON shares continue to trade on Nasdaq and on Euronext. Their market turnover in March was equal to more than two times our free float. Understandably  the price of VEON's shares has been impacted significantly by the deterioration in the geopolitical environment. While the price of our ADRs has recovered from the closing price low of US$0.26/share  it remains below the US$1/share minimum required by Nasdaq. As a result  VEON was notified on April 7  2022 that the Company no longer meets the exchange's Listing Rules  based on the closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days. These rules do provide for the resolution of the matter  should the closing bid price of the Company's security be at least US$1 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at any time during the 180-day period following the notification. Further extensions and other options will be available. As and when the current geopolitical volatility subsides  I am confident that VEON's share price will better reflect fair value.Committed to connectivityWe provide connectivity  access to information and other vital digital services to 220 million customers across nine countries. One third of VEON's customers are in Ukraine and Russia  where they are supported by 33 000 employees. Our top priority is to protect the safety and well-being of these employees and their families while they work hard to ensure that our subscribers can stay connected and access what is an essential humanitarian service.The outstanding job done by Kyivstar in maintaining connectivity and supporting its customers has been covered extensively  including in this article by Reuters . I want to applaud once again the extraordinary dedication of our team  who have worked tirelessly to keep the people of Ukraine connected  informed and safe. Kyivstar's technicians are currently repairing equipment in areas of the country that are now safe to enter  and 91% of all transmission sites are now operational.To maintain our high standards of service in Ukraine  Kyivstar's team have also overseen the construction of 121 new base stations in the western part of the country. Furthermore  to ensure essential connectivity in these challenging and unpredictable conditions  we are growing our partnership with Starlink.Kyivstar continues to serve its customers with roam like home – for free   which enables about 2 million subscribers to remain connected without additional roaming fees as they take refuge in European countries.Our core mission of providing customers with connectivity  access to information and other vital digital services applies to all of our markets. The humanitarian need for connectivity is as important as other basic needs such as food  water  shelter and health care.In Russia we are facing a new and challenging economic environment. The quality of our network remains a key focus  and Beeline continues to launch VoLTE in new regions  to build new LTE base stations and to progress in the fiberization of its transport infrastructure.

2875,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=29b31074-6c7a-43d4-b1ce-b1efa9db2dd7,Changes to the Euronext Growth Markets Rule Book,8 hours ago,An updated Euronext Growth Markets Rule Book (the “Euronext Growth Rules”) came into effect on 1 April 2022. These updated Euronext Growth Rules are available from the Euronext website here and replace the previous version of the Euronext Growth Rules published on 9 November 2020.BackgroundSince the acquisition of the Irish Stock Exchange plc by the pan-European stock exchange operator Euronext  issuers admitted to the Euronext Growth Market operated by Euronext Dublin (“Euronext Growth Dublin”) have been required to comply with the harmonised rules in Part I of the Euronext Growth Rules (“Part I”) (which apply to issuers admitted to all Euronext Growth markets throughout Europe) along with the additional rules for Euronext Growth Dublin in Part II of the Euronext Growth Rules (“Part II”) (which set out specific rules for admission and continuing obligations for issuers admitted to Euronext Growth Dublin).In May 2021  Euronext Dublin announced a review of the Euronext Growth Rules citing a number of factors including the migration of Euronext Dublin issuers to Euronext’s pan-European trading platform Optiq  Brexit and the CSD migration from CREST to Euroclear Bank and the fact that the FCA is currently in the process of reviewing the London Stock Exchange’s listing rules. A consultation paper was issued by Euronext Dublin on 19 May 2021 and the amended rules were published on 21 March 2021.Euronext has stated that the main objectives of the review of the Euronext Growth Rules were:to have reasonably consistent regimes across Euronext Growth markets to enable current and future issuers to access one or more markets easily; to expand the advisory regime to enable approved Euronext advisors to support companies across Euronext’s European platforms; to enable international issuers and advisors to connect to the Irish market; and to streamline and align the existing rules with those of other Euronext jurisdictions  including by removal of rules that are covered in legislation and certain anomalies vis-à-vis other European exchanges  e.g. the class tests.The changes in the main relate to the Irish specific rules in Part II but Part I has also been amended to reflect that certain rules in Part I  previously switched off for Irish issuers  will now apply to Euronext Growth Dublin issuers also.Interestingly  a proposed change to Part I which would have explicitly allowed for the admission of special purpose acquisition companies (or SPACs) to Euronext Growth Dublin did not survive the consultation process and does not appear in the new version of the Euronext Growth Rules.Key changesThe key changes to the Euronext Growth Rules include:Admission processThe content requirements for the Information Document (also referred to as an Admission Document) required on first admission to trading have been amended. The content requirements are now set out in Appendix III of Part I and as a result are aligned with the Euronext Growth markets in other jurisdictions.Euronext Dublin will now also perform a review of the Information Document for completeness  consistency and comprehensibility pursuant to Rule 3.1.2 of Part I. Previously  the Euronext Growth Advisor was responsible for confirming to Euronext Dublin that the Information Document complied with the relevant requirements of the Euronext Growth Rules.For new applicants to Euronext Growth Dublin  the requirement to make a Schedule One announcement has been removed. Going forward  an applicant will be required to make an intention to float announcement and publish an Information Document only.Disclosure of Corporate TransactionsThe rules setting out conditions which issuers must comply with before entering into substantial transactions (a transaction exceeding 10% under any of the class tests)  related party transactions (a transaction with a related party exceeding 5% of any of the class tests) and transactions resulting in a fundamental change of business (a disposal or disposals exceeding 75% under any of the class tests) have been removed in their entirety.The deletion of these requirements was addressed in a feedback statement released by Euronext. Regarding the deletion of the rules relating to substantial transactions  Euronext reasoned that issuers must still comply with their obligations under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU 596/2014) (“MAR”) and substantial transactions would often amount to inside information requiring disclosure to the market as soon as possible. In regards to related party transactions and in particular the removal of the requirement for the directors of an issuer to state that the transaction is fair and reasonable as far as shareholders are concerned  Euronext noted that directors have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of shareholders in any event and related party transactions have to be disclosed in the issuer’s financial statements where they affect the issuer’s financial position.The requirement that the completion of a reverse takeover be subject to the consent of shareholders at general meeting  notification of the transaction to the market and the publication of an Information Document in respect of the proposed enlarged entity is maintained. The concept of a fundamental change in business has been retained as a test for assessing whether a transaction is a reverse takeover  alongside the alternative test that the consideration exceed 100% of market capitalisation.Euronext Growth AdvisorsThe Rules for Euronext Growth Advisors have been repealed and are replaced by the rules set out in Appendix IV of Part I which apply to advisors in other Euronext jurisdictions.

However  the requirement to disclose changes to the shareholdings of “significant shareholders” (shareholders over 3%) is retained. Similarly  the explicit requirement to have in place sufficient procedures  resources and controls to comply with the Euronext Growth Rules is deleted  as is the requirement to have in place a reasonable and effective share dealing policy (but this will not affect an issuer’s obligations to comply with MAR).CommentIssuers and their advisers (in particular Euronext Growth Listing Sponsors (formerly Euronext Growth Advisors)) should take note of these changes to ensure continuing compliance with the Euronext Growth Rules.,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.04,negative,0.02,0.13,0.85,True,English,"['Euronext Growth Markets Rule Book', 'Changes', 'Euronext Growth Markets Rule Book', 'pan-European stock exchange operator', 'Irish Stock Exchange plc', 'special purpose acquisition companies', 'updated Euronext Growth Rules', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Euronext Growth Dublin issuers', 'Euronext Growth Advisor', 'pan-European trading platform', 'Market Abuse Regulation', 'other European exchanges', 'related party transactions', 'other Euronext jurisdictions', 'Irish specific rules', 'Euronext Dublin issuers', 'Schedule One announcement', 'other jurisdictions', 'Irish market', 'Euronext website', 'Irish issuers', 'European platforms', 'additional rules', 'listing rules', 'existing rules', 'Corporate Transactions', 'substantial transactions', 'Euronext advisors', 'previous version', 'Euroclear Bank', 'consultation paper', 'consistent regimes', 'advisory regime', 'class tests', 'new version', 'Information Document', 'Appendix III', 'new applicants', 'feedback statement', 'inside information', 'fiduciary duty', 'best interest', 'financial statements', 'financial position', 'reverse takeover', 'general meeting', 'future issuers', 'international issuers', 'content requirements', 'relevant requirements', 'consultation process', 'Key changes', 'Admission Document', 'first admission', 'Part II', 'continuing obligations', 'CSD migration', 'main objectives', 'Part I.', 'fundamental change', 'Admission process', 'effect', '1 April', '9 November', 'Background', 'May', 'review', 'number', 'factors', 'Optiq', 'Brexit', 'CREST', 'FCA', 'amended', '21 March', 'current', 'removal', 'legislation', 'anomalies', 'SPACs', 'result', 'completeness', 'consistency', 'comprehensibility', 'intention', 'Disclosure', 'conditions', 'business', 'disposal', 'entirety', 'deletion', 'directors', 'shareholders', 'event', 'completion', 'consent', 'notification']",2022-04-13,2022-04-13,lexology.com

The first trial of its kind in the UK  it will also explore how fibre can help the water industry detect and repair leaks  often before they cause a problem for consumers. This will help water companies operate more efficiently and lower the carbon cost of drinking water.Under the proposals  fibre-optic cables would be deployed through 17 kilometres of live drinking water mains between Barnsley and Penistone  South Yorkshire  in a technology trial. Broadband companies could then tap into the network to deliver gigabit-capable connections to up to 8 500 homes and businesses along the route.Civil works  in particular installing new ducts and poles  can make up as much as four fifths of the cost to industry of building new gigabit-capable broadband networks. The Fibre in Water scheme will demonstrate what could be a greener  quicker and more cost-effective way of connecting fibre optic cables to homes  businesses and mobile masts  without the disruption caused by digging up roads and land.The network will also be used to set up 5G masts to bring fast and reliable wireless broadband to hard-to-reach communities where wired solutions are too expensive to deliver commercially.Peter Oosterveer  CEO of Arcadis  said:“This is an ambitious and ground-breaking project that will help to future-proof both water and telecommunications infrastructure  and I’m excited that Arcadis is at the forefront of developing new and scalable solutions to some of today’s most pressing challenges. Fibre in water technology will be key when it comes to finding quicker  cleaner and more cost-effective ways to ensure hard-to-reach communities can access vital broadband services  while simultaneously reducing water leakage across the network.”Mark Harrop  Head of Telecoms at Arcadis  said:“This kind of project is where the depth and breadth of Arcadis really comes into its own. Fibre in water technology has been around for some time  but what is missing is an operational and commercial model that meets the needs of both telecoms and water industries.“Working in both industries  Arcadis is well positioned to help identify pain-points and develop a viable approach that will make fibre in water a realistic choice for operators delivering the UK Government’s Project Gigabit plan. What is really pleasing is that  with Yorkshire Water  we are bringing the project to South Yorkshire and Barnsley  where Arcadis recently also completed a project for the Mayoral Combined Authority  developing South Yorkshire’s digital infrastructure strategy.”Minister of State for Media  Data  and Digital Infrastructure in the UK  Julia Lopez MP  added:“Digging up roads and land is one of the biggest obstacles to rolling out faster broadband  so we’re investing to explore how we can make use of the existing water network to accelerate deployment and also help detect and prevent water leaks.“We’re committed to breaking down barriers to better broadband and this pioneering project is an exciting example of the bold measures this government is leading on to level-up communities with top-of-the-range digital connectivity.”Sam Bright  Innovation Programme Manager at Yorkshire Water said:“We are pleased that the UK Government is supporting the development of the Fibre in Water solution  which can reduce the environmental impact and day-to-day disruptions that can be caused by both water and telecoms companies’ activities.“The technology for fibre in water has significantly progressed in recent years and this project will now enable us to fully develop its potential to help improve access to better broadband in hard-to-reach areas and further reduce leakage on our networks.”The first phase of the project will focus on the legal and safety aspects of this innovative solution. It will ensure that combining clean water and telecoms services in a single pipeline is safe  secure and commercially viable before any technology is actually installed.If successful  the project could be replicated in other parts of the country and could turbocharge the UK government’s £5 billion Project Gigabit plan to level up broadband access in hard-to-reach areas.In the UK  20 per cent of water put into public supply is wasted due to leaks every day. With current technology  it can be difficult for water companies to quickly identify the exact location of a leak and carry out a repair.Water companies in the UK have committed to delivering a 50% reduction in leakage  and this project could help to reach that goal. The materials that will come into contact with the water supply have been approved for use in the UK  and they have already been deployed in water pipes in other countries such as Spain.The trials will last for up to two years and  if successful  the technology could be operational in networks from 2024 onwards.-End-FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:ARCADIS CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONSKerri MooreE-mail : kerri.moore@arcadis.comARCADIS INVESTOR RELATIONSChristine DischMobile: +31 6 15376020E-mail: christine.disch@arcadis.comABOUT ARCADISArcadis is the leading global design & consultancy organization for natural and built assets.

Our go-to-market traction  successful financing activities  and investment in intellectual property and scalable infrastructure position us to drive consistent growth and meaningful value for shareholders throughout 2022 and beyond.Story continuesOur ongoing investment into building out our internal capabilities and developing our innovative IP portfolio to address evolving needs for privacy  security  and accessibility in digital operations resulted in key strategic achievements in 2021  including entry into the GovTech space with a contract from the United States federal government  growth in our client and prospect base  and expanded commercial relationships with both new and flagship customers.Trust Stamp provides transformational  privacy-first technologies that give individuals greater control and protection of their own data while strengthening organizational security  at a fraction of the cost of legacy solutions. Our growth in 2021 parallels an increased awareness of the risks associated with conventional means of authentication including the breach and exposure of data  along with a rapidly evolving global regulatory landscape around data privacy and protection  both of which we anticipate to continue trending upward.Trust Stamp is committed to delivering solutions that support robust  accessible  and equitable financial systems with vast potential to impact the large yet underserved addressable market made up of an estimated 4B underbanked individuals around the world. Innovation for global inclusion remained a core strategic focus in 2021 as we established a subsidiary in Rwanda  which today represents our second largest R&D hub  and a key base as we continue to develop important governmental and commercial relationships in the region.With continued cross-industry successes as we execute on a mission-driven strategy for global growth  we remain highly encouraged by the outlook for the business and look forward to providing further updates in the weeks and months ahead.”Financial Performance OverviewRevenueNet Sales for the Full Year increased to $3.7M in 2021 from $2.6M in 2020 as Trust Stamp expanded on agreements with existing customers in line with our strategy of seeking long-term revenue channels that can drive stable growth. We also acquired new customers  doubling the number of non-affiliated clients generating significant revenue to six customers. As a result  our flagship customers comprise a smaller proportion of revenue compared to prior years despite their own increased engagements with us.Gross Profit and Profit MarginGross Profit increased by a notable 124.0% year-over-year  to $2.5M in 2021 from $1.1M in 2020  while Gross Profit Margin improved by 26.1% year-over-year  to 68.7% in 2021 from 42.6% in 2020. The improvements in Gross Profit and Profit Margin result from a change in the disaggregation of revenue earned through different sales models  reflecting our ongoing efforts to shift income streams from custom implementation and development work to semi-custom implementations  in addition to onboarding contracts that provide for long-term pay-per-use revenue  with relatively nominal costs to implementing existing technology.Operational and Strategic DevelopmentsGrowth in Global Team and PresenceTrust Stamp’s headcount grew to 94 team members from 57  with a focus on accelerating R&D and productization in addition to expanding our global sales team’s capacity to address increased interest across geographies and verticals. Trust Stamp hired our Chief Innovation Officer in September 2021 to lead various R&D initiatives as well as the monetization of existing technology.Trust Stamp Rwanda Limited was formed in May 2021 as part of our commitment to delivering equitable  accessible  and secure identity technologies that power inclusion in all regions of the world. Our African R&D center had 12 employees by 31 December 2021. Trust Stamp Malta Limited also experienced significant expansion during 2021  growing from 23 to 40 staff members as Trust Stamp’s largest R&D center and our hub for E.U. operations.This growth in headcount and resulting overhead requirements led to a $1.9M increase in year-over-year Selling  General  and Administrative expenses  totalling $8.3 million for the year ended 31 December 2021  and contributing to a 13.8% or $1.5M increase in Total Operating Expenses. Both increases were outpaced by the growth rate of Net Sales.Intellectual PropertyTrust Stamp continued developing a robust intellectual property portfolio  adding three new patent issuances and 11 new pending patents  including multiple that serve to secure protection and validate our innovation behind the liveness verification and presentation attack detection technologies central to our fraud-resistant biometric services. Most notably  we received allowance of the patent for Trust Stamp’s core market differentiator  our privacy-first data tokenization technology.Digital Asset and Cryptocurrency ServicesTo further develop a competitive position in the digital asset space  Trust Stamp established the Metapresence Limited subsidiary as a participant in The Digital Isle of Man Accelerator Program  which provides access to a regulatory sandbox where flexible licensing conditions enable agile development of digital asset services. The subsidiary operates Trust Stamp’s currently beta-stage Crypto Key Vault solution designed to provide cryptocurrency and NFT investors with the security and convenience of traditional financial services  using our proven facial biometric authentication technology.FinancingThese operational developments were supported in part by the Trust Stamp’s financing activities throughout 2021  carrying into early 2022. Building on the success of a private $4.0M round of funding in the first half of 2021 and driven by investor interest  Trust Stamp launched a public round of funding in Q3 2021 with the primary goal of driving our January 2022 uplisting to the Nasdaq Capital Market. Financing and operating activities  combined with the monetization of internal-use software  resulted in an 80.0% increase in Total Assets to $8.7M at year-end 2021 from $3.9M at year-end 2020.H1 2022 OutlookWe expect significant year-on-year revenue growth for the first two quarters of 2022. This growth is expected to come from pre-contracted monthly payments from current clients along with revenue growth from new clients in a maturing sales pipeline. As of 31 December 2021  our commercial pipeline included 55 potential revenue contracts and projects.In addition to generating revenue in 2021  our investment in business development led to significant client engagements for proof-of-concept and new product development  which we expect to result in future recurring revenue. The 64.9% headcount increase in 2021 enabled the transition of most of Trust Stamp’s software development activities from outsourcing to in-house  which we expect to further reduce costs  improve margins  and accelerate service delivery.We will continue pursuing new commercial opportunities to expand our client base  along with the scope and range of services provided both to and through our clients as we also focus efforts on engaging channel partners with substantial distribution networks and the potential for high revenue impact at relatively low costs. Following substantial investment into developing our core technology services in prior years and its targeted commercialization through development of cost-effective  streamlined routes of service delivery in 2021  two financial service providers utilizing our “low-code” implementation platform publicly announced partnership with Trust Stamp in Q1 2022  including S&P 500 company and global leader in financial services technology  FIS.Trust Stamp has made significant progress on executing key strategic goals in the first quarter of 2022  including uplisting to the Nasdaq Capital Market on 28 January 2022. With a strong balance sheet and cash on hand following closing $5.8M in funding in January 2022  we anticipate having sufficient liquidity to support our working capital needs to execute on our growth plan through 2022.Enquiries Trust Stamp Email: Shareholders@truststamp.ai Gareth Genner  Chief Executive Officer Nisha Naik  Executive VP of Communications Davy (Euronext Growth Advisor) Tel: +353 1 679 6363 Barry Murphy Investor Relations Tel: +1 212-671-1021 Crescendo Communications Email: idai@crescendo-ir.comAbout Trust StampTrust Stamp   the Privacy-First Identity Company™  is a global provider of AI-powered identity services for use in multiple sectors including banking and finance  regulatory compliance  government  real estate  communications  and humanitarian services.
