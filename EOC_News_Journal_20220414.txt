2799,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=29b31074-6c7a-43d4-b1ce-b1efa9db2dd7,Changes to the Euronext Growth Markets Rule Book,1 day ago,An updated Euronext Growth Markets Rule Book (the “Euronext Growth Rules”) came into effect on 1 April 2022. These updated Euronext Growth Rules are available from the Euronext website here and replace the previous version of the Euronext Growth Rules published on 9 November 2020.BackgroundSince the acquisition of the Irish Stock Exchange plc by the pan-European stock exchange operator Euronext  issuers admitted to the Euronext Growth Market operated by Euronext Dublin (“Euronext Growth Dublin”) have been required to comply with the harmonised rules in Part I of the Euronext Growth Rules (“Part I”) (which apply to issuers admitted to all Euronext Growth markets throughout Europe) along with the additional rules for Euronext Growth Dublin in Part II of the Euronext Growth Rules (“Part II”) (which set out specific rules for admission and continuing obligations for issuers admitted to Euronext Growth Dublin).In May 2021  Euronext Dublin announced a review of the Euronext Growth Rules citing a number of factors including the migration of Euronext Dublin issuers to Euronext’s pan-European trading platform Optiq  Brexit and the CSD migration from CREST to Euroclear Bank and the fact that the FCA is currently in the process of reviewing the London Stock Exchange’s listing rules. A consultation paper was issued by Euronext Dublin on 19 May 2021 and the amended rules were published on 21 March 2021.Euronext has stated that the main objectives of the review of the Euronext Growth Rules were:to have reasonably consistent regimes across Euronext Growth markets to enable current and future issuers to access one or more markets easily; to expand the advisory regime to enable approved Euronext advisors to support companies across Euronext’s European platforms; to enable international issuers and advisors to connect to the Irish market; and to streamline and align the existing rules with those of other Euronext jurisdictions  including by removal of rules that are covered in legislation and certain anomalies vis-à-vis other European exchanges  e.g. the class tests.The changes in the main relate to the Irish specific rules in Part II but Part I has also been amended to reflect that certain rules in Part I  previously switched off for Irish issuers  will now apply to Euronext Growth Dublin issuers also.Interestingly  a proposed change to Part I which would have explicitly allowed for the admission of special purpose acquisition companies (or SPACs) to Euronext Growth Dublin did not survive the consultation process and does not appear in the new version of the Euronext Growth Rules.Key changesThe key changes to the Euronext Growth Rules include:Admission processThe content requirements for the Information Document (also referred to as an Admission Document) required on first admission to trading have been amended. The content requirements are now set out in Appendix III of Part I and as a result are aligned with the Euronext Growth markets in other jurisdictions.Euronext Dublin will now also perform a review of the Information Document for completeness  consistency and comprehensibility pursuant to Rule 3.1.2 of Part I. Previously  the Euronext Growth Advisor was responsible for confirming to Euronext Dublin that the Information Document complied with the relevant requirements of the Euronext Growth Rules.For new applicants to Euronext Growth Dublin  the requirement to make a Schedule One announcement has been removed. Going forward  an applicant will be required to make an intention to float announcement and publish an Information Document only.Disclosure of Corporate TransactionsThe rules setting out conditions which issuers must comply with before entering into substantial transactions (a transaction exceeding 10% under any of the class tests)  related party transactions (a transaction with a related party exceeding 5% of any of the class tests) and transactions resulting in a fundamental change of business (a disposal or disposals exceeding 75% under any of the class tests) have been removed in their entirety.The deletion of these requirements was addressed in a feedback statement released by Euronext. Regarding the deletion of the rules relating to substantial transactions  Euronext reasoned that issuers must still comply with their obligations under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU 596/2014) (“MAR”) and substantial transactions would often amount to inside information requiring disclosure to the market as soon as possible. In regards to related party transactions and in particular the removal of the requirement for the directors of an issuer to state that the transaction is fair and reasonable as far as shareholders are concerned  Euronext noted that directors have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of shareholders in any event and related party transactions have to be disclosed in the issuer’s financial statements where they affect the issuer’s financial position.The requirement that the completion of a reverse takeover be subject to the consent of shareholders at general meeting  notification of the transaction to the market and the publication of an Information Document in respect of the proposed enlarged entity is maintained. The concept of a fundamental change in business has been retained as a test for assessing whether a transaction is a reverse takeover  alongside the alternative test that the consideration exceed 100% of market capitalisation.Euronext Growth AdvisorsThe Rules for Euronext Growth Advisors have been repealed and are replaced by the rules set out in Appendix IV of Part I which apply to advisors in other Euronext jurisdictions. As a result  Euronext Growth Advisors will now be known as Euronext Growth Listing Sponsors and will be subject to the pan-European rules of Book I.Half-year reportThe half year report must now be published within 4 months of the end of the second quarter of the financial year (previously required within 3 months).BrokerIssuers admitted to Euronext Growth Dublin are no longer required to retain a broker at all times (but we expect many issuers will continue to do so).Cash Shell CompaniesEuronext has extended the period during which an issuer may be a cash shell company (from 6 months to 12 months) before Euronext will consider suspending the issuer from trading.Other continuing obligationsCertain of the other continuing obligations for issuers on Euronext Growth Dublin have also been removed  including many of the miscellaneous disclosure requirements  such as the requirements to issue an RIS on the resignation  dismissal and appointment of directors  on changes to an accounting reference date  registered office or legal name and on payment of dividends. However  the requirement to disclose changes to the shareholdings of “significant shareholders” (shareholders over 3%) is retained. Similarly  the explicit requirement to have in place sufficient procedures  resources and controls to comply with the Euronext Growth Rules is deleted  as is the requirement to have in place a reasonable and effective share dealing policy (but this will not affect an issuer’s obligations to comply with MAR).CommentIssuers and their advisers (in particular Euronext Growth Listing Sponsors (formerly Euronext Growth Advisors)) should take note of these changes to ensure continuing compliance with the Euronext Growth Rules.,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.04,negative,0.02,0.13,0.85,True,English,"['Euronext Growth Markets Rule Book', 'Changes', 'Euronext Growth Markets Rule Book', 'pan-European stock exchange operator', 'Irish Stock Exchange plc', 'special purpose acquisition companies', 'updated Euronext Growth Rules', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Euronext Growth Dublin issuers', 'Euronext Growth Advisor', 'pan-European trading platform', 'Market Abuse Regulation', 'other European exchanges', 'related party transactions', 'other Euronext jurisdictions', 'Irish specific rules', 'Euronext Dublin issuers', 'Schedule One announcement', 'other jurisdictions', 'Irish market', 'Euronext website', 'Irish issuers', 'European platforms', 'additional rules', 'listing rules', 'existing rules', 'Corporate Transactions', 'substantial transactions', 'Euronext advisors', 'previous version', 'Euroclear Bank', 'consultation paper', 'consistent regimes', 'advisory regime', 'class tests', 'new version', 'Information Document', 'Appendix III', 'new applicants', 'feedback statement', 'inside information', 'fiduciary duty', 'best interest', 'financial statements', 'financial position', 'reverse takeover', 'general meeting', 'future issuers', 'international issuers', 'content requirements', 'relevant requirements', 'consultation process', 'Key changes', 'Admission Document', 'first admission', 'Part II', 'continuing obligations', 'CSD migration', 'main objectives', 'Part I.', 'fundamental change', 'Admission process', 'effect', '1 April', '9 November', 'Background', 'May', 'review', 'number', 'factors', 'Optiq', 'Brexit', 'CREST', 'FCA', 'amended', '21 March', 'current', 'removal', 'legislation', 'anomalies', 'SPACs', 'result', 'completeness', 'consistency', 'comprehensibility', 'intention', 'Disclosure', 'conditions', 'business', 'disposal', 'entirety', 'deletion', 'directors', 'shareholders', 'event', 'completion', 'consent', 'notification']",2022-04-14,2022-04-14,lexology.com

2871,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/letter-veon-ceo-stakeholders-113200778.html,Letter from VEON CEO to stakeholders,Dear VEON stakeholder ,AMSTERDAM  April 13  2022 /PRNewswire/ --Dear VEON stakeholder I am writing you today to highlight the strategic progress we are making across our operations  as well as provide updates on a number of key issues for our Group.Liquidity and capital marketsWe continue to prioritize maintaining the Group's healthy liquidity. Our cash position at HQ level currently stands at around US$1.3 billion  which is deposited with international banks and fully accessible. In addition  around US$700 million remains available to VEON as part of a committed revolving credit facility  underwritten by a group of diversified lenders headquartered in the United States  Europe and Asia. VEON has no further material debt maturities at HQ level for the rest of 2022.Besides this HQ liquidity  our operating companies currently have a total cash position equivalent to over US$500 million. Considering the self-sufficient nature of each of our operating subsidiaries  VEON is well placed to weather the complex market conditions we currently face.VEON shares continue to trade on Nasdaq and on Euronext. Their market turnover in March was equal to more than two times our free float. Understandably  the price of VEON's shares has been impacted significantly by the deterioration in the geopolitical environment. While the price of our ADRs has recovered from the closing price low of US$0.26/share  it remains below the US$1/share minimum required by Nasdaq. As a result  VEON was notified on April 7  2022 that the Company no longer meets the exchange's Listing Rules  based on the closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days. These rules do provide for the resolution of the matter  should the closing bid price of the Company's security be at least US$1 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at any time during the 180-day period following the notification. Further extensions and other options will be available. As and when the current geopolitical volatility subsides  I am confident that VEON's share price will better reflect fair value.Story continuesCommitted to connectivityWe provide connectivity  access to information and other vital digital services to 220 million customers across nine countries. One third of VEON's customers are in Ukraine and Russia  where they are supported by 33 000 employees. Our top priority is to protect the safety and well-being of these employees and their families while they work hard to ensure that our subscribers can stay connected and access what is an essential humanitarian service.The outstanding job done by Kyivstar in maintaining connectivity and supporting its customers has been covered extensively  including in this article by Reuters . I want to applaud once again the extraordinary dedication of our team  who have worked tirelessly to keep the people of Ukraine connected  informed and safe. Kyivstar's technicians are currently repairing equipment in areas of the country that are now safe to enter  and 91% of all transmission sites are now operational.To maintain our high standards of service in Ukraine  Kyivstar's team have also overseen the construction of 121 new base stations in the western part of the country. Furthermore  to ensure essential connectivity in these challenging and unpredictable conditions  we are growing our partnership with Starlink.Kyivstar continues to serve its customers with roam like home – for free   which enables about 2 million subscribers to remain connected without additional roaming fees as they take refuge in European countries.Our core mission of providing customers with connectivity  access to information and other vital digital services applies to all of our markets. The humanitarian need for connectivity is as important as other basic needs such as food  water  shelter and health care.In Russia we are facing a new and challenging economic environment.

Liquidity and capital markets …,AMSTERDAM  April 13  2022 /PRNewswire/ --Dear VEON stakeholder I am writing you today to highlight the strategic progress we are making across our operations  as well as provide updates on a number of key issues for our Group.Liquidity and capital marketsWe continue to prioritize maintaining the Group's healthy liquidity. Our cash position at HQ level currently stands at around US$1.3 billion  which is deposited with international banks and fully accessible. In addition  around US$700 million remains available to VEON as part of a committed revolving credit facility  underwritten by a group of diversified lenders headquartered in the United States  Europe and Asia. VEON has no further material debt maturities at HQ level for the rest of 2022.Besides this HQ liquidity  our operating companies currently have a total cash position equivalent to over US$500 million. Considering the self-sufficient nature of each of our operating subsidiaries  VEON is well placed to weather the complex market conditions we currently face.VEON shares continue to trade on Nasdaq and on Euronext. Their market turnover in March was equal to more than two times our free float. Understandably  the price of VEON's shares has been impacted significantly by the deterioration in the geopolitical environment. While the price of our ADRs has recovered from the closing price low of US$0.26/share  it remains below the US$1/share minimum required by Nasdaq. As a result  VEON was notified on April 7  2022 that the Company no longer meets the exchange's Listing Rules  based on the closing bid price for the last 30 consecutive business days. These rules do provide for the resolution of the matter  should the closing bid price of the Company's security be at least US$1 for a minimum of ten consecutive business days at any time during the 180-day period following the notification. Further extensions and other options will be available. As and when the current geopolitical volatility subsides  I am confident that VEON's share price will better reflect fair value.Committed to connectivityWe provide connectivity  access to information and other vital digital services to 220 million customers across nine countries. One third of VEON's customers are in Ukraine and Russia  where they are supported by 33 000 employees. Our top priority is to protect the safety and well-being of these employees and their families while they work hard to ensure that our subscribers can stay connected and access what is an essential humanitarian service.The outstanding job done by Kyivstar in maintaining connectivity and supporting its customers has been covered extensively  including in this article by Reuters . I want to applaud once again the extraordinary dedication of our team  who have worked tirelessly to keep the people of Ukraine connected  informed and safe. Kyivstar's technicians are currently repairing equipment in areas of the country that are now safe to enter  and 91% of all transmission sites are now operational.To maintain our high standards of service in Ukraine  Kyivstar's team have also overseen the construction of 121 new base stations in the western part of the country. Furthermore  to ensure essential connectivity in these challenging and unpredictable conditions  we are growing our partnership with Starlink.Kyivstar continues to serve its customers with roam like home – for free   which enables about 2 million subscribers to remain connected without additional roaming fees as they take refuge in European countries.Our core mission of providing customers with connectivity  access to information and other vital digital services applies to all of our markets. The humanitarian need for connectivity is as important as other basic needs such as food  water  shelter and health care.In Russia we are facing a new and challenging economic environment. The quality of our network remains a key focus  and Beeline continues to launch VoLTE in new regions  to build new LTE base stations and to progress in the fiberization of its transport infrastructure.

These updated Euronext Growth Rules are available from the Euronext website here and replace the previous version of the Euronext Growth Rules published on 9 November 2020.BackgroundSince the acquisition of the Irish Stock Exchange plc by the pan-European stock exchange operator Euronext  issuers admitted to the Euronext Growth Market operated by Euronext Dublin (“Euronext Growth Dublin”) have been required to comply with the harmonised rules in Part I of the Euronext Growth Rules (“Part I”) (which apply to issuers admitted to all Euronext Growth markets throughout Europe) along with the additional rules for Euronext Growth Dublin in Part II of the Euronext Growth Rules (“Part II”) (which set out specific rules for admission and continuing obligations for issuers admitted to Euronext Growth Dublin).In May 2021  Euronext Dublin announced a review of the Euronext Growth Rules citing a number of factors including the migration of Euronext Dublin issuers to Euronext’s pan-European trading platform Optiq  Brexit and the CSD migration from CREST to Euroclear Bank and the fact that the FCA is currently in the process of reviewing the London Stock Exchange’s listing rules. A consultation paper was issued by Euronext Dublin on 19 May 2021 and the amended rules were published on 21 March 2021.Euronext has stated that the main objectives of the review of the Euronext Growth Rules were:to have reasonably consistent regimes across Euronext Growth markets to enable current and future issuers to access one or more markets easily; to expand the advisory regime to enable approved Euronext advisors to support companies across Euronext’s European platforms; to enable international issuers and advisors to connect to the Irish market; and to streamline and align the existing rules with those of other Euronext jurisdictions  including by removal of rules that are covered in legislation and certain anomalies vis-à-vis other European exchanges  e.g. the class tests.The changes in the main relate to the Irish specific rules in Part II but Part I has also been amended to reflect that certain rules in Part I  previously switched off for Irish issuers  will now apply to Euronext Growth Dublin issuers also.Interestingly  a proposed change to Part I which would have explicitly allowed for the admission of special purpose acquisition companies (or SPACs) to Euronext Growth Dublin did not survive the consultation process and does not appear in the new version of the Euronext Growth Rules.Key changesThe key changes to the Euronext Growth Rules include:Admission processThe content requirements for the Information Document (also referred to as an Admission Document) required on first admission to trading have been amended. The content requirements are now set out in Appendix III of Part I and as a result are aligned with the Euronext Growth markets in other jurisdictions.Euronext Dublin will now also perform a review of the Information Document for completeness  consistency and comprehensibility pursuant to Rule 3.1.2 of Part I. Previously  the Euronext Growth Advisor was responsible for confirming to Euronext Dublin that the Information Document complied with the relevant requirements of the Euronext Growth Rules.For new applicants to Euronext Growth Dublin  the requirement to make a Schedule One announcement has been removed. Going forward  an applicant will be required to make an intention to float announcement and publish an Information Document only.Disclosure of Corporate TransactionsThe rules setting out conditions which issuers must comply with before entering into substantial transactions (a transaction exceeding 10% under any of the class tests)  related party transactions (a transaction with a related party exceeding 5% of any of the class tests) and transactions resulting in a fundamental change of business (a disposal or disposals exceeding 75% under any of the class tests) have been removed in their entirety.The deletion of these requirements was addressed in a feedback statement released by Euronext. Regarding the deletion of the rules relating to substantial transactions  Euronext reasoned that issuers must still comply with their obligations under the Market Abuse Regulation (EU 596/2014) (“MAR”) and substantial transactions would often amount to inside information requiring disclosure to the market as soon as possible. In regards to related party transactions and in particular the removal of the requirement for the directors of an issuer to state that the transaction is fair and reasonable as far as shareholders are concerned  Euronext noted that directors have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of shareholders in any event and related party transactions have to be disclosed in the issuer’s financial statements where they affect the issuer’s financial position.The requirement that the completion of a reverse takeover be subject to the consent of shareholders at general meeting  notification of the transaction to the market and the publication of an Information Document in respect of the proposed enlarged entity is maintained. The concept of a fundamental change in business has been retained as a test for assessing whether a transaction is a reverse takeover  alongside the alternative test that the consideration exceed 100% of market capitalisation.Euronext Growth AdvisorsThe Rules for Euronext Growth Advisors have been repealed and are replaced by the rules set out in Appendix IV of Part I which apply to advisors in other Euronext jurisdictions. As a result  Euronext Growth Advisors will now be known as Euronext Growth Listing Sponsors and will be subject to the pan-European rules of Book I.Half-year reportThe half year report must now be published within 4 months of the end of the second quarter of the financial year (previously required within 3 months).BrokerIssuers admitted to Euronext Growth Dublin are no longer required to retain a broker at all times (but we expect many issuers will continue to do so).Cash Shell CompaniesEuronext has extended the period during which an issuer may be a cash shell company (from 6 months to 12 months) before Euronext will consider suspending the issuer from trading.Other continuing obligationsCertain of the other continuing obligations for issuers on Euronext Growth Dublin have also been removed  including many of the miscellaneous disclosure requirements  such as the requirements to issue an RIS on the resignation  dismissal and appointment of directors  on changes to an accounting reference date  registered office or legal name and on payment of dividends. However  the requirement to disclose changes to the shareholdings of “significant shareholders” (shareholders over 3%) is retained. Similarly  the explicit requirement to have in place sufficient procedures  resources and controls to comply with the Euronext Growth Rules is deleted  as is the requirement to have in place a reasonable and effective share dealing policy (but this will not affect an issuer’s obligations to comply with MAR).CommentIssuers and their advisers (in particular Euronext Growth Listing Sponsors (formerly Euronext Growth Advisors)) should take note of these changes to ensure continuing compliance with the Euronext Growth Rules.,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.04,negative,0.02,0.13,0.85,True,English,"['Euronext Growth Markets Rule Book', 'Changes', 'Euronext Growth Markets Rule Book', 'pan-European stock exchange operator', 'Irish Stock Exchange plc', 'special purpose acquisition companies', 'updated Euronext Growth Rules', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Euronext Growth Dublin issuers', 'Euronext Growth Advisor', 'pan-European trading platform', 'Market Abuse Regulation', 'other European exchanges', 'related party transactions', 'other Euronext jurisdictions', 'Irish specific rules', 'Euronext Dublin issuers', 'Schedule One announcement', 'other jurisdictions', 'Irish market', 'Euronext website', 'Irish issuers', 'European platforms', 'additional rules', 'listing rules', 'existing rules', 'Corporate Transactions', 'substantial transactions', 'Euronext advisors', 'previous version', 'Euroclear Bank', 'consultation paper', 'consistent regimes', 'advisory regime', 'class tests', 'new version', 'Information Document', 'Appendix III', 'new applicants', 'feedback statement', 'inside information', 'fiduciary duty', 'best interest', 'financial statements', 'financial position', 'reverse takeover', 'general meeting', 'future issuers', 'international issuers', 'content requirements', 'relevant requirements', 'consultation process', 'Key changes', 'Admission Document', 'first admission', 'Part II', 'continuing obligations', 'CSD migration', 'main objectives', 'Part I.', 'fundamental change', 'Admission process', 'effect', '1 April', '9 November', 'Background', 'May', 'review', 'number', 'factors', 'Optiq', 'Brexit', 'CREST', 'FCA', 'amended', '21 March', 'current', 'removal', 'legislation', 'anomalies', 'SPACs', 'result', 'completeness', 'consistency', 'comprehensibility', 'intention', 'Disclosure', 'conditions', 'business', 'disposal', 'entirety', 'deletion', 'directors', 'shareholders', 'event', 'completion', 'consent', 'notification']",2022-04-14,2022-04-14,lexology.com

The Board of Directors shall convene the nomination committee. The member representing the largest shareholder shall be appointed chairman of the nomination committee  unless the nomination committee unanimously appoints someone else.Should a shareholder having appointed a representative to the nomination committee no longer be among the three largest shareholders at a point in time falling three months before the annual general meeting at the latest  the representative appointed by such shareholder shall resign and the shareholder who is then among the three largest shareholders shall have the right to appoint one representative to the nomination committee. Unless there are specific reasons otherwise  the already established composition of the nomination committee shall  however  remain unchanged in case such change in the ownership is only marginal or occurs during the three month period prior to the annual general meeting. Where a shareholder has become one of the three largest shareholders due to a material change in the ownership at a point in time falling later than three months before the annual general meeting  such shareholder shall however in any event have the right to take part of the work of the nomination committee and participate in its meetings. Should a member resign from the nomination committee before his or her work is completed  the shareholder who has appointed such member shall appoint a new member  unless that shareholder is no longer one of the three largest shareholders  in which case the largest shareholder in turn shall appoint the substitute member. A shareholder who has appointed a representative to the nomination committee shall have the right to discharge such representative and appoint a new representative.Changes to the composition of the nomination committee shall be announced immediately. The term of office for the nomination committee ends when the next nomination committee has been appointed.

Such share issue resolution may be carried out with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions. The authorization may only be utilized to such extent that the number of shares issued under the authorization  or the number of shares created in connection with exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles  corresponds to a dilution of not more than 15 percent of the total number of shares outstanding at the time of the general meeting's resolution on adoption of the proposed authorization  reduced with the number of shares transferred to ensure delivery of shares under the company's ATM Program in accordance with item 16d below.The purpose of the authorization is to increase the financial flexibility of the company and the general flexibility of the Board of Directors. Should the Board of Directors resolve on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason for this shall be to finance an acquisition of operations  to procure capital to finance the development of projects or to commercialize the company' s products.

Calliditas' board of directors has been evaluating the opportunity of launching a so called At-The-Market program (""ATM Program"") in the US market. ATM Programs are common among many US listed companies  including Life Science companies. Approximately 70 percent of eligible Life Science Companies in the United States have ATM Programs in place. The board of directors of Calliditas is thus proposing to the shareholders to adopt resolutions to allow for an ATM Program as set out below in this agenda item 16  subject to AGM approval and further resolutions by the board before implementation of the program  however  no assurances can be given that a program will be utilized and the future use of an ATM Program will be evaluated by the Board of Directors taking other potential sources of financing  capital need and shareholder dilution into consideration.An ATM Program is an efficient and cost-effective method to raise equity in the US market  from time to time  and with significantly lower transactional costs compared to traditional capital raising alternatives. Sales are effected in ""at the market"" transactions of ADSs on The Nasdaq Global Select Market and/or negotiated transactions in the US subject to applicable US regulations and documentation. Having an ATM Program in place is expected to enable Calliditas to efficiently source capital in the US market  subject to demand and board approval. An ATM Program may also be used to settle reverse enquiries from institutional buyers. An ATM Program  if used  may also increase the liquidity of Calliditas' ADSs in the United States.16a - Amend the articles of associationThe Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend the articles of association as follows.A new section  § 5  together with an updated wording of § 4  is proposed in the articles of association.

Ordinary shares shall entitle the holder to one (1) vote per share  whereas C-shares shall entitle the holder to one tenth (1/10) vote per share. Shares of each class may be issued in a quantity corresponding to the entire share capital of the company. Holders of C-shares are not entitled to dividends. Upon the company's liquidation  C-shares carry equivalent right to the company's assets as other shares  however not to an amount exceeding the quota value of the share.Where the company resolves to issue new shares by way of a cash issue or a set-off issue  one old share shall entitle the holder to pre-emption rights to one new share of the same class pro rata to the number of shares previously owned by the holder (primary pre-emption rights). Shares that are not subscribed for pursuant to primary pre-emption rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (subsidiary pre-emption rights). Unless shares offered in such manner are sufficient for the subscription which takes place pursuant to subsidiary pre-emption rights  the shares shall be allotted among the subscribers pro rata to the total number of shares previously owned. Where this is not possible with respect to a particular share(s)  shares shall be allotted through drawing of lots.The provisions above shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility for the company to adopt a resolution regarding a cash issue or set-off issue without regard to shareholders' pre-emption rights.The provisions above regarding shareholders' pre-emption rights shall apply mutatis mutandis to an issue of warrants or an issue of convertible instruments.Where the company resolves to issue only one class of shares by way of a cash issue or set-off issue  all of the shareholders  irrespective of the class of share  shall hold pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares pro rata to the number of shares previously owned.In the event of a bonus issue  new shares of each class shall be issued pro rata to the number of shares of the same class previously issued.

The redemption amount per C- share shall correspond to the quota value of such share.Following notice of the redemption resolution  holders of shares shall promptly receive payment for the shares  or  if authorization from the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) or a court is required  following notice that the final decision has been registered. 5 § (New section inserted) 5 § Conversion clauseC-shares held by the company may  upon decision of the board of directors be reclassified into ordinary shares.

The resolutions under items 17a – 17b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 17b below not be met  the nomination committee proposes that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 17c below and resolutions under items 17a and 17c shall then be conditional upon each other.Board LTIP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  share awards subject to performance vesting (""Share Awards"") that entitle to shares in Calliditas Therapeutics to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 50 000 shares. As part of the implementation of Board LTIP 2022  not more than 50 000 warrants can be issued in accordance with item 17b below.17a - Adoption of a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of DirectorsThe rationale for the proposalBoard LTIP 2022 is intended for main owner independent members of the Board of Directors in Calliditas Therapeutics. The nomination committee believes that an equity-based incentive program is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members of the Board of Directors  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. Board LTIP 2022 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics.

The Share Awards shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as practicable after the annual general meeting.2. The Share Awards shall vest gradually over approximately three years  corresponding to three terms up to the date of  whichever is earliest  (i) the annual general meeting 2025 or (ii) 1 July 2025 (the ""Vesting Date"")  where each term equals the period from one annual general meeting up until the day falling immediately prior to the next annual general meeting or the Vesting Date  as applicable (each such period a ""Term""). The Share Awards shall vest with 1/3 at the end of each Term  provided that the participant is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics on the said date. In addition to the vesting conditions just stated  the Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price  in accordance with the vesting conditions below.3. The Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price over the period from the date the Share Awards are allocated (""Grant Date"") up to and including the day before the Vesting Date. The development of the share price will be measured based on the volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Grant Date and the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Vesting Date  respectively. In the event Calliditas Therapeutics' share price has increased by more than 60 percent  100 percent of the Share Awards shall vest  and should the share price have increased by 20 percent  33 percent of such Share Awards shall vest. In the event of an increase of the share price of between 20 and 60 percent  vesting of the Share Awards will occur linearly. Should the increase of the share price be less than 20 percent  vesting will not occur at all.4. The earliest point in time at which shares may be obtained from vested Share Awards shall be as soon as possible after the Vesting Date and once an assessment of the performance criteria has been made.5. Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Calliditas Therapeutics without any compensation being payable provided that the holder is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics at the relevant time of vesting with the exception of certain customary ""good leaver""-situations (death and permanent incapacity to complete the assignment due to illness or accident) and this shall also apply during the first year up until the day of the annual general meeting 2023.6. The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.7. The Share Awards cannot be transferred and may not be pledged.8. The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group.9. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Share Awards will vest in their entirety upon completion of such transaction.10. The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board LTIP 2022.AllocationThe number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal the below amount for the respective participant divided by the volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Share Awards under Board LTIP 2022 shall be awarded in accordance with the following:Share Awards calculated based on SEK 1 300 000 to the chairman of the Board of Directors; andShare Awards calculated based on SEK 500 000 to each of Diane Parks  Hilde Furberg  Molly Henderson  Henrik Stenqvist and Elisabeth Björk.In any event  Board LTIP 2022 will comprise a total number of Share Awards which  if all Share Awards are vested in accordance with the vesting conditions above  can entitle to not more than 50 000 shares in Calliditas Therapeutics.Preparation of the proposalBoard LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the nomination committee and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies.DilutionAssuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 100.00  Board LTIP 2022 will comprise not more than 38 000 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.07 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company  the maximum dilution amounts to 6.2 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company as well as the incentive program for the company's management and key personnel proposed to the annual general meeting 2022  the maximum dilution amounts to 9.4 percent on a fully diluted basis. The dilution is only expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found in Calliditas Therapeutics' annual report for 2021  note 10  which is available on the company's website  www.calliditas.se/en/.Scope and costs of the programBoard LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 100.0  the annual cost for the Board LTIP 2022  according to IFRS 2  is estimated at approximately SEK 0.5 million pre-tax. The estimated IFRS 2 cost has been calculated with a Monte Carlo simulation. The annual cost for social security contributions is estimated at SEK 0.7 million  based on an annual increase in the share price of 20 percent  the aforementioned assumptions and a social security tax rate of 31.42 percent. The total annual cost for Board LTIP 2022 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security charges  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 1.2 million.The total cost of the Board LTIP 2022  including all costs referred to above and social security charges  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 3.7 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants in accordance with item 17b below.17b –Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 50 000 warrants  whereby the company's share capital can increase by not more than SEK 2 000 in accordance with the following:1. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only vest with Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of Board LTIP 2022. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants of Board LTIP 2022  or a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of Share Awards.2. The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than 1 July 2022. The Board of Directors may extend the subscription period.3. The detailed terms of the warrants are set out in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders.4. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value.5. The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the new issue.6. Notification of subscription of shares by the exercise of Warrants can be made from and including the day of registration of the Warrants with the Swedish Companies' Office up until and including 31 December 2025.7. Shares which are issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of profits for the first time on the nearest record date occurring after the subscription has been exercised.17c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 17b above not be met  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that Board LTIP 2022 shall instead be hedged so that Calliditas Therapeutics can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Item 18 – Resolution  in order to adopt a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel  on:The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics proposes the introduction of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in accordance with the following.The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics (""ESOP 2022"") in accordance with items 18a – 18b below.The resolutions under items 18a – 18b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 18b below not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 18c below and resolutions under items 18a and 18c shall then be conditional upon each other.ESOP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  stock options to acquire shares in Calliditas Therapeutics (""Options"")  subject to vesting over a three-year period in accordance with the below. The Board of Directors proposes that a maximum of 2 000 000 Options are allocated to the participants.18a – Adoption of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnelThe rationale for the proposalESOP 2022 is intended for members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that an equity-based incentive program in the form of stock options is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate competent members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders.The proposed program is key for the company's ability to attract  retain and motivate competent key persons in the United States as well as in Europe in the company's operations and commercial functions scaling up the market launch of TARPEYO in the United States and the development of the company's pipeline assets. During the fourth quarter of 2021  the company received accelerated approval in the United States and currently the company are launching TARPEYO in the United States. When recruiting experienced commercial personnel in the United States and other key employees in the United States and Europe it will be important for Calliditas Therapeutics to be able to offer attractive compensation terms. A competitive equity-based incentive program will be a key component in order to be able to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced individuals as Calliditas Therapeutics launches TARPEYO in the United States.The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that ESOP 2022 will fortify the alignment of the interests of the participants and the interests of the shareholders. ESOP 2022 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that ESOP 2022 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Calliditas Therapeutics' operations  improve company loyalty and that ESOP 2022 will be beneficial to both the shareholders and Calliditas Therapeutics.Conditions for OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Options.The Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants.The Board of Directors shall resolve upon the allocation of Options between the date of the annual general meeting 2022 and the date of the annual general meeting 2023 (with each respective granting falling on a "" Grant Date "").Each Option entitles the holder to acquire one share in Calliditas Therapeutics for a pre-determined exercise price. The exercise price will correspond to 115 percent of the volume weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Options shall vest over a three-year period  with 20 percent on the first anniversary of the Grant Date  with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the second year after the Grant Date  and with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the third year after the Grant Date  and thereafter be exercisable  provided that the holder  with certain exceptions  still is employed by Calliditas Therapeutics (or  in the case of consultants  still provides services to Calliditas Therapeutics).Following the expiry of the vesting period  the Options may be exercised during a one-year period.The number of Options shall be subject to customary re-calculation  for example in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The Options may be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group.In the event of a public take-over offer  significant asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Options will vest in their entirety following the completion of a change of control.AllocationThe right to receive Options shall accrue to up to 100 employees or consultants of the company. The Board of Directors may grant Options  on one or several occasions  between the date of the annual general meeting 2022 and the date of the annual general meeting 2023. The maximum number of Options that may be allocated to the participants under ESOP 2022 is 2 000 000.The maximum allocation per individual in each category shall be 300 000 Options for Category 1 (CEO)  250 000 Options for Category 2 (Management) and 100 000 Options for Category 3 (Other key personnel and consultants).Preparation  administration and the right to amend the terms of the OptionsThe Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of ESOP 2022  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions  including resolving on cash or other settlement if deemed favorable for Calliditas Therapeutics based on foreign tax regulations. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in Calliditas Therapeutics or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of ESOP 2022 no longer serve their purpose.Preparation of the proposalESOP 2022 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies. ESOP 2022 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors.DilutionSubject to certain recalculation conditions  the maximum number of shares that may be issued under ESOP 2022 is 2 000 000 which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3.6 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to already allocated warrants under the company's outstanding incentive programs  the maximum dilution amounts to approximately 9.4 percent on a fully diluted basis.The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found on Calliditas Therapeutics' website  www.calliditas.se/en/  under ""Remuneration"" as well as in the company's annual report.Scope and costs of the programESOP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Options of SEK 100.0  an annual increase in the share price of 15 percent and that all Options are allocated up-front under the assumptions set out under ""Dilution"" above  the average annual cost for Calliditas Therapeutics according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 16.2 million per year before tax. The average annual social security costs over the vesting period are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 10.9 million  based on the above assumptions  that all Options are fully vested  a vesting period for all Options of three years and social security costs of 31.42 percent. It is envisaged that the social security costs associated with ESOP 2022 will be covered by the cash received from the participants at exercise of Options. If necessary  social security costs will be covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants (see item 18b below) which would be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the Options. In either case  the social security costs associated with ESOP 2022 will be fully covered and will hence not affect the company's cash flow.The total cost of ESOP 2022  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 81.3 million under the above assumptions.The costs associated with ESOP 2022 are expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Expenses relating to R&D/operating expenses"".Delivery of shares under ESOP 2022In order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2022 and if necessary for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue and use warrants in accordance with item 18b below.18b –Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2022  and for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 2 000 000 warrants  whereby the company's share capital could be increased by not more than SEK 80 000.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only be granted Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of ESOP 2022. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants or a financial intermediary in connection with exercise.The warrants shall be issued free of charge. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value.The full terms and conditions for the warrants are presented in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders in accordance with the below.18c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 18b above not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that ESOP 2022 instead shall be hedged through an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Majority rulesThe implementation of the Board of Directors' proposals under item 15 and items 16a – 16d are subject to the approval at the annual general meeting with at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the meeting. Resolution in accordance with item 17b and 18b above requires approval of at least nine tenths (9/10) of the shares represented and votes cast at the annual general meeting.Other informationThe annual report and the auditor's report for the financial year 2021  proxy form and advance voting form  the remuneration report and other supporting documents for the general meeting  including complete proposals and statements from the Board of Directors  as well as the statement from the auditor pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 54 of the Companies Act will be available to the shareholders at the company's office on Kungsbron 1 D5  SE-111 22 Stockholm  Sweden  and on the company's webpage  www.calliditas.se/en/  no later than 28 April 2022.

Such share issue resolution may be carried out with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions.

Calliditas' board of directors has been evaluating the opportunity of launching a so called At-The-Market program (""ATM Program"") in the US market. ATM Programs are common among many US listed companies  including Life Science companies. Approximately 70 percent of eligible Life Science Companies in the United States have ATM Programs in place. The board of directors of Calliditas is thus proposing to the shareholders to adopt resolutions to allow for an ATM Program as set out below in this agenda item 16  subject to AGM approval and further resolutions by the board before implementation of the program  however  no assurances can be given that a program will be utilized and the future use of an ATM Program will be evaluated by the Board of Directors taking other potential sources of financing  capital need and shareholder dilution into consideration.An ATM Program is an efficient and cost-effective method to raise equity in the US market  from time to time  and with significantly lower transactional costs compared to traditional capital raising alternatives. Sales are effected in ""at the market"" transactions of ADSs on The Nasdaq Global Select Market and/or negotiated transactions in the US subject to applicable US regulations and documentation. Having an ATM Program in place is expected to enable Calliditas to efficiently source capital in the US market  subject to demand and board approval. An ATM Program may also be used to settle reverse enquiries from institutional buyers. An ATM Program  if used  may also increase the liquidity of Calliditas' ADSs in the United States.16a - Amend the articles of associationThe Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend the articles of association as follows.A new section  § 5  together with an updated wording of § 4  is proposed in the articles of association. The new § 5  together with the amended § 4  allows for C-shares to be issued  conversion of C-shares into ordinary shares  redemption and regulates preferential rights.Following the insertion of a new section  a renumbering of sections is proposed  whereby the previous § 5 becomes § 6 and so on.Current wording Poposed wording 4 § Share capital and number of shares The share capital shall be not less than SEK 710 000 and not more than SEK 2 840 000.

Shares that are not subscribed for pursuant to primary pre-emption rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (subsidiary pre-emption rights).

The resolutions under items 17a – 17b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 17b below not be met  the nomination committee proposes that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 17c below and resolutions under items 17a and 17c shall then be conditional upon each other.Board LTIP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  share awards subject to performance vesting (""Share Awards"") that entitle to shares in Calliditas Therapeutics to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 50 000 shares. As part of the implementation of Board LTIP 2022  not more than 50 000 warrants can be issued in accordance with item 17b below.17a - Adoption of a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of DirectorsThe rationale for the proposalBoard LTIP 2022 is intended for main owner independent members of the Board of Directors in Calliditas Therapeutics.

The Share Awards shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as practicable after the annual general meeting.2.

The Share Awards shall vest with 1/3 at the end of each Term  provided that the participant is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics on the said date. In addition to the vesting conditions just stated  the Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price  in accordance with the vesting conditions below.3. The Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price over the period from the date the Share Awards are allocated (""Grant Date"") up to and including the day before the Vesting Date. The development of the share price will be measured based on the volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Grant Date and the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Vesting Date  respectively. In the event Calliditas Therapeutics' share price has increased by more than 60 percent  100 percent of the Share Awards shall vest  and should the share price have increased by 20 percent  33 percent of such Share Awards shall vest. In the event of an increase of the share price of between 20 and 60 percent  vesting of the Share Awards will occur linearly. Should the increase of the share price be less than 20 percent  vesting will not occur at all.4. The earliest point in time at which shares may be obtained from vested Share Awards shall be as soon as possible after the Vesting Date and once an assessment of the performance criteria has been made.5. Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Calliditas Therapeutics without any compensation being payable provided that the holder is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics at the relevant time of vesting with the exception of certain customary ""good leaver""-situations (death and permanent incapacity to complete the assignment due to illness or accident) and this shall also apply during the first year up until the day of the annual general meeting 2023.6. The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.7. The Share Awards cannot be transferred and may not be pledged.8. The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group.9. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Share Awards will vest in their entirety upon completion of such transaction.10. The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board LTIP 2022.AllocationThe number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal the below amount for the respective participant divided by the volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Share Awards under Board LTIP 2022 shall be awarded in accordance with the following:Share Awards calculated based on SEK 1 300 000 to the chairman of the Board of Directors; andto the chairman of the Board of Directors; and Share Awards calculated based on SEK 500 000 to each of Diane Parks   Hilde Furberg   Molly Henderson   Henrik Stenqvist and Elisabeth Björk .In any event  Board LTIP 2022 will comprise a total number of Share Awards which  if all Share Awards are vested in accordance with the vesting conditions above  can entitle to not more than 50 000 shares in Calliditas Therapeutics.Preparation of the proposalBoard LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the nomination committee and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies.DilutionAssuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 100.00  Board LTIP 2022 will comprise not more than 38 000 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.07 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company  the maximum dilution amounts to 6.2 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company as well as the incentive program for the company's management and key personnel proposed to the annual general meeting 2022  the maximum dilution amounts to 9.4 percent on a fully diluted basis. The dilution is only expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found in Calliditas Therapeutics' annual report for 2021  note 10  which is available on the company's website  www.calliditas.se/en/.Scope and costs of the programBoard LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 100.0  the annual cost for the Board LTIP 2022  according to IFRS 2  is estimated at approximately SEK 0.5 million pre-tax. The estimated IFRS 2 cost has been calculated with a Monte Carlo simulation. The annual cost for social security contributions is estimated at SEK 0.7 million  based on an annual increase in the share price of 20 percent  the aforementioned assumptions and a social security tax rate of 31.42 percent. The total annual cost for Board LTIP 2022 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security charges  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 1.2 million.The total cost of the Board LTIP 2022  including all costs referred to above and social security charges  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 3.7 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants in accordance with item 17b below.17b –Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 50 000 warrants  whereby the company's share capital can increase by not more than SEK 2 000 in accordance with the following:1. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only vest with Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of Board LTIP 2022. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants of Board LTIP 2022  or a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of Share Awards.2. The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than 1 July 2022. The Board of Directors may extend the subscription period.3. The detailed terms of the warrants are set out in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders.4. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value.5. The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the new issue.6. Notification of subscription of shares by the exercise of Warrants can be made from and including the day of registration of the Warrants with the Swedish Companies' Office up until and including 31 December 2025.7. Shares which are issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of profits for the first time on the nearest record date occurring after the subscription has been exercised.17c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 17b above not be met  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that Board LTIP 2022 shall instead be hedged so that Calliditas Therapeutics can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Item 18 – Resolution  in order to adopt a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel  on:The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics proposes the introduction of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in accordance with the following.The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics (""ESOP 2022"") in accordance with items 18a – 18b below.The resolutions under items 18a – 18b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 18b below not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 18c below and resolutions under items 18a and 18c shall then be conditional upon each other.ESOP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  stock options to acquire shares in Calliditas Therapeutics (""Options"")  subject to vesting over a three-year period in accordance with the below. The Board of Directors proposes that a maximum of 2 000 000 Options are allocated to the participants.18a – Adoption of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnelThe rationale for the proposalESOP 2022 is intended for members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that an equity-based incentive program in the form of stock options is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate competent members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders.The proposed program is key for the company's ability to attract  retain and motivate competent key persons in the United States as well as in Europe in the company's operations and commercial functions scaling up the market launch of TARPEYO in the United States and the development of the company's pipeline assets. During the fourth quarter of 2021  the company received accelerated approval in the United States and currently the company are launching TARPEYO in the United States. When recruiting experienced commercial personnel in the United States and other key employees in the United States and Europe it will be important for Calliditas Therapeutics to be able to offer attractive compensation terms. A competitive equity-based incentive program will be a key component in order to be able to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced individuals as Calliditas Therapeutics launches TARPEYO in the United States.The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that ESOP 2022 will fortify the alignment of the interests of the participants and the interests of the shareholders. ESOP 2022 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that ESOP 2022 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Calliditas Therapeutics' operations  improve company loyalty and that ESOP 2022 will be beneficial to both the shareholders and Calliditas Therapeutics.Conditions for OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Options.The Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants.The Board of Directors shall resolve upon the allocation of Options between the date of the annual general meeting 2022 and the date of the annual general meeting 2023 (with each respective granting falling on a "" Grant Date "").""). Each Option entitles the holder to acquire one share in Calliditas Therapeutics for a pre-determined exercise price. The exercise price will correspond to 115 percent of the volume weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Options shall vest over a three-year period  with 20 percent on the first anniversary of the Grant Date  with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the second year after the Grant Date  and with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the third year after the Grant Date  and thereafter be exercisable  provided that the holder  with certain exceptions  still is employed by Calliditas Therapeutics (or  in the case of consultants  still provides services to Calliditas Therapeutics).Following the expiry of the vesting period  the Options may be exercised during a one-year period.The number of Options shall be subject to customary re-calculation  for example in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The Options may be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group.In the event of a public take-over offer  significant asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Options will vest in their entirety following the completion of a change of control.AllocationThe right to receive Options shall accrue to up to 100 employees or consultants of the company. The Board of Directors may grant Options  on one or several occasions  between the date of the annual general meeting 2022 and the date of the annual general meeting 2023. The maximum number of Options that may be allocated to the participants under ESOP 2022 is 2 000 000.The maximum allocation per individual in each category shall be 300 000 Options for Category 1 (CEO)  250 000 Options for Category 2 (Management) and 100 000 Options for Category 3 (Other key personnel and consultants).Preparation  administration and the right to amend the terms of the OptionsThe Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of ESOP 2022  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions  including resolving on cash or other settlement if deemed favorable for Calliditas Therapeutics based on foreign tax regulations. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in Calliditas Therapeutics or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of ESOP 2022 no longer serve their purpose.Preparation of the proposalESOP 2022 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies. ESOP 2022 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors.DilutionSubject to certain recalculation conditions  the maximum number of shares that may be issued under ESOP 2022 is 2 000 000 which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3.6 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to already allocated warrants under the company's outstanding incentive programs  the maximum dilution amounts to approximately 9.4 percent on a fully diluted basis.The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found on Calliditas Therapeutics' website  www.calliditas.se/en/  under ""Remuneration"" as well as in the company's annual report.Scope and costs of the programESOP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"".

Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Options of SEK 100.0  an annual increase in the share price of 15 percent and that all Options are allocated up-front under the assumptions set out under ""Dilution"" above  the average annual cost for Calliditas Therapeutics according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 16.2 million per year before tax. The average annual social security costs over the vesting period are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 10.9 million  based on the above assumptions  that all Options are fully vested  a vesting period for all Options of three years and social security costs of 31.42 percent. It is envisaged that the social security costs associated with ESOP 2022 will be covered by the cash received from the participants at exercise of Options. If necessary  social security costs will be covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants (see item 18b below) which would be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the Options. In either case  the social security costs associated with ESOP 2022 will be fully covered and will hence not affect the company's cash flow.The total cost of ESOP 2022  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 81.3 million under the above assumptions.The costs associated with ESOP 2022 are expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Expenses relating to R&D/operating expenses"".Delivery of shares under ESOP 2022In order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2022 and if necessary for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue and use warrants in accordance with item 18b below.18b –Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2022  and for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 2 000 000 warrants  whereby the company's share capital could be increased by not more than SEK 80 000.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only be granted Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics.

Should any of the three largest shareholders renounce its right to appoint one representative to the nomination committee  such right shall transfer to the shareholder who then in turn  after these three  is the largest shareholder in the company. The Board of Directors shall convene the nomination committee. The member representing the largest shareholder shall be appointed chairman of the nomination committee  unless the nomination committee unanimously appoints someone else.Should a shareholder having appointed a representative to the nomination committee no longer be among the three largest shareholders at a point in time falling three months before the annual general meeting at the latest  the representative appointed by such shareholder shall resign and the shareholder who is then among the three largest shareholders shall have the right to appoint one representative to the nomination committee. Unless there are specific reasons otherwise  the already established composition of the nomination committee shall  however  remain unchanged in case such change in the ownership is only marginal or occurs during the three month period prior to the annual general meeting. Where a shareholder has become one of the three largest shareholders due to a material change in the ownership at a point in time falling later than three months before the annual general meeting  such shareholder shall however in any event have the right to take part of the work of the nomination committee and participate in its meetings. Should a member resign from the nomination committee before his or her work is completed  the shareholder who has appointed such member shall appoint a new member  unless that shareholder is no longer one of the three largest shareholders  in which case the largest shareholder in turn shall appoint the substitute member. A shareholder who has appointed a representative to the nomination committee shall have the right to discharge such representative and appoint a new representative.Changes to the composition of the nomination committee shall be announced immediately. The term of office for the nomination committee ends when the next nomination committee has been appointed.

Such share issue resolution may be carried out with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions. The authorization may only be utilized to such extent that the number of shares issued under the authorization  or the number of shares created in connection with exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles  corresponds to a dilution of not more than 15 percent of the total number of shares outstanding at the time of the general meeting's resolution on adoption of the proposed authorization  reduced with the number of shares transferred to ensure delivery of shares under the company's ATM Program in accordance with item 16d below.The purpose of the authorization is to increase the financial flexibility of the company and the general flexibility of the Board of Directors. Should the Board of Directors resolve on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason for this shall be to finance an acquisition of operations  to procure capital to finance the development of projects or to commercialize the company' s products. Upon such deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the new issue shall be made at market terms and conditions.The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration.Item 16 – Resolution  in order to facilitate implementation of and delivery of shares under a contemplated ""At-the-market"" program (the ""ATM Program"")  to:Since 2020  Calliditas has had its shares  in the form of American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"")  listed in the United States on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Calliditas' board of directors has been evaluating the opportunity of launching a so called At-The-Market program (""ATM Program"") in the US market. ATM Programs are common among many US listed companies  including Life Science companies. Approximately 70 percent of eligible Life Science Companies in the United States have ATM Programs in place. The board of directors of Calliditas is thus proposing to the shareholders to adopt resolutions to allow for an ATM Program as set out below in this agenda item 16  subject to AGM approval and further resolutions by the board before implementation of the program  however  no assurances can be given that a program will be utilized and the future use of an ATM Program will be evaluated by the Board of Directors taking other potential sources of financing  capital need and shareholder dilution into consideration.An ATM Program is an efficient and cost-effective method to raise equity in the US market  from time to time  and with significantly lower transactional costs compared to traditional capital raising alternatives. Sales are effected in ""at the market"" transactions of ADSs on The Nasdaq Global Select Market and/or negotiated transactions in the US subject to applicable US regulations and documentation. Having an ATM Program in place is expected to enable Calliditas to efficiently source capital in the US market  subject to demand and board approval. An ATM Program may also be used to settle reverse enquiries from institutional buyers. An ATM Program  if used  may also increase the liquidity of Calliditas' ADSs in the United States.16a - Amend the articles of associationThe Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend the articles of association as follows.A new section  § 5  together with an updated wording of § 4  is proposed in the articles of association. The new § 5  together with the amended § 4  allows for C-shares to be issued  conversion of C-shares into ordinary shares  redemption and regulates preferential rights.Following the insertion of a new section  a renumbering of sections is proposed  whereby the previous § 5 becomes § 6 and so on.Current wording Poposed wording 4 § Share capital and number of shares The share capital shall be not less than SEK 710 000 and not more than SEK 2 840 000. The number of shares shall be not less than 17 750 000 and not more than 71 000 000. 4 § Share capital and number of sharesThe share capital shall be not less than SEK 710 000 and not more than SEK 2 840 000.

Ordinary shares shall entitle the holder to one (1) vote per share  whereas C-shares shall entitle the holder to one tenth (1/10) vote per share. Shares of each class may be issued in a quantity corresponding to the entire share capital of the company. Holders of C-shares are not entitled to dividends. Upon the company's liquidation  C-shares carry equivalent right to the company's assets as other shares  however not to an amount exceeding the quota value of the share.Where the company resolves to issue new shares by way of a cash issue or a set-off issue  one old share shall entitle the holder to pre-emption rights to one new share of the same class pro rata to the number of shares previously owned by the holder (primary pre-emption rights). Shares that are not subscribed for pursuant to primary pre-emption rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (subsidiary pre-emption rights). Unless shares offered in such manner are sufficient for the subscription which takes place pursuant to subsidiary pre-emption rights  the shares shall be allotted among the subscribers pro rata to the total number of shares previously owned. Where this is not possible with respect to a particular share(s)  shares shall be allotted through drawing of lots.The provisions above shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility for the company to adopt a resolution regarding a cash issue or set-off issue without regard to shareholders' pre-emption rights.The provisions above regarding shareholders' pre-emption rights shall apply mutatis mutandis to an issue of warrants or an issue of convertible instruments.Where the company resolves to issue only one class of shares by way of a cash issue or set-off issue  all of the shareholders  irrespective of the class of share  shall hold pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares pro rata to the number of shares previously owned.In the event of a bonus issue  new shares of each class shall be issued pro rata to the number of shares of the same class previously issued. In connection therewith  the owners of existing shares of a certain class shall entitle the holder to new shares of the same class. This shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility of issuing new shares of a new class by means of a bonus issue  following the required amendment to the articles of association.Reduction of share capital  which in any case shall not fall below the minimum share capital  may  upon the request of an owner of C-shares and a resolution by the company's Board of Directors or the general meeting  take place through redemption of C-shares. A request from a shareholder shall be made in writing. When a resolution on reduction has been passed  an amount corresponding to the reduction amount shall be transferred to the company's reserve fund  if required funds are available. The redemption amount per C- share shall correspond to the quota value of such share.Following notice of the redemption resolution  holders of shares shall promptly receive payment for the shares  or  if authorization from the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) or a court is required  following notice that the final decision has been registered. 5 § (New section inserted) 5 § Conversion clauseC-shares held by the company may  upon decision of the board of directors be reclassified into ordinary shares.

With deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights  the participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new C-shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares.The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights in connection with the issue of shares is to ensure delivery of shares to be sold under the company's ATM Program.16c - Authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on purchase of C-sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Board is authorized  during the period until the annual general meeting 2023  on one or more occasions  to decide on purchases of up to 5 908 019 C-shares in accordance with purchase offerings directed to all shareholders of C-shares which shall comprise all outstanding C-shares. Repurchases shall be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the acquired C-shares shall be made in cash. The company may purchase maximum so many shares that the company's holding of own shares after the purchase amounts to a maximum of one-tenth of all the shares in the company.The purpose of the authorization is to ensure delivery of shares to be sold under the company's ATM Program.16d - Authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on transfer of own ordinary sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Board of Directors is authorized  during the period until the next annual general meeting  on one or more occasions  to transfer up to 5 908 019 ordinary shares (following the re-classification from C-shares)  to be effected outside Nasdaq Stockholm against payment in cash. Such transfers may be effected at a price in cash which corresponds to the market price at the time of the transfer of the Calliditas Therapeutics shares transferred with such deviation as the Board of Directors finds appropriate. The authorization under this item may only be utilized to the extent that the shares transferred by virtue of this authorization  together with any shares issued by virtue of the authorization under item 15 above  do not exceed 20 percent of the total number of shares outstanding at the time of the general meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization.The purpose of the authorization is to ensure delivery of shares to be sold under the company's ATM Program.Item 17 – Resolution  in order to adopt a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of Directors  on:The nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics AB (""Board LTIP 2022"") in accordance with items 17a – 17b below. The resolutions under items 17a – 17b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 17b below not be met  the nomination committee proposes that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 17c below and resolutions under items 17a and 17c shall then be conditional upon each other.Board LTIP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  share awards subject to performance vesting (""Share Awards"") that entitle to shares in Calliditas Therapeutics to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 50 000 shares. As part of the implementation of Board LTIP 2022  not more than 50 000 warrants can be issued in accordance with item 17b below.17a - Adoption of a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of DirectorsThe rationale for the proposalBoard LTIP 2022 is intended for main owner independent members of the Board of Directors in Calliditas Therapeutics. The nomination committee believes that an equity-based incentive program is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members of the Board of Directors  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. Board LTIP 2022 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics. The nomination committee is of the opinion that Board LTIP 2022 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Calliditas Therapeutics' operations  improve company loyalty and be beneficial to both the shareholders and Calliditas Therapeutics.Conditions for Share AwardsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards.1. The Share Awards shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as practicable after the annual general meeting.2. The Share Awards shall vest gradually over approximately three years  corresponding to three terms up to the date of  whichever is earliest  (i) the annual general meeting 2025 or (ii) 1 July 2025 (the ""Vesting Date"")  where each term equals the period from one annual general meeting up until the day falling immediately prior to the next annual general meeting or the Vesting Date  as applicable (each such period a ""Term""). The Share Awards shall vest with 1/3 at the end of each Term  provided that the participant is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics on the said date. In addition to the vesting conditions just stated  the Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price  in accordance with the vesting conditions below.3. The Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price over the period from the date the Share Awards are allocated (""Grant Date"") up to and including the day before the Vesting Date. The development of the share price will be measured based on the volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Grant Date and the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Vesting Date  respectively. In the event Calliditas Therapeutics' share price has increased by more than 60 percent  100 percent of the Share Awards shall vest  and should the share price have increased by 20 percent  33 percent of such Share Awards shall vest. In the event of an increase of the share price of between 20 and 60 percent  vesting of the Share Awards will occur linearly. Should the increase of the share price be less than 20 percent  vesting will not occur at all.4. The earliest point in time at which shares may be obtained from vested Share Awards shall be as soon as possible after the Vesting Date and once an assessment of the performance criteria has been made.5. Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Calliditas Therapeutics without any compensation being payable provided that the holder is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics at the relevant time of vesting with the exception of certain customary ""good leaver""-situations (death and permanent incapacity to complete the assignment due to illness or accident) and this shall also apply during the first year up until the day of the annual general meeting 2023.6. The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.7. The Share Awards cannot be transferred and may not be pledged.8. The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group.9. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Share Awards will vest in their entirety upon completion of such transaction.10. The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board LTIP 2022.AllocationThe number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal the below amount for the respective participant divided by the volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Share Awards under Board LTIP 2022 shall be awarded in accordance with the following:Share Awards calculated based on SEK 1 300 000 to the chairman of the Board of Directors; andShare Awards calculated based on SEK 500 000 to each of Diane Parks   Hilde Furberg   Molly Henderson   Henrik Stenqvist and Elisabeth Björk .In any event  Board LTIP 2022 will comprise a total number of Share Awards which  if all Share Awards are vested in accordance with the vesting conditions above  can entitle to not more than 50 000 shares in Calliditas Therapeutics.Preparation of the proposalBoard LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the nomination committee and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies.DilutionAssuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 100.00  Board LTIP 2022 will comprise not more than 38 000 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.07 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company  the maximum dilution amounts to 6.2 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company as well as the incentive program for the company's management and key personnel proposed to the annual general meeting 2022  the maximum dilution amounts to 9.4 percent on a fully diluted basis. The dilution is only expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found in Calliditas Therapeutics' annual report for 2021  note 10  which is available on the company's website  www.calliditas.se/en/.Scope and costs of the programBoard LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 100.0  the annual cost for the Board LTIP 2022  according to IFRS 2  is estimated at approximately SEK 0.5 million pre-tax. The estimated IFRS 2 cost has been calculated with a Monte Carlo simulation. The annual cost for social security contributions is estimated at SEK 0.7 million  based on an annual increase in the share price of 20 percent  the aforementioned assumptions and a social security tax rate of 31.42 percent. The total annual cost for Board LTIP 2022 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security charges  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 1.2 million.The total cost of the Board LTIP 2022  including all costs referred to above and social security charges  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 3.7 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants in accordance with item 17b below.17b –Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 50 000 warrants  whereby the company's share capital can increase by not more than SEK 2 000 in accordance with the following:1. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only vest with Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of Board LTIP 2022. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants of Board LTIP 2022  or a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of Share Awards.2. The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than 1 July 2022. The Board of Directors may extend the subscription period.3. The detailed terms of the warrants are set out in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders.4. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value.5.

Should the majority requirement for item 18b below not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 18c below and resolutions under items 18a and 18c shall then be conditional upon each other.ESOP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  stock options to acquire shares in Calliditas Therapeutics (""Options"")  subject to vesting over a three-year period in accordance with the below. The Board of Directors proposes that a maximum of 2 000 000 Options are allocated to the participants.18a – Adoption of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnelThe rationale for the proposalESOP 2022 is intended for members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that an equity-based incentive program in the form of stock options is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate competent members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders.The proposed program is key for the company's ability to attract  retain and motivate competent key persons in the United States as well as in Europe in the company's operations and commercial functions scaling up the market launch of TARPEYO in the United States and the development of the company's pipeline assets. During the fourth quarter of 2021  the company received accelerated approval in the United States and currently the company are launching TARPEYO in the United States. When recruiting experienced commercial personnel in the United States and other key employees in the United States and Europe it will be important for Calliditas Therapeutics to be able to offer attractive compensation terms. A competitive equity-based incentive program will be a key component in order to be able to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced individuals as Calliditas Therapeutics launches TARPEYO in the United States.The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that ESOP 2022 will fortify the alignment of the interests of the participants and the interests of the shareholders. ESOP 2022 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that ESOP 2022 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Calliditas Therapeutics' operations  improve company loyalty and that ESOP 2022 will be beneficial to both the shareholders and Calliditas Therapeutics.Conditions for OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Options.The Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants.The Board of Directors shall resolve upon the allocation of Options between the date of the annual general meeting 2022 and the date of the annual general meeting 2023 (with each respective granting falling on a "" Grant Date "").Each Option entitles the holder to acquire one share in Calliditas Therapeutics for a pre-determined exercise price. The exercise price will correspond to 115 percent of the volume weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Options shall vest over a three-year period  with 20 percent on the first anniversary of the Grant Date  with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the second year after the Grant Date  and with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the third year after the Grant Date  and thereafter be exercisable  provided that the holder  with certain exceptions  still is employed by Calliditas Therapeutics (or  in the case of consultants  still provides services to Calliditas Therapeutics).Following the expiry of the vesting period  the Options may be exercised during a one-year period.The number of Options shall be subject to customary re-calculation  for example in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The Options may be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group.In the event of a public take-over offer  significant asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Options will vest in their entirety following the completion of a change of control.AllocationThe right to receive Options shall accrue to up to 100 employees or consultants of the company. The Board of Directors may grant Options  on one or several occasions  between the date of the annual general meeting 2022 and the date of the annual general meeting 2023. The maximum number of Options that may be allocated to the participants under ESOP 2022 is 2 000 000.The maximum allocation per individual in each category shall be 300 000 Options for Category 1 (CEO)  250 000 Options for Category 2 (Management) and 100 000 Options for Category 3 (Other key personnel and consultants).Preparation  administration and the right to amend the terms of the OptionsThe Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of ESOP 2022  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions  including resolving on cash or other settlement if deemed favorable for Calliditas Therapeutics based on foreign tax regulations. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in Calliditas Therapeutics or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of ESOP 2022 no longer serve their purpose.Preparation of the proposalESOP 2022 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies. ESOP 2022 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors.DilutionSubject to certain recalculation conditions  the maximum number of shares that may be issued under ESOP 2022 is 2 000 000 which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3.6 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to already allocated warrants under the company's outstanding incentive programs  the maximum dilution amounts to approximately 9.4 percent on a fully diluted basis.The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found on Calliditas Therapeutics' website  www.calliditas.se/en/  under ""Remuneration"" as well as in the company's annual report.Scope and costs of the programESOP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Options of SEK 100.0  an annual increase in the share price of 15 percent and that all Options are allocated up-front under the assumptions set out under ""Dilution"" above  the average annual cost for Calliditas Therapeutics according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 16.2 million per year before tax. The average annual social security costs over the vesting period are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 10.9 million  based on the above assumptions  that all Options are fully vested  a vesting period for all Options of three years and social security costs of 31.42 percent. It is envisaged that the social security costs associated with ESOP 2022 will be covered by the cash received from the participants at exercise of Options. If necessary  social security costs will be covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants (see item 18b below) which would be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the Options. In either case  the social security costs associated with ESOP 2022 will be fully covered and will hence not affect the company's cash flow.The total cost of ESOP 2022  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 81.3 million under the above assumptions.The costs associated with ESOP 2022 are expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Expenses relating to R&D/operating expenses"".Delivery of shares under ESOP 2022In order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2022 and if necessary for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue and use warrants in accordance with item 18b below.18b –Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2022  and for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 2 000 000 warrants  whereby the company's share capital could be increased by not more than SEK 80 000.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only be granted Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of ESOP 2022. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants or a financial intermediary in connection with exercise.The warrants shall be issued free of charge. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value.The full terms and conditions for the warrants are presented in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders in accordance with the below.18c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 18b above not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that ESOP 2022 instead shall be hedged through an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Majority rulesThe implementation of the Board of Directors' proposals under item 15 and items 16a – 16d are subject to the approval at the annual general meeting with at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the meeting. Resolution in accordance with item 17b and 18b above requires approval of at least nine tenths (9/10) of the shares represented and votes cast at the annual general meeting.Other informationThe annual report and the auditor's report for the financial year 2021  proxy form and advance voting form  the remuneration report and other supporting documents for the general meeting  including complete proposals and statements from the Board of Directors  as well as the statement from the auditor pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 54 of the Companies Act will be available to the shareholders at the company's office on Kungsbron 1 D5  SE-111 22 Stockholm  Sweden  and on the company's webpage  www.calliditas.se/en/  no later than 28 April 2022.

Calliditas' board of directors has been evaluating the opportunity of launching a so called At-The-Market program (""ATM Program"") in the US market. ATM Programs are common among many US listed companies  including Life Science companies. Approximately 70 percent of eligible Life Science Companies in the United States have ATM Programs in place. The board of directors of Calliditas is thus proposing to the shareholders to adopt resolutions to allow for an ATM Program as set out below in this agenda item 16  subject to AGM approval and further resolutions by the board before implementation of the program  however  no assurances can be given that a program will be utilized and the future use of an ATM Program will be evaluated by the Board of Directors taking other potential sources of financing  capital need and shareholder dilution into consideration.An ATM Program is an efficient and cost-effective method to raise equity in the US market  from time to time  and with significantly lower transactional costs compared to traditional capital raising alternatives. Sales are effected in ""at the market"" transactions of ADSs on The Nasdaq Global Select Market and/or negotiated transactions in the US subject to applicable US regulations and documentation. Having an ATM Program in place is expected to enable Calliditas to efficiently source capital in the US market  subject to demand and board approval.

The Share Awards shall vest with 1/3 at the end of each Term  provided that the participant is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics on the said date. In addition to the vesting conditions just stated  the Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price  in accordance with the vesting conditions below.3. The Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price over the period from the date the Share Awards are allocated (""Grant Date"") up to and including the day before the Vesting Date.

In the event Calliditas Therapeutics' share price has increased by more than 60 percent  100 percent of the Share Awards shall vest  and should the share price have increased by 20 percent  33 percent of such Share Awards shall vest. In the event of an increase of the share price of between 20 and 60 percent  vesting of the Share Awards will occur linearly.

The earliest point in time at which shares may be obtained from vested Share Awards shall be as soon as possible after the Vesting Date and once an assessment of the performance criteria has been made.5. Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Calliditas Therapeutics without any compensation being payable provided that the holder is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics at the relevant time of vesting with the exception of certain customary ""good leaver""-situations (death and permanent incapacity to complete the assignment due to illness or accident) and this shall also apply during the first year up until the day of the annual general meeting 2023.6.

The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board LTIP 2022.AllocationThe number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal the below amount for the respective participant divided by the volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Share Awards under Board LTIP 2022 shall be awarded in accordance with the following:Share Awards calculated based on SEK 1 300 000 to the chairman of the Board of Directors; andto the chairman of the Board of Directors; and Share Awards calculated based on SEK 500 000 to each of Diane Parks   Hilde Furberg   Molly Henderson   Henrik Stenqvist and Elisabeth Björk.In any event  Board LTIP 2022 will comprise a total number of Share Awards which  if all Share Awards are vested in accordance with the vesting conditions above  can entitle to not more than 50 000 shares in Calliditas Therapeutics.Preparation of the proposalBoard LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the nomination committee and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies.DilutionAssuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 100.00  Board LTIP 2022 will comprise not more than 38 000 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.07 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company  the maximum dilution amounts to 6.2 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company as well as the incentive program for the company's management and key personnel proposed to the annual general meeting 2022  the maximum dilution amounts to 9.4 percent on a fully diluted basis. The dilution is only expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found in Calliditas Therapeutics' annual report for 2021  note 10  which is available on the company's website  www.calliditas.se/en/.Scope and costs of the programBoard LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 100.0  the annual cost for the Board LTIP 2022  according to IFRS 2  is estimated at approximately SEK 0.5 million pre-tax. The estimated IFRS 2 cost has been calculated with a Monte Carlo simulation. The annual cost for social security contributions is estimated at SEK 0.7 million  based on an annual increase in the share price of 20 percent  the aforementioned assumptions and a social security tax rate of 31.42 percent. The total annual cost for Board LTIP 2022 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security charges  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 1.2 million.The total cost of the Board LTIP 2022  including all costs referred to above and social security charges  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 3.7 million under the above assumptions.Delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants in accordance with item 17b below.17b –Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 50 000 warrants  whereby the company's share capital can increase by not more than SEK 2 000 in accordance with the following:1. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only vest with Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics.

The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than 1 July 2022. The Board of Directors may extend the subscription period.3. The detailed terms of the warrants are set out in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders.4.

Shares which are issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of profits for the first time on the nearest record date occurring after the subscription has been exercised.17c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 17b above not be met  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that Board LTIP 2022 shall instead be hedged so that Calliditas Therapeutics can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Item 18 – Resolution  in order to adopt a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel  on:The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics proposes the introduction of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in accordance with the following.The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics (""ESOP 2022"") in accordance with items 18a – 18b below.The resolutions under items 18a – 18b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other.

During the fourth quarter of 2021  the company received accelerated approval in the United States and currently the company are launching TARPEYO in the United States. When recruiting experienced commercial personnel in the United States and other key employees in the United States and Europe it will be important for Calliditas Therapeutics to be able to offer attractive compensation terms.

Each Option entitles the holder to acquire one share in Calliditas Therapeutics for a pre-determined exercise price. The exercise price will correspond to 115 percent of the volume weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days preceding the Grant Date.The Options shall vest over a three-year period  with 20 percent on the first anniversary of the Grant Date  with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the second year after the Grant Date  and with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the third year after the Grant Date  and thereafter be exercisable  provided that the holder  with certain exceptions  still is employed by Calliditas Therapeutics (or  in the case of consultants  still provides services to Calliditas Therapeutics).Following the expiry of the vesting period  the Options may be exercised during a one-year period.The number of Options shall be subject to customary re-calculation  for example in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The Options may be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group.In the event of a public take-over offer  significant asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Options will vest in their entirety following the completion of a change of control.AllocationThe right to receive Options shall accrue to up to 100 employees or consultants of the company.

To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions  including resolving on cash or other settlement if deemed favorable for Calliditas Therapeutics based on foreign tax regulations. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in Calliditas Therapeutics or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of ESOP 2022 no longer serve their purpose.Preparation of the proposalESOP 2022 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies. ESOP 2022 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors.DilutionSubject to certain recalculation conditions  the maximum number of shares that may be issued under ESOP 2022 is 2 000 000 which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3.6 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to already allocated warrants under the company's outstanding incentive programs  the maximum dilution amounts to approximately 9.4 percent on a fully diluted basis.The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"".Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found on Calliditas Therapeutics' website  www.calliditas.se/en/  under ""Remuneration"" as well as in the company's annual report.Scope and costs of the programESOP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"".

Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Options of SEK 100.0  an annual increase in the share price of 15 percent and that all Options are allocated up-front under the assumptions set out under ""Dilution"" above  the average annual cost for Calliditas Therapeutics according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 16.2 million per year before tax. The average annual social security costs over the vesting period are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 10.9 million  based on the above assumptions  that all Options are fully vested  a vesting period for all Options of three years and social security costs of 31.42 percent. It is envisaged that the social security costs associated with ESOP 2022 will be covered by the cash received from the participants at exercise of Options. If necessary  social security costs will be covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants (see item 18b below) which would be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the Options. In either case  the social security costs associated with ESOP 2022 will be fully covered and will hence not affect the company's cash flow.The total cost of ESOP 2022  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 81.3 million under the above assumptions.The costs associated with ESOP 2022 are expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Expenses relating to R&D/operating expenses"".Delivery of shares under ESOP 2022In order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2022 and if necessary for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue and use warrants in accordance with item 18b below.18b –Issue of warrantsIn order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2022  and for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 2 000 000 warrants  whereby the company's share capital could be increased by not more than SEK 80 000.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only be granted Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of ESOP 2022. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants or a financial intermediary in connection with exercise.The warrants shall be issued free of charge. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value.The full terms and conditions for the warrants are presented in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders in accordance with the below.18c – Equity swap agreement with a third partyShould the majority requirement for item 18b above not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that ESOP 2022 instead shall be hedged through an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants.Majority rulesThe implementation of the Board of Directors' proposals under item 15 and items 16a – 16d are subject to the approval at the annual general meeting with at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the meeting. Resolution in accordance with item 17b and 18b above requires approval of at least nine tenths (9/10) of the shares represented and votes cast at the annual general meeting.Other informationThe annual report and the auditor's report for the financial year 2021  proxy form and advance voting form  the remuneration report and other supporting documents for the general meeting  including complete proposals and statements from the Board of Directors  as well as the statement from the auditor pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 54 of the Companies Act will be available to the shareholders at the company's office on Kungsbron 1 D5  SE-111 22 Stockholm  Sweden  and on the company's webpage  www.calliditas.se/en/  no later than 28 April 2022.

By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  NOXXON’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses against the immune system and enable greater therapeutic impact. NOXXON’s lead program NOX-A12 has delivered final top-line data from a Keytruda® combination trial in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients published at the ESMO conference in September 2020 and in July 2021 the company announced its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. NOXXON is also studying NOX-A12 in brain cancer in combination with radiotherapy which has been granted orphan drug status in the US and EU for the treatment of certain brain cancers. GLORIA  a trial of NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy has delivered top-line data from all three dose-escalation cohorts showing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA has been expanded to assess the benefit of NOX-A12 with other treatment combinations  radiotherapy + bevacizumab and radiotherapy + pembrolizumab. The company’s second clinical-stage asset NOX-E36 is a Phase 2 TME asset targeting the innate immune system. NOXXON plans to test NOX‑E36 in patients with solid tumors. Further information can be found at: www.noxxon.com.Keytruda® is a registered trademark of Merck Sharp & Dohme Corp.Visit NOXXON on LinkedIn and Twitter.About the GLORIA StudyGLORIA (NCT04121455) is NOXXON’s dose-escalation  phase 1/2 study of NOX-A12 in combination with irradiation in first-line partially resected or unresected glioblastoma (brain cancer) patients with unmethylated MGMT promoter (resistant to standard chemotherapy). GLORIA further evaluates safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 three additional arms combining NOX-A12 with: A. radiotherapy in patients with complete tumor resection; B. radiotherapy and bevacizumab in patients with incomplete tumor resection; and C. radiotherapy and pembrolizumab in patients with incomplete tumor resection.About the OPTIMUS StudyOPTIMUS (NCT04901741) is NOXXON’s open-label two-arm phase 2 study of NOX-A12 combined with pembrolizumab and nanoliposomal irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in microsatellite-stable metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.DisclaimerTranslations of any press release into languages other than English are intended solely as a convenience to the non-English-reading audience.

The nomination committee shall be composed of the chairman of the Board of Directors together with one representative of each of the three largest shareholders  based on ownership in the company as of the expiry of the third quarter of the financial year. Should any of the three largest shareholders renounce its right to appoint one representative to the nomination committee  such right shall transfer to the shareholder who then in turn  after these three  is the largest shareholder in the company. The Board of Directors shall convene the nomination committee. The member representing the largest shareholder shall be appointed chairman of the nomination committee  unless the nomination committee unanimously appoints someone else. Should a shareholder having appointed a representative to the nomination committee no longer be among the three largest shareholders at a point in time falling three months before the annual general meeting at the latest  the representative appointed by such shareholder shall resign and the shareholder who is then among the three largest shareholders shall have the right to appoint one representative to the nomination committee. Unless there are specific reasons otherwise  the already established composition of the nomination committee shall  however  remain unchanged in case such change in the ownership is only marginal or occurs during the three month period prior to the annual general meeting. Where a shareholder has become one of the three largest shareholders due to a material change in the ownership at a point in time falling later than three months before the annual general meeting  such shareholder shall however in any event have the right to take part of the work of the nomination committee and participate in its meetings. Should a member resign from the nomination committee before his or her work is completed  the shareholder who has appointed such member shall appoint a new member  unless that shareholder is no longer one of the three largest shareholders  in which case the largest shareholder in turn shall appoint the substitute member. A shareholder who has appointed a representative to the nomination committee shall have the right to discharge such representative and appoint a new representative. Changes to the composition of the nomination committee shall be announced immediately. The term of office for the nomination committee ends when the next nomination committee has been appointed. The nomination committee shall carry out its duties as set out in the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance. - Resolution on approval of the Board of Directors' remuneration report The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to approve the remuneration report on remunerations according to Chapter 8  section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551) (the ""Companies Act""). - Resolution to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of new shares  warrants and/or convertibles The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to  at one or several occasions and for the period up until the next annual general meeting  increase the company's share capital by issuing new shares  warrants and/or convertibles. Such share issue resolution may be carried out with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions. The authorization may only be utilized to such extent that the number of shares issued under the authorization  or the number of shares created in connection with exercise of warrants or conversion of convertibles  corresponds to a dilution of not more than 15 percent of the total number of shares outstanding at the time of the general meeting's resolution on adoption of the proposed authorization  reduced with the number of shares transferred to ensure delivery of shares under the company's ATM Program in accordance with item 16d below. The purpose of the authorization is to increase the financial flexibility of the company and the general flexibility of the Board of Directors. Should the Board of Directors resolve on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason for this shall be to finance an acquisition of operations  to procure capital to finance the development of projects or to commercialize the company' s products. Upon such deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the new issue shall be made at market terms and conditions. The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration. - Resolution  in order to facilitate implementation of and delivery of shares under a contemplated ""At-the-market"" program (the ""ATM Program"")  to: Since 2020  Calliditas has had its shares  in the form of American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"")  listed in the United States on The Nasdaq Global Select Market. Calliditas' board of directors has been evaluating the opportunity of launching a so called At-The-Market program (""ATM Program"") in the US market. ATM Programs are common among many US listed companies  including Life Science companies. Approximately 70 percent of eligible Life Science Companies in the United States have ATM Programs in place. The board of directors of Calliditas is thus proposing to the shareholders to adopt resolutions to allow for an ATM Program as set out below in this agenda item 16  subject to AGM approval and further resolutions by the board before implementation of the program  however  no assurances can be given that a program will be utilized and the future use of an ATM Program will be evaluated by the Board of Directors taking other potential sources of financing  capital need and shareholder dilution into consideration. An ATM Program is an efficient and cost-effective method to raise equity in the US market  from time to time  and with significantly lower transactional costs compared to traditional capital raising alternatives. Sales are effected in ""at the market"" transactions of ADSs on The Nasdaq Global Select Market and/or negotiated transactions in the US subject to applicable US regulations and documentation. Having an ATM Program in place is expected to enable Calliditas to efficiently source capital in the US market  subject to demand and board approval. An ATM Program may also be used to settle reverse enquiries from institutional buyers. An ATM Program  if used  may also increase the liquidity of Calliditas' ADSs in the United States. 16a - Amend the articles of association The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend the articles of association as follows. A new section  § 5  together with an updated wording of § 4  is proposed in the articles of association. The new § 5  together with the amended § 4  allows for C-shares to be issued  conversion of C-shares into ordinary shares  redemption and regulates preferential rights. Following the insertion of a new section  a renumbering of sections is proposed  whereby the previous § 5 becomes § 6 and so on. Current wording Poposed wording 4 § Share capital and number of shares The share capital shall be not less than SEK 710 000 and not more than SEK 2 840 000. The number of shares shall be not less than 17 750 000 and not more than 71 000 000. 4 § Share capital and number of shares The share capital shall be not less than SEK 710 000 and not more than SEK 2 840 000. The number of shares shall be not less than 17 750 000 and not more than 71 000 000. The shares shall be issued in two classes  ordinary shares and C-shares. Ordinary shares shall entitle the holder to one (1) vote per share  whereas C-shares shall entitle the holder to one tenth (1/10) vote per share. Shares of each class may be issued in a quantity corresponding to the entire share capital of the company. Holders of C-shares are not entitled to dividends. Upon the company's liquidation  C-shares carry equivalent right to the company's assets as other shares  however not to an amount exceeding the quota value of the share. Where the company resolves to issue new shares by way of a cash issue or a set-off issue  one old share shall entitle the holder to pre-emption rights to one new share of the same class pro rata to the number of shares previously owned by the holder (primary pre-emption rights). Shares that are not subscribed for pursuant to primary pre-emption rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (subsidiary pre-emption rights). Unless shares offered in such manner are sufficient for the subscription which takes place pursuant to subsidiary pre-emption rights  the shares shall be allotted among the subscribers pro rata to the total number of shares previously owned. Where this is not possible with respect to a particular share(s)  shares shall be allotted through drawing of lots. The provisions above shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility for the company to adopt a resolution regarding a cash issue or set-off issue without regard to shareholders' pre-emption rights. The provisions above regarding shareholders' pre-emption rights shall apply mutatis mutandis to an issue of warrants or an issue of convertible instruments. Where the company resolves to issue only one class of shares by way of a cash issue or set-off issue  all of the shareholders  irrespective of the class of share  shall hold pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares pro rata to the number of shares previously owned. In the event of a bonus issue  new shares of each class shall be issued pro rata to the number of shares of the same class previously issued. In connection therewith  the owners of existing shares of a certain class shall entitle the holder to new shares of the same class. This shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility of issuing new shares of a new class by means of a bonus issue  following the required amendment to the articles of association. Reduction of share capital  which in any case shall not fall below the minimum share capital  may  upon the request of an owner of C-shares and a resolution by the company's Board of Directors or the general meeting  take place through redemption of C-shares. A request from a shareholder shall be made in writing. When a resolution on reduction has been passed  an amount corresponding to the reduction amount shall be transferred to the company's reserve fund  if required funds are available. The redemption amount per C- share shall correspond to the quota value of such share. Following notice of the redemption resolution  holders of shares shall promptly receive payment for the shares  or  if authorization from the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) or a court is required  following notice that the final decision has been registered. 5 § (New section inserted) 5 § Conversion clause C-shares held by the company may  upon decision of the board of directors be reclassified into ordinary shares. Immediately thereafter  the board of directors shall register the reclassification to the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The reclassification is effected when it has been registered and the reclassification been reflected in the central securities depository register. The Board of Directors proposes that the CEO shall be authorized to make the minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with their registration. 16b - Authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on issue of new C-shares The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the Board of Directors  during the period until the annual general meeting 2023 on one or more occasions  to increase the company's share capital by not more than SEK 236 321 by the issue of not more than 5 908 019 C-shares  each with a quota value of SEK 0.04. With deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights  the participating bank shall be entitled to subscribe for the new C-shares at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights in connection with the issue of shares is to ensure delivery of shares to be sold under the company's ATM Program. 16c - Authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on purchase of C-shares The Board of Directors proposes that the Board is authorized  during the period until the annual general meeting 2023  on one or more occasions  to decide on purchases of up to 5 908 019 C-shares in accordance with purchase offerings directed to all shareholders of C-shares which shall comprise all outstanding C-shares. Repurchases shall be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the acquired C-shares shall be made in cash. The company may purchase maximum so many shares that the company's holding of own shares after the purchase amounts to a maximum of one-tenth of all the shares in the company. The purpose of the authorization is to ensure delivery of shares to be sold under the company's ATM Program. 16d - Authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on transfer of own ordinary shares The Board of Directors proposes that the Board of Directors is authorized  during the period until the next annual general meeting  on one or more occasions  to transfer up to 5 908 019 ordinary shares (following the re-classification from C-shares)  to be effected outside Nasdaq Stockholm against payment in cash. Such transfers may be effected at a price in cash which corresponds to the market price at the time of the transfer of the Calliditas Therapeutics shares transferred with such deviation as the Board of Directors finds appropriate. The authorization under this item may only be utilized to the extent that the shares transferred by virtue of this authorization  together with any shares issued by virtue of the authorization under item 15 above  do not exceed 20 percent of the total number of shares outstanding at the time of the general meeting's resolution on the proposed authorization. The purpose of the authorization is to ensure delivery of shares to be sold under the company's ATM Program. - Resolution  in order to adopt a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of Directors  on: The nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics AB (""Board LTIP 2022"") in accordance with items 17a - 17b below. The resolutions under items 17a - 17b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 17b below not be met  the nomination committee proposes that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 17c below and resolutions under items 17a and 17c shall then be conditional upon each other. Board LTIP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  share awards subject to performance vesting (""Share Awards"") that entitle to shares in Calliditas Therapeutics to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below  however not more than 50 000 shares. As part of the implementation of Board LTIP 2022  not more than 50 000 warrants can be issued in accordance with item 17b below. 17a - Adoption of a long-term performance-based incentive program for members of the Board of Directors The rationale for the proposal Board LTIP 2022 is intended for main owner independent members of the Board of Directors in Calliditas Therapeutics. The nomination committee believes that an equity-based incentive program is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members of the Board of Directors  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. Board LTIP 2022 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics. The nomination committee is of the opinion that Board LTIP 2022 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Calliditas Therapeutics' operations  improve company loyalty and be beneficial to both the shareholders and Calliditas Therapeutics. Conditions for Share Awards The following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards. 1. The Share Awards shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as practicable after the annual general meeting. 2. The Share Awards shall vest gradually over approximately three years  corresponding to three terms up to the date of  whichever is earliest  (i) the annual general meeting 2025 or (ii) 1 July 2025 (the ""Vesting Date"")  where each term equals the period from one annual general meeting up until the day falling immediately prior to the next annual general meeting or the Vesting Date  as applicable (each such period a ""Term""). The Share Awards shall vest with 1/3 at the end of each Term  provided that the participant is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics on the said date. In addition to the vesting conditions just stated  the Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price  in accordance with the vesting conditions below. 3. The Share Awards are subject to performance vesting based on the development of the Calliditas Therapeutics share price over the period from the date the Share Awards are allocated (""Grant Date"") up to and including the day before the Vesting Date. The development of the share price will be measured based on the volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Grant Date and the 10 trading days immediately preceding the Vesting Date  respectively. In the event Calliditas Therapeutics' share price has increased by more than 60 percent  100 percent of the Share Awards shall vest  and should the share price have increased by 20 percent  33 percent of such Share Awards shall vest. In the event of an increase of the share price of between 20 and 60 percent  vesting of the Share Awards will occur linearly. Should the increase of the share price be less than 20 percent  vesting will not occur at all. 4. The earliest point in time at which shares may be obtained from vested Share Awards shall be as soon as possible after the Vesting Date and once an assessment of the performance criteria has been made. 5. Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in Calliditas Therapeutics without any compensation being payable provided that the holder is still a Board member of Calliditas Therapeutics at the relevant time of vesting with the exception of certain customary ""good leaver""-situations (death and permanent incapacity to complete the assignment due to illness or accident) and this shall also apply during the first year up until the day of the annual general meeting 2023. 6. The number of Share Awards will be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures. 7. The Share Awards cannot be transferred and may not be pledged. 8. The Share Awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group. 9. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Share Awards will vest in their entirety upon completion of such transaction. 10. The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board LTIP 2022. Allocation The number of Share Awards that shall be granted to each participant shall equal the below amount for the respective participant divided by the volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date. The Share Awards under Board LTIP 2022 shall be awarded in accordance with the following: · Share Awards calculated based on SEK 1 300 000 to the chairman of the Board of Directors; and · Share Awards calculated based on SEK 500 000 to each of Diane Parks  Hilde Furberg  Molly Henderson  Henrik Stenqvist and Elisabeth Björk. In any event  Board LTIP 2022 will comprise a total number of Share Awards which  if all Share Awards are vested in accordance with the vesting conditions above  can entitle to not more than 50 000 shares in Calliditas Therapeutics. Preparation of the proposal Board LTIP 2022 has been prepared by the nomination committee and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies. Dilution Assuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 100.00  Board LTIP 2022 will comprise not more than 38 000 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.07 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company  the maximum dilution amounts to 6.2 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the company as well as the incentive program for the company's management and key personnel proposed to the annual general meeting 2022  the maximum dilution amounts to 9.4 percent on a fully diluted basis. The dilution is only expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"". Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found in Calliditas Therapeutics' annual report for 2021  note 10  which is available on the company's website  www.calliditas.se/en/ . Scope and costs of the program Board LTIP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period. Assuming a volume-weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 10 trading days preceding the Grant Date of SEK 100.0  the annual cost for the Board LTIP 2022  according to IFRS 2  is estimated at approximately SEK 0.5 million pre-tax. The estimated IFRS 2 cost has been calculated with a Monte Carlo simulation. The annual cost for social security contributions is estimated at SEK 0.7 million  based on an annual increase in the share price of 20 percent  the aforementioned assumptions and a social security tax rate of 31.42 percent. The total annual cost for Board LTIP 2022 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security charges  is therefore estimated to approximately SEK 1.2 million. The total cost of the Board LTIP 2022  including all costs referred to above and social security charges  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 3.7 million under the above assumptions. Delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022 In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants in accordance with item 17b below. 17b -Issue of warrants In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2022  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 50 000 warrants  whereby the company's share capital can increase by not more than SEK 2 000 in accordance with the following: 1. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only vest with Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of Board LTIP 2022. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants of Board LTIP 2022  or a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of Share Awards. 2. The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than 1 July 2022. The Board of Directors may extend the subscription period. 3. The detailed terms of the warrants are set out in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders. 4. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value. 5. The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the new issue. 6. Notification of subscription of shares by the exercise of Warrants can be made from and including the day of registration of the Warrants with the Swedish Companies' Office up until and including 31 December 2025. 7. Shares which are issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of profits for the first time on the nearest record date occurring after the subscription has been exercised. 17c - Equity swap agreement with a third party Should the majority requirement for item 17b above not be met  the nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that Board LTIP 2022 shall instead be hedged so that Calliditas Therapeutics can enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants. - Resolution  in order to adopt a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel  on: The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics proposes the introduction of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in accordance with the following. The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics (""ESOP 2022"") in accordance with items 18a - 18b below. The resolutions under items 18a - 18b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 18b below not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that Calliditas Therapeutics shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 18c below and resolutions under items 18a and 18c shall then be conditional upon each other. ESOP 2022 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  stock options to acquire shares in Calliditas Therapeutics (""Options"")  subject to vesting over a three-year period in accordance with the below. The Board of Directors proposes that a maximum of 2 000 000 Options are allocated to the participants. 18a - Adoption of a long-term incentive program for the company's management and key personnel The rationale for the proposal ESOP 2022 is intended for members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that an equity-based incentive program in the form of stock options is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate competent members of management and key personnel (including employees and consultants) in Calliditas Therapeutics  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. The proposed program is key for the company's ability to attract  retain and motivate competent key persons in the United States as well as in Europe in the company's operations and commercial functions scaling up the market launch of TARPEYO in the United States and the development of the company's pipeline assets. During the fourth quarter of 2021  the company received accelerated approval in the United States and currently the company are launching TARPEYO in the United States. When recruiting experienced commercial personnel in the United States and other key employees in the United States and Europe it will be important for Calliditas Therapeutics to be able to offer attractive compensation terms. A competitive equity-based incentive program will be a key component in order to be able to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced individuals as Calliditas Therapeutics launches TARPEYO in the United States. The Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics believes that ESOP 2022 will fortify the alignment of the interests of the participants and the interests of the shareholders. ESOP 2022 is adapted to the current position and needs of Calliditas Therapeutics. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that ESOP 2022 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Calliditas Therapeutics' operations  improve company loyalty and that ESOP 2022 will be beneficial to both the shareholders and Calliditas Therapeutics. Conditions for Options The following conditions shall apply for the Options. · The Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants. · The Board of Directors shall resolve upon the allocation of Options between the date of the annual general meeting 2022 and the date of the annual general meeting 2023 (with each respective granting falling on a ""Grant Date""). · Each Option entitles the holder to acquire one share in Calliditas Therapeutics for a pre-determined exercise price. The exercise price will correspond to 115 percent of the volume weighted average price of the Calliditas Therapeutics share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days preceding the Grant Date. · The Options shall vest over a three-year period  with 20 percent on the first anniversary of the Grant Date  with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the second year after the Grant Date  and with an annual vesting of 40 percent during the third year after the Grant Date  and thereafter be exercisable  provided that the holder  with certain exceptions  still is employed by Calliditas Therapeutics (or  in the case of consultants  still provides services to Calliditas Therapeutics). · Following the expiry of the vesting period  the Options may be exercised during a one-year period. · The number of Options shall be subject to customary re-calculation  for example in the event that changes occur in Calliditas Therapeutics' equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures. · The Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged. · The Options may be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the Calliditas Therapeutics group. · In the event of a public take-over offer  significant asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting Calliditas Therapeutics  the Options will vest in their entirety following the completion of a change of control. Allocation The right to receive Options shall accrue to up to 100 employees or consultants of the company. The Board of Directors may grant Options  on one or several occasions  between the date of the annual general meeting 2022 and the date of the annual general meeting 2023. The maximum number of Options that may be allocated to the participants under ESOP 2022 is 2 000 000. The maximum allocation per individual in each category shall be 300 000 Options for Category 1 (CEO)  250 000 Options for Category 2 (Management) and 100 000 Options for Category 3 (Other key personnel and consultants). Preparation  administration and the right to amend the terms of the Options The Board of Directors is responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of ESOP 2022  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions  including resolving on cash or other settlement if deemed favorable for Calliditas Therapeutics based on foreign tax regulations. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in Calliditas Therapeutics or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of ESOP 2022 no longer serve their purpose. Preparation of the proposal ESOP 2022 has been initiated by the Board of Directors of Calliditas Therapeutics and has been structured based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) and American listed companies. ESOP 2022 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors. Dilution Subject to certain recalculation conditions  the maximum number of shares that may be issued under ESOP 2022 is 2 000 000 which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 3.6 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to already allocated warrants under the company's outstanding incentive programs  the maximum dilution amounts to approximately 9.4 percent on a fully diluted basis. The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Earnings (loss) per share"". Information about Calliditas Therapeutics' existing incentive programs can be found on Calliditas Therapeutics' website  www.calliditas.se/en/   under ""Remuneration"" as well as in the company's annual report. Scope and costs of the program ESOP 2022 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period. Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Options of SEK 100.0  an annual increase in the share price of 15 percent and that all Options are allocated up-front under the assumptions set out under ""Dilution"" above  the average annual cost for Calliditas Therapeutics according to IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 16.2 million per year before tax. The average annual social security costs over the vesting period are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 10.9 million  based on the above assumptions  that all Options are fully vested  a vesting period for all Options of three years and social security costs of 31.42 percent. It is envisaged that the social security costs associated with ESOP 2022 will be covered by the cash received from the participants at exercise of Options. If necessary  social security costs will be covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants (see item 18b below) which would be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the Options. In either case  the social security costs associated with ESOP 2022 will be fully covered and will hence not affect the company's cash flow. The total cost of ESOP 2022  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 81.3 million under the above assumptions. The costs associated with ESOP 2022 are expected to have a marginal effect on the company's key performance indicator ""Expenses relating to R&D/operating expenses"". Delivery of shares under ESOP 2022 In order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2022 and if necessary for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue and use warrants in accordance with item 18b below. 18b -Issue of warrants In order to ensure the delivery of shares under ESOP 2022  and for hedging of social security costs  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue not more than 2 000 000 warrants  whereby the company's share capital could be increased by not more than SEK 80 000. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only be granted Nefecon AB  a wholly owned subsidiary of Calliditas Therapeutics. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of ESOP 2022. Nefecon AB shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants or a financial intermediary in connection with exercise. The warrants shall be issued free of charge. The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value. The full terms and conditions for the warrants are presented in the complete proposal which is kept available to the shareholders in accordance with the below. 18c - Equity swap agreement with a third party Should the majority requirement for item 18b above not be met  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that ESOP 2022 instead shall be hedged through an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of Calliditas Therapeutics to the participants. Majority rules The implementation of the Board of Directors' proposals under item 15 and items 16a - 16d are subject to the approval at the annual general meeting with at least two thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the meeting.

In case of any discrepancies between the Swedish text and the English translation  the Swedish text shall prevail.The board of directors' proposal for resolution on (A) authorization on directed issues of series C shares; (B) authorization on repurchase of series C shares; and (C) transfer of own ordinary sharesThe board of directors of BONESUPPORT HOLDING AB (publ)  Reg. No. 556802-2171  proposes that the annual general meeting (""AGM"") on 19 May 2022 resolves on hedging measures in accordance with sections A - C to secure delivery of shares under the long-term performance-based share saving program for senior executives and other key employees resolved by the 2021 AGM (the ""LTI 2021"") and to hedge associated costs  such as social security charges  with the purpose to replace the share swap resolved by the 2021 AGM.During 2021 BONESUPPORT has  in accordance with the resolution from the AGM last year  entered into a share swap agreement to secure the commitment in the Group's incentive program LTI 2021. A total of 786 000 shares have been hedged at an average value of SEK 79.30 per share  totaling SEK 62 333 thousand. A hedge through issuance of C shares to replace the share swap agreement means that liquid funds equivalent to 786 000 shares at the share price applicable at the time is released  less minor transaction costs. Based on the closing share price on 12 April 2022 such sales proceeds would have amounted to a total of SEK 34 144 thousand.A.Authorization on directed issues of series C sharesThe board of directors proposes that the AGM resolves to authorize the board of directors  for the period up until the next AGM  on one or several occasions  to resolve to issue a maximum of 639 572 series C shares. The new shares may  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  only be subscribed for by a bank or a securities company at a subscription price which corresponds to the quota value of the shares. The new series C shares shall be subject to Chapter 4  Section 6 of the Swedish Companies Act (conversion restriction) and Chapter 20  Section 31 of the Swedish Companies Act (redemption restriction). The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights in connection with an issue of shares is to hedge delivery of performance shares to the participants in LTI 2021 and  in terms of liquidity  to hedge payments of future social security charges related to performance shares.B. Authorization on repurchase of series C sharesLEGAL#22248302v6The board of directors proposes that the AGM resolves to authorize the board of directors  for the period up until the next AGM  on one or several occasions  to repurchase its own series C shares. Repurchase may only be effected through a public offer directed to all holders of series C shares and shall comprise all outstanding series C shares. Repurchase may also be made of so-called interim shares  by Euroclear Sweden AB designated as a Paid Subscribed Share (Sw. Betald Tecknad Aktie (BTA))  regarding a series C share. Repurchase shall be made at a purchase price per share which corresponds to the quota value of the share. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to secure delivery of performance shares to participants in LTI 2021 and to hedge associated costs  such as social security charges.The board of directors' statement pursuant to Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act is presented in a separate document provided with this proposal.C. Transfer of own ordinary sharesIn order to fulfil the company's obligations towards participants in LTI 2021  the board of directors proposes that the AGM resolves that the company shall be entitled to transfer the company's own ordinary shares as follows:1. The company shall have the right to transfer the number of ordinary shares that the company has a maximum obligation to allocate as performance shares to participants in LTI 2021  at most 521 841 shares.2. The shares that can be transferred in accordance with paragraph 1 above may consist of either shares newly issued and repurchased in accordance with paragraphs A - C above or  after conversion into ordinary shares  C shares issued in connection with corresponding previous LTI programs  but which are no longer required for the performance of the company commitments under such programs.3. It is noted that the number of shares that shall be transferred pursuant to LTI 2021 may be subject to recalculation in consequence of a bonus issue  split  rights issue  and/or other similar corporate action which affects the number of shares in the company  which consequently  to the corresponding degree affects the highest number of shares that can be transferred.4. The right to acquire ordinary shares shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  vest in participants in LTI 2021 who are entitled to be allotted performance shares in accordance with the terms and conditions of the program.5. Transfer of shares to participants in LTI 2021 shall be made free of charge and beexecuted at the relevant time pursuant to the terms of LTI 2021.Since LTI 2021 initially  in principle  is not expected to give rise to any social security charges for the company  the board of directors has decided not to propose to the 2022 AGM to decide on authorization regarding the transfer of own ordinary shares on a regulated market to hedge costs associated to LTI 2021  such as social security charges. However  before the transfer of the company's shares to the participants in LTI 2021  the board of directors intends to propose to a later AGM to decide on a transfer of ordinary shares which may take place on a regulated market to hedge such payments.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights in connection with the transfers of own ordinary shares is to enable the delivery of performance shares to participants in LTI 2021.Majority requirementThe proposals in sections A - C above constitute a joint proposal and shall be resolved upon as one resolution. For a valid resolution the proposal has to be supported by shareholders representing at least nine tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the AGM.AuthorizationThe CEO  or anyone appointed by him  shall be authorized to make minor formal adjustments of the resolutions which may be required for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) or Euroclear Sweden AB.____________________Lund in April 2022BONESUPPORT HOLDING AB (publ)The Board of Directors",neutral,0.01,0.95,0.03,negative,0.02,0.32,0.66,True,English,"['series C shares', 'Bonesupport', 'boards', 'issues', 'repurchase', 'transfer', 'long-term performance-based share saving program', 'Sw.

I n addition  in this initial stage  it will also widen the investors’ base for Oman by enhancing the ease of access and participation from foreign investors to invest in multi-currency fixed-income instruments with eurobond or Sukuk structures issued by the Oman government or Omani companies from Oman and listed on the MSX.This means that a foreign investor with an existing Euroclear account in Europe also does not need to incur the additional cost nor the hassle to open another CSD account with MCD in Oman to invest in an international eurobond or Sukuk structure issued from Oman.With easier access and more participation by foreign investors  this will hopefully encourage more primary and secondary trading activities and enhance the liquidity of the instruments and the MSX.As such  with this new initiative  we also hope to widen the issuers’ base and encourage more local and international institutions and companies to issue and dual list their multi-currency eurobonds or Sukuk in Oman and other countries connected to the Euroclear system.Al Salmi  Executive President of the CMA  also commented  “This is just the initial stage of our collaboration with Euroclear. In the next stage  we hope to provide full access to international investors with Euroclear accounts to invest and trade in any securities listed on the MSX  and not just fixed-income instruments with eurobond or Sukuk structures.”,neutral,0.09,0.88,0.04,positive,0.7,0.28,0.02,True,English,"['global financial markets', 'Pact', 'Oman', 'connectivity', 'new Euroclear international central securities depository', 'Abdullah bin Salem al Salmi', 'cross borders settlement efficiencies', 'The Capital Market Authority', 'other international financial markets', 'Depository Company SAOC', 'biggest settlement house', 'Muscat Stock Exchange', 'secondary trading activities', 'Omani financial markets', 'global financial markets', 'cost effective services', 'cost effective way', 'new Euroclear account', 'Euroclear Bank SA/NV', 'existing Euroclear account', 'multi-currency fixed-income instruments', 'Euroclear Bank system', 'new initiative', 'international institutions', 'other countries', 'international investors', 'market players', 'additional cost', 'international eurobond', 'multi-currency eurobonds', 'global connectivity', 'Omani issuers', 'Euroclear transactions', 'Euroclear system', 'Euroclear accounts', 'CSD) account', 'CSD account', 'one account', 'Executive President', 'important initiative', 'continuous efforts', 'Mohammed Abdulhadi', 'General Manager', 'sole point', 'Bernard Ferran', 'Middle East', 'I n', 'initial stage', 'issuers’ base', 'dual list', 'next stage', 'Omani companies', 'investors’ base', 'foreign investors', 'easier access', 'Sukuk structures', 'full access', 'MCD account', 'Oman government', 'CMA', 'Belgium', 'Sultanate', 'part', 'collaboration', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'advancements', 'opening', 'MSX', 'fact', 'ease', 'hassle', 'primary', 'liquidity', 'local']",2022-04-14,2022-04-14,omanobserver.om

These guidelines shall also apply regarding remuneration (for example consultant’s fee)  if any  for work carried out by a board member  in addition to the board assignment  for the corporate group of NIBE or one of its group companies. Unless otherwise stated below  the guidelines do not apply to the board member remuneration  which are determined by the Annual General Meeting.The guidelines shall promote the business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability of the companyIn short  NIBE’s business strategy is to provide world-class sustainable energy solutions. For more information regarding the company’s business strategy  visit www.nibe.com. A successful implementation of the company’s business strategy and the procurement of NIBE’s long-term interests  including its sustainability  rely on NIBE’s ability to attract and retain a management that is highly qualified and with the capacity to reach stated goals. Thus  it is a prerequisite that the company can offer remuneration terms that are competitive. These guidelines enable NIBE to offer remuneration to senior executives on market terms and to be competitive in order to attract and retain personnel.Types of remunerationRemuneration may be paid as fixed salary  variable salary  pension and other benefits such as car benefit.Board fees shall not be paid to senior executives  who are employed in the group.All senior executives  who have not reached the age of 65  shall have retirement benefits corresponding to the defined benefit ITP-plan (supplementary pensions for salaried employees) (SW: ITP-planen)  section 2  for salary parts up to 30 income base amounts (SW: inkomstbasbelopp). For salary parts exceeding 30 income base amounts  a premium with a fixed percentage of 30% shall be paid  in accordance with the same principles as in the ITP-plan with fixed premium  section 1. The retirement premiums may  in total  amount to a maximum of 35% of the total remuneration. Senior executives  who have reached the age of 65  are not entitled to retirement benefits.Other benefits  i.a. medical insurance  life insurance and car benefit  may  in total  amount to a maximum of 5% of the total remuneration.Criteria for payment of variable remunerationSenior executives shall as incentive be able to obtain a variable salary part  which is paid if the goals that have been set are met. These goals are set by the board of directors and shall be measurable and predetermined  e.g. percentage growth  operating margin and working capital reduction. The goals are set for one financial year at a time. By rewarding clear and measurable performance linked to the company’s financial and operational development  the goals set shall promote to motivate the senior executives to achieve the company’s goals regarding business strategies  long-term interests and sustainability.The variable salary part shall be limited to four monthly salaries. In addition thereto  an extra monthly salary may be paid as remuneration  provided that the senior executive uses this extra remuneration and an additional monthly salary of his/her variable remuneration for acquisition of NIBE-shares. A condition for the extra remuneration is that the senior executive keeps the annually acquired NIBE-shares for at least three years. If the condition is not met  the company is entitled to recover this part of the remuneration. The purpose of the extra remuneration for acquisition of NIBE-shares is to increase the senior executives’ long-term interests in the company and hence promote the company’s business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. Normally  the senior executives’ acquisition of NIBE-shares will be made once a year in February/March  with regard to applicable market abuse legislation. The managing director shall not be included in any incentive program.Termination of employmentSenior executives shall be employed for an indefinite or fixed term.Upon termination by the company  the term of notice for the managing director shall be six months.

This has been achieved by obtaining information regarding the employees’ average salary and terms of employment as well as rate of increase of remuneration over time during the employment at NIBE. A very important additional factor has been the group’s growth  with regard to the turnover as well as the result. Moreover  comparison has been made with other Swedish listed companies of the same size. This information has been part of the board of directors’ decision-making documentation in order to evaluate the reasonableness of the guidelines.Fees for consultancy services performed by board membersThe company’s board members elected by the Annual General Meeting may in special cases be remunerated for consultancy services within their respective fields of competence  which do not constitute the board assignment  for a limited time. For these services  remuneration shall be offered on market terms.How these guidelines have been preparedThese guidelines have been prepared by the board of directors. The managing director and the other senior executives have not participated in the board of directors’ preparations and decisions regarding these guidelines.The guidelines are subject to annual review through personal contact by the chairman of the board with the major shareholders.Deviation from these guidelinesThe board of directors may deviate from the guidelines as regards pension  bonus and other benefits if there are particular grounds for a deviation in a special case and if it is necessary in order to meet the company’s long-term interests and sustainability or to ensure the company’s financial viability.The presence of significant changesThe proposal for guidelines is in line with the guidelines approved at the Annual General Meeting in 2021. The annual review of the guidelines has not resulted in any significant changes.Documents availableThe annual report and the auditor’s report  complete proposals for decision concerning items 16 and 17  the auditor’s statement according to Chapter 8 Section 54 of the Swedish Companies Act and other documents will be kept available for the shareholders at the company’s premises in Markaryd and on the company’s web site  www.nibe.com  at the latest from 26 April 2022 and will be sent to shareholders requesting it and stating their address.Right to informationThe shareholders have the right to request information at the Annual General Meeting concerning conditions that may have an effect on the assessment of an item on the agenda and conditions that may have an effect on the assessment of the company’s financial situation.Shares and votesAt the time of execution of this notice the total number of shares in the company amounts to 2 016 066 488  of which 233 130 360 shares of class A and 1 782 936 128 shares of class B.

These devices pull tons of channels out of the air  and in many cases are little more expensive than popular streaming devices. And unlike the run-of-the-mill antenna from the dark ages  these are actually incredibly easy to install. What channels are available? There’s the local channels including CBS  Fox  NBC  and ABC  but depending on the device and your location  you may be able to pull in select cable channels as well. Here’s our picks of the best outdoor TV antennas.— Best Overall: Antennas Direct ClearStream 4V TV Antenna— Best Motorized: PBD WA-2608 Digital Amplified Outdoor HDTV Antenna— Best Long Range: Five Star Yagi Satellite HDTV Antenna— Best 4K Support: LAVA HD2605 Outdoor HDTV Antenna— Best Multi-Directional: Antop AT-415B 720 UFO Dual Omni-Directional Outdoor HDTV AntennaHow We Selected the Best Outdoor TV AntennasTerrestrial TV has officially been totally digital for more than a decade now. Still  for some reason  much of the technology to pull channels out of thin air for you to watch still has a smack of retro to it. Here are some of the things we considered when picking the best outdoor TV antennas.Range: Outdoor antennas all have a range of use  usually measured in miles. A 60-mile antenna  for example  will capture channels in any given direction for up to 60 miles. Some can stretch farther than their given range  though  expect stuff to come in fuzzy. A comparable example of this is like when you’re channel surfing on FM radio during a road trip. A bangin’ classic rock station will eventually become static-y and unlistenable once you’re no longer within range of the station. If you’re smack dab in the middle of a busy city  there’s a good chance you won’t need anything more than an inexpensive indoor antenna for basic cable needs. If you live more than thirty miles from a Starbucks  it may be worth buying an antenna with a wider range.AdvertisementAdvertisementSetup: Even the more cumbersome outdoor TV antennas may not require special tools to install  but you will  at the very least  need to break out a ladder and climb on a roof. After all  installing it lower may not take full potential out of your outdoor antenna’s range capabilities. Could you farm out the work of installing these devices to someone? Certainly. But that can take buying an affordable outdoor TV antenna and make it expensive real quick. Handypersons expect to be paid for their labor  after all  unless you have really cool friends with tool belts. But whether or not you or a screwdriver-savvy person is installing it  it shouldn’t be difficult.Build Quality: Aesthetics for this sort of device shouldn’t matter. But a big honking thing that lives on your roof could be ugly enough to make your neighbors whisper about it behind your back. “Hey look  here comes ‘Ugly Roof Boy ’” or other equally hurtful jabs. No outdoor TV antenna looks fantastic  but some models are sleeker than others  and can easily be obfuscated behind a chimney. Nicer models tend to be flat and surprisingly modern looking  though nothing beats the range capabilities of one of the busier  wiry models.Maintenance: TV antennas aren’t exactly like cars that need regular tune-ups. However  TV signals vary in strength depending on many variables that can change as frequently as the weather. Coincidentally  the weather is one of these variables. The best antennas work through these obstructions  be they nature or man-made like trees and cellular signals. Having the option to rotate your antenna without having to climb on your roof is an excellent feature. If you can’t change an antenna’s direction at will  it better be strong enough to grab signals from within an upstairs balcony or attic. Nobody wants to climb a roof anytime a big game comes on.Best Outdoor TV Antennas: Reviews and RecommendationsBest Overall: Antennas Direct ClearStream 4V TV AntennaCrystal Clear Signal. Antennas DirectWhy It Made The Cut: ClearsStream 4V is one of the most attractive outdoor TV antennas  with impressive power and range  and is 4K ready.AdvertisementAdvertisementSpecs:— Dimensions: 20.1 inches L x 28.2 inches W x 6.3 inches D— Weight: 6 pounds— Operating Range: Up to 70 miles— Frequency: UHF/VHFPros:— Smartphone app helps maximize antenna range— Works with established cable in homes— Easy install on vertical and horizontal surfacesCons:— On the pricier side— Requires high mounting for optimal resultsEven if you are handy with tools and decide to install an outdoor TV antenna yourself  there’s a lot of guesswork when it comes to pointing it in the right direction to get as many channels as possible. Antenna’s Direct ClearStream 4V takes the guesswork out of installation  so you never have to mess with it ever again.AdvertisementAdvertisementUsing the Antenna Point app (available on Google Play and App Store)  you can be sure you position the ClearStream 4v Correctly to get as many as 60 channels across 70 miles. Users in the foothills of California recorded getting channels as far as the Bay Area  in fact. Not too shabby for a simple outdoor TV antenna. Plus  its design actually looks like something invented within the last decade  which is not something you can say about many outdoor TV antennas. Granted  you need to mount the device from 30 to 40 feet off the ground for the best results. After installing  ClearStream 4V works with the installed coaxial cable in your home. Using it alone is great  pairing it with an amplifier makes it unbeatable. It’s a little pricey  but nothing beats the security that comes with a stable signal.User-Friendly. PBDWhy It Made The Cut: Installing the PBD WA-2608 Digital Amplified Outdoor HDTV Antenna is as easy as watching classic reruns  and the motorized controls ensure you never have to touch it again.Specs:— Dimensions: 13 inches L x 17.5 inches W x 4.5 inches D— Weight: 6.4 pounds— Operating Range: Up to 150 miles— Frequency: UHF/VHFPros:— Weather resistant  with lightning protection— Easy controls— Above average rangeAdvertisementAdvertisementCons:— Supports only two televisions— Cheap constructionTV antennas may bring in a bevy of HD channels and come with space-age aesthetics  but in many cases  the technology is just like you remember it. Even some of the best outdoor TV antennas need adjusting now and then  which is pretty cumbersome to do  unless you get a motorized model like the PBD WA-2608 Digital Amplified Outdoor HDTV Antenna with Mounting Pole.This outdoor TV antenna is incredibly easy to install. Because it snaps into place  you won’t need any special tools. The 10-foot mount that comes with the device will give your antenna the extra vertical reach to make channels come in as clear as possible. Better yet  it’s motorized  so you can point it in whatever direction you like  using a handy remote control. This way  you can gauge which cardinal direction will bring in more channels. It covers a range of up to 150 miles  which becomes exponentially larger when you consider it can be pointed every which way. Despite some of the parts of the PBD antenna being cheap plastic  the device is weather resistant  even to lightning. True  it only works with two televisions at once  but that’s not something a coaxial splitter can’t solve.Best Long Range: Five Star Yagi Satellite HDTV AntennaUnmatched Range. Five StarWhy It Made The Cut: Five Star Yagi Satellite pulls channels as far away as 200 miles  for those living in the middle of nowhere.AdvertisementAdvertisementSpecs:— Dimensions: 7.64 inches L x 17.8 inches W x 5.87 inches D— Weight: 5.48 pounds— Operating Range: Up to 200 miles— Frequency: UHF/VHFPros:— Great Value— Unmatched range— Wind  UV  and water resistantCons:— Cumbersome assembly— Results may varyLiving close to a local TV channel affiliate makes channels come in crystal clear  usually with an inexpensive indoor TV antenna. For those who live in the boonies  far away from the din of the city  there’s the Five Star Yagi Satellite HD TV Antenna.AdvertisementAdvertisementThis powerful outdoor TV antenna stretches as far as 200 miles away  which should be more than enough range to reach at least a handful of channels. But that’s the floor  not the ceiling as far as channel availability is concerned. With that much range  you may be able to tap into as many as 50 channels  especially if you’re not terribly far away from a major metropolitan area. For an outdoor TV antenna at this price  it’s a pretty solid deal. Unfortunately  it’s not multi-directional  so it may require occasional re-orienting. However  because it’s so powerful  many users report that it works perfectly fine from an attic instead of a roof. Not a bad tradeoff. If you do decide to mount it outside  it’s totally weather-proof  whether we’re talking extreme wind  heat  or rain. Still  this antenna is very polarizing. Users either love it or hate it  so expect to fall into one of those camps  depending on where you live. The device also claims to come “pre-assembled ” which isn’t exactly accurate: it will still require a hands-on setup.Best 4K Support: LAVA HD2605 Outdoor HDTV Antenna Remote Controlled Rotation Long Range 4K TVHD Ready. LavaWhy It Made The Cut: LAVA Outdoor HDTV Antenna is user-friendly  and one of the easiest ways to get free 4K channels.Specs:— Dimensions: 12 inches L x 16 inches W x 5 inches D— Weight: 5.48 pounds— Operating Range: Up to 125 miles— Frequency: UHF/VHF/FMPros:— Supports up to eight televisions with the right splitter— Made to prioritize 4K channels— Built-in motor and pre-amplifierAdvertisementAdvertisementCons:— Incredibly slow motorAntennas are pretty lo-fi  but plenty of terrestrial channels are broadcast in 4K. If you have a fancy 4K television  the LAVA HD2605 Outdoor HDTV Antenna is an easy way to tap into free  high-def channels.LAVA outdoor TV antenna doesn’t simply provide great picture quality  it pulls in great audio too. It supports 1080p and 4K channels for every single room in your house. Up to eight televisions can be hooked up to this antenna  which should be more than enough for most homes. Setup is relatively simple  and like any great outdoor TV antenna  it’s motorized. However  the motor that rotates the antenna is a little sluggish. If patience isn’t one of your virtues  you may want to spend a little more. If you’re confident in the signal quality in your area  it should be fine. The range is listed as 125 miles  though some users have reported it picking up channels up to 150 miles away. LAVA’s built-in amplifier may have something to do with that.Out of this World. ANTOP AntennaWhy It Made The Cut: Why settle for one direction when you can have them all  with the Antop UFO Dual Omni-Directional Outdoor HDTV Antenna.AdvertisementAdvertisementSpecs:— Dimensions: 14.96 inches L x 14.96 inches W x 6 inches D— Weight: 4.94 pounds— Operating Range: Up to 65 miles— Frequency: UHF/VHFPros:— Full HD support— Blocks unwanted 3G and 4G signals— Offers seriously stable coverageCons:— Less range  despite its powerOut of all the outdoor TV antennas in this compilation  the Antop UFO Dual Omni-Directional Outdoor HDTV Antenna is easily the most unique looking. It’s not just form you can rely on  the spaceship design packs plenty of useful function as well.AdvertisementAdvertisementWhile other outdoor TV antennas have to be re-adjusted or rotated to pick up signals  the Antop UFO provides full 360-degree coverage vertically and horizontally  hence its 720 moniker. Like many great things  this comes with a catch. Its range may be more complete  but it’s a good bit shorter  topping out at 65 miles. Considering that the antenna covers 65 miles in every direction  this may be a fair trade. The signals coming in are amplified  and a 4G filter keeps other interference from messing up your reception. Because it’s so easy to set up  it works equally well on homes and RVs. Of course  the bevvy of channels that it does pull in will all be in glorious HD.Things to Consider Before Buying an Outdoor TV AntennaDo You Actually Need an Outdoor TV Antenna?This is an actual question you should ask yourself before deciding to buy or set up an outdoor TV antenna. If you have a cable subscription  you shouldn’t need one. Many channels that would come in using an antenna will be available via your cable box. Same goes if you’re using a live TV streaming service like Sling or Hulu with Live TV  though  channel availability will vary depending on your area and channel suite. If you live within the city limits  or less than 30 miles out  an inexpensive indoor antenna may be more than enough to get the channels you need. For those that live in rural areas  an outdoor TV antenna is more or less essential for grabbing terrestrial channels. Could you still use an outdoor TV antenna if you live within a city? Sure. Even if you’re close to the signals broadcasted by local network affiliates  you may be able to find even more channels available just out of range. Many of these outdoor antennas are relatively inexpensive and set up pretty quickly  so going channel hunting may be a fun Saturday afternoon adventure. Plus  given the fact that many cable providers compress their broadcasts to save on money  there’s a good chance that the channels you pull out of the air will be truly high definition.Location  Location  LocationDo you live in an area surrounded by trees? While trees and their positive environmental impact do much to improve your overall quality of life  they’re an awful hindrance when it comes to grabbing television signals. The list of obstructions don’t end there. Mountains  large concrete buildings  power lines  LTE cell towers  LED light bulbs  and weather can all negatively affect you tapping into channels near and far. One of the easiest ways to overcome these obstacles is to get as much latitude as possible when mounting your outdoor TV antenna. In general  the higher an antenna is mounted  the better the reception. Still  depending on where you live  it may be more prudent to simply drop the cash on a cable or live-streaming TV subscription.Should I Get an Amplifier?Every outdoor TV antenna here will grab channels. But will they come in crystal clear? Even the best antenna could use a boost  because  as previously stated  TV signals are fighting with plenty of obstructions. An easy  and more importantly  inexpensive fix is to plug your rig into an amplifier  which helps boost signals and clear up staticy channels. The GE Antenna Amplifier works great  and is incredibly cheap and easy to set up. You may not need it  though. Some outdoor TV antennas come with built-in amplifiers like the Antop AT-415B 720 UFO Dual Omni-Directional Outdoor HDTV Antenna.AdvertisementAdvertisementWays to Improve Your TV ReceptionThe most important thing you can do to improve television reception is picking the perfect place to mount it. The more height  the better  but ensure that wherever it is  that it has a clear view of the sky. Make sure there are no metal obstructions nearby  as they can mess with your antenna’s reception. Occasionally  companies cheap out on the coaxial cables that come packaged with outdoor TV antennas. Using better quality cables is an easy fix  and they come in varied lengths and sizes to suit your needs.FAQsQ: How does an outdoor antenna work?TV towers broadcast UHF and VHF signals. Your outdoor TV antenna snatches these signals out of the air and transmits them to your televisions.Q: Can I put an indoor TV antenna outside?Yes  an indoor TV antenna will work great outdoors  and in fact  will work better outdoors. In general  TV antennas will always operate better outdoors.Q: How do I get the best outdoor antenna reception?The ways to get the best reception out of your outdoor antenna are to direct it correctly  reduce interference  connect it with new cables  and use it in tandem with an amplifier.AdvertisementAdvertisementQ: Does aluminum foil boost antenna signal?Wrapping foil around your antenna increases its surface area  which does amplify your signal. However  it doesn’t look great  though looks are relative.Q: Can I install an outdoor TV antenna myself?You can easily install an outdoor antenna yourself  so long as you follow best safety practices when hopping onto a roof or balcony. Some antennas get decent reception from attics.Q: How high does my antenna need to be?For the best reception  an outdoor TV antenna needs to be placed more than 30 feet off the ground. The higher the placement  the better.Final Thoughts on Outdoor TV AntennasNothing beats free  especially when it comes to television. Grabbing free networks out of thin air is easily done  especially with a powerful outdoor TV antenna. Antennas Direct ClearStream 4V TV Antenna is our overall favorite  for its easy setup and stable signals. It’s 4K ready  and requires little to no maintenance. The Antop AT-415B 720 UFO Dual Omni-Directional Outdoor HDTV Antenna is also a fantastic option  with an inspired design that provides some serious reach.AdvertisementAdvertisementThis post was created by a non-news editorial team at Recurrent Media  Futurism’s owner.

The offering is targeted for the UK and wider European market.FNZ  the wealth management technology provider which last year agreed to buy Switzerland-based onboarding tech specialist Appway  has partnered with the trade services provider Clearstream – the post-trade services provider of Deutsche Börse Group.The partnership  which will launch a new business intelligence solution  is aimed at the UK and European asset management industry  the firms said in a statement earlier this week.Explaining the reason for the move  FNZ and Clearstream said that investment distribution information is fragmented and there is very little connectivity across the industry. This means that asset managers need to seek information from wherever they distribute funds – hence the need for a new solution.The new capabilities will provide asset managers with the global and regional intelligence they require to analyse market trends  achieve a better understanding of behaviour  improve decision-making for fund distribution and  ultimately  deliver stronger business  customer and regulatory outcomes.“The partnership and our newly-unveiled business intelligence solution will allow us to significantly enhance our support for asset managers by dramatically increasing transparency across the entire industry ” Adrian Durham  CEO at FNZ Group  said.In February FNZ  which in 2021 agreed to buy Switzerland-based onboarding tech specialist Appway  secured $1.4 billion in new equity funding from Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Motive Partners.

2929,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4501363-clearbridge-international-growth-eafe-strategy-portfolio-manager-commentary-q1-2022,ClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy Portfolio Manager Commentary Q1 2022,The ClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy underperformed its benchmark during Q1. Click here to know who the primary contributors & detractors were.,Petmal/iStock via Getty ImagesMarket OverviewInternational equities were faced with numerous risks in the first quarter  ranging from resurging COVID-19 cases in large geographies like China to inflation and potential monetary tightening globally  before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24 overshadowed all else. Europe was most directly impacted by the conflict as crude oil and natural gas prices spiked and already-challenged supply chains were further pressured. The benchmark MSCI EAFE Index declined 5.91% while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 6.97%. Large cap equities held up better than small caps with the MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index giving back 8.53%. More importantly  value outperformed growth by substantial margins with the MSCI EAFE Value Index gaining 0.33% for the period while the MSCI EAFE Growth Index declined 11.94%.One of the key drivers of the rotation from growth to value stocks was action in the bond market. A significant rise in long-term bond yields reflected heightened inflationary pressures in the global economy and the outlook for tighter monetary policy. Higher rates are typically a short-term headwind to long-duration assets such as growth stocks. And while  in the longer run  high-quality growth stocks can typically pass on inflation  the sudden and sharp spike in bond yields puts pressure on near-term valuations.Exhibit 1: MSCI Growth vs. Value PerformanceThere has been a lot of debate about whether inflation is as permanent post-COVID. A certain amount of inventory restocking was needed to cure supply chain disruptions impacted by frictional costs and labor shortages. Manufacturing finally seemed to have found its footing and ports were reopening. China  the world’s largest consumer of commodity goods  has been easing economic policies for some time to tackle a broad real estate problem and navigate further COVID-19 lockdowns continuing to slow its economy. These actions should have ameliorated significant commodity pressures -- until war broke out. Coupled with the potential for Russia to now control significant parts of the food supply output and other key materials and minerals  the calculus shifted overnight.Under these conditions  the ClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy underperformed its core MSCI EAFE Index benchmark. This is to be expected but doesn’t mean we are satisfied with the results. Our observation is that in these types of markets  the Strategy tends to underperform until more balance is achieved in the market between growth and value. Simplistically  the index is a blend of both value and growth stocks. However  similar to the first quarter of 2021 (Exhibit 1) — when the value component outperformed so meaningfully — it remains tilted to whatever is doing the best  and this quarter it was value. In virtually every sector  the stocks we identify most as value did the best.On a sector and industry basis  energy (+16.98%)  materials (+3.30%) and defense (+4.63%)  given the invasion impact  did well. We evaluate and own these types of stocks within our structural bucket if we believe they will see a step change in forward returns at attractive valuations. We began to buy energy last year and that has worked well for the portfolio more recently. While the structural bucket is a component of our diversified approach to growth  the portfolio also remains invested in growth companies with a significant overweight to information technology (IT); these names underperformed in a narrow  one- sided value market.Europe and the U.K.  which represent the Strategy’s largest regional exposures  were a microcosm of these cross currents. Early in the first quarter  economies were still influenced by COVID-19  but a peak in cases was in sight and reopening was underway. Markets played the improvements  rates moved moderately  consumer spending picked up and services like travel recovered from depressed levels. War in Ukraine changed the picture dramatically. Inflation picked up even further  driven by higher natural gas  oil and agricultural commodity prices  which will be passed on to the consumer. Germany's inflation passed the 7% level last seen after the 1990 reunification. The war has caused manufacturing and consumer sentiment to plunge.While natural gas is still flowing from Russia to Europe  there are discussions that could change this. Germany  a massive importer of oil and gas  is currently in Stage 1 monitoring of energy usage and asking customers to monitor usage. A serious reduction or complete shut off of Russian gas could lead to a recession in Europe  which is the growing consensus view. We don’t agree  however  as we believe Europe has the support structures and spending capacity to keep the incipient post-COVID-19 recovery intact. The telltale signs of recession  such as European credit spreads widening  have not happened.Positively  the urgency of energy security has accelerated spending on renewable energy. The EU commission has proposed a new measure regarding energy security and plans to reduce European dependence on Russian natural gas. REPowerEU emphasizes two pillars in order to reduce reliance on Russian gas and drive resilience: diversifying gas supplies  mostly via higher liquified natural gas imports; and more rapidly reducing fossil fuel use by boosting energy efficiency while increasing renewables and electrification. Many wind and solar projects will accelerate with easier permitting and financing.The Strategy is well-exposed to this secular shift and to accelerated spending on alternative energy sourcing and generation. Growth in renewables should benefit EDP (OTCMKTS:EDRVF)  an operator of wind farms for power generation  and SolarEdge (SEDG)  a company we repurchased on weakness in the first quarter that develops electronics for solar installations and should take advantage of greater incentives for solar installations in many geographies. The company has expanded its products offering to address larger markets in commercial and utility solar on top of its traditional residential solar market. The acceleration in electrification of transport should support electric vehicle-related stocks like TE Connectivity (TEL) and Nidec (OTCMKTS:NJDCY). In addition  industrial manufacturer Atlas Copco (OTCMKTS:ATLKY) should benefit from demand for greater efficiency in mid-voltage applications such as energy- efficient compressors.The conflict could also boost the trend toward reshoring or near- shoring supply chains and production. Market worries about China’s intentions toward Taiwan  which could alter the global balance of power in semiconductors  have hastened the near- shoring of semi production globally. Such growing risks are hastening the need to build new capacity in Eastern Europe  Canada and Mexico  and they should result in a positive  multiyear  capex-heavy trend for Western companies. Such a transition would most directly benefit the Strategy’s structural growth companies  a bucket we have been increasing (and that now accounts for more than 40% of portfolio assets) to better manage the volatile risk/reward environment in international markets.Portfolio PositioningWe initiated a position in exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (OTCMKTS: BOEY)  a company with higher rate sensitivity and a higher orientation toward financial data. It operates a fund administration business with recurring revenues that have allowed these non-transaction divisions to do well. We also added Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM)  which should benefit from a consolidating bank market and higher rates as Canada catches up with the U.S. in terms of reopening and GDP growth recovery.These recent adds complement our financials exposure in Europe. While sensitive to the macro environment  European banks have already taken a serious hit and trade at levels implying stagflation or a technical recession. Higher rates will help the banks and their capital levels are high across the entire sector. Provisioning reserve releases are unlikely from here and perhaps faster buildup is needed again for future losses in the years to come  but we believe these headwinds are already priced in.Also within the structural bucket  we have selectively added to our commodity exposure with the purchases of Suncor Energy (SU) and Barrick Gold (GOLD). Suncor  a past holding  is a Canadian integrated oil company where we capitalized on attractive valuation due to a COVID-19-induced slowdown. We expect recovery in oil demand and strong pricing will result in faster than expected free cash flow growth and financial deleveraging. Canadian mining company Barrick Gold is a play on operating improvements. The company has aggressively delevered its balance sheet and reduced capex spending to a lower level more permanently  directing its healthy free cash flow to dividends and buybacks.The structural bucket has the shortest investment horizon across the spectrum of growth companies we target in the Strategy. We closely monitor the macro impacts and turnaround progress of these companies and will be disciplined sellers when the thesis for a holding plays out.Most of our selling over the last several quarters has occurred among emerging growth companies  where we have reduced our exposure to under 5% to better manage risk. Exits from the emerging growth bucket in the quarter included ending our multiyear ownership of Shopify (SHOP) as e-commerce acceleration drove the valuation close to our target price. The Canadian company  which we originally purchased in mid-2018 as merchants began to adopt its digital commerce enablement tools  has also embarked on more capital-intensive projects in logistics that are increasing its risk profile. We sold our remaining position in Sea Ltd. (SE) after the company issued below- consensus guidance due to a slowdown in its gaming business coupled with a second miss in its e-commerce business due to the pull-forward effects of the pandemic and continued difficult comps. Latin America e-commerce platform MercadoLibre (MELI) has also experienced an unwind of COVID-19-induced demand while high inflation and high interest rates in Brazil create new headwinds for consumer purchasing power  which will likely mean slower sales of high-ticket items on the company’s platform and led to the sale of the position.Most of our reductions in emerging growth have involved IT or related companies where innovation is a key to their business model. That said  we remain positive on the IT sector and have largely maintained holdings in our highest-conviction ideas.During the quarter  we reduced our semiconductor exposure through the sale of Tokyo Electron (OTCMKTS:TOELY) and a trim of ASML (ASML) to manage concerns of a slowdown due to the risk of double ordering and potential softness in some consumer end markets. We increased our position in IT services as we remain optimistic about the long- term growth potential these companies provide  which is underpinned by the compressed digital transformation cycle  rising cloud adoption and growth in data-driven insights. This included initiating a small position in French design software firm Dassault Systèmes (DSY).Despite the market volatility and hyper focus on rising rates  chief information officer surveys continue to forecast resilience in IT budgets this year. Growth in IT spending for 2022 is expected to remain above the 10-year pre-COVID-19 average  according to Morgan Stanley. We believe this is a result of the strong secular underpinnings brought on by digital transformation and businesses focusing on increasing efficiencies through technology.New addition Olympus (OTCMKTS:OCPNY)  a Japanese precision equipment and medical device maker  is a good example. The company is the number one player in gastrointestinal endoscopy with 70% market share with an entrenched moat. Its therapeutic solutions division should continue to scale with new product investments in high-growth areas  coupled with improvement in procedural volumes from COVID-19 recovery. We are also seeing progress in a restructuring plan that will create a streamlined global medical technology company with improving profitability and a reliable governance structure.OutlookWe continue to invest for the long term and are willing to endure volatility as long as our secular thesis for owning a company has not been impacted. The post-COVID-19 hangover for our emerging growth bucket has been very tough  but we understand the risks  have culled the portfolio of several challenged stocks and see a way back for disruptive growth names.From a regional standpoint  we continue to see promise in Europe and are increasing our exposure to regions like Canada through companies well-suited for developing trends around energy security and supply chains. While headline inflation remains high across Europe  the region does not face the same wage pressures as the U.S.  which could temper the increasing hawkish stance of policymakers once the Ukraine situation becomes more settled.Without question  higher energy and agricultural commodity prices creates new challenges for emerging markets  where we greatly reduced exposure in 2021. We expect continued volatility around both economic performance and political change to remain a feature of these markets.Heightened levels of uncertainty remain across international markets. In Asia  COVID-19 has become a significant risk again  not only in mainland China but also markets where Chinese tourists drive retail spending like Japan and Europe. Currencies are also in flux  with the yen  typically a port in the storm  the worst-performing developed market currency for the quarter. We believe our risk-aware approach to growth investing  emphasizing quality companies with pricing power  can provide balance as the global economy continues to work through these myriad uncertainties. It has been well-documented how tightening cycles hurt long-duration growth assets. As the Bank of England moves ahead with further tightening similar to the U.S. Fed and the ECB contemplates its own monetary actions  it is also worth noting that growth equities tend to outperform value once a tightening cycle is underway (Exhibit 2).Exhibit 2: Growth Leads Out of Tightening CyclesPortfolio HighlightsDuring the first quarter  the ClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy underperformed its MSCI EAFE Index benchmark. The Strategy had losses across nine of the 10 sectors in which it was invested (out of 11 total)  driven by the subsector and stock- specific allocations toward growth areas versus the benchmark. IT  health care and industrials sectors were the primary detractors while the energy sector was the sole contributor.On a relative basis  overall stock selection and sector allocation detracted from performance. An overweight to the IT sector was the primary detractor  and we continue to work down this overweight.Stock selection in the materials sector  hurt by our lack of metals and mining stocks  also had a negative impact on results  as did selection in health care  where an underweight to large cap pharma names and overweight in life science/tools company and more consistently growing medtech names proved detrimental. Stock selection in industrials was hurt by an overweight to machinery and underweight to defense. Within financials  our underweight to banks was a primary detractor with markets such as Japan and Australia outperforming Europe. On the positive side  stock selection in energy and an underweight to the consumer discretionary sector aided performance.On a regional basis  stock selection in Europe Ex U.K.  Japan and the U.K. and an underweight to Asia Ex Japan  primarily Australia with its large components of both mining and bank stocks  detracted the most from performance.On an individual stock basis  the largest contributors to absolute returns in the quarter included Schlumberger (SLB)  Canadian Pacific Railway (CP)  Novo Nordisk (NVO)  London Stock Exchange (OTCMKTS:LDNXF) and Monotaro (OTCMKTS:MONOY). The greatest detractors from absolute returns included positions in Recruit Holdings (OTCMKTS:RCRUY)  Keyence (OTCMKTS:KYCCF)  TE Connectivity  ICON (ICON) and Atlas Copco.In addition to the transactions mentioned above  we sold KBC Group (OTCMKTS:KBCSY) in the financials sector and Temenos (OTCMKTS:TMSNY) in the IT sector  while trimming Ocado Group (OTCMKTS:OCDGF) in the consumer discretionary.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.17,0.16,0.67,True,English,"['ClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy Portfolio Manager Commentary', 'core MSCI EAFE Index benchmark', 'narrow, one- sided value market', 'MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index', 'ClearBridge International Growth EAFE Strategy', 'benchmark MSCI EAFE Index', 'broad real estate problem', 'Getty Images Market Overview', 'MSCI EAFE Growth Index', 'MSCI EAFE Value Index', 'MSCI Emerging Markets Index', 'challenged supply chains', 'Large cap equities', 'heightened inflationary pressures', 'tighter monetary policy', 'supply chain disruptions', 'food supply output', 'complete shut off', 'growing consensus view', 'incipient post-COVID-19 recovery', 'agricultural commodity prices', 'largest regional exposures', 'European credit spreads', 'natural gas prices', 'potential monetary tightening', 'significant commodity pressures', 'long-term bond yields', 'higher natural gas', 'Russian natural gas', 'other key materials', 'high-quality growth stocks', 'MSCI Growth', 'International equities', 'small caps', 'bond market', 'Russian gas', 'commodity goods', 'large geographies', 'key drivers', 'European dependence', 'significant rise', 'largest consumer', 'significant parts', 'significant overweight', 'growth companies', 'numerous risks', 'substantial margins', 'Higher rates', 'short-term headwind', 'long-duration assets', 'longer run', 'sharp spike', 'near-term valuations', 'Value Performance', 'inventory restocking', 'frictional costs', 'labor shortages', 'economic policies', 'COVID-19 lockdowns', 'industry basis', 'structural bucket', 'step change', 'forward returns', 'attractive valuations', 'diversified approach', 'information technology', 'U.K.', 'cross currents', 'depressed levels', 'massive importer', 'Stage 1 monitoring', 'serious reduction', 'support structures', 'telltale signs', 'EU commission', 'new measure', 'value stocks', 'first quarter', 'consumer sentiment', 'spending capacity', 'energy security', 'renewable energy', 'COVID-19 cases', 'global economy', 'value component', 'invasion impact', 'consumer spending', 'crude oil', 'energy usage', 'Petmal', 'iStock', 'China', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'conflict', 'period', 'rotation', 'action', 'outlook', 'sudden', 'Exhibit', 'lot', 'debate', 'amount', 'Manufacturing', 'footing', 'ports', 'world', 'minerals', 'calculus', 'conditions', 'results', 'observation', 'types', 'balance', 'blend', 'sector', 'defense', 'portfolio', 'names', 'microcosm', 'economies', 'peak', 'sight', 'reopening', 'improvements', 'services', 'travel', 'picture', 'Germany', '7% level', '1990 reunification', 'discussions', 'customers', 'recession', 'urgency', 'plans']",2022-04-14,2022-04-14,seekingalpha.com

Forty-one percent of those investors intend to increase their allocations to the space in the coming six months.German magazine Capital first reported in December that the country’s savings banks  which hold more than 1 trillion euros  were looking to offer a wallet to trade cryptocurrency. The Coincub report called the decision a “groundbreaking” development that signals higher institutional acceptance of crypto.German stock market operator Deutsche Boerse has also listed more than 20 crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) on its digital exchange  Xetra  over the past few months. Fund issuers such as WisdomTree  CoinShares and 21Shares have all listed products in the country recently.Singapore  which previously ranked number one  dropped to second due to government decisions to restrict crypto services advertising and a clampdown on bitcoin ATMs  according to Coincub.The United States ranked third among crypto-friendly countries due in part to its decision to seek clearer crypto regulation  the report noted.President Joe Biden signed an executive order urging government agencies to work together to study the “responsible development” of digital assets. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen echoed those calls in a discussion that MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor called “probably the single-most important speech of the 21st century.”The US also ranked first in mining as the country accounts for about 35% of global hashrate — ahead of second-place Kazakhstan  which totals about 18%.The United Arab Emirates  which ranked 22  was a new addition to the list following its recent plans to become one of the world’s crypto hotspots.Dubai last month revealed its first cryptocurrency legislation overseen by a new regulatory agency  and the emirate has recently granted licenses to crypto exchanges FTX and Binance to operate there.China remained at the list’s bottom following its widespread ban on trading and mining crypto.Get the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your inbox every evening.

2937,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4501356-clearbridge-international-growth-adr-strategy-portfolio-manager-commentary-q1-2022,ClearBridge International Growth ADR Strategy Portfolio Manager Commentary Q1 2022,12 hours ago,wildpixel/iStock via Getty ImagesMarket OverviewInternational equities were faced with numerous risks in the first quarter  ranging from resurging COVID-19 cases in large geographies like China to inflation and potential monetary tightening globally  before Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on February 24 overshadowed all else. Europe was most directly impacted by the conflict as crude oil and natural gas prices spiked and already-challenged supply chains were further pressured. The benchmark MSCI EAFE Index declined 5.91% while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 6.97%. Large cap equities held up better than small caps with the MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index giving back 8.53%. More importantly  value outperformed growth by substantial margins with the MSCI EAFE Value Index gaining 0.33% for the period while the MSCI EAFE Growth Index declined 11.94%.One of the key drivers of the rotation from growth to value stocks was action in the bond market. A significant rise in long-term bond yields reflected heightened inflationary pressures in the global economy and the outlook for tighter monetary policy. Higher rates are typically a short-term headwind to long-duration assets such as growth stocks. And while  in the longer run  high-quality growth stocks can typically pass on inflation  the sudden and sharp spike in bond yields puts pressure on near-term valuations.Exhibit 1: MSCI Growth vs. Value PerformanceThere has been a lot of debate about whether inflation is as permanent post-COVID. A certain amount of inventory restocking was needed to cure supply chain disruptions impacted by frictional costs and labor shortages. Manufacturing finally seemed to have found its footing and ports were reopening. China  the world’s largest consumer of commodity goods  has been easing economic policies for some time to tackle a broad real estate problem and navigate further COVID-19 lockdowns continuing to slow its economy. These actions should have ameliorated significant commodity pressures -- until war broke out. Coupled with the potential for Russia to now control significant parts of the food supply output and other key materials and minerals  the calculus shifted overnight.Under these conditions  the ClearBridge International Growth ADR Strategy underperformed its core MSCI EAFE Index benchmark. This is to be expected but doesn’t mean we are satisfied with the results. Our observation is that in these types of markets  the Strategy tends to underperform until more balance is achieved in the market between growth and value. Simplistically  the index is a blend of both value and growth stocks. However  similar to the first quarter of 2021 (Exhibit 1) — when the value component outperformed so meaningfully — it remains tilted to whatever is doing the best  and this quarter it was value. In virtually every sector  the stocks we identify most as value did the best.On a sector and industry basis  energy (+16.98%)  materials (+3.30%) and defense (+4.63%)  given the invasion impact  did well. We evaluate and own these types of stocks within our structural bucket if we believe they will see a step change in forward returns at attractive valuations. We began to buy energy last year and that has worked well for the portfolio more recently. While the structural bucket is a component of our diversified approach to growth  the portfolio also remains invested in growth companies with a significant overweight to information technology (IT); these names underperformed in a narrow  one- sided value market.Europe and the U.K.  which represent the Strategy’s largest regional exposures  were a microcosm of these cross currents. Early in the first quarter  economies were still influenced by COVID-19  but a peak in cases was in sight and reopening was underway. Markets played the improvements  rates moved moderately  consumer spending picked up and services like travel recovered from depressed levels. War in Ukraine changed the picture dramatically. Inflation picked up even further  driven by higher natural gas  oil and agricultural commodity prices  which will be passed on to the consumer. Germany's inflation passed the 7% level last seen after the 1990 reunification. The war has caused manufacturing and consumer sentiment to plunge.While natural gas is still flowing from Russia to Europe  there are discussions that could change this. Germany  a massive importer of oil and gas  is currently in Stage 1 monitoring of energy usage and asking customers to monitor usage. A serious reduction or complete shut off of Russian gas could lead to a recession in Europe  which is the growing consensus view. We don’t agree  however  as we believe Europe has the support structures and spending capacity to keep the incipient post-COVID-19 recovery intact. The telltale signs of recession  such as European credit spreads widening  have not happened.Positively  the urgency of energy security has accelerated spending on renewable energy. The EU commission has proposed a new measure regarding energy security and plans to reduce European dependence on Russian natural gas. REPowerEU emphasizes two pillars in order to reduce reliance on Russian gas and drive resilience: diversifying gas supplies  mostly via higher liquified natural gas imports; and more rapidly reducing fossil fuel use by boosting energy efficiency while increasing renewables and electrification. Many wind and solar projects will accelerate with easier permitting and financing.The Strategy is well-exposed to this secular shift and to accelerated spending on alternative energy sourcing and generation. Growth in renewables should benefit EDP (OTCMKTS:EDRVF)  an operator of wind farms for power generation  and SolarEdge (SEDG)  a company we repurchased on weakness in the first quarter that develops electronics for solar installations and should take advantage of greater incentives for solar installations in many geographies. The company has expanded its products offering to address larger markets in commercial and utility solar on top of its traditional residential solar market. The acceleration in electrification of transport should support electric vehicle-related stocks like TE Connectivity (TEL) and Nidec (OTCMKTS:NJDCY). In addition  industrial manufacturers Legrand (OTCMKTS:LGRDY) and Atlas Copco (OTCMKTS:ATLCY) should benefit from demand for greater efficiency in mid-voltage applications such as energy-efficient compressors.The conflict could also boost the trend toward reshoring or near- shoring supply chains and production. Market worries about China’s intentions toward Taiwan  which could alter the global balance of power in semiconductors  have hastened the near- shoring of semi production globally. Such growing risks are hastening the need to build new capacity in Eastern Europe  Canada and Mexico  and they should result in a positive  multiyear  capex-heavy trend for Western companies. Such a transition would most directly benefit the Strategy’s structural growth companies  a bucket we have been increasing (and that now accounts for more than 40% of portfolio assets) to better manage the volatile risk/reward environment in international markets.Portfolio PositioningWe initiated a position in exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (OTCMKTS:DBOEY)  a company with higher rate sensitivity and a higher orientation toward financial data. It operates a fund administration business with recurring revenues that have allowed these non-transaction divisions to do well.The purchase complements our financials exposure in Europe. While sensitive to the macro environment  European banks have already taken a serious hit and trade at levels implying stagflation or a technical recession. Higher rates will help the banks and their capital levels are high across the entire sector. Provisioning reserve releases are unlikely from here and perhaps faster buildup is needed again for future losses in the years to come  but we believe these headwinds are already priced in.Also within the structural bucket  we added to our commodity exposure with the purchase of Suncor Energy (SU). Suncor  a past holding  is a Canadian integrated oil company where we capitalized on attractive valuation due to a COVID-19-induced slowdown. We expect recovery in oil demand and strong pricing will result in faster than expected free cash flow growth and financial deleveraging.The structural bucket has the shortest investment horizon across the spectrum of growth companies we target in the Strategy. We closely monitor the macro impacts and turnaround progress of these companies and will be disciplined sellers when the thesis for a holding plays out.Most of our selling over the last several quarters has occurred among emerging growth companies  where we have reduced our exposure to under 5% to better manage risk. Exits from the emerging growth bucket in the quarter included Sea Ltd. (SE) after the company issued below-consensus guidance due to a slowdown in its gaming business coupled with a second miss in its e-commerce business due to the pull-forward effects of the pandemic and continued difficult comps. We also trimmed back workflow software maker Atlassian (TEAM) after a strong runup in its shares in 2021.Most of our reductions in emerging growth have involved IT or related companies where innovation is a key to their business model. That said  we remain positive on the IT sector and have largely maintained holdings in our highest-conviction ideas.During the quarter  we reduced our semiconductor exposure through the sale of Tokyo Electron (OTCMKTS:TOELY) and a trim of ASML (ASML) to manage concerns of a slowdown due to the risk of double ordering and potential softness in some consumer end markets. We increased our position in IT services with the purchase of Accenture as we remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential these companies provide  which is underpinned by the compressed digital transformation cycle  rising cloud adoption and growth in data-driven insights.Despite the market volatility and hyper focus on rising rates  chief information officer surveys continue to forecast resilience in IT budgets this year. Growth in IT spending for 2022 is expected to remain above the 10-year pre-COVID-19 average  according to Morgan Stanley. We believe this is a result of the strong secular underpinnings brought on by digital transformation and businesses focusing on increasing efficiencies through technology.New addition Olympus (OTCMKTS:OCPNY)  a Japanese precision equipment and medical device maker  is a good example. The company is the number one player in gastrointestinal endoscopy with 70% market share with an entrenched moat. Its therapeutic solutions division should continue to scale with new product investments in high-growth areas  coupled with improvement in procedural volumes from COVID-19 recovery. We are also seeing progress in a restructuring plan that will create a streamlined global medical technology company with improving profitability and a reliable governance structure.OutlookWe continue to invest for the long term and are willing to endure volatility as long as our secular thesis for owning a company has not been impacted. The post-COVID-19 hangover for our emerging growth bucket has been very tough  but we understand the risks  have culled the portfolio of several challenged stocks and see a way back for disruptive growth names.From a regional standpoint  we continue to see promise in Europe and are increasing our exposure to regions like Canada through companies well-suited for developing trends around energy security and supply chains. While headline inflation remains high across Europe  the region does not face the same wage pressures as the U.S.  which could temper the increasing hawkish stance of policymakers once the Ukraine situation becomes more settled. Without question  higher energy and agricultural commodity prices creates new challenges for emerging markets  where we greatly reduced exposure in 2021. We expect continued volatility around both economic performance and political change to remain a feature of these markets.Heightened levels of uncertainty remain across international markets. In Asia  COVID-19 has become a significant risk again  not only in mainland China but also markets where Chinese tourists drive retail spending like Japan and Europe. Currencies are also in flux  with the yen  typically a port in the storm  the worst-performing developed market currency for the quarter. We believe our risk-aware approach to growth investing  emphasizing quality companies with pricing power  can provide balance as the global economy continues to work through these myriad uncertainties. It has been well-documented how tightening cycles hurt long-duration growth assets. As the Bank of England moves ahead with further tightening similar to the U.S. Fed and the ECB contemplates its own monetary actions  it is also worth noting that growth equities tend to outperform value once a tightening cycle is underway (Exhibit 2).Exhibit 2: Growth Leads Out of Tightening CyclesPortfolio HighlightsDuring the first quarter  the ClearBridge International Growth ADR Strategy underperformed its MSCI EAFE Index benchmark. The Strategy had losses across nine of the 10 sectors in which it was invested (out of 11 total)  driven by the subsector and stock- specific allocations toward growth areas versus the benchmark.The IT  industrials  health care and consumer discretionary sectors were the primary detractors while the energy sector was the sole contributor.On a relative basis  overall stock selection and sector allocation detracted from performance. An overweight to the IT sector was the primary detractor  and we continue to work down this overweight.Stock selection in the materials sector  hurt by our lack of metals and mining stocks  also had a negative impact on results  as did selection in health care  where an underweight to large cap pharma names and overweight in life science/tools company and more consistently growing medtech names proved detrimental. Stock selection in industrials was hurt by an overweight to machinery and underweight to defense. Within financials  our underweight to banks was a primary detractor with markets such as Japan and Australia outperforming Europe. On the positive side  stock selection in energy aided performance.On a regional basis  stock selection in Europe Ex U.K.  Japan and the U.K. and an underweight to Asia Ex Japan  primarily Australia with its large components of both mining and bank stocks  detracted the most from performance.On an individual stock basis  the largest contributors to absolute returns in the quarter included Schlumberger (SLB)  Canadian Pacific Railway (CP)  London Stock Exchange (OTCMKTS:LDNXF)  MonotaRO (OTCMKTS:MONOY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). The greatest detractors from absolute returns included positions in Recruit Holdings (OTCMKTS:RCRUY)  ICON (ICLR)  Atlas Copco  Hoya (OTCMKTS:HOCPY) and TE Connectivity.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.17,0.16,0.67,True,English,"['ClearBridge International Growth ADR Strategy Portfolio Manager Commentary', 'core MSCI EAFE Index benchmark', 'narrow, one- sided value market', 'MSCI EAFE Small Cap Index', 'ClearBridge International Growth ADR Strategy', 'benchmark MSCI EAFE Index', 'broad real estate problem', 'Getty Images Market Overview', 'MSCI EAFE Growth Index', 'MSCI EAFE Value Index', 'MSCI Emerging Markets Index', 'challenged supply chains', 'Large cap equities', 'heightened inflationary pressures', 'tighter monetary policy', 'supply chain disruptions', 'food supply output', 'complete shut off', 'growing consensus view', 'incipient post-COVID-19 recovery', 'agricultural commodity prices', 'largest regional exposures', 'European credit spreads', 'natural gas prices', 'potential monetary tightening', 'significant commodity pressures', 'long-term bond yields', 'higher natural gas', 'Russian natural gas', 'other key materials', 'high-quality growth stocks', 'MSCI Growth', 'International equities', 'small caps', 'bond market', 'Russian gas', 'commodity goods', 'large geographies', 'key drivers', 'European dependence', 'significant rise', 'largest consumer', 'significant parts', 'significant overweight', 'growth companies', 'numerous risks', 'substantial margins', 'Higher rates', 'short-term headwind', 'long-duration assets', 'longer run', 'sharp spike', 'near-term valuations', 'Value Performance', 'inventory restocking', 'frictional costs', 'labor shortages', 'economic policies', 'COVID-19 lockdowns', 'industry basis', 'structural bucket', 'step change', 'forward returns', 'attractive valuations', 'diversified approach', 'information technology', 'U.K.', 'cross currents', 'depressed levels', 'massive importer', 'Stage 1 monitoring', 'serious reduction', 'support structures', 'telltale signs', 'EU commission', 'new measure', 'value stocks', 'first quarter', 'consumer sentiment', 'spending capacity', 'energy security', 'renewable energy', 'COVID-19 cases', 'global economy', 'value component', 'invasion impact', 'consumer spending', 'crude oil', 'energy usage', 'wildpixel', 'iStock', 'China', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'conflict', 'period', 'rotation', 'action', 'outlook', 'sudden', 'Exhibit', 'lot', 'debate', 'amount', 'Manufacturing', 'footing', 'ports', 'world', 'minerals', 'calculus', 'conditions', 'results', 'observation', 'types', 'balance', 'blend', 'sector', 'defense', 'portfolio', 'names', 'microcosm', 'economies', 'peak', 'sight', 'reopening', 'improvements', 'services', 'travel', 'picture', 'Germany', '7% level', '1990 reunification', 'discussions', 'customers', 'recession', 'urgency', 'plans']",2022-04-14,2022-04-14,seekingalpha.com

On September 11  2014  the Company announced that the South African Department of Mineral Resources had granted a Mining Right for the Krone-Endora at Venetia Project encompassing 657.71 hectares of the Project's total area of 5 888 hectares. The Company has also submitted an application for a mining right over the remaining areas of the Project. The deposits which occur on the properties of Krone and Endora have been identified as a higher-grade ""Alluvial"" basal deposit which is covered by a lower-grade upper ""Eluvial"" deposit. The deposits are proposed to be the result of the direct-shift (in respect to the ""Eluvial"" deposit) and erosion (in respect to the ""Alluvial"" deposit) of material from the higher grounds of the adjacent Venetia Kimberlite areas. The deposits on Krone-Endora occur in two layers with a maximum total depth of approximately 15.0 metres from surface to bedrock  allowing for a very low-cost mining operation to be employed with the potential for near-term diamond production from a known high-quality source. Krone-Endora also benefits from the significant development of infrastructure and services already in place due to its location directly adjacent to the Venetia Mine.Qualified Person Statement:Mr. James P.

2950,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/press-release-positive-phase-1-050000699.html,Press Release: Positive Phase 1/2 study results of rilzabrutinib in people with immune thrombocytopenia published in The New England Journal of Medicine,Positive Phase 1/2 study results of rilzabrutinib in people with immune thrombocytopenia published in The New England Journal of Medicine Results published...,Sanofi - Aventis GroupePositive Phase 1/2 study results of rilzabrutinib in people with immune thrombocytopenia published in The New England Journal of MedicineResults published today in the New England Journal of Medicine showed that treatment with rilzabrutinib resulted in a rapid and durable increase in platelet count in patients with heavily pretreated immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)Data support an acceptable safety profileRilzabrutinib is an investigational oral Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitor (BTKi) for the treatment of ITP  a rare acquired autoimmune disorder in which platelets are destroyed or damaged and for which there are limited treatment optionsPARIS – April 14  2022 - Positive results from the Phase 1/2 dose-finding study evaluating the safety  pharmacokinetics and clinical activity of rilzabrutinib  an investigational oral Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor  in adults with heavily pre-treated immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Results demonstrate treatment with rilzabrutinib led to a rapid and durable increase in platelet count and support an acceptable safety profile. Sanofi is investigating the safety and efficacy of twice daily rilzabrutinib (400 mg) for adults and adolescents with chronic ITP in the ongoing Phase 3 clinical study LUNA 3  initiated in April 2021.David Kuter  M.D.Director of clinical hematology at Massachusetts General Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School  lead author of the study“Currently  there are no standard treatment recommendations for ITP patients with multiple relapses. Despite advances in treatment options over the years  some patients remain refractory to existing therapies and durable remission remains elusive. The Bruton’s tyrosine kinase is a critical signaling molecule in the immune system that is involved in certain immune-mediated diseases  and our research suggests that targeting BTK may represent a promising approach to addressing the underlying cause of ITP.”Story continuesITP is an acquired autoimmune blood disorder characterized by low platelet count (thrombocytopenia) resulting from immune-mediated platelet destruction and impairment of platelet production. A decrease in platelet counts – whether temporary or persistent – can predispose a person to a higher risk of bleeding  hospitalization  fatigue  impaired quality of life  and even death. The incidence of ITP increases with age and is more common over the age of 60.Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.Global Head of Clinical Development and Chief Medical Officer  Sanofi“We are pleased to share these encouraging early clinical results through this publication. These findings demonstrate a clinically meaningful response in difficult-to-treat ITP patients who received a median of four prior ITP therapies. Moreover  the overall study population  which also included less refractory patients  showed a numerically higher response. Rilzabrutinib could become a first-in-class BTK inhibitor therapy with the potential to increase platelet counts quickly and durably for people with ITP.”Rilzabrutinib was granted Fast Track Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of ITP in November of 2020 and was previously granted orphan drug designation. Rilzabrutinib is being investigated in multiple clinical trials across a range of diseases including immunological and inflammatory diseases.Phase 1/2 Study ResultsThe global Phase 1/2 adaptive  open-label  dose-finding study evaluated rilzabrutinib in 60 people with ITP with a median age of 50 years (range  19-74). Patients had received a median of four different ITP therapies previously. Initial doses could be 200 mg once daily  400 mg once daily  300 mg twice daily (600 mg/day)  or 400 mg twice daily (800 mg/day). The median platelet counts at the start of the study were 15×109/L  indicating a very low platelet count and high risk of bleeding. The primary endpoint measured the number of participants who achieved at least two consecutive platelet counts of ≥50×109/L and an overall platelet count increase of ≥20×109/L from the start of treatment without requiring rescue medication.Study results showed:Overall  24 of 60 people enrolled in the study at any dose achieved the primary endpoint. Of the 45 people who initiated rilzabrutinib at 400 mg twice daily  18 met the primary endpoint.Median time to first platelet count of at least 50×10 9 /L was rapid at 11.5 days  which was maintained in patients with primary platelet response for a mean of 65% of weeks during the 24-week treatment period.52% of participants experienced at least one treatment related adverse event  all of which were grade 1 or 2; the most common adverse events were diarrhea (32%)  nausea (30%)  and fatigue (10%).There were no grade 3 or higher treatment-related adverse events or serious adverse events.Rilzabrutinib Clinical ProgramThe safety and efficacy of rilzabrutinib in ITP are being evaluated in the ongoing randomized  double-blind  Phase 3 LUNA 3 study in adults and adolescents (aged ≥12 years) with persistent/chronic ITP. In addition  phase 2 studies are ongoing to evaluate rilzabrutinib as a potential therapy for the autoimmune condition IgG4 disease and immunological diseases  including asthma  atopic dermatitis  chronic spontaneous urticaria and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.About RilzabrutinibRilzabrutinib is an oral Bruton’s tyrosine kinase inhibitor incorporating Sanofi’s TAILORED COVALENCY® technology being investigated for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases  including ITP. BTK is an intracellular signaling molecule involved in innate and adaptive immune responses related to certain immune-mediated diseases. By inhibiting BTK  rilzabrutinib has the potential to target the underlying disease pathogenesis.Rilzabrutinib is currently under clinical investigation and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

While this should have led the Groupe to upgrade its expectations for 2022 organic growth  the global health situation  the evolution of the conflict in Ukraine  and the consequences of inflation for the clients  create too much uncertainty to do so at this stage.Thanks to the strength of its model  Publicis is confident in its ability to deliver on all of the 2022 targets set at its full year 2021 earnings  with organic growth now at the upper-end of its previous +4 to +5% range. This guidance takes into account a strong Q1 and an expected very solid Q2 at around +5% organic  after +17.1% in Q2 2021. The Groupe confirms its 2022 guidance of circa 17.5% operating margin rate and circa 1.4 billion Euros of Free Cash Flow before change in working capital.

Realised ilmenite prices increased for a sixth consecutive quarter and this positive momentum is continuing into Q2 2022.The Board of Directors visited the Moma Mine and the surrounding area in February. A highlight of the visit was inspection of the Rotary Uninterruptible Power Supply (“RUPS”) project  which is currently commissioning. The RUPS is designed to materially improve power stability for the Mineral Separation Plant  reduce operating costs through lower diesel usage  and drive our short-term target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12% by 2024.Production in Q1 2022 was lower than we had expected  impacted by poor weather conditions  as previously mentioned in our 2021 Preliminary Results announcement. However  the weather at the Mine typically improves after Q1  and we maintain production guidance for the year.”OverviewLost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.00 per 200 000 man-hours worked on a 12-month rolling basis (Q1 2021: 0.24)  reflecting zero Lost Time Injuries since 6 January 2021Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production increased 6% in Q1 2022 to 384 700 tonnes (Q1 2021: 361 900 tonnes)  benefitting from a 5% increase in excavated ore tonnes  partially offset by a 3% decrease in ore gradesIlmenite production decreased 7% in Q1 2022 to 256 800 tonnes (Q1 2021: 275 100) and primary zircon production decreased 3% to 12 900 tonnes (Q1 2021: 13 300 tonnes) due primarily to a 5% decrease in HMC processedRutile production increased 5% to 2 000 tonnes (Q1 2021: 1 900 tonnes)  benefitting from higher recoveries  while concentrates production increased 20% to 10 700 tonnes (Q1 2021: 8 900 tonnes) due to the processing of stockpiled spillage materialTotal shipments of finished products decreased 33% in Q1 2022 to 231 500 tonnes (Q1 2021: 344 400 tonnes)  impacted by poor weather conditions and customer-chartered vessel delays due to tight shipping marketsThe markets for all of Kenmare’s products remain strong  with further price increases received in Q1 2022 for the sixth consecutive quarterFull year guidance is maintained on all stated metricsStory continuesOperations updateOperational results from the Moma Mine in Q1 2022 were as follows:Q1 2022 Q1 2021 Variance Q4 2021 Variance tonnes tonnes % tonnes % Excavated ore1 9 391 000 8 955 000 5% 9 306 000 1% Grade1 4.49% 4.64% -3% 4.31% 4% Production HMC production 384 700 361 900 6% 343 900 12% HMC processed 373 300 391 200 -5% 353 400 6% Ilmenite 256 800 275 100 -7% 246 000 4% Primary zircon 12 900 13 300 -3% 12 400 4% Rutile 2 000 1 900 5% 2 100 -5% Concentrates2 10 700 8 900 20% 11 300 -5% Shipments 231 500 344 400 -33% 368 600 -37%1. Excavated ore and grade prior to any floor losses.2. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.Kenmare’s strong safety performance was maintained in Q1 2022  with zero Lost Time Injuries during the period. This led to the Company’s lowest ever rolling 12-month LTIFR of 0.00 per 200 000 hours worked (Q1 2021: 0.24) and the achievement of over eight million hours worked without a Lost Time Injury in early March 2022.HMC production was 384 700 tonnes in Q1 2022  representing a 6% increase compared to Q1 2021 (361 900 tonnes)  benefitting from a 5% increase in excavated ore tonnes to 9 391 000 tonnes compared to Q1 2021 (8 995 000 tonnes). Mining operations were impacted by poor weather conditions in Q1 2022  which resulted in lower HMC production than expected. However  in Q1 2021  mining operations were more affected by personnel shortages due to COVID-19  which led to a year-on-year increase in HMC production.The higher volumes of excavated ore were partially offset by a 3% decrease in ore grades to 4.49% in Q1 2022 (Q1 2021: 4.64%). As stated in the Q4 2021 Production Update  ore grades are expected to normalise at around 4.2% in 2022.Production of ilmenite  Kenmare’s primary product  decreased by 7% to 256 800 tonnes in Q1 2022 (Q1 2021: 275 100 tonnes)  due primarily to the 5% reduction in HMC processed. Primary zircon production decreased by 3% to 12 900 tonnes (Q1 2021: 13 300 tonnes)  which was also impacted by the reduced HMC processed  but partially offset by the processing of stockpiled spillage material in Q1 2022.Rutile production was up 5% in Q1 2022 to 2 000 tonnes (Q1 2021: 1 900 tonnes) due to recovery improvements that more than offset the lower HMC processed. Concentrates production increased by 20% to 10 700 tonnes (Q1 2021: 8 900 tonnes)  also benefitting from the processing of stockpiled spillage material in Q1 2022.Shipments decreased by 33% in Q1 2022 to 231 500 tonnes (Q1 2021: 344 400 tonnes)  primarily due to poor weather conditions and the arrival of some customer-chartered vessels being delayed. Shipments in Q1 2022 were comprised of 203 000 tonnes of ilmenite  11 800 tonnes of primary zircon  12 000 tonnes of concentrates and 4 800 tonnes of rutile.One of Kenmare’s two transshipment vessels  the Bronagh J  is due to begin its five-yearly dry dock in early May 2022 for a period of 10 weeks. During this time  Kenmare’s shipping capacity will be significantly reduced. However  there is sufficient capacity to catch up this shortfall when both vessels are operating together again  with finished product inventories expecting to be at normal levels by early 2023.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q1 2022 was 22 900 tonnes  compared with 11 600 tonnes at year-end 2021. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q1 2022 was 139 300 tonnes (Q4 2021: 88 700 tonnes)  which reflects lower shipments than production in Q1 2022.COVID-19 updateAs reported in the Q4 2021 Production Update in mid-January 2022  Kenmare experienced a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in the second half of December 2021. The number of employees in isolation on site following a positive test result rose as high as 326 on 6 January 2022  but quickly reduced.On 12 April 2022 there were no people in isolation in the camp but the high number of employees in isolation during January did affect operations. The business continues to be managed to mitigate the impact and production has continued uninterrupted.Capital projects updateCommissioning of the RUPS commenced in Q1 2022. It is anticipated to deliver benefits in terms of both power stability and operating costs  through reduced usage of diesel generators. It is the primary contributor to Kenmare’s short-term target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12% by 2024.A Pre-Feasibility Study in preparation for mining the Nataka ore zone continued to progress in Q1 2022 and is due to be completed later in 2022. Wet Concentrator Plant A is expected to commence mining in Nataka in 2025. The hydromining trial in Nataka has commenced and is progressing well. Ore body characterisation works continue and will be combined with mining  processing and tails management studies. The environmental and social assessment process is also underway.Market updateStrong market conditions for all of Kenmare’s products continued throughout Q1 2022. Demand continues to be greater than supply and consequently  ilmenite prices increased for the sixth consecutive quarter  while inventories remain low throughout the value chain for all products.In China  Q1 2022 was a record quarter for chloride pigment production. This intensified demand for imported feedstocks as domestic ilmenite is unsuitable for the chloride production process. Outside China  pigment demand is robust and a lack of titanium feedstock availability remains a bottleneck to pigment production volumes. Although additional ilmenite supply is entering the market  it is mostly in the form of concentrates from countries including Mozambique  the United States and Indonesia  but remains insufficient to meet demand.It is uncertain how the war in Ukraine will impact Kenmare’s product markets. Combined with high levels of inflation  the war has the potential to impact global growth  which could dampen demand for Kenmare’s products. However  4.5% of global titanium feedstocks production is attributable to Ukraine and disruption to this supply has exacerbated tight market conditions.The global freight market continues to be challenging and freight rates remain at elevated levels. However  the outlook for ilmenite remains positive  with received prices continuing to increase in Q2 2022.Demand for Kenmare’s zircon products was robust in Q1 2022  supported by low global zircon inventories. However  in Europe the increase in energy prices is presenting a headwind in the ceramics industry and could lead to lower tile production. Kenmare does not expect this to impact demand for its zircon  with strong zircon market conditions in China following Lunar New Year. Prices for zircon increased in Q1 2022 and the favourable market conditions for zircon are expected to continue in Q2 2022.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Doug Keatingedkeatinge@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 037 4163About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world’s largest producers of mineral sands products.

At constant exchange rates  growth was +16.2%  driven by very good performance in the companion animal segment. This growth benefited in part from a favorable baseline effect representing 2 points of growth in revenue  attributable to new products acquired starting in the second quarter of 2021. This growth was also supported in some countries by increases in distributor inventories. It should be noted that our actual performance was favorably impacted by the appreciation of certain currencies  in particular the US dollar  the Indian rupee  and the Brazilian real.Our growth in the first quarter was driven mainly by the performance of Asia-Pacific  Europe and Latin America. In Asia-Pacific  the real-rates growth was +25.9% (+22.5% at constant exchange rates). Australia and India were the main drivers of this growth in the area  generating nearly 80% of it  offsetting the decline in China  impacted by Covid-19 and a very challenging baseline effect compared to the first quarter of 2021. In Europe  revenue grew by 11.2% at real rates (+10.4% at constant rates). The main contributors to this performance were France  Italy  the United Kingdom  the Export and OTC areas activities  and Germany  driven by strong momentum in the companion animal ranges (in particular petfood  specialty products  and vaccines)  which offset the decline in ranges for food-producing animals. In Latin America  excluding Chile  the Group had an excellent start of the year. Revenue grew by 35.6% at real rates (+27 2 % at constant exchange rates)  due to double-digit growth in all subsidiaries  particularly thanks to strong contributions of Brazil and Mexico. Chile posted growth of 9.5% at real rates (+6.0% at constant exchange rates)  driven by sales in the companion animal and salmon ranges. Lastly  in the United States  first-quarter revenue increased by 26.2% (+17.5% at constant exchange rates). It benefited from strong sales of new products launched in 2021  as well as external parasiticides.Story continuesIn terms of species  revenue in the companion animal segment grew overall by 22.3% at real rates (+19.5% at constant exchange rates)  mainly driven by very good double-digit growth in the petfood  specialty  dermatology and hygiene ranges  as well as vaccines for dogs and cats. The food-producing animals segment also showed strong growth of 16.9% at real rates (+13.3% at constant exchange rates)  mainly driven by the ruminant sector (+17.1% at constant exchange rates); and the aquaculture segment (+6.9% at constant rates) compared to the same period in 2021.OutlookBased on first-quarter performance  while also taking into account the uncertainties of the coming months as well as the market’s expected return to normal  we are expanding our revenue growth outlook at constant rates and scope to a range of between 5% and 10%. The ratio of “current operating profit before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions” to “revenue” should be around 15% at constant exchange rates (with a deliberate overinvestment in R&D of approximately 1 percentage point of revenue compared to 2021). Furthermore  debt relief should be around €60 million  excluding dividends  at constant scope and exchange rates.Covid-19 health crisis and the war in UkraineWe continue to face significant production  logistical and supply constraints with regard to certain intermediaries  and more recently  the impact of inflation on our costs (energy  raw materials  etc.).A lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we make innovative solutions available to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

All audit procedures have been carried out.Commenting on these results  Andrew Highcock  Chief Executive Officer of Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits  said:“The second half of 2021 confirmed the positive trend observed at the beginning of the year; the ongoing operational implementation of our value creation strategy coupled with the achievement of targeted volume growth affirms the fundamentals of the 2021 EBITDA improvement. Backed by a streamlined financial structure and restored balance sheet position  the Group intends to pursue profitable and proactive business development while maintaining rigorous cost management at local and central level so as to sustain the profitability of its businesses. In an already highly disruptive and volatile environment at the close of 2021  the Group is particularly vigilant about protecting its interests given the current Ukraine conflict; the Group is committed to maintaining its adaptability as regards its organisation  employees and operations during the coming months at this time of uncertainty.”Story continuesSimplified income statement – FY 2021€m except EPS 2020 2021 Change 2021/2020 Net revenues (excluding excise duties) 169.1 166.7 -2.4 Gross margin 71.6 68.6 -3.0 Gross margin ratio 42.4% 41.1% EBITDA 10.6 12.6 +2.0 EBITDA margin 6.3% 7.6% Underlying operating profit 1.0 5.7 +4.7 Net profit/(loss) Group share (38.5) 5.6 +44.1 of which Net profit/(loss) from continuing operations  Group share (5.6) 6.6 +12.2 of which Net profit/(loss) from discontinued operations (32.9) (1.0) +31.9 Earnings per share  Group share (EPS  €) (0.86) 0.06 +0.92 Earnings per share from continuing operations  Group share (EPS  €) (0.12) 0.06 +0.18In 2021  the Group generated sales of €166.7m (after application of IFRS 5)  down 1% compared to the previous year (excluding currency impact)  but up 3.6% excluding non-recurring items1.2021 was marked by a recovery in sales driven by the France cluster despite a slowdown in the Off-Trade spirits market  in particular during the second half  in favour of the On-Trade channel.International business was impacted by multiple and successive changes in health restrictions  particularly in Europe and major Asian markets. Overall business in the USA was encouraging thanks to the new distribution model but fell short of 2020 sales  which were boosted by initial stock building at our new distributor.The gross margin ratio was 41.1% in 2021  down from 42.4% in 2020 due to:the sharp decrease in bulk sales (volume and margin) in the Baltic states (hand sanitizers for the COVID pandemic in 2020)  a market that became highly competitive the negative price effect in France due to trade negotiations and promotional expenditure to drive Sobieski and Paddy brand growth partly offset by the recovery of the branded business  which posted higher gross margin contributions  particularly for the international and On-Trade business in the second half of 2021.The various structural measures are bearing fruit and all entities except Dubar in Brazil posted positive EBITDA in 2021.Net non-recurring operating expenses for 2021 amounted to € -0.1m  mainly due to the positive outcome of the Group’s financial restructuring plan.The €0 25 m net financial income for 2021 was significantly lower than in 2020 (which included one-off proceeds from Trinidad & Tobago recorded in June 2020)  but the cost of debt has fallen significantly  given the change in the Group’s financial structure following the February 2021 capital increase.Net earnings from continuing operations in 2021 amounted to a €6 6m profit compared to a net loss of €5.6m in 2020  reflecting the Group’s improving profitability and the merits of its strategy of refocusing on the core “brand business”.2021 net revenues by cluster(€m) 2020 Like-for-like change Currencyimpact 2021 LFL change (excl. currency impact) Change(incl. currency impact) FRANCE CLUSTER 75.9 2.7 - 78.6 +3.5% +3.5% INTERNATIONAL CLUSTER 93.2 (4.5) (0.6) 88.1 -4.8% -5.4% TOTAL MBWS 169.1 (1.8) (0.6) 166.7 -1.0% -1.4%2021 EBITDA by cluster(€m) 2020 Like-for-like change Currencyimpact 2021LFL change (excl. currency impact) Change(incl. currency impact) FRANCE CLUSTER 10.7 +1.7 - 12.4 +15.9% +15.9% INTERNATIONAL CLUSTER 8.4 +0.3 (0.1) 8.6 +2.3% +1.1% HOLDING COMPANY (8.5) +0.1 - (8.4) -1.7% -1.7% TOTAL MBWS 10.6 +2.1 (0.1) 12.6 +19.2% +18.2%FRANCE CLUSTERIn an industry where competition remained particularly intense  France continued to balance its “value : volume” strategy  posting 2021 revenues of €78.6m  up 3.5% versus 2020.Following the reopening of hotels  bars and restaurants in the second half and in spite of the COVID Certificate requirement  the out-of-home consumption channel increased by 12% over the last two quarters at the expense of sales among major retailers  which nevertheless grew year-on-year.The under-12-year blended whisky market recorded a 0.9% decline over the period  significantly impacting William Peel volumes and sales among major retailers against a backdrop of intense promotional activity.The Group’s main brands followed the spirits market trend and confirmed their positive performance in the fourth quarter  driven by leading brands Marie Brizard (Manzanita) and San José. Apart from the slowdown in William Peel volumes  other brands such as Sobieski in the vodka segment gained market share thanks to extensive targeted promotional initiatives.In 2021  the France cluster also benefited from full-year sales of Paddy Irish whiskey  for which the Group took over distribution in the second half of 2020.Thanks to tight control of overheads and the recognition of a €3m exceptional non-recurring credit note issued by a whisky supplier under a new contract signed in January 2021  the region’s EBITDA increased by 15.9% in 2021 to €12.4m.INTERNATIONAL CLUSTERThe International cluster posted revenues of €88.1m for 2021  down 4.8% compared to 2020  when revenues were boosted by non-recurring items2: excluding these  International cluster revenues were up 3.6% versus 2020. As a reminder  the region’s sales are split between the legal entities within the International cluster  as detailed below. The region’s business performance  due in particular to the second half recovery of the On-Trade business and improved market coverage  generated EBITDA of €8.6m in 2021  up 2.3% versus 2020.MBWS International:Revenues amounted to €14.6m  up €4.5m due to (i) business development in Europe  Africa and Asia Pacific  (ii) recovery in the UK and (iii) the inclusion of the Canada and Poland markets served by Imperial Brands and MBWS Polska respectively in 2020.In Western Europe  as the year progressed  business was significantly impacted by the varying restrictions imposed on different economic operators due to the health crisis.In Benelux  the “value over volume” policy led to a slight erosion of revenues. These factors were partly offset  mainly during the second half  by the reopening of the On-Trade business in the UK  a major market for the Marie Brizard brand.Against this backdrop  the Italian market improved in 2021  including towards the end of the year.The French overseas territories and departments (DOM-TOM) witnessed significant growth in business marked by successive changes in health measures similar to those in mainland France. The Africa export markets also performed well  posting strong sales growth throughout the year.In Poland  sales of our brands (in particular William Peel and Cognac Gautier) to the former MBWS subsidiary (now called Premium Distillers) increased steadily during 2021.Asia Pacific business in 2021 was driven by overall sales resilience throughout the year in Australia and Korea  which offset the difficulties in Japan (following the state of emergency and lockdown  the Olympic Games not having had as positive an impact as initially anticipated). However  in Australia and Korea  the end of 2021 was  in contrast to the rest of the year  down significantly (destocking effect in Australia) compared to a dynamic 4th quarter 2020.MBWS España:Revenues amounted to €20.0m  down €1.7m.Working through the health crisis  Spain was one of the first countries to reopen the On-Trade business  which particularly benefited Marie Brizard brand and cross-border sales. As a result  brand sales rose 2% versus 2020.This recovery was offset by the Pulco subcontracting business  which saw a year-on-year decline in volumes resulting in an 11% decrease in revenues.However  growth in brand sales had a positive impact on our margin that outweighed this decline. The subsidiary continued to keep overheads under control  particularly through external cost savings.MBWS Scandinavia:Revenues increased by €0.6m to €2.7m  up 25.8% excluding currency impact  thanks to the recovery of the On-Trade market in Denmark as confirmed in the fourth quarter. The Off-Trade market is also subject to growing competition with premium brands available at affordable prices. It is worth noting the positive impact of the takeover of Kidibul brand distribution  which accounted for 25% of revenue growth.MBWS Baltics:Revenues in the Baltic states were impacted by the sharp contraction of the bulk sales market. In the fourth quarter  following the lifting of health restrictions and expectations of an increase in excise duties at the beginning of 2022  domestic market revenues edged up  boosted towards the end of the year by a stronger recovery than that of the brand business in the Eastern Europe export markets.Revenues fell €7.2m versus 2020 mainly due to the €5.4m loss in bulk sales. Following restatement  pro forma sales decreased by €1.8m versus the previous year due to lower sales prices in the recurring bulk business  despite the gradual easing of COVID restrictions and price increases for our brands.MBWS Bulgaria:Bulgaria also posted strong growth in 2021 for the Group’s international spirits brands (Marie Brizard  Sobieski  Gautier  William Peel) coupled with an increase in sales of the main national wine brands  a significant increase in export volumes  particularly to Greece and Turkey  and the subcontracting business to Romania. The subsidiary posted revenues of €14.0m  up €3.9m versus 2020.Imperial Brands:In the United States  2021 revenues fell 8% versus 2020  impacted by the distribution model changes in the first half of 2020.Revenues thus came in at €10.7m  down €5.4m excluding restatement and currency impact. After restatement  pro forma sales decreased by €3.0m compared to the previous year  with the positive effect of the initial stock building at our distributor evaluated at €2.4m. Changes in the US dollar exchange rate had an adverse impact of €0.4m on the company’s revenues.The end of the year was marked by a slowdown in Sobieski sales due to aggressive promotional strategies pursued by competitors in the vodka category (leading to a decline in value) and postponement of sales to 2022 due to logistical constraints (particularly affecting sea freight). These adverse effects were partly offset by the strong performance from Cognac Gautier.Dubar:Brazil experienced strong business growth in 2021  despite the challenging health situation and cancellation of major events  such as the Carnival at the beginning of the year. This momentum was driven by growth in local and imported brand sales (Cutty Sark and Sobieski)  although a slowdown was noted in the fourth quarter.Revenues increased by 40% compared to the previous year  up €3.0m. The depreciation of the Brazilian real hit the region’s revenues by €0.3m. Despite the intensification of the new strategy  overall performance was impacted by the year-end slowdown in sales.HOLDING COMPANYThe holding company posted an EBITDA loss of €8.4m for 2021 compared to an €8.5m loss in 2020  driven by two contrasting trends:a significant decrease in the holding company’s operating expenses  downsizing of core teams in line with the Group’s new critical mass and the operational organisational system implemented in early 2021  plus tight control of operating budgets a significant reduction in re-invoicing of central expenses to subsidiaries following the Group downsizing operation.Thus  excluding rebillings  Holding company operating expenses decreased by 16% from 2020 to 2021.Balance sheet at 31 December 2021Group shareholders’ equity amounted to €173.6m at 31 December 2021 compared to €66.6m at 31 December 2020  as restated3  while the net cash position amounted to €48.2m at 31 December 2021  compared to net financial debt of €43.6m at 31 December 2020.(€m) 31 December 2020 restated3 Profit/(loss) for the period Capital increase Otherchanges 31 December 2021 Net capitalisation of COFEPP debt Subscription by minority shareholders Of which translation reserves SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITYGroup share 66.6 5.6 82.8 17.4 1.2 173.6These changes reflect the January 2021 capital increase that led to the capitalisation of (i) all bank debt (excluding factoring) purchased by COFEPP from the Company’s lending banks (principal amount of €45m) and overdraft facilities drawn down (principal amount of €1.1m)  (ii) all current account advances paid or yet to be paid by COFEPP to the Company and its subsidiary MBWS France (total principal amount of €32m) and (iii) the first tranche of the Poland Advance granted by COFEPP to the Company (€3m) and the related accrued interest.OutlookThe Group continues to roll out its strategic plan after an initial phase that involved eliminating loss-making operations  cutting costs and streamlining operational structures.Now organised into two clusters (France and International) under the overall management of the Holding company  the Group is maintaining its consistent objective  both in commercial negotiations and transactions with customers and in brand and market development  of striking the right balance between value and volume  particularly in Europe and the USA.This strategy  coupled with the policy of tailoring costs to the size of operations on a country-by-country basis  will be continued and will underpin the Group’s growing profitability. Bolstered by the proceeds of the February 2021 capital increase  the MBWS Group is now looking to step up organic as well as external growth projects in order to boost operational and financial performance.2021 full-year earnings confirm the positive trends observed in 2020  in an economic environment largely dependent on developments in the pandemic during H1 2021  with a disruptive impact on the business depending on distribution channels and against a volatile backdrop at the end of the year.At the beginning of 2022  taking into acount the ongoing resolution of the health crisis and in view of (i) the supply risks relating to the regular unavailability of raw and dry materials  (ii) the sharp increases in costs (which are far higher than the potential for passing them on downstream to the distribution chain and customers)  the Group has adopted a conservative position on its annual performance for 2022.This situation is greatly aggravated by the recent unforeseen news at the end of February about dramatic events in Ukraine (with new exceptional inflationary pressures) and their consequences  which are not yet completely measurable  on all the markets where MBWS operates (particularly in France and Europe); for the time being  the Group is therefore very cautious about its short and medium-term performance in view of these operational challenges  which are forcing the Group to adapt its commercial policies accordingly.Financial calendar:General Meeting: 30 June 2022Q1 2020 revenues: 28 April 2022H1 2022 revenues: 28 July 2022Investor and shareholder relations contactMBWS GroupEmilie Drexleremilie.drexler@mbws.comTel.: +33 1 43 91 62 21 Press contactImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurence Maurycdoligez@image7.fr – lmaury@image7.frTel.: +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a wine and spirits group based in Europe and the United States.

Read more at straitstimes.com.,"LONDON (REUTERS) - Britain approved on Thursday (April 14) Valneva's Covid-19 vaccine  making it the first European country to give a nod to the French firm's coronavirus vaccine shot that is easier to store and involves a process widely used in making flu and polio vaccines.The shot is also the sixth Covid-19 vaccine to be approved in Britain  whose government had in September scrapped a €1.4 billion (S$2 billion) supply deal.Euronext temporarily halted trading in Valneva's shares  that were indicated sharply up. At Wednesday's closing price of €15.255  they are down 37.7 per cent since the start of year after gaining 216 per cent in 2021 and 202 per cent in 2020.""It is also the first  whole-virus inactivated Covid-19 vaccine to gain regulatory approval in the UK "" the British health watchdog said in a statement  adding that the shot met required safety  quality and effectiveness standards.In vaccines such as Valneva's VLA2001  the virus is grown in a lab and then made completely inactive so that it cannot infect cells or replicate in the body but can still trigger an immune response. It is seen by some as having the potential to win over people wary of some shots which use new mRNA technology.Rx Securities managing director Samir Devani said even after the mass roll-out  Valneva's vaccine could still be useful if a new variant arises.""The fact that it is available on hand is good news  although the exact revenue profile beyond the orders already received from the EU and Bahrain remains unclear "" he said.Mr Devani said the approval bodes well for the decision from the European Union's human medicines committee (CHMP)  which is assessing the drug after the European Commission signed an advance deal for up to 60 million doses.Valneva said in March that it expected a positive recommendation by the European Medicines Agency this month and that it had begun manufacturing and has inventory ready for labelling and deployment once it is is approved there.Bahrain granted Valneva's vaccine emergency use authorisation in early March.Earlier this year  analysts at Jefferies estimated four to 5.5 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses will be delivered globally this year  mostly outside the EU and United States  which have received the lion's share of supplies.The temperature at which VLA2001 needs to be stored is similar to that of a domestic refrigerator  making it appropriate in countries where storage at very low temperatures is a challenge.",neutral,0.11,0.88,0.01,mixed,0.13,0.27,0.6,True,English,"['Covid-19 shot', 'Britain', 'Valneva', 'four to 5.5 billion Covid-19 vaccine doses', 'Rx Securities managing director', 'vaccine emergency use authorisation', 'virus inactivated Covid-19 vaccine', 'sixth Covid-19 vaccine', 'British health watchdog', 'exact revenue profile', 'human medicines committee', 'billion) supply deal', 'new mRNA technology', 'European Medicines Agency', 'coronavirus vaccine shot', 'first European country', '60 million doses', 'new variant', 'European Union', 'European Commission', 'advance deal', 'French firm', 'closing price', 'effectiveness standards', 'immune response', 'Samir Devani', 'mass roll', 'good news', 'Mr Devani', 'positive recommendation', 'United States', 'domestic refrigerator', 'low temperatures', 'polio vaccines', 'regulatory approval', 'early March', '€1.4 billion', 'LONDON', 'REUTERS', 'Britain', 'Thursday', 'April', 'Valneva', 'nod', 'process', 'flu', 'government', 'September', 'Euronext', 'trading', 'shares', 'Wednesday', 'start', 'year', 'UK', 'statement', 'safety', 'quality', 'VLA2001', 'lab', 'cells', 'body', 'potential', 'people', 'shots', 'fact', 'hand', 'orders', 'Bahrain', 'decision', 'CHMP', 'drug', 'inventory', 'deployment', 'analysts', 'Jefferies', 'supplies', 'countries', 'storage', 'challenge', '216', '202']",2022-04-14,2022-04-14,straitstimes.com

This new game is based on an original model  combining solo playing with a multiplayer world  enabling players to acquire  develop and operate a park on the blockchain based on a Play to Earn model using NFTs. Pre-sales will start in May 2022  with Alpha and Beta versions to follow for a first quarter 2023 game release.MetaCoaster is a key feature of CBI’s strategy. Announced at the time of the IPO in October 2021  this universe  conceived by CBI and developed directly within AlphaVerse  is one of the core pillars of the metaverse created by CBI.MetaCoaster  which is free to access in AlphaVerse  offers various modes  from solo to multiplayer  with a wide range of challenges and experiences enabling the community to acquire virtual plots  build and develop theme parks  and organize tournaments. Players have full responsibility for managing their parks: the plot and decor can be adjusted (locations of roller coasters  rides  restaurants  etc.)  and attractions can be built or demolished.For MetaCoaster  the blockchain offers benefits on two levels: on the one hand  the use of NFTs to represent the game’s most valuable elements and facilitate transactions between players; on the other hand  the creation of an internal economy making it possible to reward the best players with the Play to Earn model  with pricing levels set by the creators and criteria for progress based on satisfaction and loyalty levels.NFTs are made of plots  roller coasters and attractions that can then be extended  improved and sold between players as NFTs. Players will be able to create their own roller coasters in the form of NFTs  upgrade them and participate in the game's economy.With the Big World multiplayer mode  players are grouped together within a virtual world made up of 132 205 plots. The goal is to create the best park and earn the most cryptocurrencies  spent by virtual visitors and other MetaCoaster players. By progressing up the various rankings (satisfaction  loyalty  park complexity  etc.)  players can maximize the overall value of their park and  if they wish  sell it to another player on a blockchain marketplace.The quality of their park  its level of visits by other players and the various challenges they meet  enable players to earn cryptocurrencies  which can be exchanged for making improvements to their park and its attractions. To foster interactivity and support the user experience  visitors or “MetaPeeps”  whose behavior is predefined by artificial intelligence  take part in the game and the experiences created by the players. Throughout the MetaCoaster game  players will be able to use the BNB and CRYS tokens to purchase land and other NFTs. In addition  players will be able to use the bATRI token to purchase certain plots of land or NFTs  depending on their location or feature.Considering the progress made with its development  involving in-house teams and studios from Latin America and Asia  this universe is scheduled to be launched in the first quarter of 2023  with additional features  plots  attractions and new developments to follow.For more information: https://alphaverse.com/metacoaster-alphaverse/Disclaimer:The realisation of projects  as well as their operational budget and financing plan  remain fundamentally subject to uncertainties  and the non-realisation of the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the value of assets and liabilities.About CBICRYPTO BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRIES (“CBI”) is a French company that develops  operates and invests in video games  business applications and selected projects relating to the blockchain  non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) and cryptocurrencies.

The upgrade is a move from energy-intensive SON-T lamps to the new Philips TrueForce Core LED Road 40W lamps  which promise improved white light quality in customer facing areas for increased safety and enhanced colour rendering for better visibility. In addition  with this replacement  it is estimated over 800 000 kWh energy will be saved each year by using the Trueforce LED lamps  as the lighting installed uses 80% less energy.After several months of extensive research into the right lighting solutions  Sheffield Stagecoach found the Philips TrueForce Core LED Road LED lamp 40W to be the perfect fit that meets all necessary specifications and objectives for upgrading the lighting. This replacement to the new SON lighting dramatically reduces the maintenance costs of lamps and the ageing electromagnetic gear system by reducing the need for frequent replacements and maintenance visits. The Philips TrueForce Core LED Road brings all the energy-efficiency and long-lifetime benefits of LED to HID replacement while providing instant saving with low initial investment  removing the need to replace existing fixtures. Philips TrueForce Core LED Road lamps are a tubular glass envelope LED retro-fit similar to that of SON-T lamps. They will fit in the existing luminaires and importantly work truly with the luminaire’s optic making sure that light is photometrically positioned. Signify was recommended as the lighting provider of choice by CEF Sheffield.‘’For a long now  we have been looking for the best replacement that physically fits into the existing luminaires  taking away the need to replace them. We also needed to ensure the new lightbulbs meet all our objectives of enhanced safety  better visibility and being environmentally friendly. The Philips LED lighting solutions offer several benefits such as better colour rendering  enhanced CCTV visibility  increased traveller  staff safety  and improved visibility at the tram stops. In addition  the energy savings are impressive when compared with conventional light sources and long-lasting products. With instant restrike of the new LED lamps  this takes away the waiting period of HID cooldown in the case of power outages. We are sure we will reap several benefits for a long time to come.’’ Mark Tomkins  Infrastructure Electrical Co-ordinator  Stagecoach Supertram‘’Our LED solution for the Sheffield tramline will encourage travellers to travel on the line worry-free due to the better visibility and safety. To add to this  the positive impact on the environment is another huge benefit for the Sheffield tramline as the upgrade to LED lighting helps reduce the tramline’s environmental impact. We are excited to be part of such an exciting project that ultimately leads to the citizen welfare and satisfaction.’’ Simon Greenwood  Sales Director Trade & Specification  Signify UK&I.,neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,positive,0.78,0.2,0.02,True,English,"['Philips LED solution', 'energy efficient lighting', 'Sheffield Tramline', 'Philips TrueForce Core LED Road LED lamp 40W', 'new Philips TrueForce Core LED Road 40W lamps', 'The Philips TrueForce Core LED Road', 'Philips TrueForce Core LED Road lamps', 'The Philips LED lighting solutions', 'tubular glass envelope LED', 'ageing electromagnetic gear system', 'Trueforce LED lamps', 'new LED lamps', 'energy-intensive SON-T lamps', 'right lighting solutions', 'new SON lighting', 'low initial investment', 'Infrastructure Electrical Co-ordinator', 'Sales Director Trade', 'white light quality', 'conventional light sources', 'LED solution', 'Signify UK&I', 'new lightbulbs', 'lighting provider', 'world leader', 'Sheffield Stagecoach', 'Sheffield Supertram', 'busiest tramlines', '10.5 million passengers', 'colour rendering', '800,000 kWh energy', '80% less energy', 'several months', 'extensive research', 'perfect fit', 'necessary specifications', 'maintenance costs', 'frequent replacements', 'maintenance visits', 'long-lifetime benefits', 'instant saving', 'existing fixtures', 'existing luminaires', 'CEF Sheffield', 'several benefits', 'tram stops', 'energy savings', 'long-lasting products', 'instant restrike', 'waiting period', 'HID cooldown', 'power outages', 'long time', 'Mark Tomkins', 'Stagecoach Supertram', 'positive impact', 'huge benefit', 'environmental impact', 'exciting project', 'citizen welfare', 'Simon Greenwood', 'Sheffield tramline', 'HID replacement', 'best replacement', 'staff safety', 'CCTV visibility', 'enhanced safety', 'Guildford', 'Euronext', 'platforms', 'traffic', 'upgrade', 'move', 'customer', 'areas', 'increased', 'addition', 'objectives', 'need', 'energy-efficiency', 'optic', 'choice', 'traveller', 'case', 'part', 'satisfaction']",2022-04-14,2022-04-14,voltimum.co.uk

Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented  “We are extremely pleased with this new authorization and would like to thank the MHRA for their trust and confidence. VLA2001 is the only inactivated whole virus COVID-19 vaccine approved in the UK and this authorization could pave the way for the availability of an alternative vaccine solution for the UK population. We continue to receive messages every day from people who are looking for a more traditional vaccine approach. We believe that this new approval could also lead to additional marketing authorizations in other regions of the world. I would like to personally thank all the people who have been supporting us in this endeavor and our internal teams for all their hard work.” This new marketing authorization comes in addition to the emergency use authorization which was granted by the Bahraini NHRA in March 20221. A rolling review process is still ongoing with the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In the UK  following termination of the supply agreement with the British government in September 20212  Valneva is currently in discussion with the Scottish government to supply up to 25 000 doses to the National Health Service and frontline workers in Scotland34. About VLA2001VLA2001 is currently the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted vaccine candidate in clinical trials against COVID-19 in Europe. It is intended for active immunization of at-risk populations to prevent carriage and symptomatic infection with COVID-19 during the pandemic and for routine vaccination including addressing new variants. VLA2001 may also be suited for boosting  as repeat booster vaccinations have been shown to work well with whole virus inactivated vaccines. VLA2001 is produced on Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®. VLA2001 consists of inactivated whole virus particles of SARS-CoV-2 with high S-protein density  in combination with two adjuvants  alum and CpG 1018. This adjuvant combination has consistently induced higher antibody levels in preclinical experiments than alum-only formulations and shown a shift of the immune response towards Th1. CpG 1018 adjuvant  supplied by Dynavax Technologies Corporation (Nasdaq: DVAX)  is a component of the US FDA- and EMA-approved HEPLISAV-B® vaccine. VLA2001’s manufacturing process  which has already ben upscaled to final industrial scale  includes chemical inactivation to preserve the native structure of the S-protein. VLA2001 is expected to conform with standard cold chain requirements (2 to 8 degrees Celsius).About Valneva SE Valneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases. Valneva has leveraged its expertise and capabilities both to successfully commercialize two vaccines and to rapidly advance a broad range of vaccine candidates into and through the clinic  including candidates against Lyme disease  the chikungunya virus and COVID-19.Media & Investor ContactsLaëtitia Bachelot-FontaineVP Global Communications & European Investor RelationsM +33 (0)6 4516 7099[email protected]Joshua Drumm  Ph.D.VP Global Investor RelationsM +001 917 815 4520[email protected] Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements relating to the business of Valneva  including with respect to the progress  timing  design  data read-outs  anticipated results and completion of clinical trials of VLA2001 and with respect to possible regulatory approval of VLA2001.

By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  NOXXON’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses against the immune system and enable greater therapeutic impact. NOXXON’s lead program NOX-A12 has delivered final top-line data from a Keytruda® combination trial in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients published at the ESMO conference in September 2020 and in July 2021 the company announced its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. NOXXON is also studying NOX-A12 in brain cancer in combination with radiotherapy which has been granted orphan drug status in the US and EU for the treatment of certain brain cancers. GLORIA  a trial of NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy has delivered top-line data from all three dose-escalation cohorts showing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA has been expanded to assess the benefit of NOX-A12 with other treatment combinations  radiotherapy + bevacizumab and radiotherapy + pembrolizumab. The company’s second clinical-stage asset NOX-E36 is a Phase 2 TME asset targeting the innate immune system. NOXXON plans to test NOX‑E36 in patients with solid tumors.

GLORIA further evaluates safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 three additional arms combining NOX-A12 with: A. radiotherapy in patients with complete tumor resection; B. radiotherapy and bevacizumab in patients with incomplete tumor resection; and C. radiotherapy and pembrolizumab in patients with incomplete tumor resection.About the OPTIMUS StudyOPTIMUS (NCT04901741) is NOXXON’s open-label two-arm phase 2 study of NOX-A12 combined with pembrolizumab and nanoliposomal irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in microsatellite-stable metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.DisclaimerTranslations of any press release into languages other than English are intended solely as a convenience to the non-English-reading audience.
