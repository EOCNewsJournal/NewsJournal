(Euronext Paris: FR0000120388 - RX) (the ""Company"") notes  in light of the offers received in the context of the asset disposal process that the...","RECYLEX SARecylex S.A. (Euronext Paris: FR0000120388 - RX) (the ""Company"") notes  in light of the offers received in the context of the asset disposal process that the Company had initiated in May 2021  that (i) it will not have sufficient financial resources to allow a debt restructuring in an amicable framework  and (ii) it will be impossible to implement the envisaged asset disposal program in an in bonis1 framework.The offers received by the Company to date are as follows:An offer for the Escaudoeuvres and Villefranche-sur-Saône industrial sites and the shares of the subsidiary C2P S.A.S. for less than €2.5 million  allowing the preservation of the business and jobs (60 jobs in total);Two offers for the 50% stake in Recytech S.A. for a total of €40 million  this stake being subject to a first and second ranking pledge in favour of Glencore International AG;Offers valuing the discontinued Estaque site for an amount of less than €0.5 million (on the assumption of environmental rehabilitation obligations taken over by the potential buyer).This compares with total net debt of €52.2 million  plus provisions for environmental risks and liabilities of €16.2 million2  for a total of €68.4 million. The Company does not expect to receive any further offers in view of the extensive due diligence undertaken to find potential buyers.This asset disposal process was part of an amicable prevention procedure (conciliation)  which has been underway for several months  at the initiative of the Company  and which will end on April 15  2022  without a debt-restructuring plan having been approved.In addition  a significant portion of the Group's debt will also become due after April 15  2022.As a result  the Company will be in a state of cessation of payments and is preparing to file for reorganization proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”) before the Paris Commercial Court  under the conditions provided for by law3.The Company notes that the conditional offer received from Campine NV for the two industrial sites (including its subsidiary C2P S.A.S.  located at the Villefranche-sur-Saône site) is likely to maintain the activities of the Group's industrial sites and the associated jobs. However  it is still uncertain whether these conditions will be met.Story continuesThis offer remains subject to an agreement between Campine NV and the French government on the amounts of the financial guarantees that the buyer would have to put in place in the event of the takeover of the operation of these two sites  which are classified as ""Seveso"".If the Court grants the request for the opening of reorganization proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”)  this procedure will allow the examination by the Court of the offer received from Campine NV and the study of a judicial solution for the restructuring of the Company's debt.As this is the only offer for the industrial sites  the Company will request that Campine NV's offer be examined by the Paris Commercial Court according to the “prépack cession” procedure - which implies  in particular  an accelerated timetable - in order to limit the consequences on the activity and employment at the industrial sites.The asset disposal process carried out by the Company since May 2021  in parallel with the process of restructuring its debt  is thus in the hands of the Paris Commercial Court.In the event of the opening of reorganization proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”) it should be noted  however  that  given the importance of the debts and other liabilities  and the low value of the assets resulting from the offers received  the prospects of the adoption of a reorganization plan (“plan de redressement”)  in parallel with the envisaged “prépack cession”  remain uncertain.***The Company reiterates below in more detail the announcements made today:Offers received for the Company's assets;Inability to present a debt restructuring plan in an amicable framework;Examination by the Paris Commercial Court of the offer received for the industrial sites in the context of the asset disposal process (""prépack cession"").1. Offers received for the Company's assetsThe Company's only assets to date are the following4:The Villefranche-sur-Saône and Escaudœuvres sites for the recycling of used lead-acid batteries  as well as the polypropylene waste recycling business of the subsidiary C2P S.A.S. located at the Villefranche-sur-Saône site;the 50% stake in Recytech S.A.;Discontinued mining and industrial sites  including the Estaque site in Marseille.Offer for the Villefranche-sur-Saône and Escaudœuvres sitesThe structured and competitive sales process conducted by the Company since May 2021 has enabled to identify and approach  through the intermediary of the investment bank ODDO BHF Corporate Finance  nearly 80 potential investors  to finally obtain a single offer for the Group's ""lead"" and ""plastics"" operations.This offer from Campine NV  a Belgian company listed on Euronext Brussels  would ensure the takeover of all the industrial activities and almost all employees of the Villefranche-sur-Saône and Escaudœuvres sites  including C2P S.A.S. (via a takeover of the corresponding stake)  while providing a new overall industrial vision for the years to come.This offer is likely to promote the sustainability of activities and jobs at sites that are fully committed to the lead and plastic waste recycling economy.The proceeds from the sale of all the industrial activities being less than €2.5 million  notably because of the significant investments to be made at these two sites  it would not contribute significantly to the restructuring of the Group's debtAt the date of publication of this press release  the offer received remains subject to certain conditions related to the level of the overall amount of the environmental financial guarantees to be provided by the buyer  in accordance with the provisions of articles L.516-1 and L.516-2 of the French Environmental Code. Discussions are currently underway between the Government departments concerned and the potential buyer. Given the nature of these conditions  the Company is not currently in a position to comment on the fulfilment and lifting of these conditions  which are beyond the Company's control.Offers concerning the discontinued Estaque siteThe discontinued Estaque site has been the subject of an environmental remediation program for several years. The Company has received proposals to acquire this site with a tiers demandeur mechanism5 that would allow a significant portion of the remaining remediation costs to be transferred to the buyer. The expected proceeds from the sale would be less than €0.5 million and would not contribute significantly to the restructuring of the Group's debt.Offers for the stake in Recytech S.A.The Company has received indicative offers of up to €40 million for its 50% stake in Recytech S.A. The proceeds from the sale of this stake are expected  based on the offers received  to be fully received by Glencore International AG  as the Company's main creditor and beneficiary of a first and second ranking pledge on the Company's stake in Recytech S.A. (it being specified that the amounts guaranteed by these pledges amount to €47.1 million as of March 31  20226). These offers are not likely to enable the Company's debts to be restructured and  by extension  its activities and jobs to be maintained.2. Inability to present a debt restructuring plan in an amicable frameworkGross financial debt and other liabilities amount to 82.3 million euro to date  as summarized below:Summary of known debts and liabilities In millions of euros Glencore International AG 27.5 European Commission 25.7 SNCF Réseau / Retia 2.9 Others 0.3 Financial debts 56.4 Rehabilitation of former mining sites and Estaque 13.4 Litigation Metaleurop Nord 4.0 Litigation SNCF Réseau 8.5 Provisions for other liabilities 25.9 Total provisioned debts and other liabilities 82.3 Cash and cash equivalents 4.2As consequence  the offers received do not provide the Company with sufficient financial resources to consider restructuring its debt.The imminent expiration and the failure of the current conciliation procedure  as well as the payability of a large part of the debt after April 15  2022  will lead the Company to declare a situation of cessation of payments under the conditions provided for by law and to request the opening of a Court-ordered reorganization proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”) in which the sale of the ""lead"" and ""plastic"" operations could be ordered by the Court.2.1. Significant debt and liabilities inherited from the pastNet financial debtAs of March 31  2022  the Company’s net financial debt amounted to €52.2 million (excluding IFRS 16 rental debt).Debt Creditors million euros €16 million loan (a) Glencore International AG 18.6 Debt related to the European Commission fine (b) European Commission 25.7 Clawback clause (c) Glencore International AG & Others 4.1 Rescheduled debt from the 2005-2015 continuation plan (d) Glencore International AG 5.1 SNCF Réseau/ Retia SASU (e) 2.9 Total debt 56.4 Total available cash 4.2 Net debt as of March 31  2022 52.2Financial debt breaks down as follows:Loan of €16 million (€18.6 million including capitalized interest) taken out in 2014 with Glencore International AG. At the end of December 2021  the Company obtained from Glencore International AG an extension of the conditional waiver of its right to declare the loan immediately due and payable until April 15  2022 at the latest (previously January 31  2022). Given the absence of a debt-restructuring plan in an amicable framework and the expiration of Glencore International AG's conditional waiver of its right to declare the loan immediately due on April 15  2022  the liabilities corresponding to the accrued interest (€2.5 million) will now become due and payable after that date. As regards the principal  the corresponding liability will now be considered as an unmatured demand liability due to Glencore International AG's right to declare the loan due at any time; Debt relating to the European Commission fine of €25.7 million  including interest on suspended maturities. In September 2020  the Company temporarily suspended payment of the fine in the context of discussions with the European Commission. The outstanding maturities amount to €2.7 million as of March 31  2021. The full amount of the fine will become due after April 15  2022; Clawback clause under the 2005-2015 continuation plan for an amount of €4.1 million7. The amounts due under this debt amount to €3.8 million at December 31  2021  with Glencore International AG as the main creditor for €3.5 million. The total amount will become due after April 15  2022  as the suspension of the due date granted by Glencore International AG will end on that date; The rescheduled debt  due in 2026  resulting from the Company's continuation plan  for an amount of €5.1 million towards Glencore International AG; An estimated debt of €2.9 million8 in connection with the order by the Marseille Administrative Court ruling to pay €5.7 million to SNCF Réseau in solidum with Retia SASU. Retia SASU  which indicates having paid the full amount called in by SNCF Réseau  i.e. €5.7 million  in December 2021  would therefore have a recourse claim against the Company.These debts are largely attributable to the past of the former Metaleurop Group.It should be noted in this respect that since 2005 the Company has disbursed nearly €108 million euros for liabilities related to the past  including:€42 million under its continuation plan;€24 million in compensations paid to former employees of Metaleurop Nord S.A.S. following legal proceedings initiated by them; and€42 million for the remediation of former mining sites and the discontinued Estaque site.Other liabilitiesThe Company also has a number of environmental liabilities inherited from its industrial and mining past  including:Provisions Nature million euros Liabilities for the rehabilitation of former mines (€3.7 million) and the discontinued Estaque site (€9.7 million) Costs provisioned in the amount of 13.4 Judgment by the Marseille Administrative Court in respect of damage allegedly caused by SNCF Réseau to railway infrastructure (joint and several with Retia SASU) (e) Amount provisioned[Initial judgment of up to €63.3 million euros on call for funds] 8.5 Litigation Metaleurop Nord S.A.S. 4.0 Total Provisions 25.9In view of the offers received to date for the discontinued Estaque site  a possible sale of the site with a tiers demandeur mechanism5 would make it possible  in the event of a sale  to transfer the remediation costs and obligations (€9.7 million) to the buyer. The remaining provisions to be cleared in this case would amount to €16.2 million.Liabilities resulting from the decision of the Marseille Administrative CourtOn May 26  2021  the Marseille Administrative Court ordered the Company  jointly and severally with Retia SASU  to pay the SNCF Réseau a provisional amount of €5.7 million for the “global refurbishment” of the railways public domain near the Estaque sector. The Company and Retia SASU must also pay the remainder  up to a maximum of €63.3 million  as and when SNCF Réseau calls for funds9. The Company filed an appeal of this decision on July 22  2021. The Company also filed a request for a temporary suspension of execution on October 29  2021.Retia SASU indicates having paid €5.7 million to SNCF Réseau in December 2021  and would therefore have a recourse claim against the Company – estimated at 50% of this amount (approximately €2.9 million) for accounting purposes subject to the determination of the exact contribution of each party.A provision of €8.5 million euros has been made in the Company's accounts for this litigation with SNCF Réseau.2.2. A weakened business model and an activity that does not allow the repayment of existing debtsSince May 2022  the Group's main activity is the recycling of used lead-acid batteries t the Villefranche-sur-Saône and Escaudœuvres sites  for which the quasi-unique outlet is Nordenham smelter (in Germany)  the industrial site of the former German subgroup (then called Weser-Metall GmbH). The assets of this smelter were taken over by Glencore International AG in August 2021 through its subsidiary Nordenham Metall GmbH. Material purchases from this smelter accounted for 90% of the Recylex Group’s sales in 2021. The Company's business and cash generation capacity are thus highly exposed to fluctuations in demand from Nordenham Metall GmbH  which makes Recylex business model even more fragile.The Group has sought to reduce its heavy dependence on this quasi-unique customer. However  as the recycling process for used batteries at the two French sites was originally designed as an integral part of the Nordenham smelter's secondary materials recovery chain  it became clear that significant industrial changes in the used battery recycling process would be required before other potential customers and market segments could be targeted.Despite the efforts undertaken over the past two years  the Company has not yet succeeded in finding significant new outlets for its products from the recycling of used lead-acid batteries  nor in making the industrial changes necessary to address new outlets.The sustainability of the activity is thus considerably weakened  requiring the takeover by an industrial operator such as Campine NV.2.3. The offers received do not allow for the repayment or restructuring of debtsThe various offers received highlighted the following:It is clear that the proceeds from a potential sale of the Group's assets will not be sufficient to effectively support a restructuring of the debt  or even a sufficiently significant portion thereof; Without significant debt write-offs  which are unlikely due to the security interests in the Company's assets6  the sale of all the assets would not be sufficient to reduce the Company's debt; he valuation process for the discontinued Estaque site has shown that the offers received would only cover the remaining rehabilitation costs and would clearly not contribute to the repayment of the existing debt.2.4. Failure and expiration of the conciliation procedure and cessation of paymentsIn order to deal with the difficulties encountered and the level of indebtedness of the Group  the Company had requested the opening of conciliation proceedings  in order to benefit from a confidential and protective framework  conducive to discussions relating to the restructuring of the debt and the assessment of the feasibility of a sale of all or part of the Company's assets and/or activities  with the assistance of a conciliator.This conciliation procedure was opened by the President of the Paris Commercial Court on June 15  2021.The purpose of this conciliation procedure was to reach an agreement with the financial partners and with any creditors (in particular Glencore International AG  the European Commission and SNCF Réseau) to restructure the debt in order to ensure the sustainability of its operations.By a new order dated November 18  2021  the President of the Paris Commercial Court therefore extended the conciliator's mission to the organization of a partial or total sale of the company  which could be implemented  if necessary  in the context of subsequent reorganization proceedings (namely the French Sauvegarde  Redressement Judiciaire or Liquidation Judiciaire) (“prépack cession” mission).In the absence of an agreement with the creditors  the conciliation procedure  which will end on April 15  2022  will fail.The Company will not have sufficient cash flow to meet its liabilities  which will become due as a result of the expiration and failure of the conciliation procedure.The Company will therefore be obliged to declare its situation of cessation of payments to the Paris Commercial Court and to request the opening of reorganization proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”).3. Examination by the Paris Commercial Court of the offer received for the industrial sites in the context of the asset disposal process (""prépack cession"")The declaration of cessation of payments will be filed by the Company under the conditions provided for by law.The Company will keep investors informed of the Court’s decision.If the application to open Court-ordered reorganization proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”) is granted  the Paris Commercial Court will be asked to examine the offer received from Campine NV in accordance with the terms of the ""prépack cession"" (implying  in particular  an accelerated examination schedule in order to limit the consequences on the activity and employment of the industrial sites) and to order  as a result  the sale of the Company's ""lead"" and ""plastics"" operations in accordance with article L. 631-22 of the French Commercial Code. This assumes  however  that the remaining conditions attached to this offer can be lifted in the near future.At the same time  the Company may study the feasibility of a legal solution for restructuring its debt and the continuation (or sale) of its holding company activity or the sale of the related stake in Recytech S.A.In the event of the opening of reorganization proceedings (“redressement judiciaire”) it should be noted  however  that  given the importance of the debts and other liabilities  and the low value of the assets resulting from the offers received  the prospects of the adoption of a reorganization plan (“plan de redressement”)  in parallel with the envisaged “prépack cession”  remain uncertain.In view of the above  there are no plans at this stage to resume the listing of Recylex S.A. shares.***1 The Latin expression in bonis refers to the situation in which a natural person or legal entity normally has all the rights to its assets.2 Recylex S.A. has made provisions for only €8.5 million in respect of the litigation with SNCF Réseau  in which the Company was ordered in the first instance to pay €63 million jointly and severally with Retia SASU  and the costs of rehabilitation (€9.7 million) would be transferred to the purchaser of the Estaque site in the event of sale  with a tiers demandeur mechanism (Article L. 512-21 of the French Environmental Code).3 Article L631-4 of the Commercial Code.4 See press releases of May 14  2020 and May 20  2020.5. Article L. 512-21 of the Environmental Code.6. As a reminder  the first and second ranking pledges cover certain financial commitments of the Company or its former German subsidiaries to Glencore International AG  which are detailed in Note 30 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2020.7. The nominal amount of the better fortunes clause amounts to €19.2 million  of which €17.8 million is owed to Glencore International AG.8.

(""VAM Investments SPAC"" or the ""Company"") is a private limited liability company incorporated under Dutch law (besloten vennootschap met beperkte aansprakelijkheid)  with its statutory seat in Amsterdam  the Netherlands  and its registered office at Via Manzoni 3  20121 Milan  Italy  and registered in the Trade Register of the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (handelsregister van de Kamer van Koophandel) under number 82465207  and operating under the laws of the Netherlands. The Company's Legal Entity Identifier is 724500WU54AQ8OJ2SU41. VAM Investments SPAC was admitted to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam  the regulated market operated by Euronext Amsterdam N.V. (""Euronext Amsterdam"") on 19 July 2021 following an initial public offering (""IPO"") of Units (as defined below) pursuant to which it raised €210 326 560 in gross proceeds (the ""IPO Proceeds""). VAM Investments SPAC is a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (""SPAC"") and was incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger  demerger  share exchange  asset acquisition  share purchase  reorganisation or similar business combination with  or acquisition of  a business or company (a ""Target"") (a ""Business Combination"") operating in the consumer products and services sector (the ""Target Sector"") that is headquartered or operating in the European Economic Area  Switzerland or the United Kingdom  although it may pursue a Business Combination opportunity in any geography  industry or sector. VAM Investments Group S.p.A. is the sponsor of the Company (the ""Sponsor""). Each unit sold to investors in the IPO comprised (the ""Units""): (i) one ordinary share in the share capital of the Company  each having a nominal value of €0.01 (jointly  the ""Ordinary Shares""); and (ii)a right to receive one-half (1/2) of a redeemable warrant issued by the Company (jointly  the ""Warrants""). During the exercise period described in the Prospectus (as defined below)  each whole Warrant entitles an eligible holder to acquire one Ordinary Share  at the exercise price of €11.50 per Ordinary Share  subject to certain anti-dilution provisions  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Warrants and the Founder Warrants (as defined below) as published on the Company's website (the ""Warrant T&Cs""). The Units traded on Euronext Amsterdam as Ordinary Shares with (cum) a right to acquire one-half (1/2) of Warrant until 27 July 2021  on which day a distribution in kind was made at the expense of the general share premium reserve maintained by the Company  whereby one-half (1/2) of a Warrant was distributed to each holder of Ordinary Shares on the record date (the ""Distribution"")  after which the Ordinary Shares and the whole Warrants commenced trading separately on Euronext Amsterdam. Entitlements to fractions of Warrants were forfeited. Since the IPO  we have been focusing on finding the right Target for our SPAC. Whilst we have reviewed  and are reviewing  multiple potential Targets  at the date of this management report  we have not yet selected a Target that could be proposed to the Business Combination EGM (as defined below). We continue our search for a Business Combination with a Target  which is to be completed within the 24-month period from the settlement date of the IPO (the settlement date of the IPO  being 21 July 2021  the ""Settlement Date"")  being 21 July 2023  plus an additional six months subject to approval by the general meeting (algemene vergadering) of the Company (the ""General Meeting"") (the ""Business Combination Deadline"")  as announced in the prospectus relating to the IPO dated 14 July 2021 (the ""Prospectus""). If the Company proposes to complete a Business Combination  it will convene an extraordinary General Meeting and propose the Business Combination to the Company's shareholders (the ""Business Combination EGM""). The resolution by the Board (as defined below) to complete a Business Combination will require the prior approval of a simple majority of the votes cast on the Ordinary Shares and the Founder Shares (as defined below) at the Business Combination EGM. If a proposed Business Combination is not approved at the Business Combination EGM  the Company may (i) provide notice of a subsequent General Meeting and submit the same proposed Business Combination for approval or (ii) seek other potential Targets  provided that the Business Combination must be completed prior to the Business Combination Deadline. VAM Investments SPAC suffered an after-tax loss of €3 154 802.43 over the period from 7 April 2021 (date of incorporation of VAM Investments SPAC) until 31 December 2021. VAM Investments SPAC has not recorded any operational revenues. The result is attributable to the Negative Interest (as defined below) rate payable on the Escrow Account (as defined below) plus a change in the market value of the Warrants and incurring expenses  commissions and taxes in connection with the IPO and the subsequent search for a Business Combination. The Negative Interest in respect of the IPO Proceeds held in the Escrow Account from 21 July 2021 to 31 December 2021 was paid from the part of the Negative Interest Cover (as defined below) deposited in the Escrow Account  so that the entire amount of IPO Proceeds was still held in the Escrow Account at 31 December 2021. About VAM Investments SPAC B.V. Capital structure At incorporation  the Company issued 1 share with a nominal value of €1.00 to the Sponsor. Following the IPO and the concurrent private placement with the Sponsor  the Company's issued capital was increased to €1 262 908.20  as at 31 December 2021 consisting of the following: (i) €52 581.64  representing approximately 4.16% of the Company's issued capital  consisting of 5 258 164 founder shares  each having a nominal value of €0.01 (the ""Founder Shares"")  acquired by the Sponsor for an aggregate issue price of €9 809 796.80. The Founder Shares shall not share in any profits nor in the reserves of the Company  other than in case of a Liquidation (as defined below) in accordance with a pre-determined order of priority as laid down in the Company's articles of association as in force on the date hereof (the ""Articles of Association""). The Founder Shares will be converted into newly issued Ordinary Shares following a Business Combination on a one-for-one basis  subject to adjustment for share sub-divisions  share capitalizations  reorganizations  recapitalizations and the like  in accordance with the promote schedule the terms of which are set out in the Prospectus;(ii) €200 000  representing approximately 15.84% of the Company's issued capital  consisting of the founder share f1 in the Company with a nominal value of €200 000 (the ""Founder Share F1"")  subscribed by the Sponsor for an issue price of €200 000;(iii) €210 326.56  representing approximately 16.65% of the Company's issued capital  consisting of 21 032 656 Ordinary Shares  each having a nominal value of €0.01  acquired by the investors in the IPO as part of the Units for an aggregate issue price of €210 326 560; and(iv) €800 000  representing approximately 63.35% of the Company's issued capital  consisting of the 80 000 000 Treasury Shares (as defined below)  each having a nominal value of €0.01. As part of the IPO and the concurrent private placement with the Sponsor  the Company further: (i) transferred 10 516 328 Warrants to holders of Ordinary Shares as part of the Distribution; and(ii) issued 9 809 796 rights to subscribe for one ordinary share in the capital of the Company (the ""Founder Warrants"")  for no consideration  which are deemed embedded in and form part of the Founder Share F1 held by the Sponsor. During the exercise period described in the Prospectus  each whole Founder Warrant entitles an eligible holder to acquire one newly issued Ordinary Share  at the exercise price of €11.50 per Ordinary Share  subject to certain anti-dilution provisions  in accordance with the Warrant T&Cs. Ordinary Shares and Warrants held in treasury On the Settlement Date  the Company issued to  and immediately repurchased from  the Sponsor (i) 80 000 000 Ordinary Shares (""Treasury Shares"") and (ii) 40 000 000 Warrants  all at the same value (so that no net proceeds remained with or were due by the Company)  for the purpose of holding these in treasury for purposes of  inter alia  (i) the delivery of Ordinary Shares upon the exercise of the Warrants  (ii) the transfer of Warrants as part of the Distribution; and (iii) for future issuances of securities of the Company that are convertible into  exchangeable for or exercisable for Ordinary Shares to fund  or otherwise in connection with  the Business Combination. As long as the Treasury Shares are held in treasury  they will not yield dividends or rights to other distributions  will not entitle the Company as a holder thereof to voting rights  will not count towards the calculation of dividends  or other distributions or voting percentages  and will not be eligible for redemption. As long as the Warrants are held in treasury  they will not be exercisable. The Treasury Shares and Warrants held in treasury are admitted to listing and trading on Euronext Amsterdam. No Business Combination by the Business Combination Deadline If the Company does not complete a Business Combination by the Business Combination Deadline  the Company intends to  as soon as reasonably possible  initiate a repurchase procedure allowing the holders of Ordinary Shares to receive a pro rata share of funds in the Escrow Account which  as a result of the Negative Interest Cover  is anticipated to be €10.00 per Ordinary Share. The Board (as defined below) will set and announce by press release an acceptance period for the repurchase of Ordinary Shares. Holders of Ordinary Shares will need to take steps to have their Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company  as will be set out by the Company around that time. Ordinary Shareholders who fail to participate in the repurchase procedure at such time are dependent on the Liquidation of the Company to receive any repayment in respect of their Ordinary Shares and such amount may be different from  and will be paid later than  that available if such holder of Ordinary Shares had participated in the repurchase procedure. Subsequently  the Company intends to  as soon as reasonably possible  and in any event  within no more than two months from the Business Combination Deadline  at the proposal of the Board convene a General Meeting for the purpose of adopting a resolution to (i) dissolve and liquidate the Company and (ii) delist the Ordinary Shares and the Warrants (the ""Liquidation""). In the event of a Liquidation  the distribution of the Company's assets and the allocation of the liquidation surplus shall be completed  after payment of the Company's creditors and settlement of its liabilities  in accordance with a pre-determined order of priority as laid down in the Articles of Association. There will be no distribution of proceeds or otherwise with respect to any of the Warrants or the Founder Warrants  and all such Warrants and Founder Warrants will automatically expire without value upon occurrence of such a Liquidation.

I n addition  in this initial stage  it will also widen the investors’ base for Oman by enhancing the ease of access and participation from foreign investors to invest in multi-currency fixed-income instruments with eurobond or Sukuk structures issued by the Oman government or Omani companies from Oman and listed on the MSX.This means that a foreign investor with an existing Euroclear account in Europe also does not need to incur the additional cost nor the hassle to open another CSD account with MCD in Oman to invest in an international eurobond or Sukuk structure issued from Oman.With easier access and more participation by foreign investors  this will hopefully encourage more primary and secondary trading activities and enhance the liquidity of the instruments and the MSX.As such  with this new initiative  we also hope to widen the issuers’ base and encourage more local and international institutions and companies to issue and dual list their multi-currency eurobonds or Sukuk in Oman and other countries connected to the Euroclear system.Al Salmi  Executive President of the CMA  also commented  “This is just the initial stage of our collaboration with Euroclear. In the next stage  we hope to provide full access to international investors with Euroclear accounts to invest and trade in any securities listed on the MSX  and not just fixed-income instruments with eurobond or Sukuk structures.”2022 © All right reserved for Oman Establishment for Press  Publication and Advertising (OEPPA) Provided by SyndiGate Media Inc.

T…,A new study from crypto insights firm Coincub is shedding light on the most accommodating markets in the world for the digital asset industry.Coincub’s latest report says that Germany has now replaced Singapore as the most crypto-friendly country on earth.The analytics firm highlights a number of key developments over the past year that have helped Europe’s largest economy to overtake Singapore.“Germany is already one of the world’s most crypto-friendly countries. The country also has the highest number of Bitcoin nodes besides the US  but with a smaller population and GDP demonstrating an even greater commitment to crypto. There have been several positive developments over the last few months.The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority issued a crypto custody business license for Coinbase’s German arm earlier this year. German stock market operator Deutsche Boerse has also listed more than 20 crypto exchange-traded products on its digital exchange  Xetra. The Sparkasse savings bank looking into offering wallets to trade crypto is a huge step for institutional acceptance.”With Singapore now ranked second  the United States now sits in third  followed by Australia  Switzerland and Hong Kong.Coincub says that the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has become a new country on the list  appearing at number 22 after previously taking a hard stance against crypto with bans on trading and other activity. India has moved up to number 19  but as Coincub says  suffers from indecisive government policy.Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get crypto email alerts delivered directly to your inboxFollow us on Twitter Facebook and TelegramCheck Latest News HeadlinesDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

It moved up 3 places from 2021 to take the top spot. Germany is already one of the world’s most crypto-friendly countries. The country also has the highest number of Bitcoin nodes besides the US  but with a smaller population and GDP demonstrating an even greater commitment to crypto.“There have been several positive developments over the last few months. The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority issued a crypto custody business license for Coinbase’s German arm earlier this year. German stock market operator Deutsche Boerse has also listed more than 20 crypto exchange-traded products on its digital exchange  Xetra. The Sparkasse savings bank looking into offering wallets to trade crypto is a huge step for institutional acceptance.“The report explained that although Singapore was #1 in Q4 2021 and it “remains a crypto and blockchain powerhouse”  it dropped to #2 because of “Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) hitting the brakes by issuing firm guidelines that Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) should not be allowed to advertise their services outside of their own websites and thus restricting the use of Bitcoin ATMs.”DisclaimerThe views and opinions expressed by the author  or any people mentioned in this article  are for informational purposes only  and they do not constitute financial  investment  or other advice.

3046,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://moneyweek.com/trading/604709/what-is-next-for-interdealer-broker-tp-icap,What is next for interdealer broker TP Icap?,TP Icap has struggled in a declining market  but there’s still a role for its services. Bruce Packard explains what that is.,When shareholder activists target financial firms  history is not encouraging. In 2005  there was an activist campaign to prevent Deutsche Boerse from buying the London Stock Exchange.Werner Seifert  the chief executive of the German exchange  lost his job and Rolf Breuer  chairman of the supervisory board  later resigned.Yet the Deutsche Boerse management could see value where the activists who disliked the deal could not. London Stock Exchange has increased in value by 16 times since the public spat.Then there was Knight Vinke’s activist campaign against HSBC during the 2007-2009 financial crisis  encouraging the bank to take more risk at precisely the wrong point in the credit cycle.More recently  hedge fund Elliott Management’s six-year fight with Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong and Edward Bramson’s three-year battle with Barclays both ended in failure.I think the reason for those activist failures is that financial companies tend to be run by dull  unimaginative finance types who try to create shareholder value by doing finance-type things: improve margins  cut costs and announce share buybacks. Any activist who buys the shares in a financial company is fighting an uphill battle  because management are already trying to do the obvious and it hasn’t been working.A declining marketNow an activist hedge fund called Phase 2 has taken a stake in TP Icap (LSE: TCAP)  the interdealer broker (IDB) formed from the all-share merger between Tullett Prebon and Icap in 2016.

(Euronext Paris: FR0000120388 - RX) (the ""Company"") notes  in light of the offers received in the context of the asset disposal process that the Company had initiated in May 2021  that (i) it will not have sufficient financial resources to allow a debt restructuring in an amicable framework  and (ii) it will be impossible to implement the envisaged asset disposal program in an in bonis1 framework.The offers received by the Company to date are as follows: An offer for the Escaudoeuvres and Villefranche-sur-Saône industrial sites and the shares of the subsidiary C2P S.A.S. for less than €2.5 million  allowing the preservation of the business and jobs (60 jobs in total); Two offers for the 50% stake in Recytech S.A. for a total of €40 million  this stake being subject to a first and second ranking pledge in favour of Glencore International AG; Offers valuing the discontinued Estaque site for an amount of less than €0.5 million (on the assumption of environmental rehabilitation obligations taken over by the potential buyer).This compares with total net debt of €52.2 million  plus provisions for environmental risks and liabilities of €16.2 million2  for a total of €68.4 million. The Company does not expect to receive any further offers in view of the extensive due diligence undertaken to find potential buyers.This asset disposal process was part of an amicable prevention procedure (conciliation)  which has been underway for several months  at the initiative of the Company  and which will end on April 15  2022  without a debt-restructuring plan having been approved.In addition  a significant portion of the Group's debt will also become due after April 15  2022.As a result  the Company will be in a state of cessation of payments and is preparing to file for reorganization proceedings (""redressement judiciaire"") before the Paris Commercial Court  under the conditions provided for by law3.The Company notes that the conditional offer received from Campine NV for the two industrial sites (including its subsidiary C2P S.A.S.  located at the Villefranche-sur-Saône site) is likely to maintain the activities of the Group's industrial sites and the associated jobs. However  it is still uncertain whether these conditions will be met.This offer remains subject to an agreement between Campine NV and the French government on the amounts of the financial guarantees that the buyer would have to put in place in the event of the takeover of the operation of these two sites  which are classified as ""Seveso"".If the Court grants the request for the opening of reorganization proceedings (""redressement judiciaire"")  this procedure will allow the examination by the Court of the offer received from Campine NV and the study of a judicial solution for the restructuring of the Company's debt.As this is the only offer for the industrial sites  the Company will request that Campine NV's offer be examined by the Paris Commercial Court according to the ""prépack cession"" procedure - which implies  in particular  an accelerated timetable - in order to limit the consequences on the activity and employment at the industrial sites.The asset disposal process carried out by the Company since May 2021  in parallel with the process of restructuring its debt  is thus in the hands of the Paris Commercial Court.In the event of the opening of reorganization proceedings (""redressement judiciaire"") it should be noted  however  that  given the importance of the debts and other liabilities  and the low value of the assets resulting from the offers received  the prospects of the adoption of a reorganization plan (""plan de redressement"")  in parallel with the envisaged ""prépack cession""  remain uncertain.***The Company reiterates below in more detail the announcements made today:1. Offers received for the Company's assets;2. Inability to present a debt restructuring plan in an amicable framework;3. Examination by the Paris Commercial Court of the offer received for the industrial sites in the context of the asset disposal process (""prépack cession"").1.Offers received for the Company's assetsThe Company's only assets to date are the following4: The Villefranche-sur-Saône and Escaudœuvres sites for the recycling of used lead-acid batteries  as well as the polypropylene waste recycling business of the subsidiary C2P S.A.S. located at the Villefranche-sur-Saône site; the 50% stake in Recytech S.A.; Discontinued mining and industrial sites  including the Estaque site in Marseille.Offer for the Villefranche-sur-Saône and Escaudœuvres sitesThe structured and competitive sales process conducted by the Company since May 2021 has enabled to identify and approach  through the intermediary of the investment bank ODDO BHF Corporate Finance  nearly 80 potential investors  to finally obtain a single offer for the Group's ""lead"" and ""plastics"" operations.This offer from Campine NV  a Belgian company listed on Euronext Brussels  would ensure the takeover of all the industrial activities and almost all employees of the Villefranche-sur-Saône and Escaudœuvres sites  including C2P S.A.S. (via a takeover of the corresponding stake)  while providing a new overall industrial vision for the years to come.This offer is likely to promote the sustainability of activities and jobs at sites that are fully committed to the lead and plastic waste recycling economy.The proceeds from the sale of all the industrial activities being less than €2.5 million  notably because of the significant investments to be made at these two sites  it would not contribute significantly to the restructuring of the Group's debtAt the date of publication of this press release  the offer received remains subject to certain conditions related to the level of the overall amount of the environmental financial guarantees to be provided by the buyer  in accordance with the provisions of articles L.516-1 and L.516-2 of the French Environmental Code. Discussions are currently underway between the Government departments concerned and the potential buyer. Given the nature of these conditions  the Company is not currently in a position to comment on the fulfilment and lifting of these conditions  which are beyond the Company's control.Offers concerning the discontinued Estaque siteThe discontinued Estaque site has been the subject of an environmental remediation program for several years. The Company has received proposals to acquire this site with a tiers demandeur mechanism5 that would allow a significant portion of the remaining remediation costs to be transferred to the buyer. The expected proceeds from the sale would be less than €0.5 million and would not contribute significantly to the restructuring of the Group's debt.Offers for the stake in Recytech S.A.The Company has received indicative offers of up to €40 million for its 50% stake in Recytech S.A. The proceeds from the sale of this stake are expected  based on the offers received  to be fully received by Glencore International AG  as the Company's main creditor and beneficiary of a first and second ranking pledge on the Company's stake in Recytech S.A. (it being specified that the amounts guaranteed by these pledges amount to €47.1 million as of March 31  20226). These offers are not likely to enable the Company's debts to be restructured and  by extension  its activities and jobs to be maintained.2.Inability to present a debt restructuring plan in an amicable frameworkGross financial debt and other liabilities amount to 82.3 million euro to date  as summarized below:Summary of known debts and liabilities In millions of euros Glencore International AG 27.5 European Commission 25.7 SNCF Réseau / Retia 2.9 Others 0.3 Financial debts 56.4 Rehabilitation of former mining sites and Estaque 13.4 Litigation Metaleurop Nord 4.0 Litigation SNCF Réseau 8.5 Provisions for other liabilities 25.9 Total provisioned debts and other liabilities 82.3 Cash and cash equivalents 4.2As consequence  the offers received do not provide the Company with sufficient financial resources to consider restructuring its debt.The imminent expiration and the failure of the current conciliation procedure  as well as the payability of a large part of the debt after April 15  2022  will lead the Company to declare a situation of cessation of payments under the conditions provided for by law and to request the opening of a Court-ordered reorganization proceedings (""redressement judiciaire"") in which the sale of the ""lead"" and ""plastic"" operations could be ordered by the Court.2.1.Significant debt and liabilities inherited from the pastNet financial debtAs of March 31  2022  the Company's net financial debt amounted to €52.2 million (excluding IFRS 16 rental debt).",negative,0.01,0.16,0.82,mixed,0.07,0.2,0.74,True,English,"['Recylex S A', 'Court-ordered reorganization proceedings', 'prépack cession', 'redressement judiciaire', 'disposal plan', 'industrial assets', 'debt restructuring', 'opening', 'implementation', 'Group', 'failure', 'subsidiary C2P S.A.S.', 'polypropylene waste recycling business', 'prépack cession"" procedure', 'Recytech S.A.', 'Saône industrial sites', 'Recylex S.A.', 'second ranking pledge', 'Glencore International AG', 'extensive due diligence', 'asset disposal program', 'competitive sales process', 'asset disposal process', 'sufficient financial resources', 'environmental rehabilitation obligations', 'Escaudœuvres sites', 'The European expert', 'Paris Commercial Court', 'Saône site', 'amicable prevention procedure', 'plan de redressement', 'Court-ordered reorganization proceedings', 'two industrial sites', 'total net debt', 'debt restructuring plan', 'disposal plan', 'two sites', 'Euronext Paris', 'reorganization plan', 'Estaque site', 'environmental risks', 'financial guarantees', 'debt-restructuring plan', 'amicable framework', 'redressement judiciaire', 'circular economy', 'bonis1 framework', 'potential buyers', 'several months', 'significant portion', 'Campine NV', 'French government', 'judicial solution', 'accelerated timetable', 'low value', 'lead-acid batteries', 'industrial assets', 'other liabilities', 'Two offers', 'The Company', 'associated jobs', 'conditional offer', '60 jobs', '15 April', 'Press', 'Filing', 'opening', 'implementation', 'Group', 'failure', 'RX', 'light', 'context', 'May', 'date', 'Escaudoeuvres', 'shares', 'less', 'preservation', '50% stake', 'first', 'favour', 'amount', 'assumption', 'provisions', 'view', 'part', 'conciliation', 'initiative', 'addition', 'result', 'state', 'cessation', 'payments', 'conditions', 'law', 'activities', 'agreement', 'place', 'takeover', 'operation', 'Seveso', 'request', 'examination', 'study', 'consequences', 'activity', 'employment', 'parallel', 'hands', 'importance', 'debts', 'prospects', 'adoption', 'detail', 'announcements', 'Inability', 'mining', 'Marseille', 'structured', 'intermedi', '8:45', '3.']",2022-04-16,2022-04-16,marketscreener.com

If  following realisation in full of the Secured Property relating to such Series  any outstanding claim remains unpaid  then such claim will be extinguished and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect thereof. C. KEY INFORMATION ON THE SECURITIES C.1 What are the main features of the ETC Securities? C.1.1 Type  class and ISIN Commodity-linked securities. ISIN Code: FR0013416716 Common Code: 199119532 C.1.2 Currency  denomination  par value  number of securities issued and duration The ETC Securities are denominated in USD. The ETC Securities are in bearer global form. For the purposes of the UK Prospectus Regulation  the Nominal Amount of each ETC Security (USD 5.085) shall be regarded as the denomination of such ETC Security. The ETC Securities are being treated by the Issuer as having a minimum denomination of less than €100 000. As at the issue date of the above tranche of ETC Securities  there will be 66 256 104.00 ETC Securities of this Series in issue. The scheduled maturity date (the ""Scheduled Maturity Date"") of the ETC Securities is 23 May 2118. C.1.3 Rights attached to the ETC Securities Overview The ETC Securities are designed to provide purchasers with exposure to Gold without having to take physical delivery of the Gold. The Issuer  under the Programme  may only issue ETC Securities to authorised participants appointed as such (each  an ""Authorised Participant""). Authorised Participants may  thereafter  offer such ETC Securities to retail clients  professional clients or other eligible counterparties (subject to certain selling restrictions contained in the Base Prospectus). The first tranche of the Series was issued on 23 May 2019 (the ""Series Issue Date"") to one or more Authorised Participants. Each ETC Security relates to a specific amount in weight of Gold  specified in the Final Terms  known as the ""Metal Entitlement"". In order to back its obligations under the ETC Securities  the Issuer will seek to hold enough Gold to meet its obligations under the ETC Securities. On the Series Issue Date  each ETC Security was ascribed with a Metal Entitlement (the ""Initial Metal Entitlement"") and on each subsequent day  the Metal Entitlement of each ETC Security shall be reduced by a percentage (the ""Total Expense Ratio"") determined as sufficient to fund the Issuer's ""all in one"" operational fee to Amundi Asset Management S.A.S (the ""Advisor""). In order to fund such ""all in one"" operational fee  HSBC Bank plc (the ""Metal Counterparty"") shall periodically liquidate an amount of Gold (the ""TER Metal"") equal to the accrued reductions (pursuant to the Total Expense Ratio) to the Metal Entitlement of all ETC Securities of the Series. The Total Expense Ratio shall cease to apply to an ETC Security for a Series on the earliest to occur of (i) a Buy-Back Trade Date relating to such ETC Security  (ii) an Early Redemption Trade Date relating to such Series and (iii) the Final Redemption Valuation Date for such Series. The Gold will be held for the Issuer by HSBC Bank plc (the ""Custodian"") and will generally be held on an ""allocated"" basis on the terms of the Custody Agreement in the relevant allocated account of the Issuer with the Custodian marked for the relevant series (the ""Allocated Account""). This means that the Gold is held in a segregated account held at the London vault of the Custodian in the name of the Issuer for the account of the relevant Series and all Gold in allocated form that is deposited with or received by the Custodian from time to time is held by the Custodian as bailee for the Issuer for that Series. There are times when amounts of the Gold may be held on an ""unallocated"" basis  for example to facilitate subscriptions. Subscription On any day (other than a Saturday or a Sunday) on which (i) Euronext Paris is open for business  (ii) the over-the-counter market of The London Bullion Market Association (the ""LBMA"") is open for business and (iii) commercial banks in Ireland are open for business (a ""Business Day"")  an Authorised Participant may request the Issuer to issue further ETC Securities to such Authorised Participant (a ""Subscription""). Prior to settlement of a Subscription  the Authorised Participant will be required to transfer to an unallocated account of the Issuer with the Custodian marked for such Series (the ""Unallocated Account"") an amount of Gold (the ""Subscription Settlement Amount"") equal to the product of (a) the Metal Entitlement on the relevant trade date (the ""Subscription Trade Date"") and (b) the total number of ETC Securities being issued. The Issuer will not issue ETC Securities to an Authorised Participant until the Subscription Settlement Amount has been received in the Unallocated Account and allocated to the Allocated Account for the Series. In connection with each Subscription  the Authorised Participant will also be required to pay to the Issuer a subscription fee (the ""Subscription Fee""). Buy-Backs On any Business Day  an Authorised Participant may request that the Issuer buys back ETC Securities from such Authorised Participant (a ""Buy-Back""). Prior to settlement of a Buy-Back  the Authorised Participant will be required to deliver to the Issuing and Paying Agent on behalf of the Issuer the relevant ETC Securities being bought back. The Issuer will not cancel such ETC Securities and deliver to the Authorised Participant an amount of Gold (the ""Buy-Back Settlement Amount"") equal to the product of (1) the Metal Entitlement on the relevant trade date (the ""Buy-Back Trade Date"") and (2) the total number of ETC Securities being bought back  until the Issuing and Paying Agent has confirmed receipt of such ETC Securities. In connection with each Buy-Back  the Authorised Participant will also be required to pay to the Issuer a buy-back fee (the ""Buy-Back Fee""). Future Buy-Backs and Early and Final Redemption At any given time  the Gold standing to the credit of the Allocated Account should at least equal the aggregate Metal Entitlement for all ETC Securities still outstanding for such Series. Such Gold will fund the delivery of any future Buy-Back Settlement Amounts and the payment of any ""Early Redemption Amount"" or ""Final Redemption Amount"" (each as defined below) in respect of each ETC Security. Security The obligations of the Issuer under the ETC Securities will be secured pursuant to a security deed governed by the laws of Ireland and a security deed governed by English law by security interests over the rights of the Issuer under the agreements entered into by it in respect of the ETC Securities and the underlying Gold. The assets and property that are the subject of such security interests are known as ""Secured Property"" for this Series. Securityholders will not  by reason of holding such Series  have any claim against the Secured Property with respect to any other series of ETC Securities. The security over the Secured Property in respect of a Series of ETC Securities will become enforceable if payment of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount  as applicable  is not made in full when due on the Scheduled Maturity Date or the relevant Early Redemption Settlement Date  as applicable. Limited Recourse and Ranking The ETC Securities will rank equally amongst themselves. The rights of Securityholders are limited in recourse to the Secured Property. As such  once the Secured Property has been realised and the net proceeds distributed  none of the parties or anyone acting on their behalves may take further steps against the Issuer or its directors  officers  members or administrator to recover any further sum and no debt will be owed by the Issuer in respect of such sum. Any proceeds of the Secured Property will be applied in accordance with the priorities of payments set out in the terms and conditions and  therefore  the rights of Securityholders will rank in accordance therewith. As a result of such provisions  the Securityholders of a Series may not receive in full the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount payable in respect of each ETC Security of such Series if the proceeds of the Secured Property are insufficient to meet the claims of all secured creditors of such Series. Interest The ETC Securities will not pay periodic interest but the Early Redemption Amount or Final Redemption Amount  as applicable  may incorporate an interest redemption premium to the extent such Early Redemption Amount or Final Redemption Amount  as applicable  exceeds the issue price per ETC Security for the first tranche of the Series. Where the value of the Metal comprising the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security is trading at or below an amount equal to the Nominal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount (each as defined below)  a Specified Interest Amount may be payable by the Issuer as part of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount payable per ETC Security  as the case may be  which amount shall represent interest on the Nominal Amount. Final Redemption of the ETC Securities Unless previously redeemed in whole or purchased and cancelled by the Issuer  each ETC Security will become due and payable on the Scheduled Maturity Date at its Final Redemption Amount. The ""Final Redemption Amount"" for a Series shall be an amount (which amount may incorporate an interest redemption premium  being any excess over the issue price per ETC Security for the first tranche of such Series) denominated in USD per ETC Security equal to the greater of: the product of (a) the Metal Entitlement (expressed in fine troy ounces) as at the date falling 40 Business Days prior to the scheduled maturity date (the ""Final Redemption Valuation Date""  subject to postponement in certain circumstances) and (b) the average price ascribed to each fine troy ounce of Metal held in the Allocated Account on the Final Redemption Valuation Date based on (1) the proceeds received on any Metal sold prior to the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled maturity date and (2) the reference price for the Metal as published on the relevant price source for such Series (or any successor or replacement price source) in respect of any Metal not sold prior to the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the scheduled maturity date; andan amount equal to 10 per cent. of the issue price per ETC Security on the Series Issue Date (the ""Nominal Amount"") plus an amount equal to 1 per cent. of the Nominal Amount (the ""Specified Interest Amount""). Early Redemption of the ETC Securities The ETC Securities shall become due and payable prior to their scheduled maturity date at its Early Redemption Amount due to the occurrence of any of the following events if  following the occurrence of any such event  the Issuer (and/or  in the case of a Market Value Redemption Event or an Event of Default  the Trustee following requisite direction by the Securityholders) has given notice designating an early redemption of the ETC Securities in full: the Issuer at any time and for any reason elects to early redeem the ETC Securities in full (an ""Issuer Call Redemption Event"");on the next date on which a delivery of Metal is due (whether in respect of a Subscription  a Buy-Back or a sale of TER Metal)  the Issuer is  or there is a substantial likelihood that it will be  required to make payment in respect of VAT or register for VAT or otherwise account for VAT on such delivery of Metal  or the Issuer has become liable  or become aware that it is liable  for VAT in respect of a prior delivery of Metal (a ""VAT Redemption Event"");certain key service providers of the Issuer resign or their appointment in relation to such Series is terminated for any reason and no successor or replacement has been appointed within 120 calendar days (a ""Service Provider Non-Replacement Redemption Event"");the prevailing value of an ETC Security on two consecutive non-disrupted days (calculated by the Administrator by reference to each ETC Security's Metal Entitlement and the ""Metal Reference Price"" (being the LBMA Gold Price or such successor Metal Reference Price as may be determined from time to time) on each such non-disrupted day) is less than or equal to 20 per cent. of the issue price per ETC Security (calculated by reference to each ETC Security's Metal Entitlement and the Metal Reference Price) as at the Series Issue Date (a ""Market Value Redemption Event""); oran event of default occurs including certain breaches by the Issuer of its obligations that are not cured within the applicable cure period and certain insolvency events with respect to the Issuer (an ""Event of Default""). The ""Early Redemption Amount"" shall be an amount (which amount may incorporate an interest redemption premium  being any excess over the issue price per ETC Security for the first tranche of such Series) denominated in USD per ETC Security equal to the greater of: the product of (a) the Metal Entitlement (expressed in fine troy ounces) as at the date specified in the relevant notice designating an Issuer Call Redemption Event  a VAT Redemption Event  a Service Provider Non-Replacement Redemption Event  a Market Value Redemption Event or an Event of Default  as applicable (the ""Early Redemption Trade Date""  subject to postponement in certain circumstances) and (b) the average price ascribed to each fine troy ounce of Metal held in the Allocated Account on the Early Redemption Trade Date based on (1) the proceeds received on any Metal sold prior to the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the 40th Business Day following the Early Redemption Trade Date (such 40th Business Day following the Early Redemption Trade Date  the ""Metal Sale Cut-Off Date"") and (2) the reference price for the Metal as published on the relevant price source for such Series (or any successor or replacement price source) in respect of any Metal not sold prior to the fifth Business Day immediately preceding the Metal Sale Cut-Off Date; andthe Nominal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount. Payment of any Early Redemption Amount or the Final Redemption Amount is subject at all times to the limited recourse provisions. Withholding Tax All payments in respect of the ETC Securities will be made net of and after allowance for any withholding or deduction for  or on account of  any taxes. In the event that any withholding  reduction or deduction for  or on account of  any tax applies to payments in respect of the ETC Securities of any Series  the Securityholders will be subject to such tax or reduction or deduction and will not be entitled to receive amounts to compensate for any such tax or reduction or deduction. No Event of Default will occur as a result of any such withholding or deduction. Governing Law The ETC Securities will be governed by Irish law. There will be two security trust deeds relating to each Series of ETC Securities - one will be governed by Irish law and the other will be governed by English law. C.1.4 Rank of the ETC Securities in the Issuer's capital structure upon insolvency The ETC Securities are secured  limited recourse obligations of the Issuer and the ETC Securities of a series rank equally amongst themselves. The obligations of the Issuer in respect of a Series are secured by the Secured Property. The security over the Secured Property in respect of a Series will become enforceable if payment of the Final Redemption Amount or Early Redemption Amount  as applicable  is not made in full when due on the scheduled maturity date or the relevant early redemption settlement date  as applicable. C.1.5 Restrictions on free transferability of the securities Interests in ETC Securities traded in any clearing system will be transferred in accordance with the procedures and regulations of that clearing system. The ETC Securities will be freely transferable  subject to certain restrictions on sales of ETC Securities into  amongst other jurisdictions  the United Kingdom  the United States  Italy  Switzerland and any European Economic Area countries to whose competent authority the Base Prospectus has not been notified or passported. These restrictions are mainly targeting offerings to the public in such jurisdictions unless certain exemptions apply although some of the restrictions are blanket prohibitions on the offering of the ETC Securities in the relevant jurisdiction. The ETC Securities are subject to U.S. tax law requirements. C.2 Where will the ETC Securities be traded? Application has been made for the ETC Securities to be admitted to listing on  and trading on the regulated markets of  Euronext Paris  Euronext Amsterdam and the Deutsche Börse  and to listing on and trading on the main market of the London Stock Exchange. The ETC Securities may also be listed and/or admitted to trading on such other or further stock exchanges as may be agreed between the Issuer and the Arranger at some point in the future. C.3 What are the key risks that are specific to the ETC Securities? The value  the secondary market price and the Early Redemption Amount or Final Redemption Amount  as applicable  of each ETC Security of a Series will be affected by movements in the price of the Metal  market perception  the creditworthiness of certain transaction parties and the liquidity of the ETC Securities in the secondary market. The price of the Metal (and  by extension  the price of the ETC Security) can go down as well as up and the performance of the Metal in any future period may not mirror its past performance.Gold is generally more volatile than most other asset classes  making investments in Gold riskier and more complex than other investments  and the secondary market price of the ETC Securities may demonstrate similar volatility.The reduction of the Metal Entitlement by the Total Expense Ratio and the imposition of Subscription Fees and Buy-Back Fees on Authorised Participants (which are likely to be passed on to investors) may prove unattractive to investors who are interested solely in the price movement of the Metal and there can be no assurance that the performance of the Metal will be sufficient to offset the effect of the Total Expense Ratio and such fees.The Issuer may elect to trigger an Issuer Call Redemption Event and redeem all the ETC Securities of a Series early on giving not less than 30 calendar days' notice to Securityholders.The Total Expense Ratio may be varied by the Issuer at the request of the Advisor from time to time provided that no increase may occur on less than 30 days' notice to Securityholders.VAT may become due on transfers of Metal to or by the Issuer in certain circumstances. This could adversely affect the Issuer's ability to meet its obligations under the ETC Securities of the relevant Series in full and could trigger a VAT Redemption Event leading to the early redemption of all the ETC Securities of such Series.Investing in the ETC Securities will not make an investor the owner of the Metal held by the Custodian (or a Sub-Custodian on behalf of the Custodian) in respect of the relevant Series. Any early or final redemption of the ETC Securities of a Series will be settled in cash.ETC Securities may have a long term and an investor who is not an Authorised Participant can only realise value from a ETC Security prior to the occurrence of an early redemption event or the scheduled maturity date by selling it at its then market price to an Authorised Offeror or to other investors on the secondary market. While each Authorised Participant may make a market for the relevant Series  no Authorised Participant is obliged to make a market for any Series and an Authorised Participant may discontinue making a market at any time. Furthermore  any market in ETC Securities may not be liquid and the secondary market price (if any) for ETC Securities may be substantially less than the price paid by the investor.The Nominal Amount plus the Specified Interest Amount operates as a minimum repayment amount on the early or final redemption of the ETC Securities of a Series. In the event that the liquidation proceeds of the Metal Entitlement for each ETC Security of such Series is insufficient to fund the Nominal Amount and the Specified Interest Amount payable in respect of such ETC Security on such early or final redemption  the holder of such ETC Security may not receive payment of the Nominal Amount and/or the Specified Interest Amount in full and may receive substantially less. In respect of each ETC Security  payment of the Specified Interest Amount to Securityholders will rank in priority to payment of the Nominal Amount.The Issuer and the Securityholders are exposed to the creditworthiness of the Metal Counterparty  the Custodian and the Authorised Participants.The Custodian is required  under the Custody Agreement  to verify that the Metal delivered by the Authorised Participants in exchange for ETC Securities complies with ""The Good Delivery Rules for Gold and Silver Bars"" published by the LBMA. Such verification may not fully prevent the deposit of Metal by Authorised Participants that fail to meet the required purity standards.The Arranger  Advisor  Trustee  Security Trustee  Administrator  Custodian  Authorised Participants  Metal Counterparty  each Agent and/or their affiliates may actively trade or hold positions in the Metal and other financial instruments based on or related to the Metal. Such activities present conflicts of interest and could adversely affect the price and liquidity of ETC Securities. D. KEY INFORMATION ON THE ADMISSION TO TRADING ON A REGULATED MARKET D.1 Under which conditions and timetable can I invest in this security? Upon initial issue  the ETC Securities are being made available by the Issuer for subscription only to entities (the ""Authorised Participants"") allowed to buy and sell ETC Securities directly from and to the Issuer pursuant an authorised participant agreement with the Issuer. Authorised Participants will pay for any such subscriptions by delivering Metal equal to the Metal Entitlement per ETC Security of the ETC Securities being subscribed. Authorised Participants may also act as market makers  i.e. they buy and sell ETC Securities from and to investors on an over-the-counter basis or via a stock exchange. However  not all market makers need to be Authorised Participants. Any offer or sale of ETC Securities to an investor by an Authorised Participant or other distributor or broker authorised to use the Base Prospectus (each  an ""Authorised Offeror"") will be made in accordance with any terms and other arrangements in place between such Authorised Offeror and such investor including as to price  allocations and settlement arrangements. It will be the responsibility of the applicable financial intermediary at the time of such offer to provide the investor with that information. None of the Issuer  the Arranger nor any other Transaction Party (other than the relevant Authorised Offeror) will be a party to any such arrangements with investors and  accordingly  the Base Prospectus and the Final Terms may not contain such information and  in such case  an investor must obtain such information from the relevant Authorised Offeror. D.2 Why has the prospectus been produced? D.2.1 Reason for the offer and use of proceeds The ETC Securities offer investors a relatively easy means of gaining exposure to the movement in spot prices of gold and provide an alternative means of gaining exposure that is very similar to a direct investment in gold. Although the ETC Securities are not the exact equivalent of an investment in gold  they provide investors with an alternative that allows a level of participation in the gold market through the securities market. The net proceeds from the issue of a Series of ETC Securities will be an amount of Metal which will ultimately be held in the Allocated Account(s) in respect of such Series. Such Metal shall be used to meet the Issuer's obligations under such Series. D.2.2 Material conflicts of interest pertaining to the offer or admission to trading At the date of the Base Prospectus  the arranger to the Programme (the ""Arranger"") is Amundi Asset Management S.A.S who also acts as the Advisor to the Issuer in respect of each Series  performing certain functions and determinations on behalf of the Issuer pursuant to an advisory agreement. Amundi Asset Management S.A.S. is ultimately owned by Crédit Agricole S.A. Any member within Crédit Agricole S.A. or the Crédit Agricole group  and any of the directors of the foregoing  may (a) have an interest in the ETC Securities issued by the Issuer or in any transaction effected with or for it  or a relationship of any description with any other person  which may involve a potential conflict with their respective duties to the Arranger and Advisor  and (b) deal with or otherwise use the services of Crédit Agricole group companies in connection with the performance of such duties  and none of them will be liable to account for any profit or remuneration derived from so doing. A Crédit Agricole group entity and/or its affiliates may engage in trading and market-making activities and may hold long or short positions in any metal  other instruments or derivative products based on or related to the metal  metal for their proprietary accounts or for other accounts under their management. Crédit Agricole group entities may also issue securities or enter into financial instruments in relation to Gold. To the extent that any Crédit Agricole group entity  directly or through its affiliates  serves as issuer  agent  manager  sponsor or underwriter of such securities or other instruments  its interests with respect to such products may be adverse to those of the Securityholders. Such activities may have an adverse effect on the value of the ETC Securities and/or the value of the underlying Gold relating to the ETC Securities.",neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,neutral,0.03,0.91,0.06,True,English,"['Amundi Asset Management', 'Final Terms', '2 King Edward Street London EC1A 1HQ PROVISIONS', 'Secured Precious Metal Linked ETC Securities Programme', 'TRANSACTION PARTIES Additional Paying Agent(s', 'AMUNDI PHYSICAL METALS PLC ETC Securities', '5HQ Jane Street Financial Limited', '3BUY Flow Traders B.V.', 'Amundi Physical Gold ETC Tranche Number', '0.04 fine troy ounces Metal Entitlement', 'Amundi Physical Metals plc Series', 'Amundi Physical Metal Plc', 'BNP Paribas Arbitrage SNC', 'FEES Total Expense Ratio', 'Relevant Regulatory Law Reference Date', 'Paris Merrill Lynch International', '9 1018 LL Amsterdam Optiver VOF', 'other Relevant Member State', 'Other Information LISTING Listing', 'ETC SECURITIES Non-exempt Offer', 'Initial Metal Entitlement', 'HSBC Bank plc', 'Amundi Asset Management', 'FINAL TERMS Final Terms', 'Authorised Offeror(s', 'Deutsche Börse', 'retained EU law', 'Subscription Trade Date', 'Contractual Terms Terms', 'Current Base Prospectus', '00 Metal Entitlement', 'Specified Interest Amount', 'UK Prospectus Regulation', 'REDEMPTION Nominal Amount', 'Series Issue Date', '20 Fenchurch Street', 'GENERAL TERMS Issuer', '339 Aggregate Number', 'Tranche(s', 'GENERAL PROVISIONS', '26,000.00 ETC Securities', 'London EC3M', 'relevant Tranche', 'Regulatory Announcement', 'Full information', 'Part B', 'Euronext Paris', 'ETC Security', '1077 ZX Amsterdam', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Nominal Amount.', '3982048 Issue Date', 'Maturity Date', 'first Tranche', 'Issue Price', 'EQS Group', 'European Union', 'Withdrawal) Act', '8 Canada Square', 'Canary Wharf', 'Jacob Bontiusplaats', '1 Rue Laffitte', '10 per cent', '1 per cent', 'competent authority', 'regulated market', 'Part A', 'registered office', 'TRADING APPLICATION', 'GLDA', 'Dissemination', 'content', 'purposes', 'Conditions', 'May', 'Supplement', 'document', 'Article', 'conjunction', 'July', 'respect', 'basis', 'combination', '20 April', 'Board', 'approval', 'issuance', '25 April', 'E14', 'Floor', 'Strawinskylaan', 'annum', 'Austria', 'France', 'Germany', 'Luxembourg', 'Netherlands', 'Spain', 'Sweden', 'accordance', 'ADMISSION', 'behalf', '3095']",2022-04-16,2022-04-16,uk.sports.yahoo.com

3059,EuroNext,Bing API,https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/04/are-microbes-the-future-of-recycling-its-complicated/2/,Are microbes the future of recycling? It’s complicated,In 2020  Marty and colleagues at Carbios  along with researchers in France  announced that they had engineered an enzyme—a so-called cutinase  naturally found in microbes that decompose leaves—that could withstand warmer temperatures and convert nearly an entire batch of PET into monomers in a matter of hours.,Enzymatic recycling’s promise isn’t limited to PET; the approach can potentially be applied to other plastics  including polyurethane  used in foam  insulation  and paint. But PET offers perhaps the most expansive commercial opportunity: It is one of the largest categories of plastics produced  widely used in food packaging and fabrics. PET-based beverage bottles are among the easiest plastics to collect and recycle into a marketable product.Traditional depolymerization technologies rely on inorganic catalysts rather than enzymes. But some chemical recycling companies have struggled in efforts to turn PET recycling into a viable business model—with some even facing legal scrutiny.Despite this  Marty says that Carbios’ enzyme-based approach offers advantages over traditional depolymerization methods: The enzymes are more chemically selective than synthetic catalysts—they can more precisely target specific sites on specific molecules—and could therefore yield purer product. Plus they work at relatively low reactor temperatures and do not require expensive  hazardous solvents.Traditionally  however  the problem with enzymes has been that they work slowly and can destabilize under heat. In early experiments  it sometimes took weeks to process just a fraction of a batch of PET. In 2020  Marty and colleagues at Carbios  along with researchers in France  announced that they had engineered an enzyme—a so-called cutinase  naturally found in microbes that decompose leaves—that could withstand warmer temperatures and convert nearly an entire batch of PET into monomers in a matter of hours. The discovery dramatically boosted enzymatic recycling’s commercial prospects; In the 10 months that followed  Carbios’ stock price on the Euronext Paris exchange grew about eightfold.Last September  Carbios began testing its technology at a demonstration facility near its headquarters in Clermont-Ferrand  France  about a two-hour drive west of Lyon. Used PET arrives here as thin  pre-processed flakes about one-fifth of an inch across. In a 16-foot-tall reactor  the flakes are mixed with the patented cutinase enzymes —produced by Denmark-based biotechnology company Novozymes—and warmed to a little above 140° Fahrenheit. Within 10 hours  Marty says  95 percent of the plastic fed to the reactor  the equivalent of 100 000 plastic bottles  can be converted into monomers  which are then filtered  purified  and prepared for use in plastic manufacturing. (The remaining 5 percent  made up of unreacted plastic and impurities  is incinerated.) As Marty describes it  the end product is physically indistinguishable from the petrochemical-based substances used to manufacture virgin PET.AdvertisementCarbios’ recycling technology has grabbed the attention of some of the world’s largest consumer goods companies. L’Oréal  Nestlé  and PepsiCo have collaborated with the startup to produce proof-of-concept bottles  and all seem intent on eventually putting enzyme-recycled plastic on shelves.But Kate Bailey  the policy and research director at Eco-Cycle  a nonprofit recycler based in Colorado  says that over her 20 years in the recycling industry  she has grown skeptical of biotechnology fixes like the one being touted by Carbios. While she acknowledges that new solutions are needed  given the urgency of the plastic problem  she says “we don’t have more years to figure this out and wait for new technology.” Bailey points to lingering questions about how enzymatic recycling will be scaled up to handle commercial volumes  including questions about its energy footprint and its handling of toxic chemical additives found in many consumer plastics.Marty concedes that Carbios’ process is  indeed  more energy-intensive than conventional recycling—he declined to specify by how much—but added that it’s not fair to compare enzymatic recycling with thermomechanical processes  which don’t produce as high quality of a recycled product and eventually result in the same quantity of waste. Still  he said  it requires less energy  and releases less greenhouse gas  than producing virgin PET from petroleum—claims that are supported by an independent analysis published last year by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory. As for additives  he says they are filtered out during post-reaction processing and incinerated.But the most stubborn hurdle for Carbios and other enzymatic recycling hopefuls may be an economic one. “It’s super cheap to make virgin plastic  especially with the low price of oil ” said Bailey.“You have to be able to sell your recycled PET to some company that also has the option of buying virgin PET ” she added  “and when virgin is just cheaper  then that’s what companies buy.”,negative,0.06,0.26,0.68,negative,0.03,0.13,0.84,True,English,"['microbes', 'future', 'recycling', 'U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory', 'largest consumer goods companies', 'other enzymatic recycling hopefuls', 'Traditional depolymerization technologies', 'viable business model', 'traditional depolymerization methods', 'expensive, hazardous solvents', 'Euronext Paris exchange', 'L’Oréal', 'many consumer plastics', 'less greenhouse gas', 'expansive commercial opportunity', 'PET-based beverage bottles', 'chemical recycling companies', 'thin, pre-processed flakes', 'toxic chemical additives', 'Denmark-based biotechnology company', 'Carbios’ stock price', 'low reactor temperatures', 'Carbios’ enzyme-based approach', 'Carbios’ recycling technology', 'less energy', 'energy footprint', 'other plastics', 'largest categories', 'low price', 'warmer temperatures', 'biotechnology fixes', 'recycling industry', 'conventional recycling', 'commercial prospects', 'concept bottles', 'commercial volumes', '100,000 plastic bottles', 'food packaging', 'easiest plastics', 'inorganic catalysts', 'legal scrutiny', 'synthetic catalysts', 'specific sites', 'specific molecules', 'early experiments', 'demonstration facility', '16-foot-tall reactor', 'petrochemical-based substances', 'research director', 'nonprofit recycler', 'new solutions', 'new technology', 'thermomechanical processes', 'high quality', 'same quantity', 'independent analysis', 'post-reaction processing', 'stubborn hurdle', 'PET recycling', 'Carbios’ process', 'plastic manufacturing', 'unreacted plastic', 'enzyme-recycled plastic', 'virgin plastic', 'marketable product', 'purer product', 'end product', 'entire batch', 'Used PET', 'remaining 5 percent', 'virgin PET', 'lingering questions', 'economic one', 'plastic problem', 'Kate Bailey', 'cutinase enzymes', '95 percent', 'promise', 'polyurethane', 'foam', 'insulation', 'paint', 'fabrics', 'efforts', 'Marty', 'advantages', 'heat', 'weeks', 'fraction', 'colleagues', 'researchers', 'France', 'microbes', 'monomers', 'matter', 'hours', 'discovery', '10 months', 'headquarters', 'Clermont-Ferrand', 'two-hour', 'Lyon', 'one-fifth', 'inch', 'Novozymes', '140° Fahrenheit', 'equivalent', 'impurities', 'Advertisement', 'attention', 'world', 'Nestlé', 'PepsiCo', 'startup', 'proof', 'shelves', 'policy', 'Eco-Cycle', 'Colorado', '20 years', 'urgency', 'handling', 'waste', 'petroleum', 'claims', 'oil', 'option']",2022-04-16,2022-04-16,arstechnica.com
