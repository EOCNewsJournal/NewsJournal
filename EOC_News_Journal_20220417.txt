According to Coincub’s report  which was published on April 13  t…,A research report published earlier this week states that in Q1 2022 the top five most crypto-friendly countries in the world were Germany  Singapore  United States  Australia  and Switzerland.According to Coincub’s report  which was published on April 13  there were several factors behind their decision for giving the #1 position in their list of 45 countries to Germany:“Germany takes a positive stance on cryptocurrency trading and investment. It moved up 3 places from 2021 to take the top spot. Germany is already one of the world’s most crypto-friendly countries. The country also has the highest number of Bitcoin nodes besides the US  but with a smaller population and GDP demonstrating an even greater commitment to crypto.“There have been several positive developments over the last few months. The Federal Financial Supervisory Authority issued a crypto custody business license for Coinbase’s German arm earlier this year.

3069,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://moneyweek.com/trading/604709/what-is-next-for-interdealer-broker-tp-icap,What is next for interdealer broker TP Icap?,1 day ago,When shareholder activists target financial firms  history is not encouraging. In 2005  there was an activist campaign to prevent Deutsche Boerse from buying the London Stock Exchange.Werner Seifert  the chief executive of the German exchange  lost his job and Rolf Breuer  chairman of the supervisory board  later resigned.Yet the Deutsche Boerse management could see value where the activists who disliked the deal could not. London Stock Exchange has increased in value by 16 times since the public spat.Then there was Knight Vinke’s activist campaign against HSBC during the 2007-2009 financial crisis  encouraging the bank to take more risk at precisely the wrong point in the credit cycle.More recently  hedge fund Elliott Management’s six-year fight with Bank of East Asia in Hong Kong and Edward Bramson’s three-year battle with Barclays both ended in failure.I think the reason for those activist failures is that financial companies tend to be run by dull  unimaginative finance types who try to create shareholder value by doing finance-type things: improve margins  cut costs and announce share buybacks. Any activist who buys the shares in a financial company is fighting an uphill battle  because management are already trying to do the obvious and it hasn’t been working.A declining marketNow an activist hedge fund called Phase 2 has taken a stake in TP Icap (LSE: TCAP)  the interdealer broker (IDB) formed from the all-share merger between Tullett Prebon and Icap in 2016.

3073,EuroNext,Google API,https://cen.acs.org/business/outsourcing/EuroAPI-ready-emerge-Sanofis-shadow/100/i13,EuroAPI is ready to emerge from Sanofi's shadow,1 day ago,Credit: EuroAPIWith sales last year of more than $1 billion from active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) and contract services  EuroAPI is already big in the drug manufacturing world  and it reckons it is on the cusp of something bigger. Its owner  the French drug giant Sanofi  will spin it off on the stock market next month. When freed from a domineering corporate parent  EuroAPI says  it is going to grow.EuroAPI at a glance ▸ Headquarters: Paris ▸ Sales in 2021: About $1 billion ▸ Pretax profits in 2021: $127 million ▸ Business: Production of active pharmaceutical ingredients  with a focus on complex chemistries  and contract development and manufacturing services ▸ Product portfolio: More than 200 active pharmaceutical ingredients ▸ Plants: Haverhill  England; Elbeuf and Vertolaye  France; Frankfurt  Germany; Budapest  Hungary; and Brindisi  Italy ▸ Customers: More than 500 from 80 countries ▸ Employees: 3 350 Source: Company.While EuroAPI is bullish about its prospects for growth  not everyone is convinced. It will need a culture change away from that of a conservative Big Pharma company to one of agility and responsiveness to customer needs  industry watchers say. Additionally  EuroAPI’s profit margin is low compared with that of its peers  and improving it will take time.Until a couple of years ago  Sanofi’s API business was primarily focused on filling spare capacity at its six disparate European manufacturing sites. Then Sanofi organized the six plants under the EuroAPI name with the aim of growing the assets into a more profitable business.The drug company carved out the plants into a new organization in late 2020 and in January 2021 brought in Karl Rotthier as CEO. An industry veteran who was previously CEO of DSM Sinochem Pharmaceuticals  an anti-infectives business  Rotthier proceeded to build a team to run EuroAPI as an independent entity.EuroAPI may be new  but it is already substantial. It claims to be the world’s largest small-molecule API manufacturer and the seventh-largest contract development and manufacturing organization (CDMO). Its production of multicustomer APIs brought in about $770 million in 2021  and its bespoke CDMO services generated about $260 million.“We have indeed the number 1 position in the small-molecule API-CDMO world ” Rotthier said at an event showcasing the company to stock analysts earlier this month. “We have more than 200 active pharma ingredients in our portfolio. And we have the widest variety of technology in CDMO terms that I have seen up until now.”EuroAPI’s origins are as the in-house drug manufacturing arm of Sanofi  and around half the firm’s sales are to the drug company. Even though selling APIs was a bit of a sideline for Sanofi  the firm successfully filled its plants with many products for other drug firms. As a result  EuroAPI will start life as an independent company with both a 5-year contract to supply Sanofi and 530 other customers.Day 1 will be May 6  when 58% of the company is listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange. French Tech Souveraineté  an investment fund set up by the French government  has agreed to purchase 12% of EuroAPI from Sanofi  leaving Sanofi with a 30% stake.Not having independence has been holding EuroAPI back  Rotthier told stock analysts. “If we are not independent  if we do not have our own board . . . we cannot reach out to the customers who are currently the competitors of Sanofi.” Independence will give drug and biotech companies the confidence “to open up their kitchen secrets ” Rotthier said.Rotthier said he spent EuroAPI’s first full year  in 2021  establishing the building blocks for success. “The company itself lacked a little bit of strategy  lacked a little bit of vision going forward ” he told C&EN in November during a tour of the firm’s plant in Haverhill  England. The company’s strategy is now clear; it is offering CDMO services and API production involving complex chemistry.The firm dismisses the notion that it is a garden-variety manufacturer of APIs for generic drugs. Most of its APIs are highly differentiated  niche  complex molecules  Rotthier told investors.If we are not independent  if we do not have our own board . . . we cannot reach out to the customers who are currently the competitors of Sanofi. Karl Rotthier  CEO  EuroAPIEuroAPI uses complex chemistry to make steroids  alkaloids  sartans  antihistamines  and antipyretics. The firm uses fermentation technology to make vitamin B 12 and anti-infectives. Additionally  at its Budapest  Hungary  site  EuroAPI produces highly potent prostaglandins from a process featuring more than 60 steps. “I would hardly call that a commodity ” Rotthier said.Although making complex APIs is EuroAPI’s main business today  it aims to grow fastest in the custom development of new drugs for individual customers. The firm’s goals are to increase API sales by a single-digit percentage and its CDMO business by a double-digit percentage each year. It wants to become the number 5 CDMO by 2025.“We are much more than just an API supplier ” Rotthier said. “We need to reach out to the entire generic world . . . but also to the innovator world with our CDMO activities. That business model was not pursued inside Sanofi.”Of its 3 350 employees  about 300 are working on 30–50 process development projects at any given time  the company says. EuroAPI is targeting companies of all sizes as new CDMO customers. Biotechs and start-ups such as those around Cambridge  England  and Frankfurt  Germany  are of special interest because they do not often invest in their own production capacity  Rotthier said. “That’s a booming market ” he told C&EN in November.While the company is big  its overall profit margin of 12.3% in 2021 is a long way behind those of its peers such as Siegfried  which has a profit margin forecast for 2022 of around 21%. EuroAPI is even further behind Bachem and Lonza  each of which is forecasting a profit margin this year of about 32%  according to a EuroAPI presentation. EuroAPI’s goal is to increase its margin to above 20% by 2025.The success that EuroAPI is hoping for will depend  in part  on its ability to instill a customer-centric culture  says Roger LaForce  a veteran of the drug contracting industry and head of the Swiss consulting firm LaForce Business Solutions.“Most of the management team members seem to have made their career in large organizations. It depends whether they will be able to change the mindset to a very flexible organization and management ” LaForce says. And while there is still room for more CDMOs in Europe  he adds  “most successful CDMOs have been in the field for decades.”Still  LaForce sees positives in the EuroAPI business. “They have some good differentiation points  like opiates and fermentation. I can imagine that they will be successful in some areas where they are specialists  and less in others where they need to compete with the rest of the CDMO crowd ” he says.Jan Ramakers  another industry analyst  sees some near-term challenges for EuroAPI. “As an example  it could be a few years down the line before EuroAPI has an opportunity to extend its activities into a new field—that of final drug formulation—because such activity risks EuroAPI competing with its largest customer  Sanofi ” Ramakers says. Firms like Siegfried and Lonza have been moving into drug formulation for years now.“Overall  though  they have a great set of assets  and they know how to make APIs ” Ramakers says.The need for a cultural shift is something that Rotthier and his management team acknowledged several times at the investor event. “My priority is instilling a CDMO mindset ” said Cécile Maupas  head of EuroAPI’s CDMO business.While EuroAPI aims to create most of its growth by becoming a more attractive partner  the company expects to be helped over the next few years by an uptick in demand for CDMO services in Europe  according to Rotthier. “A lot of customers don’t dual source anymore from Asia but also are looking out more for European or Western producers ” he said.This is happening because the pharmaceutical industry’s priority has shifted from cost to quality  reliability  and security of supply  Rotthier said. The high regulatory standards that EuroAPI has inherited from Sanofi are extremely important in this market. “This is really resonating now ” he said.All six of EuroAPI’s plants are in Europe. “These are big assets also giving us the advantage of cost competitiveness via scale ” Rotthier said.

The installation was made by an external third-party supplier. The wrong installation caused potentially hazardous particles and dust to move into the air in the production hall. The company decided as a pre-cautious measure to temporarily shut down production and collected dust samples that will be analysed by external experts. Six production workers and two mechanics potentially exposed to the dust were sent home the same day. The company further decided to keep production closed in the two and half working days before the Easter break while conducting inspection of the air ventilation system filter with the supplier and independent experts on the matter. The independent expert concluded in a report that the external supplier was responsible for the issue. The company also had experts on sanitizing of the production hall on inspection and planning the same days. Following the meetings  it was decided that dust and air samples will be collected the first working day after easter and then the production hall will be sanitized. After sanitizing  new samples will be collected and analysed. The company will notify The Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority (Arbeidstilsynet) about the matter and has also informed its insurance company. Bergen Carbon Solutions takes the matter seriously and having a safe working environment for all employees is a top priority for the company. The company will take every measure necessary to ensure production employees can return to work as soon as possible. Employees impacted by the temporary production halt will be fully compensated on wages. The company currently expects to resume production at the end of April or first week of May. In the meantime  the production Diegels will  due to its very low energy consumption  be kept warm so that production can quickly resume once the production hall is sanitized. The office part of the building will be fully operational  but the closed production hall could potentially have some minor time impact on development projects. Except for lost revenues for about two production weeks and costs related to inspection  analyses and sanitizing  the company does not expect any additional financial consequences. Currently the company estimates the financial impact to less than NOK 3 million before any potential insurance recovery and third-party compensation. Jan Børge Sagmo  CEO commented: ""We have a zero tolerance for issues that can impact the health and safety of our employees. This was caused by a human error by an external supplier and was not related to any of our equipment  technology or operating procedures. Independent of the matter  we had planned for a production break during the Easter holiday. Once the sanitizing has been completed  we expect quickly to return to full production.""

Know-How IT Companies Plan to Reopen Offices,1 day ago,TCS  Infosys  HCL Work From Home to End? Know-How IT Companies Plan to Reopen OfficesEven though the COVID-19 situation in the country has improved dramatically in recent months  businesses have begun urging their employees to return to work in stages.Major IT firms like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys have encouraged their employees to enter the workplace.Coronavirus Makes Work Work-from-home — India Inc’s ‘new normal’?Work-from-home (WFH) used to be considered an employee benefit  but those days are long gone. Longer hours  larger workloads  fewer breaks  and phone calls past logout time — those days are long gone. At first  what had been exciting has become tiresome since this has become their ‘new normal.’“Because there are no set working hours  we work the entire day.” Aanchal Sharda (24)  an associate at Mumbai-based consulting firm Think Analytics  says  “No routine  nothing!”As word of COVID-19 spread  several businesses chose to allow most of their staff to work from home for at least a week before the nationwide lockdown on March 25 2020.Some companies conducted daylong trials with a two- to three-day buffer to identify difficulties with business-related data availability  connection  and infrastructure to remain ahead of the curve.“You have to be there in the office to [access] data available on platforms like Reuters and Bloomberg terminals ” says Vinay Bafna (30)  who works in ICICI’s stock research section. While his company decided not to allow such access at home  he said he knew of other companies that did.According to a Bengaluru-based Wipro consultant  even technology-enabled sectors like IT-ITeS (information technology and IT-enabled services) suffered initially.“There’s an old adage that any company that offers IT services is lousy.” “There were a lot of data security risks involved  especially for those working with BFSI [banking  insurance  and financial services] clients ” the consultant explains.It’s back to business once these early concerns are overcome. But  as time has passed  the distinction between personal and professional life has become increasingly blurred.“There are no longer any obvious borders.” Even though my work doesn’t start until 9.30 a.m.  I start getting texts at eight a.m. People from other teams are now calling me late at night. It used to be a one-time occurrence  but now it’s the standard ” says Neha Abrol (29)  a product manager at India’s leading private sector banks.She says that while her company designated one hour in the afternoon as a “no calls hour ” most employees did not adhere to it.Managers have always viewed WFH with considerable mistrust before COVID-19 for so many reasons. However  the practice has been tested in the last two months  and opinions have shifted.While the workplace has a WFH policy  Ruchi Negi (26)  who works for a multinational investment bank in Bengaluru  claims that the practice has never been encouraged.“Because it was a little frowned upon  we only used [the WFH option] on days when we didn’t have a lot of work.” “I hope that is no longer the case – productivity hasn’t decreased ” she adds.Silicon Valley has once again become the forerunner in terms of working practices. While Facebook  Google  and Salesforce have extended WFH to their employees until the end of the year  Twitter has gone above and above  saying that its employees can choose to participate in it permanently. TCS  a prominent IT company  based in India  has revealed ambitions to have 75 per cent of its employees work from home by 2025.COVID-19  according to prominent management consultant Kavi Arasu  has caused significant workplace disturbance. “First and foremost  there will be an emphasis on hygiene. Organizations have already begun to establish norms and regulations in this regard. Second  we’ll see a lot of flexibility when working from home or in remote regions. In the long run  WFH and working at a location where people can physically come together will be combined ” he believes.Even so  these professionals are hopeful that they will be able to return to work soon. The lack of domestic help to aid with household duties has exacerbated the aversion to working from home. Most people believe that WFH should be a more flexible choice in the future because the work environment — including talks and coffee breaks with coworkers throughout the day — is a key component in job happiness and productivity.Prishta Grover (23)  a Gurugram-based analyst at RBS  says  “If you enjoy your profession  you’d rather go to the office and hunt for the best atmosphere.” Currently  the area available for interaction has been reduced from the walls of office cubicles to one corner of a desktop screen.Even though India’s lockdown regulations are being modified  it could be months before the cubicles are reunited with their residents. The picture of employees grouped together in most corporate offices symbolizes the workplace. However  the pandemic has forced businesses to reconsider how they will adapt to the ‘new normal.’“Only staff in vital functions will work from the office ” says an employee at a big investment bank in Mumbai. About 20-30% of the folks on a certain level will return for the following year.”“Our in-house cafeteria has been closed  and people are encouraged to bring home-cooked meals.” We might also limit the number of persons who attend meetings in person. “Most interactions would be over video-calling  even for customer-facing professions ” says Elstan Antony  an HR representative for a large life insurance company in Mumbai.Commuting to work is another daily reality for professionals in large Indian cities. While the federal and state governments have considered measures to reintroduce public transportation while adhering to rigorous physical separation standards  many believe this will simply not work  given how densely populated these cities are.Currently  the dread of the virus outweighs the need for cubicles. Those who commute long distances to work in metropolitan areas want to keep using WFH until the infection rate drops.However  a return to the pre-COVID-19 workplace looks improbable. According to Arasu  this could signal a shift in how managers and organizations view work and evaluate individual performance: “The current work model  which considers physical presence in the office to be a key requirement and metric for performance and rewards  has begun to fade. Work needs to be redesigned to fit into people’s homes. That would necessitate creativity and effort.”Know the work from home plans of the major IT companies:1. InfosysIt is a multinational IT corporation based in India  specializing in business consulting  information technology  and outsourcing. The company was founded in Pune and is based in Bangalore. Infosys will be the second-largest Indian IT company by 2020  behind Tata Consultancy Services  and the 602nd largest public company in the world.

Infosys Consultants Private Limited was established on July 2  1981.In 1983  it relocated its headquarters to Bangalore  Karnataka  India.In April 1992  the firm changed its name to Infosys Technologies Private Limited and then to Infosys Technologies Limited when it went public in June 1992. In June 2011  it was rebranded to Infosys Limited.In February 1993  an IPO was launched with a share price of 95 (equivalent to 580 or US$7.70 in 2020) and a book value of 20 (equivalent to 120 or US$1.60 in 2020). The IPO was undersubscribed  but Morgan Stanley  a US investment bank  “bailed it out” by purchasing a 13 per cent stock share at the offer price. Its shares were first traded in June 1993 at a price of 145 (equal to 890 or US$12 in 2020).In 1999  American depositary receipts for Infosys shares were listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. It was the first Indian company listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.By 1999  the stock had risen to $8 100 (equal to 30 000 or US$390 in 2020)  making it the most expensive stock on the market. Infosys was one of Nasdaq’s top 20 businesses by market capitalization at the time. To give European investors better access to the company’s shares  the ADR listing was moved from Nasdaq to NYSE Euronext.On July 28  2010  then-British Prime Minister David Cameron paid a visit to Infosys’ Bangalore headquarters and addressed the company’s employees.In 1999  it made $100 million in revenue  $1 billion in 2004  and $10 billion in 2017.In 2012  Infosys announced the opening of its 18th foreign office in the United States  in Milwaukee  Wisconsin  to serve Harley-Davidson. In 2011  Infosys hired 1 200 people in the United States  and in 2012  the company hired another 2 000 people. Infosys announced its expansion in Indianapolis  Indiana  in April 2018. The project will cover more than 120 acres and create 3 000 new employment  up from the earlier estimate of 2 000.Infosys launched EdgeVerve Systems  a product subsidiary focused on enterprise software products for business operations  customer support  procurement  and commerce network sectors  in July 2014. Finacle Global Banking Solutions assets were officially transferred from Infosys in August 2015 and formed part of the product range of EdgeVerve Systems.Products and servicesCompanies in the financial  insurance  manufacturing and other industries use Infosys’ software development  maintenance  and independent validation services.Finacle  a universal banking system with several modules for retail and corporate banking  is one of its well-known offerings.The following are some of the company’s most important products and services:· NIA – Next Generation Integrated AI Platform· Infosys Consulting Cloud· Infosys Information Platform (IIP)· EdgeVerve Systems· Panaya Cloud Suite· Skava· Engineering Services· Digital MarketingGeographical presenceAs of March 31  2018  Infosys had 82 sales and marketing offices and 123 development centres worldwide  with a strong presence in India  the United States  China  Australia  Japan  the Middle East  and Europe.Projects in North America  Europe  and India accounted for 60 per cent  24 per cent  and 3 per cent of its sales in 2019  respectively. The revenue balance came from the rest of the world  which accounted for 13% of total revenue.Infosys’ position in Russia to serve the energy industry there was questioned in 2022. Despite Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  the company  unlike Western corporations like Oracle  has refused to leave the country.Infosys Phased PlanInfosys has begun calling individuals to offices as early as this month. At the moment  only senior personnel are coming to work. Infosys Chief Financial Officer Nilanjan Roy told reporters after presenting the March 2022 quarter results that 95 per cent of the company’s employees work remotely  with only 5% of senior executives reporting to offices.He explained that the corporation has a three-phased work-from-home strategy. “We started the first phase in April  and persons who live near DCs (development centres) or who live in upcountry towns adjacent to DCs are urged to come to the office twice a week. We’re already seeing some interest in this. Senior executives are on their way in. Huddles  for example  are already in use by teams.”In the second phase  he said  the corporation will encourage people living outside of DC towns to begin making plans in the coming months to see if they can return to their base development centres. “This is dependent on individual circumstances  among other things.”In the long run  they are considering a hybrid work paradigm  depending on the clients  regulatory climate  and many other factors. Currently  95% of the workforce works from home  with only 5% of senior executives reporting to offices.After following phases of return to the office  Infosys Executive Vice-President and Head (HR) Richard Lobo previously stated that the company envisions a hybrid model in which roughly 40-50 per cent of employees will likely work from home.2.

3076,EuroNext,Bing API,https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/galapagos-publishes-2021-annual-report-201700414.html,Galapagos publishes 2021 annual report and announces extraordinary and annual shareholders’ meetings,Mechelen  Belgium; 24 March 2022  21.01 CET; regulated information – Galapagos NV (Euronext & NASDAQ: GLPG) published its annual report for the financial year 2021 and announces extraordinary and annual shareholders’ meetings to be held sequentially on ...,Galapagos NV-- Proposal of one-tier board structure & appointment of three new directors --Mechelen  Belgium; 24 March 2022  21.01 CET; regulated information – Galapagos NV (Euronext & NASDAQ: GLPG) published its annual report for the financial year 2021 and announces extraordinary and annual shareholders’ meetings to be held sequentially on Tuesday 26 April 2022 at 1:00 p.m. (CET) and 2:00 p.m. (CET)  respectively  at the registered office of the Company.The annual report for the financial year 2021  including a review of figures and performance  is available online at https://www.glpg.com/financial-reports and can also be downloaded as PDF. Our annual 2021 Form 20-F filing with the SEC is available at www.sec.gov/edgar .Furthermore  Galapagos NV (hereinafter the Company) has the honor to invite its shareholders  holders of subscription rights  members of the supervisory board and statutory auditor to its extraordinary and annual shareholders’ meetings that will be held sequentially on Tuesday 26 April 2022 at 1:00 p.m. (CET) and 2:00 p.m. (CET)  respectively  at the Company’s registered office.The items on the agenda of the extraordinary and annual shareholders’ meetings include  amongst other items: i) the amendment of the Company’s articles of association to implement a one-tier board structure  ii) the appointment of Paul Stoffels* as a director  iii) the appointments of Jérôme Contamine and Dan Baker as independent directors  and iv) the approval of an amended remuneration policy of the Company.The supervisory board proposed a one-tier board structure as it strongly believes that this unitary structure will strengthen the decision-making processes and the agility of the organization. The supervisory board’s considerations included that a one-tier board would allow for increased information flow and would provide directors with a greater understanding of the Company’s business and strategy as the executive and non-executive directors would be in direct and consistent contact. A unitary board would also allow for fast approvals to execute on the Company’s strategy to drive long-term shareholder value.Story continuesIf approved  the new board of directors intends to appoint Paul Stoffels* chair of the board. Paul Stoffels* has been appointed CEO of the Company  effective as from 1 April 2022. The board believes that the combined chair/CEO role will allow him to fully leverage his leadership capabilities and to efficiently set and implement the Company’s direction and strategy  including business development opportunities.To ensure that the independent directors can continue to actively oversee the CEO and management  the new board (if approved) also intends to appoint a lead non-executive director if and as long as the CEO serves as chair. The role and responsibility of the lead non-executive director will be to act as the principal liaison between the non-executive members of the (new) board and the chair/CEO  to ensure the independence of the board of directors from the chair/CEO and executive management  to support the chair/CEO and to ensure continuity within the board. The lead non-executive director would have the authority to call meetings of the non-executive directors at any time and would also automatically be a vice-chair of the board of directors.Biographies of proposed new board membersPaul Stoffels*  MD was Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee and CSO of Johnson & Johnson  setting the company wide innovation agenda and leading the pharmaceutical research and product pipeline as well as the external initiatives.
