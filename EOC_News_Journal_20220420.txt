The guidelines are forward-looking  i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the Annual General Meeting 2022. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the General Meeting. Share-related incentive plans are decided  where appropriate  by the General Meeting.The guidelines’ promotion of Sdiptech’s business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilitySdiptech is a technology group focused on infrastructure. Sdiptech’s business concept is to provide niched solutions to the infrastructure sector. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of Sdiptech’s business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that Sdiptech is able to recruit and retain qualified senior executives. To this end  it is necessary that the Company offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the Company to offer the senior executives a competitive total remuneration.The remuneration shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally  the general meeting may – irrespective of these guidelines – resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration. Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the Company’s business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.The satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a period of one or several years. The variable cash remuneration may amount to not more than 50 per cent of the total fixed cash salary under the measurement period for such criteria.For senior executives  pension benefits  including health insurance (Sw: sjukförsäkring)  shall be based on a premium defined pension plan unless the individual concerned is subject to defined benefit pension under mandatory law or collective agreement provisions. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits unless required by mandatory law or collective agreement provisions. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 30 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.Other benefits may include  for example  company cars  occupational health services and medical insurance (Sw: sjukvårdsförsäkring). Such benefits may amount to not more than 10 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on guidelines for remuneration to senior executives in accordance with the above  as well as supplementary information in Appendix §16  which is posted on the Company's website.Item 1 7 – Resolution on authorization for the Board to issue shares  convertibles and warrantsThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors to  until the next annual general meeting  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  on one or several occasions resolve to issue ordinary shares  convertible instruments and/or warrants. Payment may be made in cash and/or with in kind or by way of set-off  or other conditions.The total increase of the number of ordinary shares  which includes issuance  conversion or subscription for new shares  may – where it entails a deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights – correspond to a dilution of a maximum of 10 percent of the current number outstanding ordinary shares  adjusted for any splits or similar. The authorization shall primarily be used for the purpose of acquisitions or financing thereof.A valid resolution requires that shareholders holding not less than two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting vote in favor of the proposal.Item 1 8 - Resolution on warrant program for the company's employeesIn order for the Group to be able to retain and recruit competent and committed staff  the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting  deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights  decide on the issue of Warrants and the introduction of a long-term incentive program for Group employees. Annual General Meetings held in February 2018 and May 2021  respectively  decided to introduce incentive programs for employees based on warrants. In 2018  three different series were published with a term of three  four and five years  respectively  and in 2021  a series with a term of three years was published. Of these  the subscription period for two series has expired and two series remain  with a term of 2023 and 2024  respectively.The remaining series  2018/2023  currently has 192 000 options outstanding and the 2021/2024 series currently has 342 481 options outstanding.Through the proposal for the new incentive program  the Company would again have three outstanding series of warrants  which is in line with the Company's ambition.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to introduce an incentive program for the company's employees through the issue of a total of a maximum of 350 000 warrants of series 2022/2025  in accordance with Appendices §18  18a and §18b  which are posted on the Company's website. In short  the proposal means that:The Company shall issue no more than 350 000 Warrants of series 2022/2025. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new common share of series B (“B-shares”) in the Company during the following periods: (i) a period of 10 banking days from and including 9 June 2025  (ii) a period of 10 banking days from and including the banking day following the publication of the Company’s interim report for the second quarter of 2025  and (iii) a period of 10 banking days from and including the banking day following the publication of the Company’s interim report for the third quarter of 2025  however not later than 30 November 2025 (each a “Subscription Period”).Upon full subscription  by virtue of all of the Warrants  a maximum of 350 000 new common shares of series B may be issued  corresponding to a dilution of approximately 1.0 per cent of the total amount of common shares of series A and series B and approximately 0.7 per cent of the total amount of votes in the Company that the common shares of series A and series B represent (based on the number of such outstanding shares as of the date of the notice).The subscription price for new B-shares subscribed for through Warrants shall be equal to an amount corresponding to 126 per cent of the volume-weighted average of the quoted price paid for the B-share on Nasdaq Stockholm (or another corresponding trading facility or regulated market on which the Company’s shares are traded) from and including 19 May 2022 up to and including 2 June 2022 (the “Calculation period”).The increase of the Company’s share capital will  upon exercise of the Warrants  amount to not more than SEK 8 750  subject to such increase that may occur due to recalculation of the subscription price and the number of shares which each Warrant entitles to subscription for in the event of issues etcetera. If the subscription price exceeds the quota value  the excess amount shall be allotted to the non-restricted statutory reserve.Employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (the Company and its subsidiaries are referred to collectively as the “Group”) shall be entitled to acquire Warrants from the Subsidiary. Application to acquire Warrants shall be made not later than on 10 June 2022. The board of directors of the Company shall however be entitled to prolong the application period. Future new employees may also be entitled to acquire Warrants  whereby the application to acquire Warrants may take place at a later occasion. For any such acquisitions  the acquisition shall be made at the prevailing market value and that the board of directors shall apply a corresponding application period for employees whose acquisition is made following the initial application period. The board of directors is authorised to extend each Subscription Period and the time for payment in the event that any participant is restricted from subscribing to new shares pursuant to insider or market abuse regulations.If not all Warrants are acquired  the remaining number of Warrants may be allotted to participants independently of category. No participant may  however  acquire additional Warrants that correspond to more than 50 per cent of the number of Warrants which each respective participant is entitled to acquire.Transfer of Warrants to the participants shall be made at a price corresponding to the market value  which shall be calculated in accordance with the Black & Scholes formula by an independent valuation institution. At an estimated future volatility level of 30 per cent during the term of the Warrants and assuming that the average value of the Company’s share during the valuation period amounts to SEK 375  whereby the subscription price for the Warrants will amount to SEK 472 for each Warrant  the preliminary calculated market value per warrant will amount to SEK 46 for each Warrant.The general meeting’s resolution under this item is valid only if supported by shareholders holding no less than nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting.OtherComplete proposals for resolutions  accounting documents  auditor's report and other documents prior to the Annual General Meeting are available at the Company's office at Nybrogatan 39  114 39 Stockholm and on the Company's website https://www.sdiptech.se no later than 27 April 2022.

In November  DWS announced plans to switch the index to one that tracks ESG metrics due to low demand.Meanwhile  ACUU tracks the MSCI All Country Far East ex Japan ESG Leaders Select 5% Issuer Capped index  offering exposure to two developed markets – Hong Kong and Singapore – and seven emerging markets comprising China  Indonesia  Korea  Malaysia  the Philippines and Taiwan.Despite covering roughly 400 stocks  China dominates the index with a weighting of 44.4%  followed by Taiwan (20.7%)  Hong Kong (10%) and South Korea (9.7%)  at the end of March.The ETF uses a negative screening and a best-in-class selection of the top 50% of companies with the highest ESG scores taken from the parent index.Both ETFs are labelled Article 8 under the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR).Matthieu Guignard (pictured)  global head of product development and capital markets at Amundi  said: “We are delighted to further extend our Amundi ETF responsible range with these two new products.“As investors are increasingly looking for new tools allowing them to build sustainable portfolios for all asset classes  we are committed to providing them with a large range of high quality  robust and cost-efficient ESG ETFs”.It comes as Amundi continues to green up its product range. Last month  the group shifted over €13bn of assets to track Paris Aligned Benchmarks (PAB) and Climate Transition Benchmark (CTB) indices.Amundi successfully extended its lead over DWS in the European ETF issuer rankings in Q1 following its €825m acquisition of Lyxor  booking an impressive €9.2bn inflows in the first quarter.Related articles,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.36,0.28,0.36,True,English,"['Asian equity ESG ETFs', 'global aggregate', 'Amundi', 'Bloomberg MSCI Global Aggregate 500MM ex Securitised Sustainable SRI Neutral index', 'Bloomberg MSCI Global Aggregate 500MM ex Securitised index', 'Amundi MSCI AC Far East Ex Japan ESG Leaders', 'The Amundi Global AGG SRI UCITS ETF', 'Global Aggregate Bond index', 'global aggregate bond market', 'Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation', 'European ETF issuer rankings', 'Asian equity ESG ETFs', 'Amundi ETF responsible range', 'two new ESG products', '5% Issuer Capped index', 'highest ESG score', 'two new products', 'cost-efficient ESG ETFs', 'total expense ratios', '12,000 investment grade corporate', 'controversial business practices', 'high quality, robust', 'Paris Aligned Benchmarks', 'Climate Transition Benchmark', 'impressive €9.2bn inflows', 'two developed markets', 'seven emerging markets', 'The ETF', 'sustainable portfolios', 'global head', 'parent index', 'ESG metrics', 'ETF Stream', 'Asia equity', 'new tools', 'capital markets', 'large range', 'product range', 'two issuers', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'adult entertainment', 'nuclear power', 'military weapons', 'civilian firearms', 'thermal coal', 'sheer size', 'low demand', 'Hong Kong', 'negative screening', 'class selection', 'Matthieu Guignard', 'product development', 'asset classes', 'CTB) indices', '€825m acquisition', 'first quarter', 'Related articles', 'government bonds', 'South Korea', '1,200 issuers', 'OUU', 'ACUU', 'TERs', 'investors', 'access', 'alcohol', 'tobacco', 'gambling', 'GMO', 'beast', 'BlackRock', 'DWS', 'exposure', 'ability', 'November', 'plans', 'Country', 'Singapore', 'China', 'Indonesia', 'Malaysia', 'Philippines', 'Taiwan', '400 stocks', 'weighting', 'end', 'March', 'companies', 'SFDR', 'group', 'assets', 'PAB', 'Q1', 'Lyxor']",2022-04-19,2022-04-20,etfstream.com

3134,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.financialexecutives.org/FEI-Daily/April-2022/Why-Technology-Companies-Must-Navigate-Muddy-Water.aspx,Why Technology Companies Must Navigate Muddy Waters of ESG Requirements,1 day ago,The need for more corporate responsibility has evolved for today’s corporations and the next generation of business leaders in the form of environmental  social and governance (ESG). Investors  activists  and regulators are now requiring proactive  community-structured commitment and accountability that is designed to step above shareholder returns.Today’s global capital markets aren’t interested in more marketing from companies in every industry. Instead  they are demanding sustainability and eco-friendly business practices as well as a reasonable return. Global technology companies and their executives are now hearing this call  and the industry is being more proactive in this movement.Why are ESG standards needed?Although ESG metrics are still trying to find their proper place in today’s standardized financial reporting  that hasn’t stopped technology companies and other industry institutions from making promises and illustrating the proactive nature of their ESG standards.What’s needed at this critical step is the ability for companies across all industries to truly quantify their company’s present position relative to investor objectives of integration  values  and impact in the areas of governance over environmental and social contexts. American stakeholders AND shareholders aren’t interested in window dressing and empty promises only for the benefit of a feel-good investor report. They want to know that companies are holding themselves accountable to the promises and commitments they’re making in these key areas.Proxy Advisors making unfair pressuresMany technology companies  specifically  have felt their fair share of pressure into adopting more ESG-forward practices. Whether through a reduction of plastic carrier bag usage or gender pay gap reporting  shareholders have certainly brought pressure on a large number of technology companies over their supply chain strategies  environmental and sustainability impacts  and certainly gender-diverse practices. This focus has led to a significant overhaul of many business processes alongside the appointment of a new addition to the C-Suite – the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO). Other companies inside and out of technology continuously look at leaders in this movement and have started to replicate their operational changes.However  making promises about ESG commitments and holding true to them are apparently two different stories for some. Many companies are being pushed into making ESG improvements and commitments  especially through institutional investors and oversight organizations such as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS).This has led some to wonder if these proxy advisors have become too focused on ESG issues  have conflicted  and have broadly too much power over the operation of America’s largest technology companies.ISS hypocrisy over ESG requirementsAs an example  ISS talks a big game on the issue of Diversity and Inclusion. ISS demanded publicly traded companies disclose the ethnicity of each and every member of their board of directors. More recently  ISS has been accused of refusing to recommend voting for board slates that they allege do not contain enough ‘diverse’ representation.However  it appears that ISS lacks representation from even a single person of color. Moreover  it does not appear that ISS's two corporate owners---Genstar Capital and Deutsche Boerse---have even a single person of color on their executive teams. This is troubling given the fact that they have claimed Diversity  Equity  and Inclusion is a priority and have asked publicly traded companies and technology companies to make commitments towards those ends. Standards are not only needed  they must be adhered to at all levels.Technology companies have a chance to serve as modelsDespite the hypocrisy demonstrated by organizations such as ISS  technology companies have the opportunity to truly bring about change – not just in their marketing but in the way they go about doing business. In fact  as business models have had to adapt to this new landscape and changed customer behaviors  there has been evidence of the incorporation of ESG elements across the technology industry.These moves recognize it is not solely about making money and preserving the bottom line  but that technology companies have been working toward having a positive societal impact. There is no doubt that these newly implemented strategies have the potential to drive increased valuations  which pushes up the appetite of investors  but that they also attract more qualified people into technology companies who are extremely committed to the corporate cause.As more technology companies focus on staying committed to their ESG promises  everyone will win in the end  including customers  stakeholders  investors  the environment  and certainly employees. These companies will truly serve as models of operation in the future. But we must move beyond just promises and commitments  a new set of ESG standards must be developed to level the playing field of reporting.Rashida Salahuddin is the President & CEO of The Corporate Citizenship Project.,neutral,0.03,0.66,0.31,mixed,0.13,0.15,0.71,True,English,"['Technology Companies', 'Muddy Waters', 'ESG Requirements', 'plastic carrier bag usage', 'gender pay gap reporting', 'two different stories', 'standardized financial reporting', 'proactive, community-structured commitment', 'global capital markets', 'good investor report', 'two corporate owners', 'supply chain strategies', 'Chief Sustainability Officer', 'Institutional Shareholder Services', 'enough ‘diverse’ representation', 'positive societal impact', 'many business processes', 'eco-friendly business practices', 'other industry institutions', 'Global technology companies', 'largest technology companies', 'Many technology companies', 'Many companies', 'shareholder returns', 'proactive nature', 'investor objectives', 'Genstar Capital', 'Other companies', 'corporate responsibility', 'ESG-forward practices', 'gender-diverse practices', 'corporate cause', 'next generation', 'reasonable return', 'proper place', 'critical step', 'present position', 'window dressing', 'Proxy Advisors', 'unfair pressures', 'fair share', 'large number', 'sustainability impacts', 'significant overhaul', 'new addition', 'operational changes', 'big game', 'single person', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'executive teams', 'new landscape', 'customer behaviors', 'bottom line', 'qualified people', 'new set', 'playing field', 'Rashida Salahuddin', 'ESG metrics', 'ESG improvements', 'ESG issues', 'ESG requirements', 'ESG elements', 'technology industry', 'institutional investors', 'business leaders', 'ESG standards', 'business models', 'social contexts', 'American stakeholders', 'key areas', 'oversight organizations', 'board slates', 'empty promises', 'ESG promises', 'ESG commitments', 'ISS hypocrisy', 'need', 'today', 'corporations', 'form', 'governance', 'activists', 'regulators', 'accountability', 'marketing', 'executives', 'call', 'movement', 'industries', 'company', 'integration', 'values', 'environmental', 'shareholders', 'benefit', 'reduction', 'focus', 'appointment', 'C-Suite', 'CSO', 'power', 'example', 'Diversity', 'Inclusion', 'ethnicity', 'member', 'directors', 'voting', 'color', 'fact', 'Equity', 'priority', 'ends', 'levels', 'chance', 'opportunity', 'way', 'evidence', 'incorporation', 'moves', 'money', 'doubt', 'potential', 'valuations', 'appetite', 'everyone', 'customers', 'employees', 'future', 'Presi']",2022-04-20,2022-04-20,financialexecutives.org

The company has subsidiaries in 16 countries throughout Europe  Asia  Oceania  and North America  and factories in northern Africa  Asia  and France.Chantelle was facing business challenges within their Digital and Customer Care department. It was clear they needed to improve collaboration between teams worldwide  increase flexibility  speed responsiveness and ensure product availability.""We had a product data management (PDM) solution for about 20 years  but no PLM.

""We needed a more efficient and faster way to transfer images  content and data of our complete collection offer to our sites.""Chantelle's existing PDM did not allow them to easily manage collection assortments and they needed that functionality quickly.

With supply chain challenges such as rising costs and transportation disruptions  PLM will eventually be rolled out to some of Chantelle's suppliers.Chantelle products are complex  as each bra model requires more than 80 different materials and is available in approximately thirty sizes. To date  Chantelle has nearly 80 000 active SKUs. Centric PLM will enable Chantelle to better control the entire supply chain.""Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is also a priority for Chantelle "" says Cathy Sellier  Master Data Manager at Chantelle. ""We recently created a zero waste  fully recyclable bra  based on the circular economy model and we want to communicate our CSR initiatives more effectively.

(Graphic: Business Wire)""Metaverse: a View from Inside"" surveyed 1 000 gamers across the US to explore their attitudes and behaviors in this new 3D world. (Graphic: Business Wire)NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Razorfish and VICE Media Group released findings from new research that examines the metaverse’s impact on identity  social interactions  and commerce. The study  titled “The Metaverse: A View from Inside ” seeks to understand how Gen Z  in particular  blends experiences across virtual and offline worlds  and the opportunities for brands to build meaningful interactions in this new space.According to survey responses  Gen Z gamers spend twice as much time hanging out with friends in the metaverse than they do in real life  with gamers spending 12.2 hours per week playing video games versus 6.6 hours hanging out with friends in-person. These gamers don’t only view their time in the metaverse as pure escapism  but also as an extension of real life: 52% of Gen Z gamers say they would like to experience making money in the metaverse  while 33% of them would like to experience building a career there.Gen Z gamers purchase items in the metaverse the same way they do in real life. Over the next five years  20% of Gen Z gamers' ""fun"" budgets (i.e.  money spent on entertainment  leisure  or recreation) will go to in-game purchases  with the average current spend being $50/year. Further  they welcome brands here: 33% of Gen Z gamers would like to see brands provide virtual stores for browsing and buying products in the metaverse  while 30% would like to see brands selling skins and apparel for their avatars.“Today’s youth are coming into their identities both in real life and in the metaverse  using experiences across both worlds to build confidence and hone their self-expression ” said Nicolas Chidiac  brand strategy lead at Razorfish. “Gen Z gamers view the metaverse as a safe place to freely express themselves  experiment with identities  establish friendships  and ultimately create a world they want to live in. It’s important that brands don’t dismiss the metaverse as a passing fad  but view it as a paradigm-shifting trend that’s just getting started.”Brands Will Lose a Key Demographic if They Ignore the MetaverseThe “metaverse” quickly arose as one of the early buzzwords of 2022. As marketers come to grips with understanding this new environment  Gen Z is already growing up with it; it isn’t foreign or futuristic to them - it is their reality  especially for gamers. In fact  57% of Gen Z gamers feel they’re able to self-express more openly to others in a game than they do in real life. The metaverse impacts the way Gen Z gamers think  socialize  and consume every day.The study further notes that Gen Z gamers regard the metaverse in a substantial way and  more specifically  are invested in the way they interact with brands in this alternate reality.The Metaverse Impacts Reality Beyond Brand ExperiencesKey findings of the Razorfish study revealed that:The metaverse gives gamers space to explore their identity. 45% of Gen Z gamers say  “I feel like my identity in a game is a truer expression of who I am.” Forty percent say it gives them self-confidence.Stress relief is a major driver. 77% of Gen Z gamers say their biggest motive for gaming is to relieve stress and anxiety.Gen Z is approaching the metaverse with practicality. 47% would like to use it to meet new people and 33% would like to use it to build a career.Data privacy is a concern for Gen Z gamers  but less than for older generations. 63% of Gen Z are concerned about data privacy in video games and the metaverse (vs. 66% Millennials and 70% Gen X).“Our study shows that Gen Z is using the metaverse to cultivate connections and explore who they really are ” said Julie Arbit  Global SVP  Insights at VICE Media Group. “It allows them to dream and co-create a more idealized version of the world. Brands would be remiss to not include the metaverse as a strategic piece of their initiatives  provided they do so in a way that both respects and enhances the overall experience.”How Brands Can Get StartedBrands today have a significant opportunity to explore the brand and commerce possibilities for this new frontier. The Razorfish report recommends that brands:Link it up – real life and the metaverse are interlinked  so should metaverse strategies.– real life and the metaverse are interlinked  so should metaverse strategies. Find purpose – what is the value exchange you'll be delivering against?– what is the value exchange you'll be delivering against? Be wary of shiny object syndrome – approach the metaverse with the same rigor as other channels. Which problem are you solving for  whom are you trying to engage with  what is the role of the product and how are you measuring success?– approach the metaverse with the same rigor as other channels. Which problem are you solving for  whom are you trying to engage with  what is the role of the product and how are you measuring success? Ethics matter – Proceed with caution; this is an unregulated space  so ethics count.Note to Editor: The full study  The Metaverse: A View from Inside  is available on razorfish.com  and publishable images can be downloaded here.MethodologyRazorfish and VICE Media Group conducted three phases of research in the US. Phase 1 was focused on digital ethnographies. Razorfish shadowed 12 Gen Z gamers during 1-hour video gaming experiences  using probes to understand why they chose certain avatars  and how they interact with other players  brands  and the environment. Phase 2 consisted of in-depth interviews with each gamer to dive deeper into their gaming experience and understand “who they are” when they play. Phase 3 (conducted January 20 – February 8  2022)  consisted of an online quantitative survey of 1 000 youth gamers across the U.S.Of the 12 gamers shadowed and interviewed  participants consisted of 50% female and 50% male Gen Z. Of the 1 000 gamers surveyed online  participants were comprised of 37% Gen Z  49% Millennial  14% Gen X and 51% female  45% male  4% nonbinary.About RazorfishRazorfish is a global leader in marketing transformation.

Voya Financial  Inc. (NYSE: VOYA)  released new finding…,WINDSOR  Conn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--As the rising cost of goods and services impacts the wallets of many Americans today  the growing concern of being able to save enough for retirement is also on the rise. Voya Financial  Inc. (NYSE: VOYA)  released new findings from a consumer research survey revealing that 66% of Americans agree or strongly agree that they are worried about the impact of inflation on their ability to save enough for retirement. What’s more  an even greater amount of individuals agree or strongly agree they are worried about the impact of inflation on their personal finances and the ability to maintain their current lifestyle (71%).Retirement concerns greater among Generation X and millennialsAdding to the concerns of being able to meet current spending needs  Voya’s survey also found a majority (84%) of Americans feel like their money does not go as far as it used to go  leaving many to wonder how saving for the future will be able to remain a priority. But what Voya’s survey revealed as most interesting is the generational view on retirement stemming from the impacts of inflation today. Voya’s findings noted that three-quarters (73%) of millennials and Gen Xers (74%) agreed or strongly agreed that they are worried about the impact of inflation on their ability to save enough for retirement. And more than half (57%) of millennials  who now make up roughly one-third of the U.S. labor force 1 agree or strongly agree that  because of inflation  they will need to delay their planned retirement date. Meanwhile  just 55% of baby boomers and 62% of those in Generation Z agreed or strongly agreed that they are worried about the impact of inflation on their ability to save for retirement.“ The results of our latest consumer survey are an important reminder for employers that all generations  particularly those balancing the impact of competing financial priorities today  are feeling the impact inflation has on their ability to save for the future ” said Heather Lavallee  CEO of Wealth Solutions for Voya Financial. “ The past two years have also made it increasingly clear that many Americans will be faced with these competing priorities more than ever before. This could include challenges to building emergency savings  how to manage higher health care costs or general concerns about what actions to take and not to take when it comes to overall plans for one’s financial future. As a result  it’s important to remind individuals where many can seek support for addressing these challenges — their employer.”Millennial mindset shifts from saving for experiences to emergenciesThe concerns of millennials today may be rooted in their experience living through the Great Recession and then the recent economic downturn tied to the pandemic. Add to these concerns the burdens of student loan debt  higher health care costs or the rising cost of child care and education  and the uncertainties deepen. Often coined a generation likely to spend their hard-earned money on travel or entertainment  millennials stood out in Voya’s research as having the most concerns about the long-term financial impact of both COVID-19 and inflation. Voya’s survey also revealed that 68% of millennials agreed or strongly agreed that  because of inflation  they are not able to pay down debt as quickly as they want to — and even more (77%) agree or strongly agree that inflation has made them more aware of the need to save more for emergencies or unexpected events.“ Voya’s survey also found that  because of inflation  nearly half (43%) of individuals have had to tap into finances that they previously had set aside for retirement — and not surprisingly  this is even higher among millennials (57%) ” added Lavallee. “ As a result  employers and employees are increasingly looking at the value of benefits in relation to the total net outcome of individuals’ health and wealth needs. And it’s becoming increasingly important for employers to recognize one’s entire savings picture when it comes to the benefits we provide our employees.”“ While a focus will always remain on driving greater outcomes for retirement  the realities of our world today require a shift in thinking about the opportunities to harmonize one’s entire savings picture. Resources such as health savings accounts to offset the burden of medical costs  student loan debt support and tools for building emergency savings continue to grow in popularity as employer wellness benefits. Going forward  it will be critical for employers to provide support in these areas so these generations  and all individuals  can find greater opportunity to build a secure financial future ” concluded Lavallee.As an industry leader focused on the delivery of health  wealth and investment solutions to and through the workplace  Voya Financial is committed to delivering on its mission to make a secure financial future possible for all Americans — one person  one family  one institution at a time.All data unless noted otherwise is based on the results of a Voya Financial survey conducted March 29-30  2022  on the Ipsos eNation omnibus online platform among 1 000 adults aged 18+ in the U.S.1.

Despite particularly high prior-year comparatives and an economic environment disrupted by the crisis in Ukraine  we delivered sustained like-for-like revenue growth of +6.5%  and of +11.1% before the expected decline in revenue from the Covid support contracts. Quarterly revenue was lifted by robust business development  particularly in the Ibero-LATAM region and in India  in a rapidly transforming  fast-growing market. The recent strategic acquisitions of Health Advocate and Senture in the United States also made a significant contribution to the Group’s expansion during the quarter. Lastly  we recently curtailed our commitments in Russia  where our exposure remains at less than 1% of our revenue stream.Based on this encouraging first quarter  and despite an increasingly destabilized global context  we can confirm our full-year guidance  with in particular a like-for-like increase in revenue of more than +5%  and of more than +10% excluding the impact of Covid support contracts. We also remain committed to pursuing targeted acquisitions to strengthen our high value-added businesses.In an environment marked by further crises  with people thrown into highly vulnerable circumstances  we were proud to recently announce the signing of a partnership with UNICEF to support children’s education and contribute to the agency's worldwide disaster relief fund. The US$6 million partnership will help improve education programs in India and the Philippines and provide emergency disaster relief around the world. As part of the partnership  we have already donated US$500 000 to UNICEF to support its work in Ukraine. We have also donated an equivalent amount to support the work of the Red Cross in Ukraine.""------------------------Consolidated revenue€ millions 2022 2021 % change Like-for-like Reported Average exchange rate €1 = US$1.12 €1 = US$1.20 First quarter 1 962 1 712 +6.5% +14.6%Consolidated revenue came in at €1 962 million for the first quarter of 2022  representing a year-on-year increase of +6.5% at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation (like-for-like) and +14.6% as reported. The favorable currency effect  which added +€54 million to reported revenue  stemmed primarily from the rise against the euro in the US dollar and  to a lesser extent the pound sterling  the Brazilian real and the Indian rupee. Changes in the scope of consolidation had an +€82 million positive impact  reflecting the consolidation of Health Advocate from July 1  2021 and of Senture from January 1  2022.Like-for-like growth during the quarter was particularly strong given the negative but expected impact of the change in revenue from Covid support contracts (down -€83 million compared with first-quarter 2021). Adjusted for this non-recurring impact  like-for-like growth stood at +11.1% for the period. The gain reflected the very robust sales momentum in the Core Services & D.I.B.S. activities  driven by accelerating market digitalization  particularly in the social media ecosystem  and a recovery in certain sectors that had suffered during the health crisis  such as hospitality and online travel. Specialized Services revenue also rose sharply over the period  lifted by strong growth in the TLScontact visa application management business  which benefited from highly favorable prior-year comparatives and the steady upturn in its business volumes.Revenue by activityQ1 2022 Q1 2021 % change € millions Like-for-like Reported CORE SERVICES & D.I.B.S.* 1 711 1 536 +5.4% +11.4% English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP) 599 508 +1.8% +18.1% Ibero-LATAM 525 442 +16.2% +18.9% Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA) 459 481 -3.5% -4.7% India 128 105 +17.1% +21.6% SPECIALIZED SERVICES 251 176 +15.5% +42.2% TOTAL 1 962 1 712 +6.5% +14.6%* Digital Integrated Business ServicesCore Services & Digital Integrated Business Services (D.I.B.S.) (D.I.B.S.)Core Services & D.I.B.S. revenue amounted to €1 711 million in first-quarter 2022  a year-on-year increase of +5.4% like-for-like. Reported growth came to +11.4%  with the difference primarily reflecting the rise against the euro in the US dollar and  to a lesser extent sterling  the Brazilian real and the Indian rupee. In addition  the consolidation of Senture from January 1  2022 added +€50 million to reported revenue for the quarter.Excluding the impact of the decline in revenue from Covid support contracts  the Core Services & D.I.B.S. activities delivered double-digit like-for-like growth over the period  driven by the accelerating development of the digital economy  particularly in the social media  online entertainment and online food services segments. In addition  the financial services  healthcare and automotive segments saw rapid expansion during the period. Growth in the hospitality and tourism segments  which had been hard hit by the health crisis  continued to gain momentum in every operating region.English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP)Regional revenue came to €599 million in first-quarter 2022  up +1.8% like-for-like. and +18.1% as reported  i.e.  including the favorable currency effect stemming from the rise of the US dollar and pound sterling against the euro and the positive impact of consolidating Senture from January 1  2022.Business growth in the North American market confirmed the renewed momentum that emerged in the second half of last year  both in the domestic market and in the Philippines-based offshore operations. The online entertainment  financial services and healthcare segments expanded at a firm pace and the hospitality and tourism segments continued to rebound.Business in the United Kingdom ended the period down year-on-year  due to the expected steep fall-off in revenue from Covid support contracts. Among the other segments  insurance saw sustained gains and healthcare ramped up quickly during the quarter.In Asia  business growth continued to be driven by the contribution from recently signed contracts with global leaders in the social media and online entertainment sectors  notably served from the multilingual hubs in Malaysia and from Indonesia.Ibero-LATAMFirst-quarter 2022 revenue for the Ibero-LATAM region amounted to €525 million  a year-on-year increase of +16.2% like-for-like. Reported growth came to +18.9%  primarily due to the increase in the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso against the euro.Despite an unfavorable basis of comparison  business in the region expanded at a fast pace  led by the contribution from a large number of new contracts  particularly with e-clients.During the quarter  growth was robust in Brazil  Argentina  Peru and in the nearshore activities  particularly in the Dominican Republic and Guatemala  as well as in Honduras and Nicaragua  where the Group recently launched operations. The multilingual operations in Portugal serving global market leaders in the digital economy continued to expand steadily.Across the region  business was very brisk in the social media  online entertainment  hospitality and tourism  online food services  automotive and healthcare segments.Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA)Revenue in the CEMEA region amounted to €459 million in the first three months of 2022  a year-on-year decline of -3.5% like-for-like and of -4.7% as reported  with the difference reflecting the decline in the Turkish lira and Russian ruble against the euro.The slight contraction in business stemmed from the change in contribution from Covid support contracts  particularly in the Netherlands  France and Germany. As expected  revenue from these contracts dropped off more markedly towards quarter-end  and will continue to decline sharply in the second quarter.Excluding the impact of Covid support contracts  business growth was satisfactory in the region. Business with multinational clients  particularly in the e-tailing and transportation segments  was dynamic over the period  notably in the German-speaking markets  Egypt  Romania and Poland. Growth in the hospitality and tourism segments continued to pick up pace in the first quarter.IndiaIn the first quarter of 2022  operations in India generated €128 million in revenue  up +17.1% from the prior-year period on a like-for-like basis and by a stronger +21.6% as reported  due to the positive currency effect caused by the upturn in the Indian rupee against the euro.Offshore activities  which are the main source of regional revenue and include high value-added solutions  enjoyed rapid growth over the period  buoyed by strong momentum in the e-tailing  transportation and hospitality and tourism segments.Domestic operations reported satisfactory growth while e-tailing and online food services continued to ramp-up quickly.Specialized ServicesRevenue from Specialized Services stood at €251 million in first-quarter 2022  a year-on-year increase of +15.5% like-for-like and of +42.2% as reported. The difference between like-for-like and reported growth stemmed from afavorable currency effect caused by the rise of the US dollar against the euro and a positive scope effect (+€32 million) due to the consolidation of Health Advocate from July 1  2021.TLScontact’s revenues climbed very sharply during the period  thanks to a favorable basis of comparison with stronger volumes’ recovery since the second half of last year.

This enables UniCredit to effectively offer Account Information Services (AIS) and Payment Initiation Services (PIS) and opens up a range of business opportunities for both UniCredit and its customers. UniCredit has been using Worldline’s Open Banking TPP service since 2020. The partnership has been extended for another two years.Cost-effective reach  enabling new services to support further growthThe partnership with Worldline provides huge benefits in terms of efficiency. Instead of establishing separate connections with many different banks  UniCredit gains extensive and cost-effective reach throughout Europe through a single API. Via this API  Worldline enables UniCredit and its customers to execute PIS and AIS services.What’s more  Worldline’s secure Open Banking infrastructure translates the formats of all different banks into a single API. This removes the complexity and friction of many diverse integrations and allows UniCredit to provide its customers with the ability to get a consolidated view of all their bank accounts held with one or more banks. It also enables them to initiate an online payment at an account from other bank in Europe. In addition  Worldline’s Open Banking TPP service allows UniCredit to discover new business opportunities to develop new services to the benefit of corporate and individual customers.Worldline is one of the largest Open Banking providers in Europe. The company has been actively working on PSD2/XS2A since 2014  aiming to help the industry to make PSD2 work in practice. Worldline is committed to unlocking the full potential of Open Banking by reaching around 3.500 banks in 19 countries across Europe and by enabling many use cases that allow banks to quickly and effectively create a value proposition for their clients. Besides the partnership for Open Banking  UniCredit also has long-term payment processing agreement with Worldline to handle all SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) transactions  instant payments  multi-currency  domestic and high value payments in Austria and Germany.Alessandro Baroni  Chief Business Division Officer at Worldline Financial Services  says: “As a leading and fast-growing Paytech company  we want to support our clients to flourish in the API driven-economy beyond their regional markets and grasp opportunities from Open Banking and Open Finance. We are proud that UniCredit decided to extend our existing partnership. It demonstrates their recognition of our added value  and we look forward to continue supporting them in their Open Banking journey.’’Luca Corsini  Head of Transactions and Payments at UniCredit  says: “As a tier 1 bank active in different European countries  we rely on support from a supplier with both scale and a cross-European presence in order to address the challenges and opportunities our customers are facing. In the past two years  Worldline has proven their Open Banking capabilities by providing cost-effective reach across Europe and enabling the services that our customers require. In addition  we are currently also building further on the opportunities that arise from PSD2 and Open Banking.”,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,positive,0.72,0.26,0.02,True,English,"['Worldline open banking deal', 'UniCredit', 'SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) transactions', 'one single application programming interface', 'Open Banking Third Party Provider', 'Chief Business Division Officer', 'long-term payment processing agreement', 'secure Open Banking infrastructure', 'largest Open Banking providers', 'Open Banking TPP service', 'Open Banking journey', 'Open Banking capabilities', 'many diverse integrations', 'many use cases', 'high value payments', 'Payment Initiation Services', 'fast-growing Paytech company', 'past two years', 'major pan-European banks', 'different European countries', 'many different banks', 'Account Information Services', 'new business opportunities', 'TPP) service', 'Worldline Financial Services', 'single API', 'Open Finance', 'payment services', 'instant payments', 'online payment', 'new services', 'value proposition', 'added value', 'global leader', 'Cost-effective reach', 'huge benefits', 'separate connections', 'consolidated view', 'other bank', 'full potential', 'Alessandro Baroni', 'regional markets', 'Luca Corsini', 'tier 1 bank', 'cross-European presence', 'AIS services', 'bank accounts', 'individual customers', 'existing partnership', 'UniCredit customers', '19 countries', '3.500 banks', 'Source', 'Euronext', 'WLN', 'PIS', 'range', 'growth', 'terms', 'efficiency', 'extensive', 'formats', 'complexity', 'friction', 'ability', 'addition', 'corporate', 'PSD2/XS2A', 'industry', 'practice', 'clients', 'domestic', 'Austria', 'Germany', 'leading', 'recognition', 'Head', 'support', 'supplier', 'scale', 'order', 'challenges']",2022-04-19,2022-04-20,finextra.com

3162,EuroNext,Google API,https://completemusicupdate.com/article/deezer-to-go-public-with-e1-05-billion-valuation/,Deezer to go public with €1.05 billion valuation,1 day ago,Deezer to go public with €1.05 billion valuationBy Chris Cooke | Published on Tuesday 19 April 2022French special purpose acquisition company I2PO has confirmed it has agreed a deal to merge with Deezer  a move that will result in the streaming music firm being publicly listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange.It was reported last week that a deal between I2PO and Deezer was close to being agreed. SPACs like I2PO are companies without any active operations that raise money on a stock exchange with the intent of using the cash to buy up privately owned businesses. When it did just that last year  I2PO confirmed it would use the monies it raised to enter the entertainment and leisure sector.The two companies confirmed yesterday that they had now “entered into a definitive agreement for a business combination that [will] result in the combined entity  to be renamed Deezer  becoming a publicly traded company on the professional segment of the regulated market of Euronext Paris”.Although one of the first subscription streaming services to launch  Deezer is a relatively small player in today’s music streaming market. While I2PO’s press release called Deezer the “second largest independent music streaming platform in the world” – because most of its main competitors are owned by tech giants like Apple  Amazon and Google – it is dwarfed by the largest independent platform Spotify.At the end of last year  music consultancy MIDIA estimated that Deezer commanded around 2% of the premium subscription market  while Spotify has 31%. In yesterday’s announcement  I2PO confirmed that Deezer currently has 9.6 million paying subscribers  which compares to Spotify’s most recently declared subscriber count of 180 million.However  plenty of people in the investment community remain optimistic about the future growth of the digital music market  and – as that market diversifies – there could be opportunities for established platforms like Deezer beyond simply signing up more people to a ten euro a month subscription. Plus  in its announcement  I2PO noted Deezer’s recent dabblings in the B2B space  powering music services for other media and digital companies  and in particular its partnership with RTL.So  maybe it will all turn out fine. The new deal values Deezer at 1.05 billion euros. And there’ll be cash aplenty to help further grow the company in the years ahead thanks funds already held by I2PO and monies raised via a round of ‘private investment in public equity’ involving  among others  many of Deezer’s current shareholders – like Orange  Universal Music and Warner Music  as well as the biggest current shareholder  which is Warner’s parent company Access Industries.Confirming all this  I2PO CEO Iris Knobloch said: “With its well-established brand  first-class management team and scalable platform  Deezer is poised to continue to capture a significant share in the booming music streaming growth. This is a perfect match and a transformational deal that will deliver long-term value creation for our shareholders as Deezer is a unique asset with considerable strategic avenues for future growth”.“With Deezer’s hybrid B2B/B2C strategy to enter key international markets  its highly competitive technology and focus on ESG [environmental  social  and governance]”  she went on  “we are confident that the company is well-positioned to disrupt and consolidate while providing a high-quality music streaming service to millions of users around the world”.Meanwhile  Deezer CEO Jeronimo Folgueira added: “Today marks an important milestone in Deezer’s history as we embark on a journey to become a publicly traded company on Euronext Paris. I am THRILLED to partner with I2PO who will provide us with the expertise  the global network and the capital we need to execute our strategic plan. We are uniquely positioned in the growing music streaming industry  with a very competitive product  a clear strategy and an experienced and renewed management team to seize this opportunity and create substantial shareholder value”.READ MORE ABOUT: Deezer | I2PO,neutral,0.02,0.89,0.08,mixed,0.52,0.19,0.28,True,English,"['€1.05 billion valuation', 'Deezer', 'French special purpose acquisition company', 'high-quality music streaming service', 'growing music streaming industry', 'booming music streaming growth', 'first subscription streaming services', 'independent music streaming platform', 'I2PO CEO Iris Knobloch', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'streaming music firm', 'largest independent platform', 'music streaming market', '9.6 million paying subscribers', 'long-term value creation', 'key international markets', 'substantial shareholder value', 'biggest current shareholder', 'considerable strategic avenues', 'hybrid B2B/B2C strategy', 'premium subscription market', 'first-class management team', 'digital music market', 'music services', 'music consultancy', 'Universal Music', 'scalable platform', 'future growth', 'Warner Music', 'strategic plan', 'clear strategy', 'regulated market', 'digital companies', 'Deezer CEO', '€1.05 billion valuation', 'Chris Cooke', 'active operations', 'leisure sector', 'definitive agreement', 'business combination', 'professional segment', 'small player', 'press release', 'main competitors', 'tech giants', 'last year', 'subscriber count', 'investment community', 'ten euro', 'recent dabblings', 'B2B space', 'other media', '1.05 billion euros', 'private investment', 'public equity', 'current shareholders', 'Access Industries', 'significant share', 'perfect match', 'unique asset', 'competitive technology', 'Jeronimo Folgueira', 'important milestone', 'global network', 'competitive product', 'parent company', 'two companies', 'new deal', 'cash aplenty', 'transformational deal', 'Tuesday', 'April', 'move', 'SPACs', 'money', 'intent', 'privately', 'businesses', 'monies', 'entertainment', 'entity', 'today', 'world', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Google', 'Spotify', 'MIDIA', 'yesterday', 'announcement', 'people', 'opportunities', 'platforms', 'partnership', 'RTL', 'years', 'funds', 'round', 'others', 'Orange', 'ESG', 'governance', 'millions', 'users', 'history', 'journey', 'expertise', 'capital', 'experienced', 'opportunity', 'READ']",2022-04-20,2022-04-20,completemusicupdate.com

Our decision to refocus on the spine is showing its relevance  with a very good first-quarter performance. In France  activity more than doubled compared with the first quarter of last year  driven by the JAZZ activity’s organic growth but also by the OSD range that has now been incorporated within our sales offer. In the rest of the world  sales have followed the same positive trend as in France  with revenue multiplied by 2.6. The slight fall in revenue in the United States was a result of the still considerable number of surgical operations being postponed due to COVID early in the quarter. Despite the context associated with the pandemic and the lack of hospital personnel  which are still major obstacles to the return to normal activity  our solid sales momentum makes us confident that our growth will continue over the coming quarters”.Revenue (in € thousands - IFRS*) Q1 2022 Q1 2021 Change Spine France 953 354 +169% United States 372 416 -10% Rest of the world 677 256 +164% Total Spine revenue 2 002 1 026 +95% Services 14 1 Total consolidated revenue  IFRS 2 016 1 026 +96%*Unaudited dataReminder: As per IFRS 5  revenue generated by Madison activity up to October 29  2021 is classified as divested business under the net profit/loss from continuing business.In the first quarter of 2022  Spine revenue doubled from €1.03 million to €2.02 million  thanks to the organic growth generated by JAZZ activity (+20%) and the strategic acquisition of OSD (which contributed €0.77 million in revenue).In France  activity was multiplied by 2.7  increasing from €0.35 million to €0.95 million  despite the still significant impact of COVID-19 and hospitals’ lack of resources in the first two months of the quarter. However  the trend observed in March is encouraging.In the United States  revenue totaled €0.37 million  compared with €0.42 million in the first quarter of 2021. The first surgeries with the OSD cervical plate were performed in the United States – their contribution to associated revenue will be visible in the second quarter of 2022.In the rest of the world  revenue grew from €0.26 million in the first quarter of 2021 to €0.68 million (multiplied by 2.6) in the first quarter of 2022  notably driven by Latin America.Lastly  within the framework of the divestment of the MADISONTM knee prosthesis business to SERF  and to ensure the continuity of regulatory obligations  Implanet signed a manufacturing contract. These services were billed €14 thousand in the first quarter of 2022.Key events of Q1 2022✓ First surgical procedures in the United States with JAZZ™ PF  innovative solution from the JAZZ® range✓ First surgical operations in the United States with the ORIGIN cervical plate  marking the first successes of the synergies with OSD products2022 strategy and outlookFinalize the globalization of our product offer for Spine surgery: Sustain the product synergies initiated in 2021 on our priority direct sales markets; Address group purchasing organizations  both in the public sector and in private facility groups.Revitalize our presence in the United States: Add to the existing commercial team; Strengthen our direct approach by expanding our opinion leader scientific team; Launch  in 2022  two more product ranges resulting from the acquisition of OSD: SWINGO and ORIGIN.Seek strategic partnerships to allow Implanet to enter a new phase and achieve revenue leading to financial equilibrium in the short / medium term.Upcoming financial events:Annual General Meeting  May 17  2022 at 2.00 pm (CEST) at the Company’s headquartersH1 2021 revenue  July 11  2022 after marketAbout IMPLANETFounded in 2007  IMPLANET is a medical technology company that manufactures high-quality implants for orthopedic surgery.

The nomination committee further proposes that Ing-Marie Andersson Drugge be elected as member of the board  for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting. Greg Hall has declined re-election.Ing-Marie Andersson Drugge has a MSc Engineer/Metallurgist degree from University of Luleå and she has substantial experience from management positions within the processing industry. Her experience also includes senior positions within Boliden and Outokumpu. Ing-Marie Andersson Drugge also has earlier board experience from  among others  Swerim AB  EIT Raw Materials and SIP-STRIM  a Swedish innovation programme for mines and smelters.The nomination committee proposes that Öhrlings PricewaterhouseCoopers AB  with Martin Johansson as auditor in charge  shall be re-elected as auditor in the Company for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting.Item 10: Resolution on authorisation for the board of directors to resolve on new issuesThe board of directors of Copperstone Resources AB (publ)  reg.no. 556704-4168 proposes that the general meeting resolves to authorise the board for the period until the next annual general meeting  at one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  against payment in cash or through set-off or in kind  or otherwise with conditions  to resolve on an issue of new shares  convertibles or warrants. The total number of issued shares  or the number of shares that may be issued upon conversion of convertibles or through exercise of warrants  may not exceed 20 per cent of the registered number of shares in the Company at the time of the general meeting’s resolution. The number of shares which may be issued upon conversion of convertibles or through exercise of warrants refers to the number of shares before a potential recalculation. The purpose of the authorisation  and the reason for the possibility to deviate from the shareholder’s preferential rights  is to enable the Company to  in a promptly and cost-effective manner  procure capital  carry out acquisitions or make use of other strategic opportunities. The value transferred to the Company through issues by virtue of the authorisation  shall be made on market terms and may include a market-based issue discount.The board of directors  or the person the board appoints  shall have the right to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.In order for a valid resolution  made by the general meeting in accordance with the board of directors’ proposal  the resolution must be supported by shareholders holding no less than two-thirds of both the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the general meeting.Item 11: Resolution on adoption of Incentive program 2022/2025:1 by way of (A) issue of warrants to the subsidiary Copperstone Incentive AB and (B) approval of transfer of warrants to management and key personnel in the CompanyThe board of directors of Copperstone Resources AB (publ) reg.no. 556704-4168  proposes that the general meeting resolves to adopt an incentive program aimed for management and key personnel in the Company. This is proposed to be carried out by way of a directed issue of warrants to the wholly owned subsidiary Copperstone Incentive AB (the “Subsidiary”) in accordance with the resolution item (A) below  and transfer to selected management and key personnel in accordance with resolution item (B). The resolution items (A) and (B) are mutually conditioned by each other and are resolved upon one resolution.The board of directors assesses that it is urgent and in the interest of all shareholders that management and key personnel have a long-term interest of a good value development of the share in the Company. A personal and a long-term ownership commitment may be expected to contribute to an increased interest of the Company’s operations and results as well as to increase the motivation for  and affinity with  the Company and its shareholders.(A) – Issue of warrants to the subsidiary Copperstone Incentive ABThe board of directors proposes that a directed issue of warrants is carried out by way of no more than 12 000 000 warrants of series 2022/2025:1 shall be issued. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  only accrue to the Subsidiary. The intention is that the warrants afterwards shall be transferred to management and key personnel in the Company in accordance with what is stated in resolution item (B). The reason for that the issue is proposed to deviate from the shareholders’ preferential rights is therefore to create incentives for management and key personnel to at all times work for the Company’s positive development since these possess management roles or key roles in the Company and thereby constitutes an important part of the Company’s continued operations. The warrants are issued without consideration. Each warrant shall entitle to subscription of one (1) share in the Company to a subscription price per share corresponding to the current share price in connection with the annual general meeting  which further will be seen in the board of directors’ complete proposal  multiplicated with 1.5. Subscription of shares by exercising the warrants shall  in accordance with the terms and conditions for the warrants  be possible to carry out up until and including 18 December 2025. In the event that all of the warrants are exercised for subscription of shares  the Company’s registered share capital will be increased with SEK 1 200 000. The terms and conditions  including customary provisions of recalculation with regard to certain events related to the Company etc.  which will be set forth in the board of directors’ complete proposal  shall be applied regarding the warrants.(B) - Approval of transfer of warrants to management and key personnel in the CompanyFurther  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary shall transfer no more than 12 000 000 warrants in total to management or key personnel (or wholly owned companies by these persons) in the Company with the distribution stated below.Position / Categories The number of warrants CEO Maximum 2 500 000 warrants Management and other key personnel  including consultants on a permanent basis Maximum 2 000 000 warrants per person Newly employed management and key personnel Maximum 2 000 000 warrants per person Other employees Maximum 500 000 warrants per personThe warrants shall be transferred on market-based terms to a price determined on the basis of the calculated market value for the warrants at the time for transfer  by an application of Black & Scholes valuation model (options premium). The calculation of the option premium to management shall be made or controlled by an independent valuation expert  or shall be made on the basis of the expert’s valuation. Further  a so-called offer of first refusal-agreement  shall be entered into  according to which the warrant holder shall be obliged to offer the Company to acquire the warrants  or a certain part of these  under certain conditions.DilutionBased on the current number of shares in the Company  the dilution as a consequence of the proposed incentive program  with the assumption that all warrants will be exercised for subscription of shares  will not exceed 1 per cent of the shares and votes in the Company (not included the dilution which may arise as a result of the proposed incentive program for the board of directors and the Company’s current incentive programs).Costs for the incentive program and effects to important key figuresThe incentive program 2022/2025:1 has been prepared in consultation with external advisors and the total cost for this advice is not expected to amount to noteworthy amounts. Beyond the costs for advisors  the board of directors assesses that the incentive program will cause some administrative costs in connection to subscription of shares by exercising of the warrants and registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Furthermore  the Company may link salary-based bonuses to allotments in order to facilitate participation in the program  the bonus costs of which in that case will fall within the Company's ordinary personnel costs.The stated dilution above refers to in relation to the Company’s key figure the dilution of the number of shares  and finally affects relevant key figures first if the Company’s value has risen so much that exercising is carried out during the maturity period. In such a case  the dilution should be counteracted by the fact that the Company  in the event of full exercising  would (based on current share price) be added an amount of approximately SEK 21 600 000.Earlier incentive programs in the CompanyThe Company has currently some ongoing share-related incentive programs which include management  and some ongoing share-related incentive programs which include members of the board of directors. All of the Company’s warrant programs are presented on the Company’s website and will be described in the board of directors’ proposal. In the event that the incentive program in accordance with the board of directors’ proposal above as well as the nomination committee’s proposal regarding incentive program aimed for the board of directors  would be fully implemented within the now intended frames  the total numerical dilution together with the today existing warrant programs  will not exceed 5 per cent.Majority requirementsResolution to adopt incentive programs according to the above stated  is covered by the rules for the board of directors and management in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551)  which  in order for a valid resolution  requires that the proposal under this item is supported by shareholders representing no less than nine tenth (9/10) of both the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the general meeting.Item 12: Resolution on adoption of Incentive program 2022/2025:2 by way of (A) issue of warrants to the subsidiary Copperstone Incentive AB and (B) approval of transfer of warrants to members of the board of directorsThe nomination committee in Copperstone Resources AB (publ) reg.no. 556704-4168  proposes that the general meeting resolves to adopt an incentive program aimed for members of the board of directors in the Company.

The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  only accrue to the Subsidiary. The intention is that the warrants afterwards shall be transferred to members of the board of directors in the Company in accordance with what is stated in resolution item (B).

The LTI has been discussed at board meetings during the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022. The board of directors or the remuneration committee shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of the LTI Bonus in accordance with the terms and guidelines resolved on by the annual general meeting.Objectives of the LTI BonusThe main objective of the LTI Bonus is to  by promoting a common interest between the participants and Haldex as well as creating conditions to retain key competences  strengthen Haldex's financial development. The board of directors believes that the LTI Bonus will have a positive effect on the group's long-term growth as well as the participant's long-term commitment to Haldex's development through a long-term shareholding in Haldex and will thus be beneficial to both the shareholders and Haldex. The long-term objective of the LTI Bonus is reflected in the agreement with the participant of the LTI Bonus.Participants and bonus levelsParticipants in the LTI Bonus are up to 26 key employees  including members of the executive management  in Haldex  as selected by the board of directors. On the main terms and conditions presented herein  the participants will receive a cash bonus that they will use to purchase shares in Haldex. The maximum bonus amount payable to each participant corresponds to 60% of the relevant participant's annual  gross base salary. The bonus amount will be determined by the level of fulfilment of the performance criteria  as per below.Main terms of the LTI BonusThe LTI Bonus shall be governed by the following main terms and conditions:The LTI Bonus is vested during the calendar years 2022 and 2023 (the ""Vesting Period"") and is conditional upon  among other things  the fulfilment of certain performance criteria and that the participant is employed by the Haldex group  in accordance with the main terms stipulated herein and the specific terms which will be included in the agreement with the participant.The participants undertake to purchase shares in Haldex for the full net of tax amount of the cash bonus. The share purchases will take place on the stock exchange where the Haldex shares are listed and at the price per share that the shares are currently traded for at the time of the acquisition  why the share purchases will be made at the market value.The LTI Bonus will not result in any dilution of the existing shareholders' shares in the company as the participants acquires shares that are already traded on the stock exchange. This also means that Haldex does not have to take any measures to ensure delivery of the shares to the participants.The participants must in general be employed by the Haldex group during the entire Vesting Period  i.e. January 1  2022 – December 31  2023   to be eligible for the bonus. If a participant has been employed during the Vesting Period  the bonus amount shall be reduced pro rata the employment period. A participant who has terminated his or her employment during the Vesting Period shall not be eligible for the bonus.–   to be eligible for the bonus. If a participant has been employed during the Vesting Period  the bonus amount shall be reduced the employment period. A participant who has terminated his or her employment during the Vesting Period shall not be eligible for the bonus. The participants may not dispose of the shares until  at the earliest  January 1  2026 .. To ensure an effective administration of the LTI Bonus  Haldex has contracted a share plan administrator. Via the administrator  the participants will be able to acquire the shares in Haldex and  as of January 1  2026   dispose of the shares.Performance criteria for LTI BonusIn addition to the other conditions  in order for a cash bonus to be made payable to the participants  two performance criteria must be met during the calendar year 2022. The level of fulfilment of the performance criteria will determine the cash bonus amount. The two performance criteria are:Return on capital employed (ROCE)  which represents 70% of the total award; and Operating profit  which represents 30% of the total award.The level of fulfilment of the performance criteria is measured against the budget approved by the board of directors for 2022.Timing of the share acquisitionLTI Bonus is constructed so that at the expiry of the Vesting Period  i.e. during 2024  the board of directors shall assess the level of fulfilment of the performance criteria in the calendar year 2022 as well as whether the other conditions for LTI-Bonus have been fulfilled. Thereafter  the bonus amount is paid out and shares can be acquired. The shares will thus be acquired in 2024  the year after the expiry of the Vesting Period. The reason why the share acquisition takes place earlier than three years from the conclusion of the LTI Bonus agreement is that the participants shall be able to take part in the shares' value development in the coming years. The participants undertake not to sell the acquired shares until after December 31  2025 at the earliest. As a result  the program as a whole is ongoing for a longer period than three years.Cost of the LTI BonusIn addition to the bonus amounts being paid out  the costs for the LTI Bonus consist of regular personnel costs associated with cash compensation and an administration cost for the administrator's handling of the LTI Bonus. The costs will vary depending on the level of fulfilment of the performance criteria and the participants' salary and tax domicile. According to initial calculations  Haldex's costs for the bonus are estimated at between SEK 6–24 million. The administrator's costs for the administration of the LTI Bonus consist of an annual fee that will be recurrent throughout the years that the administration is ongoing.Administration of the LTI BonusThe detailed terms and conditions of the LTI Bonus shall be decided by the board of directors or the remuneration committee  but shall remain within the framework of the terms and guidelines resolved on by the annual general meetingIt is proposed that the board of directors shall be entitled to make other adjustments to the LTI Bonus  if it so deems appropriate  if changes occur in Haldex  its operation environment or the market that results in a situation where the conditions for the participants' share acquisitions becomes unreasonable. Any such adjustments shall only be made in order to fulfil the main objectives of the LTI Bonus.Majority requirementsResolutions passed by the annual general meeting in accordance with the board of director's proposal item 14 are valid if supported by simple majority.Item 15: Confirmation of 2021 LTI allotmentAt the 2021 annual general meeting  a long-term incentive program for the CEO was approved (the ""2021 LTI""). The 2021 LTI included a right to  under certain conditions  acquire Haldex shares against a pre-defined strike price (the ""Options""). Pursuant to the terms of the 2021 LTI  the CEO were to acquire the Qualifying Shares and Options were to be granted not later than 31 July 2021. However  these conditions where not fulfilled on time.

One idea raised would move payment processes onshore  enabling firms to avoid the restrictions that have blocked bond payments.EDB proposes buying back at least $200 million of the debt at a maximum of 80% face value  according to a filing on Tuesday. That would wind up saving it at least $44 million  including interest accrued until Sept. 20  when the $500 million note matures  Bloomberg calculations show.KNG Securities was offering to buy EDB’s 2022 notes at 48 cents on the dollar and selling them at 68 cents on Tuesday  underscoring the price impact of the Kazakh lender’s dependence on Russia. Mizuho was indicating buy-sell offers for 60-90 cents on the dollar  according to data compiled by Bloomberg.For bondholders  it gives a route to cashing out early  albeit at a potential loss. But it has the advantage of avoiding potential complications that could scupper payment on the maturity date altogether.Sanctions imposed on Russia as punishment for the invasion have made for a rocky path to payment.Foreign bondholders of companies including Severstal PJSC and Russian Railways are still waiting to receive money that was held up by international lenders wary of violating sanctions.Read More: Citi’s Caution Threatens to Send More Russian Debt Into DefaultRussian investors have fared little better. The world’s biggest settlement systems -- Euroclear and Clearstream -- have blocked accounts with the local Russian depository  leaving payments in limbo.Now the regulators are stepping in.A Russian government subcommittee for foreign investment control recommended issuers make payments separately to foreign and Russian holders. The Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs -- Russia’s big-business lobby-- proposed bringing the role of paying agent and register for the bonds onshore  warning of a potential wave of cross-defaults and foreign asset freezes.It’s far from clear if the proposals will be adopted  and companies are looking for alternatives in the meantime.Russian oil services company Borets is trying to win investor approval to delay the maturity of its notes by a year. With an April 22 deadline approaching  bondholders with over 80% of the debt have backed the proposal  according to an email seen by Bloomberg. The company is offering investors a 0.35% premium to get over the 90% threshold required.©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.02,0.29,0.7,negative,0.02,0.14,0.84,True,English,"['Russian-Linked Bank Plots', 'Bond Chaos', 'Buyback', 'Russian oil services company', 'Eurasian Development Bank', 'biggest settlement systems', 'local Russian depository', 'Russian government subcommittee', 'foreign investment control', 'foreign asset freezes', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'More Russian Debt', 'Russian exposure', 'Russian sources', 'Russian Railways', 'Russian holders', 'first company', 'Russian investors', 'Bond-market turmoil', 'funding costs', 'resulting loss', 'One idea', '80% face value', '$500 million note', 'KNG Securities', 'price impact', 'buy-sell offers', 'potential loss', 'potential complications', 'rocky path', 'Severstal PJSC', 'international lenders', 'The Union', 'big-business lobby', 'paying agent', 'potential wave', 'investor approval', 'April 22 deadline', 'Bloomberg calculations', 'Foreign bondholders', 'Kazakh lender', 'maturity date', 'international sanctions', 'payment processes', 'bond payments', '60-90 cents', '48 cents', '68 cents', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'Almaty', 'Kazakhstan', 'two-thirds', 'capital', 'advantage', 'discount', 'bonds', 'distressed', 'territory', 'Issuers', 'debts', 'firms', 'restrictions', 'EDB', 'maximum', 'filing', 'Tuesday', 'interest', 'Sept.', '2022 notes', 'dollar', 'dependence', 'Mizuho', 'data', 'route', 'punishment', 'companies', 'money', 'Citi', 'Caution', 'Default', 'world', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'accounts', 'limbo', 'regulators', 'Industrialists', 'Entrepreneurs', 'role', 'proposals', 'alternatives', 'meantime', 'Borets', 'year', 'email', '0.35% premium', '90% threshold']",2022-04-19,2022-04-20,bnnbloomberg.ca

The Securities will be issued initially in 2/3/5 year tenures; followed by a 10-year bond later.These securities will be auctioned and traded through Bloomberg’s Auction System and settled through a local platform  compliant with international standards  built and operated by Euroclear Bank.The Ministry of Finance and the UAE Central Bank worked with relevant government entities and international financial bodies to ensure best practice was followed when structuring the T-Bonds.The Ministry has published a robust Primary Dealers code  and on boarded six banks  namely ADCB  Emirates NBD  FAB  HSBC  Mashreq and Standard Chartered  as Primary Dealers to participate in the T-Bonds primary market auction and to actively develop the secondary market.Commenting on the announcement of T-Bonds issuance  Mohamed Hadi Al Hussaini  Minister of State for Financial Affairs  emphasised that the issuance of the UAE Dirham-denominated T-Bond tranches followed the government’s directives and aligned with international best practice.“Issuing the T-Bonds in local currency will contribute to building a local currency bond market  diversifying financing resources  boosting the local financial and banking sector  as well as providing safe investment alternatives for local and foreign investors.

With the robust financial market infrastructure developed for the purpose  we are confident that the launch of such a programme will enable market participants in the UAE to maintain a transparent  single  diversified and sustainable pool of Dirham liquidity.“It shall also contribute to the implementation of the new Dirham Monetary Framework and support the ongoing work on establishing the Dirham risk-free pricing benchmark (yield curve)  which would stimulate further domestic market activities. We  at the CBUAE  are pleased with the positive outcome of our partnership with MoF  Euroclear  and Bloomberg in this regard.” Sudip Chatterjee  Head of Global Capital Markets at Euroclear  stated that the issuance of the T-Bonds comes as the next step forward in developing the local capital market. This is made possible thanks to the launch of the innovative end-to-end platform and the creation of a short-term yield curve by the Central Bank early last year.“As a long term partner to the UAE  we are proud of our continued collaboration with the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank to develop the capital market  which will impact other domestic activities ” he added.Separately  Dubai Financial Market announced on Tuesday that HSBC has become the first international General Clearing Member (GCM) to join the market  enabling the bank to provide clearing and settlement services to its customers worldwide and to other DFM trading members.The introduction of GCM service on DFM by HSBC is part of a wider collaboration programme between the two entities aimed at enhancing market infrastructure and connectivity with international and institutional investors.WAM,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,positive,0.81,0.16,0.03,True,English,"['Domestic Dirhams Treasury Bonds', 'UAE', 'conventional Dirham denominated Treasury Bonds', 'first international General Clearing Member', 'new Dirham Monetary Framework', 'robust Primary Dealers code', 'Dirham risk-free pricing benchmark', 'other DFM trading members', 'UAE Dirham-denominated T-Bond tranches', 'Mohamed Hadi Al Hussaini', 'local bonds debt market', 'robust financial market infrastructure', 'UAE Dirham-denominated yield curve', 'T-Bonds primary market auction', 'local currency bond market', 'first auction date', 'UAE dirham-denominated bonds', 'benchmark auction size', 'Khaled Mohamed Balama', 'other domestic activities', 'mid-term yield curve', '2/3/5 year tenures', 'future funding needs', 'transparent, single, diversified', 'short-term yield curve', 'long term partner', 'domestic market activities', 'Dirham local market', 'Monetary Bills programme', 'Global Capital Markets', 'international financial bodies', 'Dubai Financial Market', 'safe investment alternatives', 'other UAE markets', 'local financial market', 'local capital market', 'international best practice', 'wider collaboration programme', 'relevant government entities', 'The Central Bank', 'UAE Central Bank', 'Dirham liquidity', 'conventional T-Bonds', 'Auction System', 'pricing reference', 'Financial Affairs', 'market conditions', 'international standards', 'secondary market', 'market participants', 'local platform', 'investment environment', 'two entities', '10-year bond', 'The UAE', 'UAE dirhams', 'Abu Dhabi', 'paying agent', 'periodical auctions', 'six banks', 'Standard Chartered', 'financing resources', 'banking sector', 'foreign investors', 'public sector', 'sustainable pool', 'ongoing work', 'positive outcome', 'Sudip Chatterjee', 'next step', 'innovative end', 'end platform', 'continued collaboration', 'settlement services', 'institutional investors', 'T-Bonds programme', 'The Securities', 'The Ministry', 'GCM service', 'Euroclear Bank', 'Issuance Calendar', 'MoF website', 'T-Bonds issuance', 'Finance', 'Issuer', 'CBUAE', 'issuing', 'launch', 'Dhs', 'May', 'series', 'aim', 'Bloomberg', 'ADCB', 'Emirates', 'NBD', 'FAB', 'HSBC', 'Mashreq', 'announcement', 'Minister', 'State', 'directives', 'equity', 'ability', 'opportunities', 'Governor', 'milestone', 'development', 'purpose', 'implementation', 'partnership', 'regard', 'Head', 'creation', 'Tuesday', 'customers', 'introduction', 'connectivity', 'WAM']",2022-04-20,2022-04-20,gulftoday.ae

However  any necessary and reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the Nomination Committee's work shall be borne by the Company.Item 13 – Guidelines for remuneration to senior executivesThe Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to adopt the following guidelines for remuneration to senior executives.GeneralGuidelines for remuneration and other employment terms for management primarily imply that the Company should offer its senior executives market remuneration  that the remuneration shall be subject to consultation by a dedicated remuneration committee within the Board of Directors  that the associated criteria shall constitute the senior executive’s responsibilities  role  competence  and position. Remuneration to senior executives is decided by the Board of Directors excluding any Board members affiliated to the Company and management.As a guiding principle the remuneration should promote the Company’s business strategy  long-term interests  and sustainability by linking the remuneration to senior executives to the corporate goals. The corporate goals and the attainment of the corporate goals are decided by the Board of Directors each financial year. The Board of Directors is of the opinion that by linking remuneration to corporate goals that are derived from the Company’s long-term strategy alignment between management and key stakeholders is achieved.The guidelines shall be applied to new agreements  or amendments to existing agreements  reached between senior executives after the guidelines have been adopted and until new or revised guidelines are determined.What is stipulated for Affibody Medical AB also applies to other group companies  where applicable.Basic principleSalary and other remuneration shall be on market terms and shall be structured so that Affibody can attract and retain competent senior executives. Additionally  the general meeting may – irrespective of these guidelines – resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration.Fixed RemunerationSenior executives shall be offered fixed remuneration that is on market terms and based on the senior executive's responsibilities  role  competence  and position. Fixed remuneration shall be subject to annual review by the remuneration committee.Variable RemunerationShort-term incentive (Bonus plan)Senior executives shall be offered a short-term incentive that is on market terms and based on the senior executive's responsibilities  role  competence  and position. The variable remuneration shall be based on the Board of Directors’ assessment of the fulfilment of Affibody’s corporate goals  as decided by the Board of Directors  for the financial year and will be calculated as the percentage of corporate goal attainment multiplied by the maximum bonus.The bonus plan should promote the Company’s business strategy  long-term interests  and sustainability by linking the remuneration to senior executives to the corporate goals. The corporate goals and the attainment of the corporate goals are decided by the Board of Directors each financial year.The measurement period for the corporate goals is generally based on a period of approximately 12 months. The extent to which the corporate goals have been satisfied shall be evaluated/determined by the Board of Directors when the measurement period has ended.At the annual review  the remuneration committee  or when applicable  the Board of Directors  may adjust the targets and/or the remuneration with regards to both positive and negative extraordinary events  reorganizations  and structural changes.The maximum amount of variable remuneration is capped at an amount corresponding to 40% of the fixed annual compensation for the CEO  33% of the fixed annual compensation for the CMO and CSO  and 25% of the fixed annual compensation for other senior executives.Variable compensation may either be paid as salary or as a lump-sum pension premium. Payment as a lump-sum pension premium is subject to indexation so the total cost for Affibody is neutral.Long-term IncentiveThe Board of Directors shall  before every annual general meeting  consider whether additional share or share price-related incentive programs shall be proposed to the general meeting to ensure that the long-term incentive is on market terms and structured so that Affibody can attract and retain competent senior executives.It is the general meeting that resolves upon such incentive programs. Incentive programs shall promote long-term value growth. New share issues and transfers of securities resolved upon by the general meeting in accordance with the rules of Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act are not covered by the guidelines to the extent the annual general meeting has taken  or will take  such decisions.Pension and benefitsSenior executives are entitled to market-based pension solutions in accordance with collective bargaining agreements and in line with Affibody’s pension policy. The preferred pension plan design is defined contribution. If the operating environment requires the establishment of a defined benefit pension plan under mandatory collective agreement provisions  law  or other regulations  such a plan may be established. The defined benefit level should in such cases be limited to the mandatory level.Variable cash remuneration shall not entitle to pension payments  unless required by mandatory collective bargaining agreement provisions. Salary waivers may be utilized to increase pension provisions through lump-sum pension premiums  providing the total cost for Affibody is neutral.The pension premiums or allowance for pension shall amount to not more than 40 per cent of the member’s pensionable salary  which may include a capped level of the variable pay to the extent required by mandatory collective bargaining agreement provisions.Executives who are expatriates to or from Sweden may receive additional remuneration and other benefits  such as a support package including relocation and tax filing support as well as tax equalization  to the extent reasonable considering the special circumstances associated with the expat arrangement  considering  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines. Such benefits may not in total exceed 20 per cent of the annual gross fixed base salary.Other benefits may include  for example  life insurance  health insurance  and  medical insurance. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits shall be based on market practice and mandatory collective bargaining agreement provisions but amount to no more than 20 per cent of the annual gross fixed base salary.Termination of employmentFrom Affibody’s side  the maximum notice period shall be twelve months  or such longer time as required by mandatory collective agreement provisions  law  or other regulations. The notice period from the CEO’s side shall be a minimum of six months  and from other senior executives’ side  shall be a minimum of six months  or such longer time as required under mandatory collective agreement provisions  law  or other regulations.The Company does not have any severance payment provisions.The preparation and decision making of the Board of DirectorsThe Board of Directors has established a remuneration committee. The committee’s tasks include preparing the Board of Directors’ decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration and any decision to deviate from the guidelines.The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the annual general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the annual general meeting. The remuneration committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the senior executives  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration  as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the Company. The CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors’ processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Deviation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to deviate from these guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause motivating the deviation and a deviation is necessary to serve the Company’s long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the Company’s financial viability. As set out above  the remuneration committee’s tasks include preparing the Board of Directors’ resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to deviate from these guidelines.Item 14 – Resolution regarding (A) introduction of an employee stock option program 2022/2029  (B) directed issue of warrants  and (C) approval of transferThe Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting resolves (A) on the introduction of an employee stock option program for the Company’s management  researchers  and other staff  (B) on an issue of warrants to the Company to ensure the Company’s delivery of shares according to the employee stock option program and (C) on approval of transfer of warrants or shares in the Company to the participants in the employee stock option program.It is considered essential and in all shareholders’ interest that the Company’s management  researchers  and other staff who are important for the Company's further development  have a long-term interest in an increase of the value of the Company’s shares. A personal long-term ownership commitment can be expected to contribute to an increased interest in the Company's operations and results as well as raise the participants’ motivation and sense of community with the Company and its shareholders.The program has been prepared by the remuneration committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors.A. Employee stock option program 2022/2029The Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on the introduction of an employee stock option program 2022/2029 on the following main terms:The employee stock option program 2022/2029 shall comprise not more than 295 000 stock options.The employee stock options shall be allotted to participants in the program free of charge no later than before the next annual general meeting.Each employee stock option shall entitle the holder to acquire one (1) new share in the Company at an exercise price determined by the Board of Directors from time to time. The exercise price shall not be less than 120% of the market value of the Company’s share at the time of allotment. If the Company’s share is not publicly traded at the time of allotment  the market value shall be based on an external valuation no older than six (6) months. In the event the Company’s share is publicly traded at the time of allotment  the market value shall be deemed to correspond to the volume weighted average price (VWAP) calculated during a period of ten (10) trading days prior to the decision of allotment.Offers of employee stock options shall be decided by the Company’s Board of Directors based on the following categories of employees: CEO  executive team  senior key employees  and key employees. The number of employee stock options to be allotted to individual persons is to be decided by the Board of Directors but cannot exceed the number set out in the table below. The total number of stock options under the program can never exceed 295 000.Maximum number of stock options per person CEO 200 000 Executive team 75 000 Senior key employees 10 000 Key employees 5 000The employee stock options may  unless the Board of Directors of the Company resolves on a right of subscription prior thereto  be exercised no earlier than three (3) years after the participant signed the option agreement relating to the employee stock options  and no later than 30 May 2029.The right to participate in the employee stock option program 2022/2029 is subject to the participant entering into an option agreement with the Company.Issued employee stock options do not constitute securities and may not be transferred  pledged  or otherwise disposed of by the holder.The stock options are tied to the participant's employment in the Company. If the employment is terminated prior to the warrants being exercised for share subscription  all the participant’s unused employee stock options lapse without any right of exercise  unless the Board of Directors of the Company resolves otherwise.If a general meeting should resolve on e.g.  an increase or decrease of the number of outstanding shares during the term of the employee stock options  recalculation can be performed to maintain the value of the employee stock options. Decisions regarding recalculation shall be made by the Board of Directors of the Company.The Board of Directors or a person designated by the Board of Directors shall have the right to decide on minor deviations in the program that may be needed to fulfill the program's purpose.Participation in the employee stock option program 2022/2029 requires  first  that such participation may lawfully be made  secondly  that such participation according to the Company's assessment can be made with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts.The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the further design and handling of the stock option program within the main conditions set out above.Based on full allocation under the ESOP 2022/2029program  the program will comprise no more than 295 000 shares  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.1 percent on a fully diluted basis.Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the Company (ESOP 2021/2028) the total dilution for ESOP 2021/2028 and ESOP 2022/2029 amounts to 5.8 percent on a fully diluted basis. In this respect it should be noted that 295 000 stock options  and corresponding warrants  under the ESOP 2021/2028 have been voided during the first quarter of 2022.B. Directed issue of warrantsTo enable the Company's delivery of shares under the employee stock option program2022/2029  it is further proposed that the general meeting resolves on a directed issue of no more than 295 000 warrants according to the following terms:The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  vest with the Company. Oversubscription cannot occur.The reason for deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is that the issue is a step in the introduction of the employee stock option program 2022/2029.The warrants are issued free of charge.Subscription of warrants shall be made within three (3) weeks from the date of the resolution to issue the warrants. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the subscription period.The increase of the Company’s share capital may  upon full exercise of the warrants  amount to a maximum of SEK 1 475 000.The warrants can be exercised for subscription of new shares during the period from registration at the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 30 June 2029.The subscription price for the share on exercise of the warrants is SEK 5 corresponding to the quota value of the Company’s shares. The subscription price may in no case be less than the quota value.Detailed terms apply for the warrants.The Board of Directors  or a person designated by the Board of Directors  is authorized to make minor adjustments that are required for the registration and execution of the decision.C. Approval of the transfer of warrants or shares in the Company to participants in theemployee stock option program 2022/2029.It is finally proposed that the general meeting resolves to authorize the Company to transfer warrants or shares in the Company to participants in the employee stock option program 2022/2029  or otherwise dispose of the warrants to fulfill the Company's obligations arising from the employee stock option program 2022/2029.Item 15 – Resolution on authorization for issues of shares  convertibles  or warrantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to  on one or several occasions during the period up to the next annual general meeting  increase the Company’s share capital through issues of new shares  convertible instruments and/or warrants  with or without deviating from the shareholder’s preferential rights  and with or without provisions on payment by non-cash consideration and/or by way of set-off or other provisions.The purpose of the authorization and the reason to propose that the Board of Directors shall be authorized to resolve on issues with deviation from the shareholders’ pre-emption rights is to give the Board of Directors flexibility in the work of ensuring that the Company shall be able to raise capital to finance the operations and to enable continued expansion both organically and through acquisitions of companies and businesses  alternatively to enable a broadening of the ownership of the Company with one or several owners of strategic importance to the Company.An issue in accordance with this authorization shall be on market conditions. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to decide on additional terms and conditions for issues under this authorization and who shall be entitled to subscribe for the shares  warrants and/or convertible instruments. If the Board of Directors deems it appropriate to facilitate the delivery of shares in connection with an issue in accordance with this authorization  the issue may also take place at a subscription price which correspond to the quota value of the shares (provided that the Company ensures through relevant agreements that market compensation is received for the issued shares).Majority requirementsA resolution in accordance with the proposals in item 15 above requires that it is supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.A resolution in accordance with the proposal in items 14 above requires that it is supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Number of shares and votesAt the time of issuing this notice the total number of shares and votes in the Company amounts to 19 879 494.The shareholders’ right to informationUpon request by any shareholder and where the Board of Directors believes that such may take place without significant harm to the Company  the Board of Directors shall provide information in respect of any circumstances which may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda or the Company’s and the group’s financial position as well as the Company’s relationship to other group companies.Provision of documentsThe annual report and the auditor’s report  complete proposals for resolutions and all other documents pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act will be available at the Company’s website www.affibody.se and the Company’s office at Scheeles väg 2  Solna no later than three weeks before the meeting  i.e.  no later than Thursday 28 April 2022.

The LTI has been discussed at board meetings during the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022. The board of directors or the remuneration committee shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of the LTI Bonus in accordance with the terms and guidelines resolved on by the annual general meeting.Objectives of the LTI BonusThe main objective of the LTI Bonus is to  by promoting a common interest between the participants and Haldex as well as creating conditions to retain key competences  strengthen Haldex's financial development. The board of directors believes that the LTI Bonus will have a positive effect on the group's long-term growth as well as the participant's long-term commitment to Haldex's development through a long-term shareholding in Haldex and will thus be beneficial to both the shareholders and Haldex. The long-term objective of the LTI Bonus is reflected in the agreement with the participant of the LTI Bonus.Participants and bonus levelsParticipants in the LTI Bonus are up to 26 key employees  including members of the executive management  in Haldex  as selected by the board of directors. On the main terms and conditions presented herein  the participants will receive a cash bonus that they will use to purchase shares in Haldex. The maximum bonus amount payable to each participant corresponds to 60% of the relevant participant's annual  gross base salary. The bonus amount will be determined by the level of fulfilment of the performance criteria  as per below.Main terms of the LTI BonusThe LTI Bonus shall be governed by the following main terms and conditions:The LTI Bonus is vested during the calendar years 2022 and 2023 (the ""Vesting Period"") and is conditional upon  among other things  the fulfilment of certain performance criteria and that the participant is employed by the Haldex group  in accordance with the main terms stipulated herein and the specific terms which will be included in the agreement with the participant.The participants undertake to purchase shares in Haldex for the full net of tax amount of the cash bonus. The share purchases will take place on the stock exchange where the Haldex shares are listed and at the price per share that the shares are currently traded for at the time of the acquisition  why the share purchases will be made at the market value.The LTI Bonus will not result in any dilution of the existing shareholders' shares in the company as the participants acquires shares that are already traded on the stock exchange. This also means that Haldex does not have to take any measures to ensure delivery of the shares to the participants.The participants must in general be employed by the Haldex group during the entire Vesting Period  i.e. January 1  2022 – December 31  2023  to be eligible for the bonus. If a participant has been employed during the Vesting Period  the bonus amount shall be reduced pro rata the employment period. A participant who has terminated his or her employment during the Vesting Period shall not be eligible for the bonus.The participants may not dispose of the shares until  at the earliest  January 1  2026.To ensure an effective administration of the LTI Bonus  Haldex has contracted a share plan administrator. Via the administrator  the participants will be able to acquire the shares in Haldex and  as of January 1  2026  dispose of the shares.Performance criteria for LTI BonusIn addition to the other conditions  in order for a cash bonus to be made payable to the participants  two performance criteria must be met during the calendar year 2022. The level of fulfilment of the performance criteria will determine the cash bonus amount. The two performance criteria are:Return on capital employed (ROCE)  which represents 70% of the total award; and Operating profit  which represents 30% of the total award.The level of fulfilment of the performance criteria is measured against the budget approved by the board of directors for 2022.Timing of the share acquisitionLTI Bonus is constructed so that at the expiry of the Vesting Period  i.e. during 2024  the board of directors shall assess the level of fulfilment of the performance criteria in the calendar year 2022 as well as whether the other conditions for LTI-Bonus have been fulfilled. Thereafter  the bonus amount is paid out and shares can be acquired. The shares will thus be acquired in 2024  the year after the expiry of the Vesting Period. The reason why the share acquisition takes place earlier than three years from the conclusion of the LTI Bonus agreement is that the participants shall be able to take part in the shares' value development in the coming years. The participants undertake not to sell the acquired shares until after December 31  2025 at the earliest. As a result  the program as a whole is ongoing for a longer period than three years.Cost of the LTI BonusIn addition to the bonus amounts being paid out  the costs for the LTI Bonus consist of regular personnel costs associated with cash compensation and an administration cost for the administrator's handling of the LTI Bonus. The costs will vary depending on the level of fulfilment of the performance criteria and the participants' salary and tax domicile. According to initial calculations  Haldex's costs for the bonus are estimated at between SEK 6–24 million. The administrator's costs for the administration of the LTI Bonus consist of an annual fee that will be recurrent throughout the years that the administration is ongoing.Administration of the LTI BonusThe detailed terms and conditions of the LTI Bonus shall be decided by the board of directors or the remuneration committee  but shall remain within the framework of the terms and guidelines resolved on by the annual general meetingIt is proposed that the board of directors shall be entitled to make other adjustments to the LTI Bonus  if it so deems appropriate  if changes occur in Haldex  its operation environment or the market that results in a situation where the conditions for the participants' share acquisitions becomes unreasonable. Any such adjustments shall only be made in order to fulfil the main objectives of the LTI Bonus.Majority requirementsResolutions passed by the annual general meeting in accordance with the board of director's proposal item 14 are valid if supported by simple majority.Item 15: Confirmation of 2021 LTI allotmentAt the 2021 annual general meeting  a long-term incentive program for the CEO was approved (the ""2021 LTI""). The 2021 LTI included a right to  under certain conditions  acquire Haldex shares against a pre-defined strike price (the ""Options"").

One idea raised would move payment processes onshore  enabling firms to avoid the restrictions that have blocked bond payments.EDB proposes buying back at least $200 million of the debt at a maximum of 80% face value  according to a filing on Tuesday. That would wind up saving it at least $44 million  including interest accrued until Sept. 20  when the $500 million note matures  Bloomberg calculations show.KNG Securities was offering to buy EDB’s 2022 notes at 48 cents on the dollar and selling them at 68 cents on Tuesday  underscoring the price impact of the Kazakh lender’s dependence on Russia.

This pricing supplement is not an offer to sell nor does it seek an offer to buy these notes in any state where the offer or sale is not permitted.Subject to Completion  Dated April 20  2022.Filed Pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2)Registration Statement No. 333-262557The Toronto-Dominion Bank $ Leveraged Capped Buffered S&P 500® Index-Linked Notes dueThe notes do not bear interest. The amount that you will be paid on your notes on the maturity date (expected to be the second business day after the valuation date) is based on the performance of the S&P 500® Index as measured from the pricing date to and including the valuation date (expected to be between 26 and 29 months after the pricing date). If the final level on the valuation date is greater than the initial level (equal to the closing level of the index on the pricing date)  the return on your notes will be positive  subject to the maximum payment amount (expected to be between $1 301.28 and $1 354.48 for each $1 000 principal amount of your notes). If the final level declines by up to 15.00% from the initial level  you will receive the principal amount of your notes. If the final level declines by more than 15.00% from the initial level  the return on your notes will be negative and you will lose approximately 1.1765% of the principal amount of your notes for every 1% that the final level has declined below the buffer level of 85.00% of the initial level. Despite the inclusion of the buffer level  due to the downside multiplier you may lose your entire principal amount.To determine your payment at maturity  we will calculate the percentage change of the S&P 500® Index  which is the percentage increase or decrease in the final level from the initial level. At maturity  for each $1 000 principal amount of your notes  you will receive an amount in cash equal to:● if the percentage change is positive (the final level is greater than the initial level)  the sum of (i) $1 000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1 000 times (b) 140.00% times (c) the percentage change  subject to the maximum payment amount;● if the percentage change is zero or negative but not below -15.00% (the final level is equal to the initial level or is less than the initial level  but not by more than 15.00%)  $1 000; or● if the percentage change is negative and is below -15.00% (the final level is less than the initial level by more than 15.00%)  the sum of (i) $1 000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1 000 times (b) the downside multiplier of approximately 117.65% times (c) the sum of the percentage change plus 15.00%. You will receive less than the principal amount of your notes.The notes do not guarantee the return of principal at maturity.The notes are unsecured and are not savings accounts or insured deposits of a bank.

We may decide to sell additional notes after the date of the final pricing supplement  at public offering prices and with underwriting discounts and proceeds to TD that differ from the amounts set forth above. The return (whether positive or negative) on your investment in the notes will depend in part on the public offering price you pay for such notes.We  TD Securities (USA) LLC (“TDS”) or any of our affiliates  may use this pricing supplement in the initial sale of the notes. In addition  we  TDS or any of our affiliates may use this pricing supplement in a market-making transaction in a note after its initial sale. Unless we  TDS or any of our affiliates informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this pricing supplement will be used in a market-making transaction.Additional Information Regarding the Estimated Value of the NotesThe final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public  which we refer to as the Pricing Date  based on prevailing market conditions on the Pricing Date  and will be included in the final pricing supplement. The economic terms of the Notes are based on TD’s internal funding rate (which is TD’s internal borrowing rate based on variables such as market benchmarks and TD’s appetite for borrowing)  and several factors  including any sales commissions expected to be paid to TDS  any selling concessions  discounts  commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries  the estimated profit that TD or any of TD’s affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes  the estimated cost TD may incur in hedging its obligations under the Notes and the estimated development and other costs which TD may incur in connection with the Notes. Because TD’s internal funding rate generally represents a discount from the levels at which TD’s benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market  the use of an internal funding rate for the Notes rather than the levels at which TD’s benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market is expected to have an adverse effect on the economic terms of the Notes. On the cover page of this pricing supplement  TD has provided the initial estimated value range for the Notes. This range of estimated values was determined by reference to TD’s internal pricing models which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of assumptions  which may or may not materialize  typically including volatility  interest rates (forecasted  current and historical rates)  price-sensitivity analysis  time to maturity of the Notes  and TD’s internal funding rate. For more information about the initial estimated value  see “Additional Risk Factors” herein. Because TD’s internal funding rate generally represents a discount from the levels at which TD’s benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market  the use of an internal funding rate for the Notes rather than the levels at which TD’s benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market is expected  assuming all other economic terms are held constant  to increase the estimated value of the Notes. For more information see the discussion under “Additional Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Estimated Value and Liquidity — TD’s and TDS’s Estimated Value of the Notes are Determined By Reference to TD’s Internal Funding Rates and are Not Determined By Reference to Credit Spreads or the Borrowing Rate TD Would Pay for its Conventional Fixed-Rate Debt Securities”.TD’s estimated value on the Pricing Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market  nor will it be the price at which TDS may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions  TDS or another affiliate of TD’s intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Pricing Date  the price at which TDS may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market  if any  may exceed TD’s estimated value on the Pricing Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately 3 months after the Pricing Date because  in its discretion  TD may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging its obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which TD will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. TD made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors  including the tenor of the Notes and any agreement TD may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of TD’s estimated costs which is effectively reimbursed to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period  and TD may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the Pricing Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.If a party other than TDS or its affiliates is buying or selling your Notes in the secondary market based on its own estimated value of your Notes which was calculated by reference to TD’s credit spreads or the borrowing rate TD would pay for its conventional fixed-rate debt securities (as opposed to TD’s internal funding rate)  the price at which such party would buy or sell your Notes could be significantly less.We urge you to read the “Additional Risk Factors” in this pricing supplement.P-2SummaryThe information in this “Summary” section is qualified by the more detailed information set forth in this pricing supplement  the product supplement and the prospectus.Issuer: The Toronto-Dominion Bank (“TD”) Issue: Senior Debt Securities  Series E Type of Note: Leveraged Capped Buffered Notes (the “Notes”) Term: Expected to be between 26 and 29 months Reference Asset: S&P 500® Index (Bloomberg Ticker: SPX) CUSIP / ISIN: 9114VD46 / US89114VD466 Agent: TD Securities (USA) LLC (“TDS”) Currency: U.S. Dollars Minimum Investment: $1 000 and minimum denominations of $1 000 in excess thereof Principal Amount: $1 000 per Note; $ in the aggregate for all the offered Notes; the aggregate Principal Amount of the offered Notes may be increased if the Issuer  at its sole option  decides to sell an additional amount of the offered Notes on a date subsequent to the date of the final pricing supplement.

Maturity Date: Expected to be two Business Days following the Valuation Date  subject to postponement for market disruption events and other disruptions  as described under “General Terms of the Notes—Maturity Date” in the product supplement.P-3Payment at Maturity: For each $1 000 Principal Amount of the Notes  we will pay you on the Maturity Date an amount in cash equal to: ● if the Final Level is greater than or equal to the Cap Level  the Maximum Payment Amount; ● if the Final Level is greater than the Initial Level but less than the Cap Level  the sum of (i) $1 000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1 000 times (b) the Leverage Factor times (c) the Percentage Change; ● if the Final Level is equal to or less than the Initial Level but greater than or equal to the Buffer Level  $1 000; or ● if the Final Level is less than the Buffer Level  the sum of (i) $1 000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1 000 times (b) the Downside Multiplier times (c) the sum of the Percentage Change plus the Buffer Percentage. If the Final Level is less than the Buffer Level  the investor will receive less than the Principal Amount of the Notes at maturity and may lose their entire Principal Amount. All amounts used in or resulting from any calculation relating to the Payment at Maturity will be rounded upward or downward  as appropriate  to the nearest cent. Leverage Factor: 140.00% Cap Level: Expected to be between 121.52% and 125.32% of the Initial Level (to be determined on the Pricing Date) Buffer Percentage: 15.00% Buffer Level: 85.00% of the Initial Level Downside Multiplier: The quotient of the Initial Level divided by the Buffer Level  expressed as a percentage  which equals approximately 117.65% Maximum Payment Amount: Between $1 301.28 and $1 354.48 per $1 000 Principal Amount of the Notes (130.128% to 135.448% of the Principal Amount of the Notes). As a result of the Maximum Payment Amount  the maximum return at maturity of the Notes will be between 30.128% and 35.448% of the Principal Amount of the Notes. The actual Maximum Payment Amount will be determined on the Pricing Date. Percentage Change: The quotient of (1) the Final Level minus the Initial Level divided by (2) the Initial Level  expressed as a percentage. Initial Level: The Closing Level of the Reference Asset on the Pricing Date Final Level: The Closing Level of the Reference Asset on the Valuation Date  except in the limited circumstances described under “General Terms of the Notes—Market Disruption Events” and subject to adjustment as provided under “General Terms of the Notes—Unavailability of the Level of  or Change in Law Event Affecting  the Reference Asset; Modification to Method of Calculation” in the product supplement. Closing Level: The Closing Level of the Reference Asset will be the closing level of the Reference Asset or any successor index (as defined in the product supplement) on any Trading Day for the Reference Asset  as displayed on Bloomberg Professional® service (“Bloomberg”) page “SPX <INDEX>” or any successor page on Bloomberg or any successor service  as applicable.P-4Business Day: Any day that is a Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday  Thursday or Friday that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or required by law to close in New York City. U.S. Tax Treatment: By purchasing a Note  each holder agrees  in the absence of a statutory or regulatory change or an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary  to characterize the Notes  for U.S. federal income tax purposes  as prepaid derivative contracts with respect to the Reference Asset. Based on certain factual representations received from us  our special U.S. tax counsel  Fried  Frank  Harris  Shriver & Jacobson LLP  is of the opinion that it would be reasonable to treat the Notes in the manner described above. However  because there is no authority that specifically addresses the tax treatment of the Notes  it is possible that your Notes could alternatively be treated for tax purposes as a single contingent payment debt instrument  or pursuant to some other characterization  such that the timing and character of your income from the Notes could differ materially and adversely from the treatment described above. Please see the discussion below under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences”. Canadian Tax Treatment: Please see the discussion in the product supplement under “Supplemental Discussion of Canadian Tax Consequences”  which applies to the Notes. Calculation Agent: TD Listing: The Notes will not be listed or displayed on any securities exchange or electronic communications network. Clearance and Settlement: DTC global (including through its indirect participants Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg) as described under “Description of the Debt Securities — Forms of the Debt Securities” and “Ownership  Book-Entry Procedures and Settlement” in the prospectus. Canadian Bail-in: The Notes are not bail-inable debt securities (as defined in the prospectus) under the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation Act. Change in Law Event: Not applicable  notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the product supplement.The Pricing Date  the Issue Date  the Valuation Date and the Maturity Date are subject to change. These dates will be set forth in the final pricing supplement that will be made available in connection with sales of the Notes.P-5Additional Terms of Your NotesYou should read this pricing supplement together with the prospectus  as supplemented by the product supplement  relating to our Senior Debt Securities  Series E  of which these Notes are a part. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this pricing supplement will have the meanings given to them in the product supplement. In the event of any conflict the following hierarchy will govern: first  this pricing supplement; second  the product supplement; and last  the prospectus. The Notes vary from the terms described in the product supplement in several important ways. You should read this pricing supplement carefully.This pricing supplement  together with the documents listed below  contains the terms of the Notes and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral statements as well as any other written materials including preliminary or indicative pricing terms  correspondence  trade ideas  structures for implementation  sample structures  brochures or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully consider  among other things  the matters set forth in “Additional Risk Factors” herein  “Additional Risk Factors Specific to the Notes” in the product supplement and “Risk Factors” in the prospectus  as the Notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment  legal  tax  accounting and other advisors concerning an investment in the Notes. You may access these documents on the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) website at www.sec.gov as follows (or if that address has changed  by reviewing our filings for the relevant date on the SEC website):◾ Prospectus dated March 4  2022:◾ Product Supplement MLN-EI-1 dated March 4  2022:Our Central Index Key  or CIK  on the SEC website is 0000947263. As used in this pricing supplement  the “Bank ” “we ” “us ” or “our” refers to The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries.We reserve the right to change the terms of  or reject any offer to purchase  the Notes prior to their issuance. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes  we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes  in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.P-6Additional Risk FactorsThe Notes involve risks not associated with an investment in conventional debt securities. This section describes the most significant risks relating to the terms of the Notes. For additional information as to these risks  please see “Additional Risk Factors Specific to the Notes” in the product supplement and “Risk Factors” in the prospectus.You should carefully consider whether the Notes are suited to your particular circumstances. Accordingly  investors should consult their investment  legal  tax  accounting and other advisors as to the risks entailed by an investment in the Notes and the suitability of the Notes in light of their particular circumstances.Risks Relating to Return CharacteristicsPrincipal at Risk.Investors in the Notes could lose their entire Principal Amount if there is a decline in the level of the Reference Asset by more than the Buffer Percentage. If the Final Level is less than the Initial Level by more than 15.00%  you will lose a portion of each $1 000 Principal Amount in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Downside Multiplier times (ii) the sum of the negative Percentage Change plus the Buffer Percentage times (iii) $1 000. Specifically  you will lose approximately 1.1765% of the Principal Amount of each of your Notes for every 1% that the Final Level is less than the Initial Level in excess of the Buffer Percentage and you may lose your entire Principal Amount.The Notes Do Not Pay Interest and Your Return on the Notes May Be Less Than the Return on Conventional Debt Securities of Comparable Maturity.There will be no periodic interest payments on the Notes as there would be on a conventional fixed-rate or floating-rate debt security having the same term. The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you bought a conventional senior interest bearing debt security of TD.Your Potential Return on the Notes Is Limited by the Maximum Payment Amount and May Be Less Than the Return on a Direct Investment In the Reference Asset.The opportunity to participate in the possible increases in the level of the Reference Asset through an investment in the Notes will be limited because the Payment at Maturity will not exceed the Maximum Payment Amount. Furthermore  the effect of the Leverage Factor will not be taken into account for any Final Level exceeding the Cap Level no matter how much the level of the Reference Asset may rise above the Cap Level. Accordingly  your return on the Notes may be less than your return would be if you made an investment in a security directly linked to the performance of the Reference Asset.The Payment at Maturity Is Not Linked to the Level of the Reference Asset at Any Time Other than the Valuation Date.The Final Level will be the Closing Level of the Reference Asset on the Valuation Date (subject to adjustment as described elsewhere in this pricing supplement). Therefore  if the Closing Level of the Reference Asset dropped precipitously on the Valuation Date  the Payment at Maturity for your Notes may be significantly less than it would have been had the Payment at Maturity been linked to the Closing Level of the Reference Asset prior to such drop in the level of the Reference Asset. Although the actual level of the Reference Asset on the Maturity Date or at other times during the term of your Notes may be higher than the Final Level  you will benefit from the Closing Level of the Reference Asset only on the Valuation Date.You Will Not Have Any Rights to the Reference Asset Constituents.As a holder of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the Reference Asset Constituents would have. The Final Level will not reflect any dividends paid on any Reference Asset Constituents.If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to Principal Amount  the Return on Your Investment Will Be Less Than the Return on Notes Purchased at Principal Amount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will be Negatively Affected.The Payment at Maturity will not be adjusted based on the public offering price you pay for the Notes. If you purchase Notes at a price that differs from the Principal Amount of the Notes  then the return on your investment in such Notes held to the Maturity Date will differ from  and may be substantially less than  the return on Notes purchased at Principal Amount. If you purchase your Notes at a premium to Principal Amount and hold them to the Maturity Date  the return on your investment in the Notes will be less than it would have been had you purchased the Notes at Principal Amount or a discount to Principal Amount. In addition  the impact of the Buffer Level and the Cap Level on the return on your investment will depend upon the price you pay for your Notes relative to Principal Amount. For example  if you purchase your Notes at a premium to Principal Amount  the Cap Level will only permit a lower positive return on your investment in the Notes than would have been the case for Notes purchased at Principal Amount or a discount to Principal Amount. Similarly  the Buffer Level  whileP-7still providing some protection for the return on the Notes  will allow a greater percentage decrease in your investment in the Notes than would have been the case for Notes purchased at Principal Amount or a discount to Principal Amount.Risks Relating to Characteristics of the Reference AssetThere Are Market Risks Associated with the Reference Asset.The level of the Reference Asset can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the Reference Asset  the securities included in the Reference Asset (the “Reference Asset Constituents”) and their issuers (the “Reference Asset Constituent Issuers”)  such as stock price volatility  earnings  financial conditions  corporate  industry and regulatory developments  management changes and decisions and other events  as well as general market factors  such as general market volatility and levels  interest rates and economic and political conditions. In addition  recently  the coronavirus infection has caused volatility in the global financial markets and a slowdown in the global economy. Coronavirus or any other communicable disease or infection may adversely affect the Reference Asset Constituent Issuers and  therefore  the Reference Asset. You  as an investor in the Notes  should make your own investigation into the Reference Asset  the Reference Asset Constituents and the Reference Asset Constituent Issuers. For additional information  see “Information Regarding the Reference Asset” herein.The Reference Asset Reflects Price Return  not Total Return.The return on your Notes is based on the performance of the Reference Asset  which reflects the changes in the market prices of the Reference Asset Constituents. It is not  however  linked to a “total return” index or strategy  which  in addition to reflecting those price returns  would also reflect dividends paid on the Reference Asset Constituents. The return on your Notes will not include such a total return feature or dividend component.We Have No Affiliation with the Index Sponsor and Will Not Be Responsible for Any Actions Taken by the Index Sponsor.S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the “Index Sponsor”) is not an affiliate of ours and will not be involved in any offerings of the Notes in any way. Consequently  we have no control of any actions of the Index Sponsor  including any actions of the type that would require the Calculation Agent to adjust the Payment at Maturity. The Index Sponsor does not have any obligation of any sort with respect to the Notes. Thus  the Index Sponsor has no obligation to take your interests into consideration for any reason  including in taking any actions that might affect the value of  or any amount payable on  the Notes. None of our proceeds from any issuance of the Notes will be paid to the Index Sponsor  except to the extent that we are required to pay the Index Sponsor licensing fees with respect to the Reference Asset.Market Disruption Events and Postponements.The Valuation Date  and therefore the Maturity Date  are subject to postponement as described in the product supplement due to the occurrence of one or more market disruption events. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see “General Terms of the Notes—Market Disruption Events” in the product supplement.Risks Relating to Estimated Value and LiquidityTD’s Initial Estimated Value of the Notes at the Time of Pricing (When the Terms of Your Notes Are Set on the Pricing Date) is Expected to be Less Than the Public Offering Price of the Notes.TD’s initial estimated value of the Notes is only an estimate. TD’s initial estimated value of the Notes is expected to be less than the public offering price of the Notes. The difference between the public offering price of the Notes and TD’s initial estimated value reflects costs and expected profits associated with selling and structuring the Notes  as well as hedging its obligations under the Notes with a third party. Because hedging our obligations entails risks and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control  this hedging may result in a profit that is more or less than expected  or a loss.TD’s and TDS’s Estimated Value of the Notes are Determined By Reference to TD’s Internal Funding Rates and are Not Determined By Reference to Credit Spreads or the Borrowing Rate TD Would Pay for its Conventional Fixed-Rate Debt Securities.TD’s initial estimated value of the Notes and TDS’s estimated value of the Notes at any time are determined by reference to TD’s internal funding rate. The internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the Notes generally represents a discount from the credit spreads for TD’s conventional fixed-rate debt securities and the borrowing rate TD would pay for its conventional fixed-rate debt securities. This discount is based on  among other things  TD’s view of the funding value of the Notes as well as the higher issuance  operational and ongoing liability management costs of the Notes in comparison to those costs for TD’s conventional fixed-rate debt  as well as estimated financing costs of any hedge positions  taking into account regulatory and internal requirements. If the interest rate implied by the credit spreads for TD’s conventional fixed-rate debt securities  or the borrowing rate TD would pay for its conventional fixed-rate debt securities were to be used  TD would expect the economic terms of the Notes to be more favorable to you. Additionally  assuming all other economic terms are held constant  the use of an internal funding rate for the Notes is expected to increase the estimated value of the Notes at any time.P-8TD’s Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Does Not Represent Future Values of the Notes and May Differ From Others’ (Including TDS’s) Estimates.TD’s initial estimated value of the Notes is determined by reference to its internal pricing models when the terms of the Notes are set. These pricing models take into account a number of variables  such as TD’s internal funding rate on the Pricing Date  and are based on a number of assumptions as discussed further under “Additional Information Regarding the Estimated Value of the Notes” herein. Different pricing models and assumptions (including the pricing models and assumptions used by TDS) could provide valuations for the Notes that are different from  and perhaps materially less than  TD’s initial estimated value. Therefore  the price at which TDS would buy or sell your Notes (if TDS makes a market  which it is not obligated to do) may be materially less than TD’s initial estimated value. In addition  market conditions and other relevant factors in the future may change  and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect.The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market  If Any  and Such Secondary Market Prices  If Any  Will Likely be Less Than the Public Offering Price of Your Notes and May Be Less Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes.The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which TDS  other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase  which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time  if any  will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted  such as market conditions  and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades  and may be substantially less than the estimated value of the Notes. Further  as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market  and do not take into account our various costs and expected profits associated with selling and structuring the Notes  as well as hedging our obligations under the Notes  secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be less than the public offering price of your Notes. As a result  the price at which TDS  other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions  if any  will likely be less than the price you paid for your Notes  and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.The Temporary Price at Which TDS May Initially Buy the Notes in the Secondary Market May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes.Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Pricing Date  the price at which TDS may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if TDS makes a market in the Notes  which it is not obligated to do) may exceed the estimated value of the Notes on the Pricing Date  as well as the secondary market value of the Notes  for a temporary period after the Pricing Date of the Notes  as discussed further under “Additional Information Regarding the Estimated Value of the Notes.” The price at which TDS may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.The Market Value of Your Notes May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors.When we refer to the market value of your Notes  we mean the value that you could receive for your Notes if you chose to sell them in the open market before the Maturity Date. A number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  will influence the market value of your Notes  including:• the level of the Reference Asset;• the volatility – i.e.  the frequency and magnitude of changes – in the level of the Reference Asset;• the dividend rates  if applicable  of the Reference Asset Constituents;• economic  financial  regulatory and political  military or other events that may affect the prices of any of the Reference Asset Constituents and thus the level of the Reference Asset;• interest rate and yield rates in the market;• the time remaining until your Notes mature;• any fluctuations in the exchange rate between currencies in which the Reference Asset Constituents are quoted and traded and the U.S. dollar  as applicable; and• our creditworthiness  whether actual or perceived  and including actual or anticipated upgrades or downgrades in our credit ratings or changes in other credit measures.These factors will influence the price you will receive if you sell your Notes before maturity  including the price you may receive for your Notes in any market-making transaction. If you sell your Notes prior to maturity  you may receive less than the Principal Amount of your Notes.The future levels of the Reference Asset cannot be predicted. The actual change in the level of the Reference Asset over the term of the Notes  as well as the Payment at Maturity  may bear little or no relation to the hypothetical historical closing levels of the Reference Asset or to the hypothetical examples shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement.P-9There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes — Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses.There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed or displayed on any securities exchange or electronic communications network. TDS and our affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. TDS and our affiliates may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and ask prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.If you sell your Notes before the Maturity Date  you may have to do so at a substantial discount from the public offering price irrespective of the level of the Reference Asset and  as a result  you may suffer substantial losses.If the Level of the Reference Asset Changes  the Market Value of Your Notes May Not Change in the Same Manner.Your Notes may trade quite differently from the performance of the Reference Asset. Changes in the level of the Reference Asset may not result in a comparable change in the market value of your Notes. Even if the level of the Reference Asset increases above the Initial Level during the term of the Notes  the market value of your Notes may not increase by the same amount and could decline.Risks Relating to Hedging Activities and Conflicts of InterestThe Agent Discount  if any  Offering Expenses and Certain Hedging Costs Are Likely to Adversely Affect Secondary Market Prices.Assuming no changes in market conditions or any other relevant factors  the price  if any  at which you may be able to sell the Notes will likely be less than the public offering price. The public offering price includes  and any price quoted to you is likely to exclude  any underwriting discount paid in connection with the initial distribution  offering expenses as well as the cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes. In addition  any such price is also likely to reflect any dealer discounts  mark-ups and other transaction costs  such as a discount to account for costs associated with establishing or unwinding any related hedge transaction. In addition  if the dealer from which you purchase Notes  or one of its affiliates  is to conduct hedging activities for us in connection with the Notes  that dealer  or one of its affiliates  may profit in connection with such hedging activities and such profit  if any  will be in addition to any compensation that the dealer receives for the sale of the Notes to you. You should be aware that the potential for the dealer or one of its affiliates to earn fees in connection with hedging activities may create a further incentive for the dealer to sell the Notes to you in addition to any compensation they would receive for the sale of the Notes.Trading and Business Activities by TD and Our Affiliates May Adversely Affect the Market Value of  and Any Amount Payable on  the Notes.TD and our affiliates may hedge our obligations under the Notes by purchasing securities  futures  options or other derivative instruments with returns linked or related to changes in the level of the Reference Asset or prices of one or more Reference Asset Constituents  and we or they may adjust these hedges by  among other things  purchasing or selling any of the foregoing at any time. It is possible that we or one or more of our affiliates could receive substantial returns from these hedging activities while the market value of  and any amount payable on  the Notes declines. We or one or more of our affiliates may also issue or underwrite other securities or financial or derivative instruments with returns linked or related to the performance of the Reference Asset or one or more Reference Asset Constituents.These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders’ interest in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in our or their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for our or their customers’ accounts and in accounts under our or their management. These trading activities could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes.We and our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with one or more Reference Asset Constituent Issuers  including making loans to or providing advisory services to those companies. These services could include investment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These business activities may present a conflict between us and our affiliates obligations  and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to the Reference Asset or one or more Reference Asset Constituents. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these business activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the level of the Reference Asset or one or more Reference Asset Constituents and  therefore  the market value of  and any amount payable on  the Notes.There Are Potential Conflicts of Interest Between You and the Calculation Agent.The Calculation Agent will  among other things  determine the amount of your payment on the Notes. We will serve as the Calculation Agent and may appoint a different Calculation Agent after the Issue Date without notice to you. The Calculation Agent will exercise its judgment when performing its functions and may take into consideration our ability to unwind anyP-10related hedges. Because this discretion by the Calculation Agent may affect payments on the Notes  the Calculation Agent may have a conflict of interest if it needs to make any such decision. For example  the Calculation Agent may have to determine whether a market disruption event affecting the Reference Asset has occurred. This determination may  in turn  depend on the Calculation Agent’s judgment whether the event has materially interfered with our ability or the ability of one of our affiliates to unwind our hedge positions. Because this determination by the Calculation Agent will affect the payment on the Notes  the Calculation Agent may have a conflict of interest if it needs to make a determination of this kind. For additional information as to the Calculation Agent’s role  see “General Terms of the Notes—Role of Calculation Agent” in the product supplement.Risks Relating to General Credit CharacteristicsInvestors Are Subject to TD’s Credit Risk  and TD’s Credit Ratings and Credit Spreads May Adversely Affect the Market Value of the Notes.Although the return on the Notes will depend on the Final Level of the Reference Asset  the payment of any amount due on the Notes is subject to TD’s credit risk. The Notes are TD’s unsecured debt obligations. Investors are dependent on TD’s ability to pay all amounts due on the Notes on the Maturity Date and  therefore  investors are subject to the credit risk of TD and to changes in the market’s view of TD’s creditworthiness. Any decrease in TD’s credit ratings or increase in the credit spreads charged by the market for taking TD’s credit risk is likely to adversely affect the market value of the Notes. If TD becomes unable to meet its financial obligations as they become due  investors may not receive any amounts due under the terms of the Notes.Risks Relating to Canadian and U.S. Federal Income TaxationSignificant Aspects of the Tax Treatment of the Notes Are Uncertain.Significant aspects of the U.S. tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation and should read carefully the section entitled “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” herein and in the product supplement.For a discussion of the Canadian federal income tax consequences of investing in the Notes  please see the discussion in the product supplement under “Supplemental Discussion of Canadian Tax Consequences”.If you are not a Non-resident Holder (as that term is defined in the prospectus) for Canadian federal income tax purposes or if you acquire the Notes in the secondary market  you should consult your tax advisors as to the consequences of acquiring  holding and disposing of the Notes and receiving the payments that might be due under the Notes.General Risk FactorsWe May Sell an Additional Aggregate Principal Amount of the Notes at a Different Public Offering Price.At our sole option  we may decide to sell an additional aggregate Principal Amount of the Notes subsequent to the date of the final pricing supplement. The public offering price of the Notes in the subsequent sale may differ substantially (higher or lower) from the original public offering price you paid as provided on the cover of the final pricing supplement.P-11Hypothetical ReturnsThe examples and graph set out below are included for illustration purposes only. They should not be taken as an indication or prediction of future investment results and merely are intended to illustrate the impact that the various hypothetical levels of the Reference Asset on the Valuation Date could have on the Payment at Maturity assuming all other variables remain constant. The actual terms of the Notes will be set on the Pricing Date.The examples below are based on a range of Final Levels that are entirely hypothetical; the levels of the Reference Asset on any day throughout the term of the Notes  including the Final Level on the Valuation Date  cannot be predicted. The Reference Asset has been highly volatile in the past—meaning that the level of the Reference Asset has changed considerably in relatively short periods—and its performance cannot be predicted for any future period.The information in the following examples reflects hypothetical rates of return on the offered Notes assuming that they are purchased on the Issue Date at the Principal Amount and held to the Maturity Date. If you sell your Notes in a secondary market prior to the Maturity Date  your return will depend upon the market value of your Notes at the time of sale  which may be affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the examples below  such as interest rates  the volatility of the Reference Asset and our creditworthiness. In addition  the estimated value of your Notes at the time the terms of your Notes are set on the Pricing Date is expected to be less than the original public offering price of your Notes. For more information on the estimated value of your Notes  see “Additional Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Estimated Value and Liquidity — TD’s Initial Estimated Value of the Notes at the Time of Pricing (When the Terms of Your Notes Are Set on the Pricing Date) is Expected to be Less Than the Public Offering Price of the Notes.” in this pricing supplement. The information in the examples also reflect the key terms and assumptions in the box below.Key Terms and Assumptions Principal Amount $1 000 Leverage Factor 140.00% Hypothetical Cap Level 121.520% of the Initial Level* Hypothetical Maximum Payment Amount $1 301.28* Buffer Level 85.00% of the Initial Level Downside Multiplier Approximately 117.65% Buffer Percentage 15.00% * The bottom of the Cap Level and Maximum Payment Amount ranges specified herein. The actual Cap Level and Maximum Payment Amount will be determined on the Pricing Date. Neither a market disruption event nor a non-Trading Day occurs on the originally scheduled Valuation Date No change in or affecting any of the Reference Asset Constituents or the method by which the Index Sponsor calculates the Reference Asset Notes purchased on the Issue Date at the Principal Amount and held to the Maturity DateMoreover  we have not yet set the Initial Level  which will serve as the baseline for determining the Percentage Change  or the Cap Level or the Maximum Payment Amount  each of which will affect the amount that we will pay on your Notes  if any  at maturity. We will not do so until the Pricing Date. As a result  the actual Initial Level may differ substantially from the level of the Reference Asset prior to the Pricing Date.For these reasons the actual performance of the Reference Asset over the term of your Notes  as well as the Payment at Maturity  if any  may bear little relation to the hypothetical examples shown below or to the historical levels of the Reference Asset shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement. For information about the historical levels of the Reference Asset during recent periods  see “Information Regarding the Reference Asset—Historical Information” below. Before investing in the offered Notes  you should consult publicly available information to determine the levels of the Reference Asset between the date of this pricing supplement and the date of your purchase of the offered Notes.Also  the hypothetical examples shown below do not take into account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to your Notes  tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your Notes to a comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the Reference Asset Constituents.P-12The levels in the left column of the table below represent hypothetical Final Levels and are expressed as percentages of the Initial Level. The amounts in the right column represent the hypothetical Payment at Maturity  based on the corresponding hypothetical Final Level  and are expressed as percentages of the Principal Amount of a Note (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of a percent). Thus  a hypothetical Payment at Maturity of 100.000% means that the value of the cash payment that we would pay for each $1 000 of the outstanding Principal Amount of the offered Notes on the Maturity Date would equal 100.000% of the Principal Amount of a Note  based on the corresponding hypothetical Final Level and the assumptions noted above.Hypothetical Final Level (as Percentage of Initial Level) Hypothetical Payment at Maturity (as Percentage of Principal Amount) 150.000% 130.128% 140.000% 130.128% 130.000% 130.128% 125.000% 130.128% 121.520% 130.128% 118.000% 125.200% 112.000% 116.800% 106.000% 108.400% 100.000% 100.000% 95.000% 100.000% 90.000% 100.000% 85.000% 100.000% 80.000% 94.118% 75.000% 88.235% 50.000% 58.824% 25.000% 29.412% 0.000% 0.000%If  for example  the Final Level were determined to be 25.000% of the Initial Level  the Payment at Maturity that we would pay on your Notes at maturity would be approximately 29.412% of the Principal Amount of your Notes  as shown in the table above. As a result  if you purchased your Notes on the Issue Date at the Principal Amount and held them to the Maturity Date  you would lose approximately 70.588% of your investment (if you purchased your Notes at a premium to Principal Amount you would lose a correspondingly higher percentage of your investment). If the Final Level were determined to be 0.000% of the Initial Level  you would lose 100.000% of your investment in the Notes. In addition  if the Final Level were determined to be 150.000% of the Initial Level  the Payment at Maturity that we would pay on your Notes at maturity would be capped at the Maximum Payment Amount  or 130.128% of each $1 000 Principal Amount of your Notes  as shown in the table above. As a result  if you held your Notes to the Maturity Date  you would not benefit from any increase in the Final Level of greater than 121.520% of the Initial Level.P-13The following examples illustrate the hypothetical Payment at Maturity for each Note based on hypothetical Final Levels of the Reference Asset  calculated based on the key terms and assumptions above. The values below have been rounded for ease of analysis.Example 1— Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is positive (and the Final Level is below the Cap Level). Percentage Change: 5.00% Payment at Maturity: $1 000.00 + ($1 000.00 × 140.00% × 5.00%) = $1 000.00 + $70.00 = $1 070.00On a $1 000.00 investment  a 5.00% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 070.00  a return of 7.00% on the Notes.Example 2— Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is positive (and the Final Level is above or equal to the Cap Level).Percentage Change: 50.00%Payment at Maturity: $1 000.00 + ($1 000.00 × 140.00% × 50.00%) = $1 000.00 + $700.00 = $1 700.00. However  the Maximum Payment Amount is $1 301.28 and therefore the Payment at Maturity would be $1 301.28.On a $1 000.00 investment  a 50.00% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 301.28  a return of 30.128% on the Notes. In addition to limiting your return on the Notes  the Maximum Payment Amount limits the positive effect of the Leverage Factor. If the Final Level is greater than the Initial Level  you will participate in the performance of the Reference Asset at a rate of 140.00% up to a certain point. However  the effect of the Leverage Factor will be progressively reduced for Final Levels that are greater than 121.520% of the Initial Level (based on the Maximum Payment Amount of 130.128% or $1 301.28 per $1 000.00 Principal Amount of the Notes) because your return on the Notes for any Final Level greater than 121.520% of the Initial Level will be limited by the Maximum Payment Amount.Example 3— Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is negative (but the Final Level is above or equal to the Buffer Level).Percentage Change: -5.00% Payment at Maturity: At maturity  if the Percentage Change is negative BUT not by more than the Buffer Percentage  then the Payment at Maturity will equal the Principal Amount. On a $1 000.00 investment  a -5.00% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 000.00  a return of 0.000% on the Notes.Example 4— Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is negative (and the Final Level is below the Buffer Level).Percentage Change: -35.00% Payment at Maturity: $1 000.00 + [$1 000.00 × 117.65% × (-35.00% + 15.00%)] = $1 000.00 – $235.29 = $764.71On a $1 000.00 investment  a -35.00% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $764.71  a return of -23.529% on the Notes.P-14The following chart shows a graphical illustration of the hypothetical Payment at Maturity that we would pay on your Notes on the Maturity Date if the Final Level were any of the hypothetical levels shown on the horizontal axis. The hypothetical Payments at Maturity in the chart are expressed as percentages of the Principal Amount of your Notes and the hypothetical Final Levels are expressed as percentages of the Initial Level. The chart shows that any hypothetical Final Level of less than 85.000% (the section left of the 85.000% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a hypothetical Payment at Maturity of less than 100.000% of the Principal Amount of your Notes (the section below the 100.000% marker on the vertical axis) and  accordingly  in a loss of principal to the holder of the Notes. The chart also shows that any hypothetical Final Level of greater than or equal to 121.520% (the section right of the 121.520% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a capped return on your investment.The Payments at Maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on a hypothetical Cap Level and Maximum Payment Amount  levels of the Reference Asset that may not be achieved on the Valuation Date and assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your Notes on the Maturity Date or at any other time  including any time you may wish to sell your Notes  may bear little relation to the hypothetical Payment at Maturity shown above  and these amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the offered Notes. The hypothetical Payment at Maturity on the Notes in the examples above assume you purchased your Notes at their Principal Amount and have not been adjusted to reflect the actual public offering price you pay for your Notes. The return on your investment (whether positive or negative) in your Notes will be affected by the amount you pay for your Notes. If you purchase your Notes for a price other than the Principal Amount  the return on your investment will differ from  and may be significantly less than  the hypothetical returns suggested by the above examples. Please read “Additional Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Estimated Value and Liquidity — The Market Value of Your Notes May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors” in this pricing supplement.P-15Payments on the Notes are economically equivalent to the amounts that would be paid on a combination of other instruments. For example  payments on the Notes are economically equivalent to a combination of a non-interest-bearing bond bought by the holder and one or more options entered into between the holder and us (with one or more implicit option premiums paid over time). The discussion in this paragraph does not modify or affect the terms of the Notes or the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Notes  as described elsewhere in this pricing supplement.We cannot predict the actual Final Level or what the market value of your Notes will be on any particular Trading Day  nor can we predict the relationship between the level of the Reference Asset and the market value of your Notes at any time prior to the Maturity Date. The actual amount that you will receive  if any  at maturity and the rate of return on the offered Notes will depend on the actual Initial Level  the Cap Level and the Maximum Payment Amount  which we will set on the Pricing Date  and the actual Final Level to be determined by the Calculation Agent as described above. Moreover  the assumptions on which the hypothetical returns are based may turn out to be inaccurate. Consequently  the amount of cash to be paid in respect of your Notes  if any  on the Maturity Date may be very different from the information reflected in the examples above.P-16Information Regarding the Reference AssetS&P 500® IndexThe S&P 500® Index (the “SPX”) includes a representative sample of 500 companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy. The 500 companies are not the 500 largest companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) and not all 500 companies are listed on the NYSE. The Index Sponsor  S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC  chooses companies for inclusion in the SPX with an aim of achieving a distribution by broad industry groupings that approximates the distribution of these groupings in the common stock population of the U.S. equity market. Although the SPX contains 500 constituent companies  at any one time it may contain greater than 500 constituent trading lines since some companies included in the SPX prior to July 31  2017 may be represented by multiple share class lines in the SPX. The SPX is calculated  maintained and published by the Index Sponsor and is part of the S&P Dow Jones Indices family of indices. Additional information (including sectors and sector weights and top constituents) is available on the following website: spglobal.com/spdji/en/indices/equity/sp-500. We are not incorporating by reference the websites or any material they include in this document or any document incorporated herein by reference.The Index Sponsor intends for the SPX to provide a performance benchmark for the large-cap U.S. equity markets. Index additions and deletions are made on an as-needed basis and there is no schedule for constituent reviews. Constituent changes are announced with at least three business days advance notice. Less than three business days’ notice may be given at the discretion of the S&P Index Committee. Relevant criteria for additions to the SPX that are employed by the Index Sponsor include: the company proposed for addition should have an unadjusted company market capitalization of $14.6 billion or more and a security level float-adjusted market capitalization of at least 50% of such threshold (for spin-offs  eligibility is determined using when-issued prices  if available); using composite pricing and volume  the ratio of annual dollar value traded (defined as average closing price over the period multiplied by historical volume) in the proposed constituent to float-adjusted market capitalization of that company should be at least 1.00 and the stock should trade a minimum of 250 000 shares in each of the six months leading up to the evaluation date; the company must be a U.S. company (characterized as a Form 10-K filer with its U.S. portion of fixed assets and revenues constituting a plurality of the total and with a primary listing of the common stock on the NYSE  NYSE Arca  NYSE American (formerly NYSE MKT)  Nasdaq Global Select Market  Nasdaq Select Market  Nasdaq Capital Market  Cboe BZX (formerly Bats BZX)  Cboe BYX (formerly Bats BYX)  Cboe EDGA (formerly Bats EDGA) or Cboe EDGX (formerly Bats EDGX) (each  an “eligible exchange”)); the proposed constituent has an investable weight factor (“IWF”) of 10% or more; the inclusion of the company will contribute to sector balance in the SPX relative to sector balance in the market in the relevant market capitalization range; financial viability (the sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters’ Generally Accepted Accounting Principles earnings (net income excluding discontinued operations) should be positive as should the most recent quarter); and  for initial public offerings  the company must be traded on an eligible exchange for at least twelve months (spin-offs or in-specie distributions from existing constituents do not need to be traded on an eligible exchange for twelve months prior to their inclusion in the SPX). In addition  constituents of the S&P MidCap 400® Index and the S&P SmallCap 600® Index can be added to the SPX provided they meet the unadjusted company level market capitalization eligibility criteria for the SPX. Migrations from the S&P MidCap 400® Index or the S&P SmallCap 600® Index do not need to meet the financial viability  liquidity  or 50% of the SPX’s unadjusted company level minimum market capitalization threshold criteria. Further  constituents of the S&P Total Market Index Ex S&P Composite 1500 (which includes all eligible U.S. common equities except for those included in the SPX  the S&P MidCap 400® Index and the S&P SmallCap 600® Index) that acquire a constituent of the SPX  the S&P MidCap 400® Index or the S&P SmallCap 600® Index that do not fully meet the financial viability or IWF criteria may still be added to the SPX at the discretion of the S&P Index Committee if the S&P Index Committee determines that the addition could minimize turnover and enhance the representativeness of the SPX as a market benchmark. Certain types of organizational structures and securities are always excluded  including  but not limited to  business development companies  limited partnerships  master limited partnerships  limited liability companies  OTC bulletin board issues  closed-end funds  exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”)  exchange-traded notes  royalty trusts  tracking stocks  special purpose acquisition companies  preferred stock and convertible preferred stock  unit trusts  equity warrants  convertible bonds  investment trusts  rights and American depositary receipts. SPX constituents are deleted from the SPX when they are involved in mergers  acquisitions or significant restructurings such that they no longer meet the inclusion criteria  and when they substantially violate one or more of the addition criteria. SPX constituents that are delisted or moved to the pink sheets or the OTC bulletin board are removed  and those that experience a trading halt may be retained or removed in the Index Sponsor’s discretion. The Index Sponsor evaluates additions and deletions with a view to maintaining SPX continuity.For constituents included in the SPX prior to July 31  2017  all publicly listed multiple share class lines are included separately in the SPX  subject to  in the case of any such share class line  that share class line satisfying the liquidity and float criteria discussed above and subject to certain exceptions. It is possible that one listed share class line of a company may be included in the SPX while a second listed share class line of the same company is excluded. For companies thatP-17issue a second publicly traded share class to SPX share class holders  the newly issued share class line is considered for inclusion if the event is mandatory and the market capitalization of the distributed class is not considered to be de minimis.As of July 31  2017  companies with multiple share class lines are no longer eligible for inclusion in the SPX. Only common shares are considered when determining whether a company has a multiple share class structure. Constituents of the SPX prior to July 31  2017 with multiple share class lines will be grandfathered in and continue to be included in the SPX. If a SPX constituent reorganizes into a multiple share class line structure  that company will be reviewed for continued inclusion in the SPX at the discretion of the S&P Index Committee.Calculation of the SPXThe SPX is calculated using a base-weighted aggregative methodology. The level of the SPX on any day for which a level is published is determined by a fraction  the numerator of which is the aggregate of the market price of each SPX constituent times the number of shares of such SPX constituent  and the denominator of which is the divisor  which is described more fully below. The “market value” of any SPX constituent is the product of the market price per share of that SPX constituent times the number of the then-outstanding shares of such SPX constituent that are then included in the SPX.The SPX is also sometimes called a “base-weighted aggregative index” because of its use of a divisor. The “divisor” is a value calculated by the Index Sponsor that is intended to maintain conformity in SPX levels over time and is adjusted for all changes in the SPX constituents’ share capital after the “base date” as described below. The level of the SPX reflects the total market value of all SPX constituents relative to the SPX’s base date of 1941-43.In addition  the SPX is float-adjusted  meaning that the share counts used in calculating the SPX reflect only those shares available to investors rather than all of a company’s outstanding shares. The Index Sponsor seeks to exclude shares held by long-term  strategic shareholders concerned with the control of a company  a group that generally includes the following: officers and directors and related individuals whose holdings are publicly disclosed  private equity  venture capital  special equity firms  asset managers and insurance companies with board of director representation  publicly traded companies that hold shares in another company  holders of restricted shares (except for shares held as part of a lock-up agreement)  company-sponsored employee share plans/trusts  defined contribution plans/savings  investment plans  foundations or family trusts associated with the company  government entities at all levels (except government retirement or pension funds)  sovereign wealth funds and any individual person listed as a 5% or greater stakeholder in a company as reported in regulatory filings (collectively  “strategic holders”). To this end  the Index Sponsor excludes all share-holdings (other than depositary banks  pension funds (including government pension and retirement funds)  mutual funds  ETF providers  investment funds  asset managers that do not have direct board of director representation (including stakeholders who may have the right to appoint a board of director member but choose not to do so  stakeholders who have exercised a right to appoint a board of director “observer” even if that observer is employed by the stakeholder and stakeholders who have exercised a right to appoint an independent director who is not employed by the stakeholder)  investment funds of insurance companies and independent foundations not associated with the company) with a position greater than 5% of the outstanding shares of a company from the float-adjusted share count to be used in SPX calculations.The exclusion is accomplished by calculating an IWF for each SPX constituent that is part of the numerator of the float-adjusted index fraction described above:IWF = (available float shares)/(total shares outstanding)where available float shares is defined as total shares outstanding less shares held by strategic holders. In most cases  an IWF is reported to the nearest one percentage point. For companies with multiple share class lines  a separate IWF is calculated for each share class line. In most cases  an IWF is reported to the nearest one percentage point.Maintenance of the SPXIn order to keep the SPX comparable over time the Index Sponsor engages in an index maintenance process. The SPX maintenance process involves changing the constituents as discussed above  and also involves maintaining quality assurance processes and procedures  adjusting the number of shares used to calculate the SPX  monitoring and completing the adjustments for company additions and deletions  adjusting for stock splits and stock dividends and adjusting for other corporate actions. In addition to its daily governance of indices and maintenance of the SPX methodology  at least once within any 12 month period  the S&P Index Committee reviews the SPX methodology to ensure the SPX continues to achieve the stated objective  and that the data and methodology remain effective. The S&P Index Committee may at times consult with investors  market participants  security issuers included in or potentially included in the SPX  or investment and financial experts.P-18Divisor AdjustmentsThe two types of adjustments primarily used by the Index Sponsor are divisor adjustments and adjustments to the number of shares (including float adjustments) used to calculate the SPX. Set forth below is a table of certain corporate events and their resulting effect on the divisor and the share count. If a corporate event requires an adjustment to the divisor  that event has the effect of altering the market value of the affected SPX constituent and consequently of altering the aggregate market value of the SPX constituents following the event. In order that the level of the SPX not be affected by the altered market value (which could be an increase or decrease) of the affected SPX constituent  the Index Sponsor generally derives a new divisor by dividing the post-event market value of the SPX constituents by the pre-event SPX level  which has the effect of reducing the SPX’s post-event level to the pre-event level.Changes to the Number of Shares of a ConstituentThe index maintenance process also involves tracking the changes in the number of shares included for each of the index companies. Changes as a result of mandatory events  such as mergers or acquisition driven share/IWF changes  stock splits and mandatory distributions are not subject to a minimum threshold for implementation and are implemented when the transaction occurs. At the Index Sponsor’s discretion  however  de minimis merger and acquisition changes may be accumulated and implemented with the updates made with the quarterly share updates as described below. Material share/IWF changes resulting from certain non-mandatory corporate actions follow the accelerated implementation rule. Non-material share/IWF changes are implemented quarterly.Accelerated Implementation Rule1. Public offerings. Public offerings of new company-issued shares and/or existing shares offered by selling shareholders  including block sales and spot secondaries  will be eligible for accelerated implementation treatment if the size of the event meets the materiality threshold criteria:(a) at least US $150 million  and(b) at least 5% of the pre-event total shares.In addition to the materiality threshold  public offerings must satisfy the following conditions:• be underwritten.• have a publicly available prospectus  offering document  or prospectus summary filed with the relevant authorities.• have a publicly available confirmation from an official source that the offering has been completed.For public offerings that involve a concurrent combination of new company shares and existing shares offered by selling shareholders  both events are implemented if either of the public offerings represent at least 5% of total shares and $150 million. Any concurrent share repurchase by the affected company will also be included in the implementation.2. Dutch Auctions  self-tender offer buybacks  and split-off exchange offers. These nonmandatory corporate action types will be eligible for accelerated implementation treatment regardless of size once their results are publicly announced and verified by S&P.Exception to the Accelerated Implementation RuleFor non-mandatory corporate actions subject to the accelerated implementation rule with a size of at least US $1 billion  S&P will apply the share change  and any resulting IWF change  using the latest share and ownership information publicly available at the time of the announcement  even if the offering size is below the 5% threshold. This exception ensures that very large events are recognized in a timely manner using the latest available information.All non-mandatory events not covered by the accelerated implementation rule (including but not limited to private placements  acquisition of private companies  and conversion of non-index share lines) will be implemented quarterly coinciding with the third Friday of the third month in each calendar quarter. In addition  events that were not implemented under the accelerated implementation rule but were found to have been eligible  (e.g. due to lack of publicly available information at the time of the event) are implemented as part of a quarterly rebalancing.Announcement PolicyFor accelerated implementation  the Index Sponsor will generally provide two (2) business days’ notice for all non-U.S. listed stocks and U.S. listed depositary receipts  and one (1) business days’ notice for all non-depositary receipt U.S. listed stocks.IWF UpdatesAccelerated implementation for events less than $1 billion will include an adjustment to the company’s IWF only to the extent that such an IWF change helps the new float share total mimic the shares available in the offering. To minimize unnecessary turnover  these IWF changes do not need to meet any minimum threshold requirement for implementation. Any IWF change resulting in an IWF of 0.96 or greater is rounded up to 1.00 at the next annual IWF review.P-19IWF changes will only be made at the quarterly review if the change represents at least 5% of total current shares outstanding and is related to a single corporate action that did not qualify for the accelerated implementation rule  regardless if there is an associated share change.Quarterly share change events resulting from the conversion of derivative securities  acquisitions of private companies  or acquisitions of non-index companies that do not trade on a major exchange are considered to be available to investors unless there is explicit information stating that the new owner is a strategic holder.Other than the situations described above  please note that IWF changes are only made at the annual IWF review.Share UpdatesFor companies with multiple share class lines  the criteria specified under the heading “Accelerated Implementation Rule” above apply to each individual multiple share class line rather than total company shares.Exceptions:Any non- fully paid or non-fully settled offering such as forward sales agreements are not eligible for accelerated implementation. Share updates resulting from completion of subscription receipts terms or the settlement of forward sale agreements are updated at a future quarterly share rebalance.Rebalancing Guidelines – Share/IWF Reference Date & Freeze PeriodA reference date  after the market close five weeks prior to the third Friday in March  June  September  and December  is the cutoff for publicly available information used for quarterly shares outstanding and IWF changes. All shares outstanding and ownership information contained in public filings and/or official sources dated on or before the reference date are included in that quarter’s update. In addition  there is a freeze period on a quarterly basis for any changes that result from the accelerated implementation rules.Pro-forma files for float-adjusted market capitalization indices are generally released after the market close on the first Friday  two weeks prior to the rebalancing effective date. Pro-forma files for capped and alternatively weighted indices are generally released after the market close on the second Friday  one week prior to the rebalancing effective date. For illustration purposes  if rebalancing pro-forma files are scheduled to be released on Friday  March 5  the share/IWF freeze period will begin after the close of trading on Tuesday  March 9 and will end after the close of trading the following Friday  March 19 (i.e. the third Friday of the rebalancing month).During the share/IWF freeze period  shares and IWFs are not changed and the accelerated implementation rule is suspended  except for mandatory corporate action events (such as merger activity  stock splits  and rights offerings). The suspension includes all changes that qualify for accelerated implementation and would typically be announced or effective during the share/IWF freeze period . At the end of the freeze period all suspended changes will be announced on the third Friday of the rebalancing month  and implemented five business days after the quarterly rebalancing effective date.Adjustments for Corporate ActionsThere is a large range of corporate actions that may affect companies included in the SPX. Certain corporate actions require the Index Sponsor to recalculate the share count or the float adjustment or to make an adjustment to the divisor to prevent the level of the SPX from changing as a result of the corporate action. This helps ensure that the movement of the SPX does not reflect the corporate actions of individual companies in the SPX.Spin-OffsAs a general policy  a spin-off security is added to the SPX on the ex-date at a price of zero (with no divisor adjustment) and will remain in the SPX for at least one trading day. The spin-off security will remain in the SPX if it meets all eligibility criteria. If the spin-off security is determined ineligible to remain in the SPX  it will generally be removed after at least one day of regular way trading (with a divisor adjustment). The weight of the spin-off being deleted is reinvested across all the SPX constituents proportionately such that the relative weights of all SPX constituents are unchanged. The net change in SPX market capitalization will cause a divisor change.Companies that are spun off from a SPX constituent do not need to meet the eligibility criteria for new constituents  but they should be considered U.S. domiciled for SPX purposes. At the discretion of the S&P Index Committee  a spin-off company may be retained in the SPX if the S&P Index Committee determines it has a total market capitalization representative of the SPX. If the spin-off company’s estimated market capitalization is below the minimum unadjusted company marketP-20capitalization for the SPX but there are other SPX constituents that have a significantly lower total market capitalization than the spin-off company  the S&P Index Committee may decide to retain the spin-off company in the SPX.Several additional types of corporate actions  and their related treatment  are listed in the table below.Corporate Action Treatment SPX constituent addition/deletion Addition SPX constituents are added at the float market capitalization weight. The net change to the SPX market capitalization causes a divisor adjustment. Deletion The weights of all SPX constituents in the SPX will proportionally change. Relative weights will stay the same. The divisor will change due to the net change in the SPX market capitalization. Change in shares outstanding Increasing (decreasing) the shares outstanding increases (decreases) the market capitalization of the SPX. The change to the SPX market capitalization causes a divisor adjustment. Split/reverse split Shares outstanding are adjusted by split ratio. Stock price is adjusted by split ratio. There is no change to the SPX market capitalization and no divisor adjustment. Change in IWF Increasing (decreasing) the IWF increases (decreases) the market capitalization of the index. A net change to the SPX market capitalization causes a divisor adjustment. Ordinary dividend When a company pays an ordinary cash dividend  the SPX does not make any adjustments to the price or shares of the stock. As a result there are no divisor adjustments to the SPX. Special dividend The stock price is adjusted by the amount of the special dividend. The net change to the SPX market capitalization causes a divisor adjustment. Rights Offering All rights offerings that are in-the-money on the ex-date are applied under the assumption the rights are fully subscribed. The stock price is adjusted by the value of the rights and the shares outstanding are increased by the rights ratio. The net change in market capitalization causes a divisor adjustment.Any company that is removed from the SPX  the S&P MidCap 400® Index or the S&P SmallCap 600® Index must wait a minimum of one year from its removal date before being reconsidered as a replacement candidate for the SPX.Recalculation PolicyThe Index Sponsor reserves the right to recalculate and republish the SPX at its discretion in the event one of the following issues has occurred: (1) incorrect or revised closing price of one or more constituent securities; (2) missed or misapplied corporate action; (3) incorrect application of SPX methodology; (4) late announcement of a corporate action; or (5) incorrect calculation or data entry error. The decision to recalculate the SPX is made at the discretion of the index manager and/or index committee  as further discussed below. The potential market impact or disruption resulting from a recalculation is considered when making any such decision. In the event of an incorrect closing price  a missed or misapplied corporateP-21action  a late announcement of a corporate action   or an incorrect calculation or data entry error that is discovered within two trading days of its occurrence  generally the SPX is recalculated. In the event any such event is discovered beyond the two trading day period  the index committee shall decide whether the SPX should be recalculated. In the event of an incorrect application of the methodology that results in the incorrect composition and/or weighting of SPX constituents  the index committee shall determine whether or not to recalculate the SPX following specified guidelines. In the event that the SPX is recalculated  it shall be done within a reasonable timeframe following the detection and review of the issue.Calculations and Pricing DisruptionsClosing levels for the SPX are calculated by the Index Sponsor based on the closing price of the individual constituents of the SPX as set by their primary exchange. Closing prices are received by the Index Sponsor from one of its third party vendors and verified by comparing them with prices from an alternative vendor. The vendors receive the closing price from the primary exchanges. Real-time intraday prices are calculated similarly without a second verification. Official end-of-day calculations are based on each stock’s primary market closing price. Prices used for the calculation of real time SPX levels are based on the “Consolidated Tape”. The Consolidated Tape is an aggregation of trades for each constituent over all regional exchanges and trading venues and includes the primary exchange. If there is a failure or interruption on one or more exchanges  real-time calculations will continue as long as the “Consolidated Tape” is operational.If an interruption is not resolved prior to the market close  official closing prices will be determined by following the hierarchy set out in NYSE Rule 123C. A notice is published on the Index Sponsor website at spdji.com indicating any changes to the prices used in SPX calculations. In extreme circumstances  the Index Sponsor may decide to delay SPX adjustments or not publish the SPX. Real-time indices are not restated.Unexpected Exchange ClosuresAn unexpected market/exchange closure occurs when a market/exchange fully or partially fails to open or trading is temporarily halted. This can apply to a single exchange or to a market as a whole  when all of the primary exchanges are closed and/or not trading. Unexpected market/exchange closures are usually due to unforeseen circumstances  such as natural disasters  inclement weather  outages  or other events.To a large degree  the Index Sponsor is dependent on the exchanges to provide guidance in the event of an unexpected exchange closure. The Index Sponsor’s decision making is dependent on exchange guidance regarding pricing and mandatory corporate actions.NYSE Rule 123C provides closing contingency procedures for determining an official closing price for listed securities if the exchange is unable to conduct a closing transaction in one or more securities due to a system or technical issue.3:00 PM ET is the deadline for an exchange to determine its plan of action regarding an outage scenario. As such  the Index Sponsor also uses 3:00 PM ET as the cutoff.If all major exchanges fail to open or unexpectedly halt trading intraday due to unforeseen circumstances  the Index Sponsor will take the following actions:Market Disruption Prior to Open of Trading:(i) If all exchanges indicate that trading will not open for a given day  the Index Sponsor will treat the day as an unscheduled market holiday. The decision will be communicated to clients as soon as possible through the normal channels. Indices containing multiple markets will be calculated as normal  provided that at least one market is open that day. Indices which only contain closed markets will not be calculated.(ii) If exchanges indicate that trading  although delayed  will open for a given day  the Index Sponsor will begin index calculation when the exchanges open.Market Disruption Intraday:(i) If exchanges indicate that trading will not resume for a given day  the SPX level will be calculated using prices determined by the exchanges based on NYSE Rule 123C. Intraday SPX levels will continue to use the last traded composite price until the primary exchange publishes official closing prices.License AgreementS&P® is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC and Dow Jones® is a registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC (“Dow Jones”).

No statutory  regulatory  judicial or administrative authority directly discusses how the Notes should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Some of these tax consequences are summarized below  but we urge you to read the more detailed discussion under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” in the product supplement and discuss the tax consequences of your particular situation with your tax advisor. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the “Code”)  final  temporary and proposed U.S. Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) regulations  rulings and decisions  in each case  as available and in effect as of the date hereof  all of which are subject to change  possibly with retroactive effect. Tax consequences under state  local and non-U.S. laws are not addressed herein. No ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) has been sought as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in the Notes  and the following discussion is not binding on the IRS.U.S. Tax Treatment. Pursuant to the terms of the Notes  TD and you agree  in the absence of a statutory or regulatory change or an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary  to characterize your Notes as prepaid derivative contracts with respect to the Reference Asset. If your Notes are so treated  you should generally recognize gain or loss upon the taxable disposition of your Notes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount you receive at such time and the amount you paid for your Notes. Such gain or loss should generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held your Notes for more than one year (otherwise such gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss if held for one year or less). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.Based on certain factual representations received from us  our special U.S. tax counsel  Fried  Frank  Harris  Shriver & Jacobson LLP  is of the opinion that it would be reasonable to treat your Notes in the manner described above. However  because there is no authority that specifically addresses the tax treatment of the Notes  it is possible that your Notes could alternatively be treated for tax purposes as a single contingent payment debt instrument  or pursuant to some other characterization  such that the timing and character of your income from the Notes could differ materially and adversely from the treatment described above  as described further under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences — Alternative Treatments” in the product supplement.Except to the extent otherwise required by law  TD intends to treat your Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with the treatment described above and under “Material U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences” of the product supplement  unless and until such time as the Treasury and the IRS determine that some other treatment is more appropriate.Notice 2008-2. In 2007  the IRS released a notice that may affect the taxation of holders of the Notes. According to Notice 2008-2  the IRS and the Treasury are actively considering whether a holder of an instrument such as the Notes should be required to accrue ordinary income on a current basis. It is not possible to determine what guidance they will ultimately issue  if any. It is possible  however  that under such guidance  holders of the Notes will ultimately be required to accrue income currently and this could be applied on a retroactive basis. The IRS and the Treasury are also considering other relevant issues  including whether additional gain or loss from such instruments should be treated as ordinary or capital  whether non-U.S. holders of such instruments should be subject to withholding tax on any deemed income accruals  and whether the special “constructive ownership rules” of Section 1260 of the Code should be applied to such instruments. Both U.S. and non-U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the significance  and the potential impact  of the above considerations on their investments in the Notes.Medicare Tax on Net Investment Income. U.S. holders that are individuals  estates or certain trusts are subject to an additional 3.8% tax on all or a portion of their “net investment income ” or “undistributed net investment income” in the case of an estate or trust  which may include any income or gain realized with respect to the Notes  to the extent of their net investment income or undistributed net investment income (as the case may be) that when added to their other modified adjusted gross income  exceeds $200 000 for an unmarried individual  $250 000 for a married taxpayer filing a joint return (or a surviving spouse)  $125 000 for a married individual filing a separate return or the dollar amount at which the highest tax bracket begins for an estate or trust. The 3.8% Medicare tax is determined in a different manner than the regular income tax. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors as to the consequences of the 3.8% Medicare tax.Specified Foreign Financial Assets. U.S. holders may be subject to reporting obligations with respect to their Notes if they do not hold their Notes in an account maintained by a financial institution and the aggregate value of their Notes and certain other “specified foreign financial assets” (applying certain attribution rules) exceeds an applicable threshold. Significant penalties can apply if a U.S. holder is required to disclose its Notes and fails to do so.P-25Non-U.S. Holders. If you are a non-U.S. holder  subject to Section 871(m) of the Code and FATCA  as discussed below  you should generally not be subject to U.S. withholding tax with respect to payments on your Notes or to generally applicable information reporting and backup withholding requirements with respect to payments on your Notes if you comply with certain certification and identification requirements as to your non-U.S. status including providing us (and/or the applicable withholding agent) a properly executed and fully completed applicable IRS Form W-8. Subject to Section 897 of the Code and Section 871(m) of the Code  as discussed below  gain realized from the taxable disposition of the Notes generally should not be subject to U.S. tax unless (i) such gain is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by you in the U.S.  (ii) you are a non-resident alien individual and are present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year of such taxable disposition and certain other conditions are satisfied or (iii) you have certain other present or former connections with the U.S.Section 897. We will not attempt to ascertain whether any Reference Asset Constituent Issuer would be treated as a “United States real property holding corporation” (a “USRPHC”) within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code. We also have not attempted to determine whether the Notes should be treated as “United States real property interests” (“USRPI”) as defined in Section 897 of the Code. If any such entity and the Notes were so treated  certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could possibly apply  including subjecting any gain to a non-U.S. holder in respect of a Note upon a taxable disposition of the Note to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis  and the proceeds from such a taxable disposition to a 15% withholding tax. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential treatment of any such entity as a USRPHC and the Notes as USRPI.Section 871(m).

3217,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.ledgerinsights.com/nomura-hitachi-partner-tokyo-stock-exchange-parent-jpx-for-blockchain-green-bond-security-token/,Nomura  Hitachi partner Tokyo Stock Exchange parent JPX for blockchain green bond security token,8 hours ago,The Japan Exchange Group (JPX)  which operates the Tokyo Stock Exchange  will issue a corporate green bond as a security token using the BOOSTRY blockchain platform. Nomura is the structuring agent and underwriter  and Hitachi will monitor the carbon emissions prevented by renewable energy generation activities.Nomura and Nomura Research Institute started working on a blockchain bond solution in 2019  incorporating BOOSTRY later that year. SBI bought a 10% stake in 2020. The company open-sourced its ‘ibet’ software solution for bonds.JPX plans to have a public security token offering (STO)  which JPX claims is the first digital green bond for wholesale trading in Japan.The bonds will be issued on the ‘Ibet for Fin’ network  a consortium network founded by BOOSTRY  Nomura Securities  SMBC Nikko Securities and SBI Securities. The network acts as the bond registry  which means the Japan Securities Depository Center will not be used as the central security depository (CSD).Data regarding the CO2 emission reductions will also be logged on the blockchain. This lays the groundwork for a future in which a bond interest rate might vary depending on whether the bond reaches a sustainability target.Hitachi will automatically measure the volume of electricity generated at the renewable plants which receive the funds and convert this to CO2 emission reduction measurements. These readings are accessible to investors at any time  in contrast to the conventional annual reports.The funds raised will be allocated to biomass and solar power generation.JPX has been ramping up its digital activities of late. Last year it announced the planned April 2022 launch of an innovation subsidiary  JPX Market Innovation & Research  which is participating in this green bond initiative. Earlier this month  as part of its medium term strategy  it said it planned to launch a digital securities market for security tokens by April 2025. In February  it mentioned it was exploring green bonds and  the same month  invested in Digital Asset Markets  which has been involved in the issuance of gold-backed tokens with Mitsui.The news also signals yet another stock exchange win for Digital Asset  as Boostry’s smart contracts use the DAML language.

(EURONEXT: HEIO; OTCQX: HKHHY) publishes its trading update for the first quarter of 2022.Key HighlightsRevenue growth 35.9%Net revenue (beia) organic growth 24.9%; per hectolitre 18.3%Beer volume 5.2% organic growth; premium volume 6.3% organicallyHeineken® volume growth 12.9%Outlook for full year 2022 unchangedHeineken Holding N.V. engages in no activities other than its participating interest in Heineken N.V. and the management or supervision of and provision of services to that company.Financial SummaryRevenue for the first quarter of 2022 was €6 989 million (2021: €5 145 million). Net revenue (beia) was €5 753 million and increased by 24.9% organically  with total consolidated volume growing by 5.7% and net revenue (beia) per hectolitre up 18.3%. The latter was driven by assertive pricing and premiumisation across all regions  as well as a positive channel mix effect  particularly in Europe. Currency translation positively impacted net revenue (beia) by €186 million or 4.3%  mainly driven by the Brazilian Real  the Mexican Peso and the Vietnamese Dong. The consolidation of United Breweries Limited (UBL) in India positively impacted net revenue (beia) by €200 million or 4.6%.Revenue1 (in € million or %) 1Q22 Total growth Organic growth 1Q21 Revenue (IFRS) 6 989 35.9% 5 145 Net revenue (beia) 5 753 24.9% 4 307Beer volume grew 5.2% organically versus last year and came 2.8% ahead of 2019 on an organic basis. All regions contributed to the growth  especially Europe  given the low base last year due to the COVID-related restrictions in the on-trade. Asia Pacific returned to growth following the lockdown in the second part of last year. The Americas region recorded modest growth whilst Africa  Middle East & Eastern Europe continued its positive momentum.Beer volume (in mhl or %) 1Q22 Organic growth 1Q21 Heineken N.V. 56.4 5.2% 50.3Premium beer volume grew 6.3%  outperforming the portfolio in the majority of HEINEKEN's markets in the first three months of 2022. HEINEKEN's growth in premium is driven by Heineken®  which grew 12.9% in volume  significantly outperforming the total beer market and ahead of 2019 by close to one-third. Volume grew double-digits across all regions and in more than 45 markets. Growth was mainly driven by Brazil  China  the Netherlands  Spain  Ireland  Italy  the UK  Portugal  Nigeria  and the United Arab Emirates. Heineken® 0.0 grew in the twenties with strong momentum in Brazil  Mexico  the USA  Chile and South Korea. Heineken® Silver continued its strong growth in Vietnam and China.HEINEKEN also launched Heineken® Silver in Europe  reflecting its increased focus on consumers who are looking for more differentiated taste profiles and to drive further premiumisation. HEINEKEN kicked off in March with the first virtual beer launch in the Metaverse and in April HEINEKEN entered the next phase with the real launch  making Heineken® Silver available all over Europe. Overall  Heineken® Silver grew more than eighty percent.Story continuesHeineken® volume (in mhl or %) 1Q22 Organic growth Heineken N.V. 11.9 12.9%Reported Net Profit of Heineken N.V.The reported net profit of Heineken N.V. for the first three months of 2022 was €417 million (2021: €168 million). The net profit growth was driven by the top-line growth  with the partial recovery of the on-trade in Europe as the main factor. The reported net profit does not include the announced impairment and other non-cash exceptional charges of approximately €0.4 billion related to the decision to transfer the ownership of the business in Russia. A further update will follow with the half-year results.Business OutlookThe war in Ukraine has brought additional uncertainty to the global economic outlook and commodity markets. HEINEKEN expects mounting inflationary pressures to impact household disposable income and a consequent risk to beer consumption later in the year. While HEINEKEN benefits from hedges taken in 2021  further cost pressures are emerging from rising input costs  supply chain challenges  and from the decision to leave Russia. HEINEKEN will take additional actions and maintain its guidance of a stable to modest sequential improvement in operating profit margin (beia) in 2022.Translational Currency Calculated ImpactBased on the impact to date  and applying spot rates of 14 April 2022 to the 2021 financial results as a baseline for the remainder of the year  HEINEKEN calculates a positive currency translational impact of approximately €1 150 million in net revenue (beia)  €160 million at operating profit (beia) and €100 million at net profit (beia).Reconciliation of non-GAAP measuresIn the internal management reports  HEINEKEN uses the measure of net revenue (beia).Reconciliation net revenue (beia) In millions of € 1Q22 1Q21 Revenue (IFRS) 6 989 5 145 Excise tax expense (1 236) (837) Net revenue 5 753 4 307 Exceptional items included in net revenue — (1) Net revenue (beia) 5 753 4 307Note: due to rounding  this table will not always castEnquiriesMedia Heineken Holding N.V.

The demand environment continued to be very robust. Our Q1 order intake increased year-on-year by 65% at constant currencies to €706 million.

For Q2 at constant currencies  we expect revenue of €540-570 million  in line with our previous forecast for a further sequential increase in Q2. Based on the current visibility  we expect revenue in the second half of 2022 to be clearly higher than the level in the first half  to a certain extent depending on the pace of improvement in supply chain conditions.

Despite particularly high prior-year comparatives and an economic environment disrupted by the crisis in Ukraine  we delivered sustained like-for-like revenue growth of +6.5%  and of +11.1% before the expected decline in revenue from the Covid support contracts. Quarterly revenue was lifted by robust business development  particularly in the Ibero-LATAM region and in India  in a rapidly transforming  fast-growing market. The recent strategic acquisitions of Health Advocate and Senture in the United States also made a significant contribution to the Group’s expansion during the quarter. Lastly  we recently curtailed our commitments in Russia  where our exposure remains at less than 1% of our revenue stream.Based on this encouraging first quarter  and despite an increasingly destabilized global context  we can confirm our full-year guidance  with in particular a like-for-like increase in revenue of more than +5%  and of more than +10% excluding the impact of Covid support contracts. We also remain committed to pursuing targeted acquisitions to strengthen our high value-added businesses.In an environment marked by further crises  with people thrown into highly vulnerable circumstances  we were proud to recently announce the signing of a partnership with UNICEF to support children’s education and contribute to the agency's worldwide disaster relief fund. The US$6 million partnership will help improve education programs in India and the Philippines and provide emergency disaster relief around the world. As part of the partnership  we have already donated US$500 000 to UNICEF to support its work in Ukraine. We have also donated an equivalent amount to support the work of the Red Cross in Ukraine.""------------------------Consolidated revenue€ millions 2022 2021 % change Like-for-like Reported Average exchange rate €1 = US$1.12 €1 = US$1.20 First quarter 1 962 1 712 +6.5% +14.6%Consolidated revenue came in at €1 962 million for the first quarter of 2022  representing a year-on-year increase of +6.5% at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation (like-for-like) and +14.6% as reported. The favorable currency effect  which added +€54 million to reported revenue  stemmed primarily from the rise against the euro in the US dollar and  to a lesser extent the pound sterling  the Brazilian real and the Indian rupee. Changes in the scope of consolidation had an +€82 million positive impact  reflecting the consolidation of Health Advocate from July 1  2021 and of Senture from January 1  2022.Like-for-like growth during the quarter was particularly strong given the negative but expected impact of the change in revenue from Covid support contracts (down -€83 million compared with first-quarter 2021). Adjusted for this non-recurring impact  like-for-like growth stood at +11.1% for the period. The gain reflected the very robust sales momentum in the Core Services & D.I.B.S. activities  driven by accelerating market digitalization  particularly in the social media ecosystem  and a recovery in certain sectors that had suffered during the health crisis  such as hospitality and online travel. Specialized Services revenue also rose sharply over the period  lifted by strong growth in the TLScontact visa application management business  which benefited from highly favorable prior-year comparatives and the steady upturn in its business volumes.Revenue by activityQ1 2022 Q1 2021 % change € millions Like-for-like Reported CORE SERVICES & D.I.B.S.* 1 711 1 536 +5.4% +11.4% English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP) 599 508 +1.8% +18.1% Ibero-LATAM 525 442 +16.2% +18.9% Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA) 459 481 -3.5% -4.7% India 128 105 +17.1% +21.6% SPECIALIZED SERVICES 251 176 +15.5% +42.2% TOTAL 1 962 1 712 +6.5% +14.6%* Digital Integrated Business ServicesCore Services & Digital Integrated Business Services (D.I.B.S.) (D.I.B.S.)Core Services & D.I.B.S. revenue amounted to €1 711 million in first-quarter 2022  a year-on-year increase of +5.4% like-for-like. Reported growth came to +11.4%  with the difference primarily reflecting the rise against the euro in the US dollar and  to a lesser extent sterling  the Brazilian real and the Indian rupee. In addition  the consolidation of Senture from January 1  2022 added +€50 million to reported revenue for the quarter.Excluding the impact of the decline in revenue from Covid support contracts  the Core Services & D.I.B.S. activities delivered double-digit like-for-like growth over the period  driven by the accelerating development of the digital economy  particularly in the social media  online entertainment and online food services segments. In addition  the financial services  healthcare and automotive segments saw rapid expansion during the period. Growth in the hospitality and tourism segments  which had been hard hit by the health crisis  continued to gain momentum in every operating region.English-speaking & Asia-Pacific (EWAP)Regional revenue came to €599 million in first-quarter 2022  up +1.8% like-for-like. and +18.1% as reported  i.e.  including the favorable currency effect stemming from the rise of the US dollar and pound sterling against the euro and the positive impact of consolidating Senture from January 1  2022.Business growth in the North American market confirmed the renewed momentum that emerged in the second half of last year  both in the domestic market and in the Philippines-based offshore operations. The online entertainment  financial services and healthcare segments expanded at a firm pace and the hospitality and tourism segments continued to rebound.Business in the United Kingdom ended the period down year-on-year  due to the expected steep fall-off in revenue from Covid support contracts. Among the other segments  insurance saw sustained gains and healthcare ramped up quickly during the quarter.In Asia  business growth continued to be driven by the contribution from recently signed contracts with global leaders in the social media and online entertainment sectors  notably served from the multilingual hubs in Malaysia and from Indonesia.Ibero-LATAMFirst-quarter 2022 revenue for the Ibero-LATAM region amounted to €525 million  a year-on-year increase of +16.2% like-for-like. Reported growth came to +18.9%  primarily due to the increase in the Brazilian real and the Mexican peso against the euro.Despite an unfavorable basis of comparison  business in the region expanded at a fast pace  led by the contribution from a large number of new contracts  particularly with e-clients.During the quarter  growth was robust in Brazil  Argentina  Peru and in the nearshore activities  particularly in the Dominican Republic and Guatemala  as well as in Honduras and Nicaragua  where the Group recently launched operations. The multilingual operations in Portugal serving global market leaders in the digital economy continued to expand steadily.Across the region  business was very brisk in the social media  online entertainment  hospitality and tourism  online food services  automotive and healthcare segments.Continental Europe & MEA (CEMEA)Revenue in the CEMEA region amounted to €459 million in the first three months of 2022  a year-on-year decline of -3.5% like-for-like and of -4.7% as reported  with the difference reflecting the decline in the Turkish lira and Russian ruble against the euro.The slight contraction in business stemmed from the change in contribution from Covid support contracts  particularly in the Netherlands  France and Germany. As expected  revenue from these contracts dropped off more markedly towards quarter-end  and will continue to decline sharply in the second quarter.Excluding the impact of Covid support contracts  business growth was satisfactory in the region. Business with multinational clients  particularly in the e-tailing and transportation segments  was dynamic over the period  notably in the German-speaking markets  Egypt  Romania and Poland. Growth in the hospitality and tourism segments continued to pick up pace in the first quarter.IndiaIn the first quarter of 2022  operations in India generated €128 million in revenue  up +17.1% from the prior-year period on a like-for-like basis and by a stronger +21.6% as reported  due to the positive currency effect caused by the upturn in the Indian rupee against the euro.Offshore activities  which are the main source of regional revenue and include high value-added solutions  enjoyed rapid growth over the period  buoyed by strong momentum in the e-tailing  transportation and hospitality and tourism segments.Domestic operations reported satisfactory growth while e-tailing and online food services continued to ramp-up quickly.Specialized ServicesRevenue from Specialized Services stood at €251 million in first-quarter 2022  a year-on-year increase of +15.5% like-for-like and of +42.2% as reported. The difference between like-for-like and reported growth stemmed from afavorable currency effect caused by the rise of the US dollar against the euro and a positive scope effect (+€32 million) due to the consolidation of Health Advocate from July 1  2021.TLScontact’s revenues climbed very sharply during the period  thanks to a favorable basis of comparison with stronger volumes’ recovery since the second half of last year. In particular  demand for UK visa applications returned to pre-crisis levels during the quarter. Business in the Schengen area continued to trend upwards  but remained below pre-crisis levels due to the dearth of inbound travelers from China. While revenue is expected to continue rebounding throughout the year  growth remains difficult to estimate given the impact on international travel of the war in Ukraine and the ever-evolving health situation.LanguageLine Solutions  the activity’s main contributor and business growth driver  advanced at a satisfactory pace over the quarter  especially in the healthcare segment  though growth rates were dampened by a high basis of comparison.The debt collection business in North America reported satisfactory quarterly revenue growth  particularly in the nearshore activities  led by the robust sales momentum built up since last year.OutlookBased on this encouraging first quarter  and despite an increasingly destabilized global context  Teleperformance has confirmed its full-year 2022 objectives  which include:- Like-for-like revenue growth above +10% (excluding the impact of Covid support contracts);- Decrease in contribution from Covid support contracts;- Like-for-like revenue growth above +5%;- A 30 basis-point increase in EBITA margin before non-recurring items;- Further targeted acquisitions capable of creating value and strengthening the Group's high value-added businesses.-----------------DisclaimerAll forward-looking statements are based on Teleperformance management’s present expectations of future events and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

This was mainly driven by low occupancy performance in oil storage in the Netherlands as a result of continued soft storage markets for oil.Cost level for Q1 2022 amounted to EUR 165 million (Q1 2021: EUR 151 million) mainly related to increases in utility prices  currency exchange movements and including costs for delivered growth projects and new business development efforts.EBIT of EUR 126 million (Q1 2021: EUR 121 million)  increased due to positive business performance  positive currency translation effect  partially offset by higher depreciation.Net profit attributable to holders of ordinary shares of EUR 75 million (Q1 2021: EUR 73 million).Cash Flow From Operations (excluding derivatives) of EUR 169 million increased compared to Q1 2021 EUR 140 million driven by business performance and receipt of dividends from joint ventures slightly offset by working capital movements.Return on capital employed (ROCE) of 9.1% decreased from Q1 2021: ROCE of 10.3% as a result of higher capital employed from new capacity and investments in sustaining and IT capex.The senior net debt: EBITDA ratio is 2.70 (Q4 2021: 2.93) mainly due to positive EBITDA performance and receipt of joint venture dividends.Portfolio items:Story continuesVopak has signed an agreement subject to customary closing conditions for the divestment of 4 Canadian terminals located in Hamilton  Montreal East and West and Quebec City. Proceeds of around EUR 116 million are expected and will be used for debt repayments. We expect a limited exceptional divestment result upon closing.Following the outcome of the previously announced strategic review of our assets in Australia  Vopak decided to continue to operate these terminals. The Australian market is solid and will continue to support the cash flow generation of Vopak.Gate terminal  our joint venture with Gasunie for LNG in Rotterdam  continues to play a key role in the security of natural gas supplies in Northwest Europe supplying the equivalent of 25% of the Netherlands’ gas needs. One of our customers  Uniper  will increase its capacity rights by 1 BCM as of October 2022. Following last year's announcement on expansion of send out capacity which will become available in October 2024  it is currently also being investigated if  in the short term  the send out capacity of the Gate terminal can be expanded further.Delivery of new capacity of 44 500 cbm during Q1 2022 in Altamira and Deer Park.Exceptional items Q1 2022:There were no exceptional items in Q1 2022.Subsequent events:Vopak will be working together with partners Gasunie and HES International to develop an import terminal for green ammonia as a hydrogen carrier in Rotterdam  the Netherlands. The companies have signed a cooperation agreement which is a response to growing global demand for import and storage of green energy. In Q2 2022  work will be started on the basic design of the import terminal. The terminal  which will operate on the Maasvlakte under the name ACE Terminal  is planned to be operational from 2026.Looking ahead:Vopak is on track with the prior announced target of EUR 110 million to EUR 125 million EBITDA contribution in 2023 from growth projects.We expect to manage the 2022 cost base including additional cost for new growth projects around EUR 645 million  subject to currency exchange and utilities price movements. In Q1 2022 there was upward pressure on currency exchange and utilities price movements.In 2022  growth investments are expected to be below EUR 300 million. The allocation of these investments will be through existing committed projects  new business development and pre-FID (Final Investment Decision) feasibility studies in new energies including hydrogen.For the period 2020-2022  Vopak expects to be at the higher end of the range EUR 750 million to EUR 850 million for sustaining and service improvement capex  subject to additional discretionary decisions  policy changes and regulatory requirements.As part of the strategic direction for the period 2020-2022  Vopak indicated to invest annually up to a maximum of EUR 45 million in IT capex  to complete Vopak’s digital terminal management system. We expect to complete the roll out of our Vopak Terminal System to our terminal network and joint ventures by the end of 2023.I mpact of the Russia-Ukraine war:The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a major humanitarian drama and we sympathize with the people who are now suffering from the violence of war. Vopak is monitoring the situation closely and is fully committed to adhere to relevant sanctions laws and regulations. At the moment  restrictions under applicable EU sanctions are in general exempted in relation to the import of energy products into the EU. As governments try to ensure energy security and affordability  Vopak follows applicable government regulations with regard to energy imports from Russia.The Russia-Ukraine war and the international sanction regimes make the market situation volatile and uncertain. Vopak’s direct exposure is assessed to be limited. There is  however  an indirect exposure through factors such as utility prices  inflation  market conditions and exchange rates.Impact of Covid-19 pandemic in 2022 :The pandemic spread of Covid-19 remains an impactful event in several regions around the world  such as recently China. Our first priority in the Covid-19 response continues to be to protect the health and well-being of our people  their families and the communities in which we operate. Also in times of crisis  Vopak plays an important role within society by storing vital products with care.Financial calendar20 April 2022 Annual General Meeting22 April 2022 Ex-dividend quotation25 April 2022 Dividend record date28 April 2022 Dividend payment date12 May 2022 Capital Markets Day27 July 2022 Publication of 2022 half-year results11 November 2022 Publication of 2022 third-quarter interim updateDisclaimerAny statement  presentation or other information contained herein that relates to future events  goals or conditions is  or should be considered  a forward-looking statement.Although Vopak believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable  based on the information available to Vopak on the date such statements are made  such statements are not guarantees of future performance and readers are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

As reported  Pucci is heading to Capri on April 28 to unveil its first designs by Camille Miceli and Dior plans to hold a runway show for Maria Grazia Chiuri’s pre-fall 2022 women’s ready-to-wear collection on April 30 in Seoul.Chanel kicks off the 2023 cruise season with a showing May 5 in Monaco  and Louis Vuitton heads to the Salk Institute in San Diego  Calif.  for its show on May 12. Meanwhile  Gucci has earmarked May 16 for a coed show at Castel Del Monte in the Italian region of Apulia  and Kim Jones plans to unveil his spring 2023 men’s collection for Dior in Los Angeles on May 19.Balenciaga’s New York showing is bound to be a hot ticket  given its creative director Demna’s reputation for mounting immersive and gripping fashion spectacles.His fall 2022 show in Paris last month had models battling gale-force winds in a giant snow globe  evoking images of Ukrainian refugees fleeing their country amid Russia’s invasion.The designer is known for fearless and incisive commentary on the climate crisis  the perils of technology  the geopolitical situation — and fashion itself.He also continues to have a broad impact on fashion. Last July  he staged Balenciaga’s first couture show since Cristóbal Balenciaga retired from fashion in 1968  and his strong-shouldered tailoring foreshadowed a glut of dark pantsuits in an array of fall 2022 collections.Alexander McQueen  also controlled by Kering  opted to show its fall 2022 womenswear collection in New York on March 15. — MILES SOCHAREVOLVE EXPLAINS: Revolve has spoken out amid the backlash over its Revolve Festival.After the e-tailer’s festival went viral on social media  particularly on TikTok  with guests complaining about having to wait hours for its shuttles to the exclusive event  Revolve has issued a statement regarding the criticism.“In anticipation of the high level of interest in attending Revolve Festival this year  Revolve worked closely with all appropriate city and safety authorities to ensure a safe and secure path for guests to access the two-day invitation-only event ” a representative from the etailer said.The scene at the Revolve Festival. Lexie Moreland/WWD“With an event of this magnitude  city regulations mandate an off-site location for guest check-in and parking  as well as licensed shuttle transportation to and from the venue ” the statement read. “The offsite lot was set up with guest parking  as well as rideshare drop-off and pickup access with added WiFi for car booking  restrooms  shade  water  medics and security.”The backlash against Revolve Festival went viral this weekend after multiple influencers took to TikTok to share their experiences. A short TikTok video by content creator Averie Danielle Bishop  for one  discussed the “chaos” of the festival and how festivalgoers had to wait hours to get onto the shuttles to transport them to the event. The only way to go to the event was with the shuttles provided by Revolve — guests were not allowed to arrive by any other means of transportation.“As the festival was reaching capacity late Saturday afternoon  shuttle access to the venue was limited in order to remain in compliance with safety requirements causing longer wait times for entry and resulting in some guests not being able to attend the festival ” the statement continued. “The safety of our guests is of the utmost importance to us and we will always make that a priority.”It continued  “We sincerely apologize to all the guests who were impacted. We always strive to provide a great experience and we promise to do better.”In Bishop’s TikTok  she and her friend discuss how the logistics of the event were reminiscent of the notorious Fyre Festival from 2017  in which guests were stranded in the Bahamas without proper accommodations or food when they thought they were attending a luxurious and exclusive music festival hosted by Billy McFarland and Ja Rule.The invite-only Revolve Festival was held on the first weekend of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and produced in collaboration with The h.wood Group on April 16 and 17. — CONCHITA WIDJOJOBLUE SUMMER: British department store Selfridges is teaming with Jacquemus on a takeover project titled “Le Bleu” ahead of the summer.From May 3  the retailer’s The Corner Shop space on Oxford Street will be turned into a surrealist retail concept inspired by Simon Porte Jacquemus’ own bathroom.Iris Law stars in Jacquemus x Selfridges Le Bleu campaign.

Different from previous editions in Milan and Paris  the London version will be stocked with the Chiquito and Bambino bags in colorways exclusive to Selfridges.The old Selfridges Hotel on top of the food hall right next to the mews will host the immersive experience concept “Le Vestiaire ” a continuation of the concept “Le Bleu.” Customers will be transported through a surrealist interpretation of a swimming pool with locker rooms and a number of different rooms which will have different sensory elements.“I wanted to recreate an accumulation of lockers with different 3D experiences inside  inspired by Jacques Tati movies ” the designer added.The project comes with a campaign featuring Iris Law  posing by the pool in a blue bikini with matching nail color. — TIANWEI ZHANGSOUNDING BOARD: Renowned for his eye for contemporary art  François Pinault also seems to have an ear for music.The French billionaire’s family office is among founders of a special purpose acquisition company that is poised to merge with streaming platform Deezer and take it public.The SPAC  known as 12PO  said the business combination would be renamed Deezer and list this summer on the professional segment of Euronext Paris  valuing the firm at 1.05 billion euros.A press release touted Deezer as “the second largest independent music streaming platform in the world” after Spotify with 9.6 million subscribers and 2021 revenues of 400 million euros.

I also used to roller skate in Central Park and every week at The Roxy.”The film is the first documentary ever produced about Tahari.

Through its unique approach of combining enzymes and plastics  Carbios aims to address new consumer expectations and the challenges of a broader ecological transition by taking up a major challenge of our time: plastic and textile pollution.Established in 2011 by Truffle Capital  the mission of Carbios is to provide an industrial solution to the recycling of PET plastics and textiles (the dominant polymer in bottles  trays  and textiles made of polyester). The enzymatic recycling technology developed by Carbios deconstructs any type of PET plastic waste into its basic components  which can then be reused to produce new PET plastics of a quality equivalent to virgin ones. This PET innovation  the first of its kind in the world  was recently recognized in a scientific paper published in the prestigious journal Nature. Additionally  Carbios is working hand in hand with multinational brands — like L’Oréal  Nestlé Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe — to implement its technology  and to lead the transition toward a truly circular economy.Story continuesThe Company has also developed an enzymatic biodegradation technology for PLA (a bio sourced polymer) based single use plastics. This technology can create a new generation of plastics that are 100% compostable in domestic conditions  integrating enzymes at the heart of the plastic product. This disruptive innovation has been licensed to Carbiolice  a joint venture created in 2016  which is now Carbios’ subsidiary.For more information  please visit www.carbios.com/enTwitter: Carbios LinkedIn: Carbios Instagram : carbioshqCarbios (ISIN FR0011648716/ALCRB) is eligible for the PEA-PME  a government program allowing French residents investing in SMEs to benefit from income tax rebates.Translation is for information purposes only.In case of discrepancy between the French and the English version of this press release  the French version shall prevail.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220420005874/en/ContactsCarbiosLaura Perrin / Agnès MathéCommunication DepartmentBenjamin AudebertInvestor Relationscontact@carbios.com+33 (0)4 73 86 51 76Media Relations (Europe)TilderMarie-Virginie Kleinmv.klein@tilder.com+33 (0)1 44 14 99 96Media Relations (U.S.)Rooney PartnersKate L.
