The LTI has been discussed at board meetings during the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022. The board of directors or the remuneration committee shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of the LTI Bonus in accordance with the terms and guidelines resolved on by the annual general meeting.Objectives of the LTI BonusThe main objective of the LTI Bonus is to  by promoting a common interest between the participants and Haldex as well as creating conditions to retain key competences  strengthen Haldex's financial development. The board of directors believes that the LTI Bonus will have a positive effect on the group's long-term growth as well as the participant's long-term commitment to Haldex's development through a long-term shareholding in Haldex and will thus be beneficial to both the shareholders and Haldex. The long-term objective of the LTI Bonus is reflected in the agreement with the participant of the LTI Bonus.Participants and bonus levelsParticipants in the LTI Bonus are up to 26 key employees  including members of the executive management  in Haldex  as selected by the board of directors. On the main terms and conditions presented herein  the participants will receive a cash bonus that they will use to purchase shares in Haldex. The maximum bonus amount payable to each participant corresponds to 60% of the relevant participant's annual  gross base salary. The bonus amount will be determined by the level of fulfilment of the performance criteria  as per below.Main terms of the LTI BonusThe LTI Bonus shall be governed by the following main terms and conditions:The LTI Bonus is vested during the calendar years 2022 and 2023 (the ""Vesting Period"") and is conditional upon  among other things  the fulfilment of certain performance criteria and that the participant is employed by the Haldex group  in accordance with the main terms stipulated herein and the specific terms which will be included in the agreement with the participant.The participants undertake to purchase shares in Haldex for the full net of tax amount of the cash bonus. The share purchases will take place on the stock exchange where the Haldex shares are listed and at the price per share that the shares are currently traded for at the time of the acquisition  why the share purchases will be made at the market value.The LTI Bonus will not result in any dilution of the existing shareholders' shares in the company as the participants acquires shares that are already traded on the stock exchange. This also means that Haldex does not have to take any measures to ensure delivery of the shares to the participants.The participants must in general be employed by the Haldex group during the entire Vesting Period  i.e. January 1  2022 ‚Äì December 31  2023   to be eligible for the bonus. If a participant has been employed during the Vesting Period  the bonus amount shall be reduced pro rata the employment period. A participant who has terminated his or her employment during the Vesting Period shall not be eligible for the bonus.‚Äì   to be eligible for the bonus. If a participant has been employed during the Vesting Period  the bonus amount shall be reduced the employment period. A participant who has terminated his or her employment during the Vesting Period shall not be eligible for the bonus. The participants may not dispose of the shares until  at the earliest  January 1  2026 .. To ensure an effective administration of the LTI Bonus  Haldex has contracted a share plan administrator. Via the administrator  the participants will be able to acquire the shares in Haldex and  as of January 1  2026   dispose of the shares.Performance criteria for LTI BonusIn addition to the other conditions  in order for a cash bonus to be made payable to the participants  two performance criteria must be met during the calendar year 2022. The level of fulfilment of the performance criteria will determine the cash bonus amount. The two performance criteria are:Return on capital employed (ROCE)  which represents 70% of the total award; and Operating profit  which represents 30% of the total award.The level of fulfilment of the performance criteria is measured against the budget approved by the board of directors for 2022.Timing of the share acquisitionLTI Bonus is constructed so that at the expiry of the Vesting Period  i.e. during 2024  the board of directors shall assess the level of fulfilment of the performance criteria in the calendar year 2022 as well as whether the other conditions for LTI-Bonus have been fulfilled. Thereafter  the bonus amount is paid out and shares can be acquired. The shares will thus be acquired in 2024  the year after the expiry of the Vesting Period. The reason why the share acquisition takes place earlier than three years from the conclusion of the LTI Bonus agreement is that the participants shall be able to take part in the shares' value development in the coming years. The participants undertake not to sell the acquired shares until after December 31  2025 at the earliest. As a result  the program as a whole is ongoing for a longer period than three years.Cost of the LTI BonusIn addition to the bonus amounts being paid out  the costs for the LTI Bonus consist of regular personnel costs associated with cash compensation and an administration cost for the administrator's handling of the LTI Bonus. The costs will vary depending on the level of fulfilment of the performance criteria and the participants' salary and tax domicile. According to initial calculations  Haldex's costs for the bonus are estimated at between SEK 6‚Äì24 million. The administrator's costs for the administration of the LTI Bonus consist of an annual fee that will be recurrent throughout the years that the administration is ongoing.Administration of the LTI BonusThe detailed terms and conditions of the LTI Bonus shall be decided by the board of directors or the remuneration committee  but shall remain within the framework of the terms and guidelines resolved on by the annual general meetingIt is proposed that the board of directors shall be entitled to make other adjustments to the LTI Bonus  if it so deems appropriate  if changes occur in Haldex  its operation environment or the market that results in a situation where the conditions for the participants' share acquisitions becomes unreasonable. Any such adjustments shall only be made in order to fulfil the main objectives of the LTI Bonus.Majority requirementsResolutions passed by the annual general meeting in accordance with the board of director's proposal item 14 are valid if supported by simple majority.Item 15: Confirmation of 2021 LTI allotmentAt the 2021 annual general meeting  a long-term incentive program for the CEO was approved (the ""2021 LTI"").

This pricing supplement is not an offer to sell nor does it seek an offer to buy these notes in any state where the offer or sale is not permitted.Subject to Completion  Dated April 20  2022.Filed Pursuant to Rule 424(b)(2)Registration Statement No. 333-262557The Toronto-Dominion Bank $ Leveraged Capped Buffered S&P 500¬Æ Index-Linked Notes dueThe notes do not bear interest. The amount that you will be paid on your notes on the maturity date (expected to be the second business day after the valuation date) is based on the performance of the S&P 500¬Æ Index as measured from the pricing date to and including the valuation date (expected to be between 26 and 29 months after the pricing date). If the final level on the valuation date is greater than the initial level (equal to the closing level of the index on the pricing date)  the return on your notes will be positive  subject to the maximum payment amount (expected to be between $1 301.28 and $1 354.48 for each $1 000 principal amount of your notes). If the final level declines by up to 15.00% from the initial level  you will receive the principal amount of your notes. If the final level declines by more than 15.00% from the initial level  the return on your notes will be negative and you will lose approximately 1.1765% of the principal amount of your notes for every 1% that the final level has declined below the buffer level of 85.00% of the initial level. Despite the inclusion of the buffer level  due to the downside multiplier you may lose your entire principal amount.To determine your payment at maturity  we will calculate the percentage change of the S&P 500¬Æ Index  which is the percentage increase or decrease in the final level from the initial level. At maturity  for each $1 000 principal amount of your notes  you will receive an amount in cash equal to:‚óè if the percentage change is positive (the final level is greater than the initial level)  the sum of (i) $1 000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1 000 times (b) 140.00% times (c) the percentage change  subject to the maximum payment amount;‚óè if the percentage change is zero or negative but not below -15.00% (the final level is equal to the initial level or is less than the initial level  but not by more than 15.00%)  $1 000; or‚óè if the percentage change is negative and is below -15.00% (the final level is less than the initial level by more than 15.00%)  the sum of (i) $1 000 plus (ii) the product of (a) $1 000 times (b) the downside multiplier of approximately 117.65% times (c) the sum of the percentage change plus 15.00%. You will receive less than the principal amount of your notes.The notes do not guarantee the return of principal at maturity.The notes are unsecured and are not savings accounts or insured deposits of a bank. The notes are not insured or guaranteed by the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation  the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency or instrumentality. Any payments on the notes are subject to our credit risk. The notes will not be listed or displayed on any securities exchange or electronic communications network.You should read the disclosure herein to better understand the terms and risks of your investment. See ‚ÄúAdditional Risk Factors‚Äù beginning on page P-7 of this pricing supplement.Neither the Securities and Exchange Commission nor any state securities commission has approved or disapproved of these notes or determined that this pricing supplement  the product supplement or the prospectus is truthful or complete. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense.The initial estimated value of the notes at the time the terms of your notes are set on the pricing date is expected to be between $971.40 and $991.40 per $1 000 principal amount  which is less than the public offering price listed below. See ‚ÄúAdditional Information Regarding the Estimated Value of the Notes‚Äù on the following page and ‚ÄúAdditional Risk Factors‚Äù beginning on page P-7 of this document for additional information. The actual value of your notes at any time will reflect many factors and cannot be predicted with accuracy.Public Offering Price Underwriting Discount1 Proceeds to TD1 Per Note $1 000.00 $0.00 $1 000.00 Total $ $ $1 See ‚ÄúSupplemental Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)‚Äù herein.TD Securities (USA) LLCPricing Supplement dated   2022The public offering price  underwriting discount and proceeds to TD listed above relate to the notes we issue initially. We may decide to sell additional notes after the date of the final pricing supplement  at public offering prices and with underwriting discounts and proceeds to TD that differ from the amounts set forth above. The return (whether positive or negative) on your investment in the notes will depend in part on the public offering price you pay for such notes.We  TD Securities (USA) LLC (‚ÄúTDS‚Äù) or any of our affiliates  may use this pricing supplement in the initial sale of the notes. In addition  we  TDS or any of our affiliates may use this pricing supplement in a market-making transaction in a note after its initial sale. Unless we  TDS or any of our affiliates informs the purchaser otherwise in the confirmation of sale  this pricing supplement will be used in a market-making transaction.Additional Information Regarding the Estimated Value of the NotesThe final terms for the Notes will be determined on the date the Notes are initially priced for sale to the public  which we refer to as the Pricing Date  based on prevailing market conditions on the Pricing Date  and will be included in the final pricing supplement. The economic terms of the Notes are based on TD‚Äôs internal funding rate (which is TD‚Äôs internal borrowing rate based on variables such as market benchmarks and TD‚Äôs appetite for borrowing)  and several factors  including any sales commissions expected to be paid to TDS  any selling concessions  discounts  commissions or fees expected to be allowed or paid to non-affiliated intermediaries  the estimated profit that TD or any of TD‚Äôs affiliates expect to earn in connection with structuring the Notes  the estimated cost TD may incur in hedging its obligations under the Notes and the estimated development and other costs which TD may incur in connection with the Notes. Because TD‚Äôs internal funding rate generally represents a discount from the levels at which TD‚Äôs benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market  the use of an internal funding rate for the Notes rather than the levels at which TD‚Äôs benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market is expected to have an adverse effect on the economic terms of the Notes. On the cover page of this pricing supplement  TD has provided the initial estimated value range for the Notes. This range of estimated values was determined by reference to TD‚Äôs internal pricing models which take into account a number of variables and are based on a number of assumptions  which may or may not materialize  typically including volatility  interest rates (forecasted  current and historical rates)  price-sensitivity analysis  time to maturity of the Notes  and TD‚Äôs internal funding rate. For more information about the initial estimated value  see ‚ÄúAdditional Risk Factors‚Äù herein. Because TD‚Äôs internal funding rate generally represents a discount from the levels at which TD‚Äôs benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market  the use of an internal funding rate for the Notes rather than the levels at which TD‚Äôs benchmark debt securities trade in the secondary market is expected  assuming all other economic terms are held constant  to increase the estimated value of the Notes. For more information see the discussion under ‚ÄúAdditional Risk Factors ‚Äî Risks Relating to Estimated Value and Liquidity ‚Äî TD‚Äôs and TDS‚Äôs Estimated Value of the Notes are Determined By Reference to TD‚Äôs Internal Funding Rates and are Not Determined By Reference to Credit Spreads or the Borrowing Rate TD Would Pay for its Conventional Fixed-Rate Debt Securities‚Äù.TD‚Äôs estimated value on the Pricing Date is not a prediction of the price at which the Notes may trade in the secondary market  nor will it be the price at which TDS may buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market. Subject to normal market and funding conditions  TDS or another affiliate of TD‚Äôs intends to offer to purchase the Notes in the secondary market but it is not obligated to do so.Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Pricing Date  the price at which TDS may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market  if any  may exceed TD‚Äôs estimated value on the Pricing Date for a temporary period expected to be approximately 3 months after the Pricing Date because  in its discretion  TD may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging its obligations under the Notes and other costs in connection with the Notes which TD will no longer expect to incur over the term of the Notes. TD made such discretionary election and determined this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors  including the tenor of the Notes and any agreement TD may have with the distributors of the Notes. The amount of TD‚Äôs estimated costs which is effectively reimbursed to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period  and TD may discontinue such reimbursement at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the Pricing Date of the Notes based on changes in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.If a party other than TDS or its affiliates is buying or selling your Notes in the secondary market based on its own estimated value of your Notes which was calculated by reference to TD‚Äôs credit spreads or the borrowing rate TD would pay for its conventional fixed-rate debt securities (as opposed to TD‚Äôs internal funding rate)  the price at which such party would buy or sell your Notes could be significantly less.We urge you to read the ‚ÄúAdditional Risk Factors‚Äù in this pricing supplement.P-2SummaryThe information in this ‚ÄúSummary‚Äù section is qualified by the more detailed information set forth in this pricing supplement  the product supplement and the prospectus.Issuer: The Toronto-Dominion Bank (‚ÄúTD‚Äù) Issue: Senior Debt Securities  Series E Type of Note: Leveraged Capped Buffered Notes (the ‚ÄúNotes‚Äù) Term: Expected to be between 26 and 29 months Reference Asset: S&P 500¬Æ Index (Bloomberg Ticker: SPX) CUSIP / ISIN: 9114VD46 / US89114VD466 Agent: TD Securities (USA) LLC (‚ÄúTDS‚Äù) Currency: U.S. Dollars Minimum Investment: $1 000 and minimum denominations of $1 000 in excess thereof Principal Amount: $1 000 per Note; $ in the aggregate for all the offered Notes; the aggregate Principal Amount of the offered Notes may be increased if the Issuer  at its sole option  decides to sell an additional amount of the offered Notes on a date subsequent to the date of the final pricing supplement.

U.S. Tax Treatment: By purchasing a Note  each holder agrees  in the absence of a statutory or regulatory change or an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary  to characterize the Notes  for U.S. federal income tax purposes  as prepaid derivative contracts with respect to the Reference Asset. Based on certain factual representations received from us  our special U.S. tax counsel  Fried  Frank  Harris  Shriver & Jacobson LLP  is of the opinion that it would be reasonable to treat the Notes in the manner described above. However  because there is no authority that specifically addresses the tax treatment of the Notes  it is possible that your Notes could alternatively be treated for tax purposes as a single contingent payment debt instrument  or pursuant to some other characterization  such that the timing and character of your income from the Notes could differ materially and adversely from the treatment described above. Please see the discussion below under ‚ÄúMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences‚Äù.

Capitalized terms used but not defined in this pricing supplement will have the meanings given to them in the product supplement. In the event of any conflict the following hierarchy will govern: first  this pricing supplement; second  the product supplement; and last  the prospectus. The Notes vary from the terms described in the product supplement in several important ways. You should read this pricing supplement carefully.This pricing supplement  together with the documents listed below  contains the terms of the Notes and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral statements as well as any other written materials including preliminary or indicative pricing terms  correspondence  trade ideas  structures for implementation  sample structures  brochures or other educational materials of ours. You should carefully consider  among other things  the matters set forth in ‚ÄúAdditional Risk Factors‚Äù herein  ‚ÄúAdditional Risk Factors Specific to the Notes‚Äù in the product supplement and ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù in the prospectus  as the Notes involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment  legal  tax  accounting and other advisors concerning an investment in the Notes. You may access these documents on the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ‚ÄúSEC‚Äù) website at www.sec.gov as follows (or if that address has changed  by reviewing our filings for the relevant date on the SEC website):‚óæ Prospectus dated March 4  2022:‚óæ Product Supplement MLN-EI-1 dated March 4  2022:Our Central Index Key  or CIK  on the SEC website is 0000947263. As used in this pricing supplement  the ‚ÄúBank ‚Äù ‚Äúwe ‚Äù ‚Äúus ‚Äù or ‚Äúour‚Äù refers to The Toronto-Dominion Bank and its subsidiaries.We reserve the right to change the terms of  or reject any offer to purchase  the Notes prior to their issuance. In the event of any changes to the terms of the Notes  we will notify you and you will be asked to accept such changes in connection with your purchase. You may also choose to reject such changes  in which case we may reject your offer to purchase.P-6Additional Risk FactorsThe Notes involve risks not associated with an investment in conventional debt securities. This section describes the most significant risks relating to the terms of the Notes. For additional information as to these risks  please see ‚ÄúAdditional Risk Factors Specific to the Notes‚Äù in the product supplement and ‚ÄúRisk Factors‚Äù in the prospectus.You should carefully consider whether the Notes are suited to your particular circumstances. Accordingly  investors should consult their investment  legal  tax  accounting and other advisors as to the risks entailed by an investment in the Notes and the suitability of the Notes in light of their particular circumstances.Risks Relating to Return CharacteristicsPrincipal at Risk.Investors in the Notes could lose their entire Principal Amount if there is a decline in the level of the Reference Asset by more than the Buffer Percentage. If the Final Level is less than the Initial Level by more than 15.00%  you will lose a portion of each $1 000 Principal Amount in an amount equal to the product of (i) the Downside Multiplier times (ii) the sum of the negative Percentage Change plus the Buffer Percentage times (iii) $1 000. Specifically  you will lose approximately 1.1765% of the Principal Amount of each of your Notes for every 1% that the Final Level is less than the Initial Level in excess of the Buffer Percentage and you may lose your entire Principal Amount.The Notes Do Not Pay Interest and Your Return on the Notes May Be Less Than the Return on Conventional Debt Securities of Comparable Maturity.There will be no periodic interest payments on the Notes as there would be on a conventional fixed-rate or floating-rate debt security having the same term. The return that you will receive on the Notes  which could be negative  may be less than the return you could earn on other investments. Even if your return is positive  your return may be less than the return you would earn if you bought a conventional senior interest bearing debt security of TD.Your Potential Return on the Notes Is Limited by the Maximum Payment Amount and May Be Less Than the Return on a Direct Investment In the Reference Asset.The opportunity to participate in the possible increases in the level of the Reference Asset through an investment in the Notes will be limited because the Payment at Maturity will not exceed the Maximum Payment Amount. Furthermore  the effect of the Leverage Factor will not be taken into account for any Final Level exceeding the Cap Level no matter how much the level of the Reference Asset may rise above the Cap Level. Accordingly  your return on the Notes may be less than your return would be if you made an investment in a security directly linked to the performance of the Reference Asset.The Payment at Maturity Is Not Linked to the Level of the Reference Asset at Any Time Other than the Valuation Date.The Final Level will be the Closing Level of the Reference Asset on the Valuation Date (subject to adjustment as described elsewhere in this pricing supplement). Therefore  if the Closing Level of the Reference Asset dropped precipitously on the Valuation Date  the Payment at Maturity for your Notes may be significantly less than it would have been had the Payment at Maturity been linked to the Closing Level of the Reference Asset prior to such drop in the level of the Reference Asset. Although the actual level of the Reference Asset on the Maturity Date or at other times during the term of your Notes may be higher than the Final Level  you will benefit from the Closing Level of the Reference Asset only on the Valuation Date.You Will Not Have Any Rights to the Reference Asset Constituents.As a holder of the Notes  you will not have voting rights or rights to receive cash dividends or other distributions or other rights that holders of the Reference Asset Constituents would have. The Final Level will not reflect any dividends paid on any Reference Asset Constituents.If You Purchase Your Notes at a Premium to Principal Amount  the Return on Your Investment Will Be Less Than the Return on Notes Purchased at Principal Amount and the Impact of Certain Key Terms of the Notes Will be Negatively Affected.The Payment at Maturity will not be adjusted based on the public offering price you pay for the Notes. If you purchase Notes at a price that differs from the Principal Amount of the Notes  then the return on your investment in such Notes held to the Maturity Date will differ from  and may be substantially less than  the return on Notes purchased at Principal Amount. If you purchase your Notes at a premium to Principal Amount and hold them to the Maturity Date  the return on your investment in the Notes will be less than it would have been had you purchased the Notes at Principal Amount or a discount to Principal Amount. In addition  the impact of the Buffer Level and the Cap Level on the return on your investment will depend upon the price you pay for your Notes relative to Principal Amount. For example  if you purchase your Notes at a premium to Principal Amount  the Cap Level will only permit a lower positive return on your investment in the Notes than would have been the case for Notes purchased at Principal Amount or a discount to Principal Amount. Similarly  the Buffer Level  whileP-7still providing some protection for the return on the Notes  will allow a greater percentage decrease in your investment in the Notes than would have been the case for Notes purchased at Principal Amount or a discount to Principal Amount.Risks Relating to Characteristics of the Reference AssetThere Are Market Risks Associated with the Reference Asset.The level of the Reference Asset can rise or fall sharply due to factors specific to the Reference Asset  the securities included in the Reference Asset (the ‚ÄúReference Asset Constituents‚Äù) and their issuers (the ‚ÄúReference Asset Constituent Issuers‚Äù)  such as stock price volatility  earnings  financial conditions  corporate  industry and regulatory developments  management changes and decisions and other events  as well as general market factors  such as general market volatility and levels  interest rates and economic and political conditions. In addition  recently  the coronavirus infection has caused volatility in the global financial markets and a slowdown in the global economy. Coronavirus or any other communicable disease or infection may adversely affect the Reference Asset Constituent Issuers and  therefore  the Reference Asset. You  as an investor in the Notes  should make your own investigation into the Reference Asset  the Reference Asset Constituents and the Reference Asset Constituent Issuers. For additional information  see ‚ÄúInformation Regarding the Reference Asset‚Äù herein.The Reference Asset Reflects Price Return  not Total Return.The return on your Notes is based on the performance of the Reference Asset  which reflects the changes in the market prices of the Reference Asset Constituents. It is not  however  linked to a ‚Äútotal return‚Äù index or strategy  which  in addition to reflecting those price returns  would also reflect dividends paid on the Reference Asset Constituents. The return on your Notes will not include such a total return feature or dividend component.We Have No Affiliation with the Index Sponsor and Will Not Be Responsible for Any Actions Taken by the Index Sponsor.S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (the ‚ÄúIndex Sponsor‚Äù) is not an affiliate of ours and will not be involved in any offerings of the Notes in any way. Consequently  we have no control of any actions of the Index Sponsor  including any actions of the type that would require the Calculation Agent to adjust the Payment at Maturity. The Index Sponsor does not have any obligation of any sort with respect to the Notes. Thus  the Index Sponsor has no obligation to take your interests into consideration for any reason  including in taking any actions that might affect the value of  or any amount payable on  the Notes. None of our proceeds from any issuance of the Notes will be paid to the Index Sponsor  except to the extent that we are required to pay the Index Sponsor licensing fees with respect to the Reference Asset.Market Disruption Events and Postponements.The Valuation Date  and therefore the Maturity Date  are subject to postponement as described in the product supplement due to the occurrence of one or more market disruption events. For a description of what constitutes a market disruption event as well as the consequences of that market disruption event  see ‚ÄúGeneral Terms of the Notes‚ÄîMarket Disruption Events‚Äù in the product supplement.Risks Relating to Estimated Value and LiquidityTD‚Äôs Initial Estimated Value of the Notes at the Time of Pricing (When the Terms of Your Notes Are Set on the Pricing Date) is Expected to be Less Than the Public Offering Price of the Notes.TD‚Äôs initial estimated value of the Notes is only an estimate. TD‚Äôs initial estimated value of the Notes is expected to be less than the public offering price of the Notes. The difference between the public offering price of the Notes and TD‚Äôs initial estimated value reflects costs and expected profits associated with selling and structuring the Notes  as well as hedging its obligations under the Notes with a third party. Because hedging our obligations entails risks and may be influenced by market forces beyond our control  this hedging may result in a profit that is more or less than expected  or a loss.TD‚Äôs and TDS‚Äôs Estimated Value of the Notes are Determined By Reference to TD‚Äôs Internal Funding Rates and are Not Determined By Reference to Credit Spreads or the Borrowing Rate TD Would Pay for its Conventional Fixed-Rate Debt Securities.TD‚Äôs initial estimated value of the Notes and TDS‚Äôs estimated value of the Notes at any time are determined by reference to TD‚Äôs internal funding rate. The internal funding rate used in the determination of the estimated value of the Notes generally represents a discount from the credit spreads for TD‚Äôs conventional fixed-rate debt securities and the borrowing rate TD would pay for its conventional fixed-rate debt securities. This discount is based on  among other things  TD‚Äôs view of the funding value of the Notes as well as the higher issuance  operational and ongoing liability management costs of the Notes in comparison to those costs for TD‚Äôs conventional fixed-rate debt  as well as estimated financing costs of any hedge positions  taking into account regulatory and internal requirements. If the interest rate implied by the credit spreads for TD‚Äôs conventional fixed-rate debt securities  or the borrowing rate TD would pay for its conventional fixed-rate debt securities were to be used  TD would expect the economic terms of the Notes to be more favorable to you. Additionally  assuming all other economic terms are held constant  the use of an internal funding rate for the Notes is expected to increase the estimated value of the Notes at any time.P-8TD‚Äôs Initial Estimated Value of the Notes Does Not Represent Future Values of the Notes and May Differ From Others‚Äô (Including TDS‚Äôs) Estimates.TD‚Äôs initial estimated value of the Notes is determined by reference to its internal pricing models when the terms of the Notes are set. These pricing models take into account a number of variables  such as TD‚Äôs internal funding rate on the Pricing Date  and are based on a number of assumptions as discussed further under ‚ÄúAdditional Information Regarding the Estimated Value of the Notes‚Äù herein. Different pricing models and assumptions (including the pricing models and assumptions used by TDS) could provide valuations for the Notes that are different from  and perhaps materially less than  TD‚Äôs initial estimated value. Therefore  the price at which TDS would buy or sell your Notes (if TDS makes a market  which it is not obligated to do) may be materially less than TD‚Äôs initial estimated value. In addition  market conditions and other relevant factors in the future may change  and any assumptions may prove to be incorrect.The Estimated Value of the Notes Is Not a Prediction of the Prices at Which You May Sell Your Notes in the Secondary Market  If Any  and Such Secondary Market Prices  If Any  Will Likely be Less Than the Public Offering Price of Your Notes and May Be Less Than the Estimated Value of Your Notes.The estimated value of the Notes will not be a prediction of the prices at which TDS  other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions (if they are willing to purchase  which they are not obligated to do). The price at which you may be able to sell your Notes in the secondary market at any time  if any  will be influenced by many factors that cannot be predicted  such as market conditions  and any bid and ask spread for similar sized trades  and may be substantially less than the estimated value of the Notes. Further  as secondary market prices of your Notes take into account the levels at which our debt securities trade in the secondary market  and do not take into account our various costs and expected profits associated with selling and structuring the Notes  as well as hedging our obligations under the Notes  secondary market prices of your Notes will likely be less than the public offering price of your Notes. As a result  the price at which TDS  other affiliates of ours or third parties may be willing to purchase the Notes from you in secondary market transactions  if any  will likely be less than the price you paid for your Notes  and any sale prior to the Maturity Date could result in a substantial loss to you.The Temporary Price at Which TDS May Initially Buy the Notes in the Secondary Market May Not Be Indicative of Future Prices of Your Notes.Assuming that all relevant factors remain constant after the Pricing Date  the price at which TDS may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market (if TDS makes a market in the Notes  which it is not obligated to do) may exceed the estimated value of the Notes on the Pricing Date  as well as the secondary market value of the Notes  for a temporary period after the Pricing Date of the Notes  as discussed further under ‚ÄúAdditional Information Regarding the Estimated Value of the Notes.‚Äù The price at which TDS may initially buy or sell the Notes in the secondary market may not be indicative of future prices of your Notes.The Market Value of Your Notes May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors.When we refer to the market value of your Notes  we mean the value that you could receive for your Notes if you chose to sell them in the open market before the Maturity Date. A number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  will influence the market value of your Notes  including:‚Ä¢ the level of the Reference Asset;‚Ä¢ the volatility ‚Äì i.e.  the frequency and magnitude of changes ‚Äì in the level of the Reference Asset;‚Ä¢ the dividend rates  if applicable  of the Reference Asset Constituents;‚Ä¢ economic  financial  regulatory and political  military or other events that may affect the prices of any of the Reference Asset Constituents and thus the level of the Reference Asset;‚Ä¢ interest rate and yield rates in the market;‚Ä¢ the time remaining until your Notes mature;‚Ä¢ any fluctuations in the exchange rate between currencies in which the Reference Asset Constituents are quoted and traded and the U.S. dollar  as applicable; and‚Ä¢ our creditworthiness  whether actual or perceived  and including actual or anticipated upgrades or downgrades in our credit ratings or changes in other credit measures.These factors will influence the price you will receive if you sell your Notes before maturity  including the price you may receive for your Notes in any market-making transaction. If you sell your Notes prior to maturity  you may receive less than the Principal Amount of your Notes.The future levels of the Reference Asset cannot be predicted. The actual change in the level of the Reference Asset over the term of the Notes  as well as the Payment at Maturity  may bear little or no relation to the hypothetical historical closing levels of the Reference Asset or to the hypothetical examples shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement.P-9There May Not Be an Active Trading Market for the Notes ‚Äî Sales in the Secondary Market May Result in Significant Losses.There may be little or no secondary market for the Notes. The Notes will not be listed or displayed on any securities exchange or electronic communications network. TDS and our affiliates may make a market for the Notes; however  they are not required to do so. TDS and our affiliates may stop any market-making activities at any time. Even if a secondary market for the Notes develops  it may not provide significant liquidity or trade at prices advantageous to you. We expect that transaction costs in any secondary market would be high. As a result  the difference between bid and ask prices for your Notes in any secondary market could be substantial.If you sell your Notes before the Maturity Date  you may have to do so at a substantial discount from the public offering price irrespective of the level of the Reference Asset and  as a result  you may suffer substantial losses.If the Level of the Reference Asset Changes  the Market Value of Your Notes May Not Change in the Same Manner.Your Notes may trade quite differently from the performance of the Reference Asset. Changes in the level of the Reference Asset may not result in a comparable change in the market value of your Notes. Even if the level of the Reference Asset increases above the Initial Level during the term of the Notes  the market value of your Notes may not increase by the same amount and could decline.Risks Relating to Hedging Activities and Conflicts of InterestThe Agent Discount  if any  Offering Expenses and Certain Hedging Costs Are Likely to Adversely Affect Secondary Market Prices.Assuming no changes in market conditions or any other relevant factors  the price  if any  at which you may be able to sell the Notes will likely be less than the public offering price. The public offering price includes  and any price quoted to you is likely to exclude  any underwriting discount paid in connection with the initial distribution  offering expenses as well as the cost of hedging our obligations under the Notes. In addition  any such price is also likely to reflect any dealer discounts  mark-ups and other transaction costs  such as a discount to account for costs associated with establishing or unwinding any related hedge transaction. In addition  if the dealer from which you purchase Notes  or one of its affiliates  is to conduct hedging activities for us in connection with the Notes  that dealer  or one of its affiliates  may profit in connection with such hedging activities and such profit  if any  will be in addition to any compensation that the dealer receives for the sale of the Notes to you. You should be aware that the potential for the dealer or one of its affiliates to earn fees in connection with hedging activities may create a further incentive for the dealer to sell the Notes to you in addition to any compensation they would receive for the sale of the Notes.Trading and Business Activities by TD and Our Affiliates May Adversely Affect the Market Value of  and Any Amount Payable on  the Notes.TD and our affiliates may hedge our obligations under the Notes by purchasing securities  futures  options or other derivative instruments with returns linked or related to changes in the level of the Reference Asset or prices of one or more Reference Asset Constituents  and we or they may adjust these hedges by  among other things  purchasing or selling any of the foregoing at any time. It is possible that we or one or more of our affiliates could receive substantial returns from these hedging activities while the market value of  and any amount payable on  the Notes declines. We or one or more of our affiliates may also issue or underwrite other securities or financial or derivative instruments with returns linked or related to the performance of the Reference Asset or one or more Reference Asset Constituents.These trading activities may present a conflict between the holders‚Äô interest in the Notes and the interests we and our affiliates will have in our or their proprietary accounts  in facilitating transactions  including options and other derivatives transactions  for our or their customers‚Äô accounts and in accounts under our or their management. These trading activities could be adverse to the interests of the holders of the Notes.We and our affiliates may  at present or in the future  engage in business with one or more Reference Asset Constituent Issuers  including making loans to or providing advisory services to those companies. These services could include investment banking and merger and acquisition advisory services. These business activities may present a conflict between us and our affiliates obligations  and your interests as a holder of the Notes. Moreover  we  and our affiliates may have published  and in the future expect to publish  research reports with respect to the Reference Asset or one or more Reference Asset Constituents. This research is modified from time to time without notice and may express opinions or provide recommendations that are inconsistent with purchasing or holding the Notes. Any of these business activities by us or one or more of our affiliates may affect the level of the Reference Asset or one or more Reference Asset Constituents and  therefore  the market value of  and any amount payable on  the Notes.There Are Potential Conflicts of Interest Between You and the Calculation Agent.The Calculation Agent will  among other things  determine the amount of your payment on the Notes. We will serve as the Calculation Agent and may appoint a different Calculation Agent after the Issue Date without notice to you. The Calculation Agent will exercise its judgment when performing its functions and may take into consideration our ability to unwind anyP-10related hedges. Because this discretion by the Calculation Agent may affect payments on the Notes  the Calculation Agent may have a conflict of interest if it needs to make any such decision. For example  the Calculation Agent may have to determine whether a market disruption event affecting the Reference Asset has occurred. This determination may  in turn  depend on the Calculation Agent‚Äôs judgment whether the event has materially interfered with our ability or the ability of one of our affiliates to unwind our hedge positions. Because this determination by the Calculation Agent will affect the payment on the Notes  the Calculation Agent may have a conflict of interest if it needs to make a determination of this kind. For additional information as to the Calculation Agent‚Äôs role  see ‚ÄúGeneral Terms of the Notes‚ÄîRole of Calculation Agent‚Äù in the product supplement.Risks Relating to General Credit CharacteristicsInvestors Are Subject to TD‚Äôs Credit Risk  and TD‚Äôs Credit Ratings and Credit Spreads May Adversely Affect the Market Value of the Notes.Although the return on the Notes will depend on the Final Level of the Reference Asset  the payment of any amount due on the Notes is subject to TD‚Äôs credit risk. The Notes are TD‚Äôs unsecured debt obligations. Investors are dependent on TD‚Äôs ability to pay all amounts due on the Notes on the Maturity Date and  therefore  investors are subject to the credit risk of TD and to changes in the market‚Äôs view of TD‚Äôs creditworthiness. Any decrease in TD‚Äôs credit ratings or increase in the credit spreads charged by the market for taking TD‚Äôs credit risk is likely to adversely affect the market value of the Notes. If TD becomes unable to meet its financial obligations as they become due  investors may not receive any amounts due under the terms of the Notes.Risks Relating to Canadian and U.S. Federal Income TaxationSignificant Aspects of the Tax Treatment of the Notes Are Uncertain.Significant aspects of the U.S. tax treatment of the Notes are uncertain. You should consult your tax advisor about your tax situation and should read carefully the section entitled ‚ÄúMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences‚Äù herein and in the product supplement.For a discussion of the Canadian federal income tax consequences of investing in the Notes  please see the discussion in the product supplement under ‚ÄúSupplemental Discussion of Canadian Tax Consequences‚Äù.If you are not a Non-resident Holder (as that term is defined in the prospectus) for Canadian federal income tax purposes or if you acquire the Notes in the secondary market  you should consult your tax advisors as to the consequences of acquiring  holding and disposing of the Notes and receiving the payments that might be due under the Notes.General Risk FactorsWe May Sell an Additional Aggregate Principal Amount of the Notes at a Different Public Offering Price.At our sole option  we may decide to sell an additional aggregate Principal Amount of the Notes subsequent to the date of the final pricing supplement. The public offering price of the Notes in the subsequent sale may differ substantially (higher or lower) from the original public offering price you paid as provided on the cover of the final pricing supplement.P-11Hypothetical ReturnsThe examples and graph set out below are included for illustration purposes only. They should not be taken as an indication or prediction of future investment results and merely are intended to illustrate the impact that the various hypothetical levels of the Reference Asset on the Valuation Date could have on the Payment at Maturity assuming all other variables remain constant. The actual terms of the Notes will be set on the Pricing Date.The examples below are based on a range of Final Levels that are entirely hypothetical; the levels of the Reference Asset on any day throughout the term of the Notes  including the Final Level on the Valuation Date  cannot be predicted. The Reference Asset has been highly volatile in the past‚Äîmeaning that the level of the Reference Asset has changed considerably in relatively short periods‚Äîand its performance cannot be predicted for any future period.The information in the following examples reflects hypothetical rates of return on the offered Notes assuming that they are purchased on the Issue Date at the Principal Amount and held to the Maturity Date. If you sell your Notes in a secondary market prior to the Maturity Date  your return will depend upon the market value of your Notes at the time of sale  which may be affected by a number of factors that are not reflected in the examples below  such as interest rates  the volatility of the Reference Asset and our creditworthiness. In addition  the estimated value of your Notes at the time the terms of your Notes are set on the Pricing Date is expected to be less than the original public offering price of your Notes. For more information on the estimated value of your Notes  see ‚ÄúAdditional Risk Factors ‚Äî Risks Relating to Estimated Value and Liquidity ‚Äî TD‚Äôs Initial Estimated Value of the Notes at the Time of Pricing (When the Terms of Your Notes Are Set on the Pricing Date) is Expected to be Less Than the Public Offering Price of the Notes.‚Äù in this pricing supplement. The information in the examples also reflect the key terms and assumptions in the box below.Key Terms and Assumptions Principal Amount $1 000 Leverage Factor 140.00% Hypothetical Cap Level 121.520% of the Initial Level* Hypothetical Maximum Payment Amount $1 301.28* Buffer Level 85.00% of the Initial Level Downside Multiplier Approximately 117.65% Buffer Percentage 15.00% * The bottom of the Cap Level and Maximum Payment Amount ranges specified herein. The actual Cap Level and Maximum Payment Amount will be determined on the Pricing Date. Neither a market disruption event nor a non-Trading Day occurs on the originally scheduled Valuation Date No change in or affecting any of the Reference Asset Constituents or the method by which the Index Sponsor calculates the Reference Asset Notes purchased on the Issue Date at the Principal Amount and held to the Maturity DateMoreover  we have not yet set the Initial Level  which will serve as the baseline for determining the Percentage Change  or the Cap Level or the Maximum Payment Amount  each of which will affect the amount that we will pay on your Notes  if any  at maturity. We will not do so until the Pricing Date. As a result  the actual Initial Level may differ substantially from the level of the Reference Asset prior to the Pricing Date.For these reasons the actual performance of the Reference Asset over the term of your Notes  as well as the Payment at Maturity  if any  may bear little relation to the hypothetical examples shown below or to the historical levels of the Reference Asset shown elsewhere in this pricing supplement. For information about the historical levels of the Reference Asset during recent periods  see ‚ÄúInformation Regarding the Reference Asset‚ÄîHistorical Information‚Äù below. Before investing in the offered Notes  you should consult publicly available information to determine the levels of the Reference Asset between the date of this pricing supplement and the date of your purchase of the offered Notes.Also  the hypothetical examples shown below do not take into account the effects of applicable taxes. Because of the U.S. tax treatment applicable to your Notes  tax liabilities could affect the after-tax rate of return on your Notes to a comparatively greater extent than the after-tax return on the Reference Asset Constituents.P-12The levels in the left column of the table below represent hypothetical Final Levels and are expressed as percentages of the Initial Level. The amounts in the right column represent the hypothetical Payment at Maturity  based on the corresponding hypothetical Final Level  and are expressed as percentages of the Principal Amount of a Note (rounded to the nearest one-thousandth of a percent). Thus  a hypothetical Payment at Maturity of 100.000% means that the value of the cash payment that we would pay for each $1 000 of the outstanding Principal Amount of the offered Notes on the Maturity Date would equal 100.000% of the Principal Amount of a Note  based on the corresponding hypothetical Final Level and the assumptions noted above.Hypothetical Final Level (as Percentage of Initial Level) Hypothetical Payment at Maturity (as Percentage of Principal Amount) 150.000% 130.128% 140.000% 130.128% 130.000% 130.128% 125.000% 130.128% 121.520% 130.128% 118.000% 125.200% 112.000% 116.800% 106.000% 108.400% 100.000% 100.000% 95.000% 100.000% 90.000% 100.000% 85.000% 100.000% 80.000% 94.118% 75.000% 88.235% 50.000% 58.824% 25.000% 29.412% 0.000% 0.000%If  for example  the Final Level were determined to be 25.000% of the Initial Level  the Payment at Maturity that we would pay on your Notes at maturity would be approximately 29.412% of the Principal Amount of your Notes  as shown in the table above. As a result  if you purchased your Notes on the Issue Date at the Principal Amount and held them to the Maturity Date  you would lose approximately 70.588% of your investment (if you purchased your Notes at a premium to Principal Amount you would lose a correspondingly higher percentage of your investment). If the Final Level were determined to be 0.000% of the Initial Level  you would lose 100.000% of your investment in the Notes. In addition  if the Final Level were determined to be 150.000% of the Initial Level  the Payment at Maturity that we would pay on your Notes at maturity would be capped at the Maximum Payment Amount  or 130.128% of each $1 000 Principal Amount of your Notes  as shown in the table above. As a result  if you held your Notes to the Maturity Date  you would not benefit from any increase in the Final Level of greater than 121.520% of the Initial Level.P-13The following examples illustrate the hypothetical Payment at Maturity for each Note based on hypothetical Final Levels of the Reference Asset  calculated based on the key terms and assumptions above. The values below have been rounded for ease of analysis.Example 1‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is positive (and the Final Level is below the Cap Level). Percentage Change: 5.00% Payment at Maturity: $1 000.00 + ($1 000.00 √ó 140.00% √ó 5.00%) = $1 000.00 + $70.00 = $1 070.00On a $1 000.00 investment  a 5.00% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 070.00  a return of 7.00% on the Notes.Example 2‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is positive (and the Final Level is above or equal to the Cap Level).Percentage Change: 50.00%Payment at Maturity: $1 000.00 + ($1 000.00 √ó 140.00% √ó 50.00%) = $1 000.00 + $700.00 = $1 700.00. However  the Maximum Payment Amount is $1 301.28 and therefore the Payment at Maturity would be $1 301.28.On a $1 000.00 investment  a 50.00% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 301.28  a return of 30.128% on the Notes. In addition to limiting your return on the Notes  the Maximum Payment Amount limits the positive effect of the Leverage Factor. If the Final Level is greater than the Initial Level  you will participate in the performance of the Reference Asset at a rate of 140.00% up to a certain point. However  the effect of the Leverage Factor will be progressively reduced for Final Levels that are greater than 121.520% of the Initial Level (based on the Maximum Payment Amount of 130.128% or $1 301.28 per $1 000.00 Principal Amount of the Notes) because your return on the Notes for any Final Level greater than 121.520% of the Initial Level will be limited by the Maximum Payment Amount.Example 3‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is negative (but the Final Level is above or equal to the Buffer Level).Percentage Change: -5.00% Payment at Maturity: At maturity  if the Percentage Change is negative BUT not by more than the Buffer Percentage  then the Payment at Maturity will equal the Principal Amount. On a $1 000.00 investment  a -5.00% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $1 000.00  a return of 0.000% on the Notes.Example 4‚Äî Calculation of the Payment at Maturity where the Percentage Change is negative (and the Final Level is below the Buffer Level).Percentage Change: -35.00% Payment at Maturity: $1 000.00 + [$1 000.00 √ó 117.65% √ó (-35.00% + 15.00%)] = $1 000.00 ‚Äì $235.29 = $764.71On a $1 000.00 investment  a -35.00% Percentage Change results in a Payment at Maturity of $764.71  a return of -23.529% on the Notes.P-14The following chart shows a graphical illustration of the hypothetical Payment at Maturity that we would pay on your Notes on the Maturity Date if the Final Level were any of the hypothetical levels shown on the horizontal axis. The hypothetical Payments at Maturity in the chart are expressed as percentages of the Principal Amount of your Notes and the hypothetical Final Levels are expressed as percentages of the Initial Level. The chart shows that any hypothetical Final Level of less than 85.000% (the section left of the 85.000% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a hypothetical Payment at Maturity of less than 100.000% of the Principal Amount of your Notes (the section below the 100.000% marker on the vertical axis) and  accordingly  in a loss of principal to the holder of the Notes. The chart also shows that any hypothetical Final Level of greater than or equal to 121.520% (the section right of the 121.520% marker on the horizontal axis) would result in a capped return on your investment.The Payments at Maturity shown above are entirely hypothetical; they are based on a hypothetical Cap Level and Maximum Payment Amount  levels of the Reference Asset that may not be achieved on the Valuation Date and assumptions that may prove to be erroneous. The actual market value of your Notes on the Maturity Date or at any other time  including any time you may wish to sell your Notes  may bear little relation to the hypothetical Payment at Maturity shown above  and these amounts should not be viewed as an indication of the financial return on an investment in the offered Notes. The hypothetical Payment at Maturity on the Notes in the examples above assume you purchased your Notes at their Principal Amount and have not been adjusted to reflect the actual public offering price you pay for your Notes. The return on your investment (whether positive or negative) in your Notes will be affected by the amount you pay for your Notes. If you purchase your Notes for a price other than the Principal Amount  the return on your investment will differ from  and may be significantly less than  the hypothetical returns suggested by the above examples. Please read ‚ÄúAdditional Risk Factors ‚Äî Risks Relating to Estimated Value and Liquidity ‚Äî The Market Value of Your Notes May Be Influenced by Many Unpredictable Factors‚Äù in this pricing supplement.P-15Payments on the Notes are economically equivalent to the amounts that would be paid on a combination of other instruments. For example  payments on the Notes are economically equivalent to a combination of a non-interest-bearing bond bought by the holder and one or more options entered into between the holder and us (with one or more implicit option premiums paid over time). The discussion in this paragraph does not modify or affect the terms of the Notes or the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the Notes  as described elsewhere in this pricing supplement.We cannot predict the actual Final Level or what the market value of your Notes will be on any particular Trading Day  nor can we predict the relationship between the level of the Reference Asset and the market value of your Notes at any time prior to the Maturity Date. The actual amount that you will receive  if any  at maturity and the rate of return on the offered Notes will depend on the actual Initial Level  the Cap Level and the Maximum Payment Amount  which we will set on the Pricing Date  and the actual Final Level to be determined by the Calculation Agent as described above. Moreover  the assumptions on which the hypothetical returns are based may turn out to be inaccurate. Consequently  the amount of cash to be paid in respect of your Notes  if any  on the Maturity Date may be very different from the information reflected in the examples above.P-16Information Regarding the Reference AssetS&P 500¬Æ IndexThe S&P 500¬Æ Index (the ‚ÄúSPX‚Äù) includes a representative sample of 500 companies in leading industries of the U.S. economy.

We are not incorporating by reference the websites or any material they include in this document or any document incorporated herein by reference.The Index Sponsor intends for the SPX to provide a performance benchmark for the large-cap U.S. equity markets. Index additions and deletions are made on an as-needed basis and there is no schedule for constituent reviews. Constituent changes are announced with at least three business days advance notice. Less than three business days‚Äô notice may be given at the discretion of the S&P Index Committee. Relevant criteria for additions to the SPX that are employed by the Index Sponsor include: the company proposed for addition should have an unadjusted company market capitalization of $14.6 billion or more and a security level float-adjusted market capitalization of at least 50% of such threshold (for spin-offs  eligibility is determined using when-issued prices  if available); using composite pricing and volume  the ratio of annual dollar value traded (defined as average closing price over the period multiplied by historical volume) in the proposed constituent to float-adjusted market capitalization of that company should be at least 1.00 and the stock should trade a minimum of 250 000 shares in each of the six months leading up to the evaluation date; the company must be a U.S. company (characterized as a Form 10-K filer with its U.S. portion of fixed assets and revenues constituting a plurality of the total and with a primary listing of the common stock on the NYSE  NYSE Arca  NYSE American (formerly NYSE MKT)  Nasdaq Global Select Market  Nasdaq Select Market  Nasdaq Capital Market  Cboe BZX (formerly Bats BZX)  Cboe BYX (formerly Bats BYX)  Cboe EDGA (formerly Bats EDGA) or Cboe EDGX (formerly Bats EDGX) (each  an ‚Äúeligible exchange‚Äù)); the proposed constituent has an investable weight factor (‚ÄúIWF‚Äù) of 10% or more; the inclusion of the company will contribute to sector balance in the SPX relative to sector balance in the market in the relevant market capitalization range; financial viability (the sum of the most recent four consecutive quarters‚Äô Generally Accepted Accounting Principles earnings (net income excluding discontinued operations) should be positive as should the most recent quarter); and  for initial public offerings  the company must be traded on an eligible exchange for at least twelve months (spin-offs or in-specie distributions from existing constituents do not need to be traded on an eligible exchange for twelve months prior to their inclusion in the SPX). In addition  constituents of the S&P MidCap 400¬Æ Index and the S&P SmallCap 600¬Æ Index can be added to the SPX provided they meet the unadjusted company level market capitalization eligibility criteria for the SPX. Migrations from the S&P MidCap 400¬Æ Index or the S&P SmallCap 600¬Æ Index do not need to meet the financial viability  liquidity  or 50% of the SPX‚Äôs unadjusted company level minimum market capitalization threshold criteria. Further  constituents of the S&P Total Market Index Ex S&P Composite 1500 (which includes all eligible U.S. common equities except for those included in the SPX  the S&P MidCap 400¬Æ Index and the S&P SmallCap 600¬Æ Index) that acquire a constituent of the SPX  the S&P MidCap 400¬Æ Index or the S&P SmallCap 600¬Æ Index that do not fully meet the financial viability or IWF criteria may still be added to the SPX at the discretion of the S&P Index Committee if the S&P Index Committee determines that the addition could minimize turnover and enhance the representativeness of the SPX as a market benchmark. Certain types of organizational structures and securities are always excluded  including  but not limited to  business development companies  limited partnerships  master limited partnerships  limited liability companies  OTC bulletin board issues  closed-end funds  exchange-traded funds (‚ÄúETFs‚Äù)  exchange-traded notes  royalty trusts  tracking stocks  special purpose acquisition companies  preferred stock and convertible preferred stock  unit trusts  equity warrants  convertible bonds  investment trusts  rights and American depositary receipts. SPX constituents are deleted from the SPX when they are involved in mergers  acquisitions or significant restructurings such that they no longer meet the inclusion criteria  and when they substantially violate one or more of the addition criteria. SPX constituents that are delisted or moved to the pink sheets or the OTC bulletin board are removed  and those that experience a trading halt may be retained or removed in the Index Sponsor‚Äôs discretion. The Index Sponsor evaluates additions and deletions with a view to maintaining SPX continuity.For constituents included in the SPX prior to July 31  2017  all publicly listed multiple share class lines are included separately in the SPX  subject to  in the case of any such share class line  that share class line satisfying the liquidity and float criteria discussed above and subject to certain exceptions. It is possible that one listed share class line of a company may be included in the SPX while a second listed share class line of the same company is excluded. For companies thatP-17issue a second publicly traded share class to SPX share class holders  the newly issued share class line is considered for inclusion if the event is mandatory and the market capitalization of the distributed class is not considered to be de minimis.As of July 31  2017  companies with multiple share class lines are no longer eligible for inclusion in the SPX. Only common shares are considered when determining whether a company has a multiple share class structure. Constituents of the SPX prior to July 31  2017 with multiple share class lines will be grandfathered in and continue to be included in the SPX. If a SPX constituent reorganizes into a multiple share class line structure  that company will be reviewed for continued inclusion in the SPX at the discretion of the S&P Index Committee.Calculation of the SPXThe SPX is calculated using a base-weighted aggregative methodology. The level of the SPX on any day for which a level is published is determined by a fraction  the numerator of which is the aggregate of the market price of each SPX constituent times the number of shares of such SPX constituent  and the denominator of which is the divisor  which is described more fully below. The ‚Äúmarket value‚Äù of any SPX constituent is the product of the market price per share of that SPX constituent times the number of the then-outstanding shares of such SPX constituent that are then included in the SPX.The SPX is also sometimes called a ‚Äúbase-weighted aggregative index‚Äù because of its use of a divisor. The ‚Äúdivisor‚Äù is a value calculated by the Index Sponsor that is intended to maintain conformity in SPX levels over time and is adjusted for all changes in the SPX constituents‚Äô share capital after the ‚Äúbase date‚Äù as described below. The level of the SPX reflects the total market value of all SPX constituents relative to the SPX‚Äôs base date of 1941-43.In addition  the SPX is float-adjusted  meaning that the share counts used in calculating the SPX reflect only those shares available to investors rather than all of a company‚Äôs outstanding shares. The Index Sponsor seeks to exclude shares held by long-term  strategic shareholders concerned with the control of a company  a group that generally includes the following: officers and directors and related individuals whose holdings are publicly disclosed  private equity  venture capital  special equity firms  asset managers and insurance companies with board of director representation  publicly traded companies that hold shares in another company  holders of restricted shares (except for shares held as part of a lock-up agreement)  company-sponsored employee share plans/trusts  defined contribution plans/savings  investment plans  foundations or family trusts associated with the company  government entities at all levels (except government retirement or pension funds)  sovereign wealth funds and any individual person listed as a 5% or greater stakeholder in a company as reported in regulatory filings (collectively  ‚Äústrategic holders‚Äù). To this end  the Index Sponsor excludes all share-holdings (other than depositary banks  pension funds (including government pension and retirement funds)  mutual funds  ETF providers  investment funds  asset managers that do not have direct board of director representation (including stakeholders who may have the right to appoint a board of director member but choose not to do so  stakeholders who have exercised a right to appoint a board of director ‚Äúobserver‚Äù even if that observer is employed by the stakeholder and stakeholders who have exercised a right to appoint an independent director who is not employed by the stakeholder)  investment funds of insurance companies and independent foundations not associated with the company) with a position greater than 5% of the outstanding shares of a company from the float-adjusted share count to be used in SPX calculations.The exclusion is accomplished by calculating an IWF for each SPX constituent that is part of the numerator of the float-adjusted index fraction described above:IWF = (available float shares)/(total shares outstanding)where available float shares is defined as total shares outstanding less shares held by strategic holders. In most cases  an IWF is reported to the nearest one percentage point. For companies with multiple share class lines  a separate IWF is calculated for each share class line. In most cases  an IWF is reported to the nearest one percentage point.Maintenance of the SPXIn order to keep the SPX comparable over time the Index Sponsor engages in an index maintenance process. The SPX maintenance process involves changing the constituents as discussed above  and also involves maintaining quality assurance processes and procedures  adjusting the number of shares used to calculate the SPX  monitoring and completing the adjustments for company additions and deletions  adjusting for stock splits and stock dividends and adjusting for other corporate actions. In addition to its daily governance of indices and maintenance of the SPX methodology  at least once within any 12 month period  the S&P Index Committee reviews the SPX methodology to ensure the SPX continues to achieve the stated objective  and that the data and methodology remain effective. The S&P Index Committee may at times consult with investors  market participants  security issuers included in or potentially included in the SPX  or investment and financial experts.P-18Divisor AdjustmentsThe two types of adjustments primarily used by the Index Sponsor are divisor adjustments and adjustments to the number of shares (including float adjustments) used to calculate the SPX. Set forth below is a table of certain corporate events and their resulting effect on the divisor and the share count. If a corporate event requires an adjustment to the divisor  that event has the effect of altering the market value of the affected SPX constituent and consequently of altering the aggregate market value of the SPX constituents following the event. In order that the level of the SPX not be affected by the altered market value (which could be an increase or decrease) of the affected SPX constituent  the Index Sponsor generally derives a new divisor by dividing the post-event market value of the SPX constituents by the pre-event SPX level  which has the effect of reducing the SPX‚Äôs post-event level to the pre-event level.Changes to the Number of Shares of a ConstituentThe index maintenance process also involves tracking the changes in the number of shares included for each of the index companies. Changes as a result of mandatory events  such as mergers or acquisition driven share/IWF changes  stock splits and mandatory distributions are not subject to a minimum threshold for implementation and are implemented when the transaction occurs. At the Index Sponsor‚Äôs discretion  however  de minimis merger and acquisition changes may be accumulated and implemented with the updates made with the quarterly share updates as described below. Material share/IWF changes resulting from certain non-mandatory corporate actions follow the accelerated implementation rule. Non-material share/IWF changes are implemented quarterly.Accelerated Implementation Rule1. Public offerings. Public offerings of new company-issued shares and/or existing shares offered by selling shareholders  including block sales and spot secondaries  will be eligible for accelerated implementation treatment if the size of the event meets the materiality threshold criteria:(a) at least US $150 million  and(b) at least 5% of the pre-event total shares.In addition to the materiality threshold  public offerings must satisfy the following conditions:‚Ä¢ be underwritten.‚Ä¢ have a publicly available prospectus  offering document  or prospectus summary filed with the relevant authorities.‚Ä¢ have a publicly available confirmation from an official source that the offering has been completed.For public offerings that involve a concurrent combination of new company shares and existing shares offered by selling shareholders  both events are implemented if either of the public offerings represent at least 5% of total shares and $150 million. Any concurrent share repurchase by the affected company will also be included in the implementation.2. Dutch Auctions  self-tender offer buybacks  and split-off exchange offers. These nonmandatory corporate action types will be eligible for accelerated implementation treatment regardless of size once their results are publicly announced and verified by S&P.Exception to the Accelerated Implementation RuleFor non-mandatory corporate actions subject to the accelerated implementation rule with a size of at least US $1 billion  S&P will apply the share change  and any resulting IWF change  using the latest share and ownership information publicly available at the time of the announcement  even if the offering size is below the 5% threshold. This exception ensures that very large events are recognized in a timely manner using the latest available information.All non-mandatory events not covered by the accelerated implementation rule (including but not limited to private placements  acquisition of private companies  and conversion of non-index share lines) will be implemented quarterly coinciding with the third Friday of the third month in each calendar quarter. In addition  events that were not implemented under the accelerated implementation rule but were found to have been eligible  (e.g. due to lack of publicly available information at the time of the event) are implemented as part of a quarterly rebalancing.Announcement PolicyFor accelerated implementation  the Index Sponsor will generally provide two (2) business days‚Äô notice for all non-U.S. listed stocks and U.S. listed depositary receipts  and one (1) business days‚Äô notice for all non-depositary receipt U.S. listed stocks.IWF UpdatesAccelerated implementation for events less than $1 billion will include an adjustment to the company‚Äôs IWF only to the extent that such an IWF change helps the new float share total mimic the shares available in the offering. To minimize unnecessary turnover  these IWF changes do not need to meet any minimum threshold requirement for implementation. Any IWF change resulting in an IWF of 0.96 or greater is rounded up to 1.00 at the next annual IWF review.P-19IWF changes will only be made at the quarterly review if the change represents at least 5% of total current shares outstanding and is related to a single corporate action that did not qualify for the accelerated implementation rule  regardless if there is an associated share change.Quarterly share change events resulting from the conversion of derivative securities  acquisitions of private companies  or acquisitions of non-index companies that do not trade on a major exchange are considered to be available to investors unless there is explicit information stating that the new owner is a strategic holder.Other than the situations described above  please note that IWF changes are only made at the annual IWF review.Share UpdatesFor companies with multiple share class lines  the criteria specified under the heading ‚ÄúAccelerated Implementation Rule‚Äù above apply to each individual multiple share class line rather than total company shares.Exceptions:Any non- fully paid or non-fully settled offering such as forward sales agreements are not eligible for accelerated implementation. Share updates resulting from completion of subscription receipts terms or the settlement of forward sale agreements are updated at a future quarterly share rebalance.Rebalancing Guidelines ‚Äì Share/IWF Reference Date & Freeze PeriodA reference date  after the market close five weeks prior to the third Friday in March  June  September  and December  is the cutoff for publicly available information used for quarterly shares outstanding and IWF changes. All shares outstanding and ownership information contained in public filings and/or official sources dated on or before the reference date are included in that quarter‚Äôs update. In addition  there is a freeze period on a quarterly basis for any changes that result from the accelerated implementation rules.Pro-forma files for float-adjusted market capitalization indices are generally released after the market close on the first Friday  two weeks prior to the rebalancing effective date. Pro-forma files for capped and alternatively weighted indices are generally released after the market close on the second Friday  one week prior to the rebalancing effective date. For illustration purposes  if rebalancing pro-forma files are scheduled to be released on Friday  March 5  the share/IWF freeze period will begin after the close of trading on Tuesday  March 9 and will end after the close of trading the following Friday  March 19 (i.e. the third Friday of the rebalancing month).During the share/IWF freeze period  shares and IWFs are not changed and the accelerated implementation rule is suspended  except for mandatory corporate action events (such as merger activity  stock splits  and rights offerings). The suspension includes all changes that qualify for accelerated implementation and would typically be announced or effective during the share/IWF freeze period . At the end of the freeze period all suspended changes will be announced on the third Friday of the rebalancing month  and implemented five business days after the quarterly rebalancing effective date.Adjustments for Corporate ActionsThere is a large range of corporate actions that may affect companies included in the SPX. Certain corporate actions require the Index Sponsor to recalculate the share count or the float adjustment or to make an adjustment to the divisor to prevent the level of the SPX from changing as a result of the corporate action. This helps ensure that the movement of the SPX does not reflect the corporate actions of individual companies in the SPX.Spin-OffsAs a general policy  a spin-off security is added to the SPX on the ex-date at a price of zero (with no divisor adjustment) and will remain in the SPX for at least one trading day. The spin-off security will remain in the SPX if it meets all eligibility criteria. If the spin-off security is determined ineligible to remain in the SPX  it will generally be removed after at least one day of regular way trading (with a divisor adjustment). The weight of the spin-off being deleted is reinvested across all the SPX constituents proportionately such that the relative weights of all SPX constituents are unchanged. The net change in SPX market capitalization will cause a divisor change.Companies that are spun off from a SPX constituent do not need to meet the eligibility criteria for new constituents  but they should be considered U.S. domiciled for SPX purposes. At the discretion of the S&P Index Committee  a spin-off company may be retained in the SPX if the S&P Index Committee determines it has a total market capitalization representative of the SPX. If the spin-off company‚Äôs estimated market capitalization is below the minimum unadjusted company marketP-20capitalization for the SPX but there are other SPX constituents that have a significantly lower total market capitalization than the spin-off company  the S&P Index Committee may decide to retain the spin-off company in the SPX.Several additional types of corporate actions  and their related treatment  are listed in the table below.Corporate Action Treatment SPX constituent addition/deletion Addition SPX constituents are added at the float market capitalization weight. The net change to the SPX market capitalization causes a divisor adjustment. Deletion The weights of all SPX constituents in the SPX will proportionally change. Relative weights will stay the same. The divisor will change due to the net change in the SPX market capitalization. Change in shares outstanding Increasing (decreasing) the shares outstanding increases (decreases) the market capitalization of the SPX. The change to the SPX market capitalization causes a divisor adjustment. Split/reverse split Shares outstanding are adjusted by split ratio. Stock price is adjusted by split ratio. There is no change to the SPX market capitalization and no divisor adjustment. Change in IWF Increasing (decreasing) the IWF increases (decreases) the market capitalization of the index. A net change to the SPX market capitalization causes a divisor adjustment. Ordinary dividend When a company pays an ordinary cash dividend  the SPX does not make any adjustments to the price or shares of the stock. As a result there are no divisor adjustments to the SPX. Special dividend The stock price is adjusted by the amount of the special dividend. The net change to the SPX market capitalization causes a divisor adjustment. Rights Offering All rights offerings that are in-the-money on the ex-date are applied under the assumption the rights are fully subscribed. The stock price is adjusted by the value of the rights and the shares outstanding are increased by the rights ratio. The net change in market capitalization causes a divisor adjustment.Any company that is removed from the SPX  the S&P MidCap 400¬Æ Index or the S&P SmallCap 600¬Æ Index must wait a minimum of one year from its removal date before being reconsidered as a replacement candidate for the SPX.Recalculation PolicyThe Index Sponsor reserves the right to recalculate and republish the SPX at its discretion in the event one of the following issues has occurred: (1) incorrect or revised closing price of one or more constituent securities; (2) missed or misapplied corporate action; (3) incorrect application of SPX methodology; (4) late announcement of a corporate action; or (5) incorrect calculation or data entry error. The decision to recalculate the SPX is made at the discretion of the index manager and/or index committee  as further discussed below. The potential market impact or disruption resulting from a recalculation is considered when making any such decision. In the event of an incorrect closing price  a missed or misapplied corporateP-21action  a late announcement of a corporate action   or an incorrect calculation or data entry error that is discovered within two trading days of its occurrence  generally the SPX is recalculated. In the event any such event is discovered beyond the two trading day period  the index committee shall decide whether the SPX should be recalculated. In the event of an incorrect application of the methodology that results in the incorrect composition and/or weighting of SPX constituents  the index committee shall determine whether or not to recalculate the SPX following specified guidelines. In the event that the SPX is recalculated  it shall be done within a reasonable timeframe following the detection and review of the issue.Calculations and Pricing DisruptionsClosing levels for the SPX are calculated by the Index Sponsor based on the closing price of the individual constituents of the SPX as set by their primary exchange. Closing prices are received by the Index Sponsor from one of its third party vendors and verified by comparing them with prices from an alternative vendor. The vendors receive the closing price from the primary exchanges. Real-time intraday prices are calculated similarly without a second verification. Official end-of-day calculations are based on each stock‚Äôs primary market closing price. Prices used for the calculation of real time SPX levels are based on the ‚ÄúConsolidated Tape‚Äù. The Consolidated Tape is an aggregation of trades for each constituent over all regional exchanges and trading venues and includes the primary exchange. If there is a failure or interruption on one or more exchanges  real-time calculations will continue as long as the ‚ÄúConsolidated Tape‚Äù is operational.If an interruption is not resolved prior to the market close  official closing prices will be determined by following the hierarchy set out in NYSE Rule 123C. A notice is published on the Index Sponsor website at spdji.com indicating any changes to the prices used in SPX calculations. In extreme circumstances  the Index Sponsor may decide to delay SPX adjustments or not publish the SPX. Real-time indices are not restated.Unexpected Exchange ClosuresAn unexpected market/exchange closure occurs when a market/exchange fully or partially fails to open or trading is temporarily halted. This can apply to a single exchange or to a market as a whole  when all of the primary exchanges are closed and/or not trading. Unexpected market/exchange closures are usually due to unforeseen circumstances  such as natural disasters  inclement weather  outages  or other events.To a large degree  the Index Sponsor is dependent on the exchanges to provide guidance in the event of an unexpected exchange closure. The Index Sponsor‚Äôs decision making is dependent on exchange guidance regarding pricing and mandatory corporate actions.NYSE Rule 123C provides closing contingency procedures for determining an official closing price for listed securities if the exchange is unable to conduct a closing transaction in one or more securities due to a system or technical issue.3:00 PM ET is the deadline for an exchange to determine its plan of action regarding an outage scenario. As such  the Index Sponsor also uses 3:00 PM ET as the cutoff.If all major exchanges fail to open or unexpectedly halt trading intraday due to unforeseen circumstances  the Index Sponsor will take the following actions:Market Disruption Prior to Open of Trading:(i) If all exchanges indicate that trading will not open for a given day  the Index Sponsor will treat the day as an unscheduled market holiday. The decision will be communicated to clients as soon as possible through the normal channels. Indices containing multiple markets will be calculated as normal  provided that at least one market is open that day. Indices which only contain closed markets will not be calculated.(ii) If exchanges indicate that trading  although delayed  will open for a given day  the Index Sponsor will begin index calculation when the exchanges open.Market Disruption Intraday:(i) If exchanges indicate that trading will not resume for a given day  the SPX level will be calculated using prices determined by the exchanges based on NYSE Rule 123C. Intraday SPX levels will continue to use the last traded composite price until the primary exchange publishes official closing prices.License AgreementS&P¬Æ is a registered trademark of Standard & Poor‚Äôs Financial Services LLC and Dow Jones¬Æ is a registered trademark of Dow Jones Trademark Holdings LLC (‚ÄúDow Jones‚Äù).

No statutory  regulatory  judicial or administrative authority directly discusses how the Notes should be treated for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Some of these tax consequences are summarized below  but we urge you to read the more detailed discussion under ‚ÄúMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences‚Äù in the product supplement and discuss the tax consequences of your particular situation with your tax advisor. This discussion is based upon the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the ‚ÄúCode‚Äù)  final  temporary and proposed U.S. Department of the Treasury (the ‚ÄúTreasury‚Äù) regulations  rulings and decisions  in each case  as available and in effect as of the date hereof  all of which are subject to change  possibly with retroactive effect. Tax consequences under state  local and non-U.S. laws are not addressed herein. No ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the ‚ÄúIRS‚Äù) has been sought as to the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in the Notes  and the following discussion is not binding on the IRS.U.S. Tax Treatment. Pursuant to the terms of the Notes  TD and you agree  in the absence of a statutory or regulatory change or an administrative determination or judicial ruling to the contrary  to characterize your Notes as prepaid derivative contracts with respect to the Reference Asset. If your Notes are so treated  you should generally recognize gain or loss upon the taxable disposition of your Notes in an amount equal to the difference between the amount you receive at such time and the amount you paid for your Notes. Such gain or loss should generally be long-term capital gain or loss if you have held your Notes for more than one year (otherwise such gain or loss should be short-term capital gain or loss if held for one year or less). The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.Based on certain factual representations received from us  our special U.S. tax counsel  Fried  Frank  Harris  Shriver & Jacobson LLP  is of the opinion that it would be reasonable to treat your Notes in the manner described above. However  because there is no authority that specifically addresses the tax treatment of the Notes  it is possible that your Notes could alternatively be treated for tax purposes as a single contingent payment debt instrument  or pursuant to some other characterization  such that the timing and character of your income from the Notes could differ materially and adversely from the treatment described above  as described further under ‚ÄúMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences ‚Äî Alternative Treatments‚Äù in the product supplement.Except to the extent otherwise required by law  TD intends to treat your Notes for U.S. federal income tax purposes in accordance with the treatment described above and under ‚ÄúMaterial U.S. Federal Income Tax Consequences‚Äù of the product supplement  unless and until such time as the Treasury and the IRS determine that some other treatment is more appropriate.Notice 2008-2. In 2007  the IRS released a notice that may affect the taxation of holders of the Notes. According to Notice 2008-2  the IRS and the Treasury are actively considering whether a holder of an instrument such as the Notes should be required to accrue ordinary income on a current basis. It is not possible to determine what guidance they will ultimately issue  if any. It is possible  however  that under such guidance  holders of the Notes will ultimately be required to accrue income currently and this could be applied on a retroactive basis. The IRS and the Treasury are also considering other relevant issues  including whether additional gain or loss from such instruments should be treated as ordinary or capital  whether non-U.S. holders of such instruments should be subject to withholding tax on any deemed income accruals  and whether the special ‚Äúconstructive ownership rules‚Äù of Section 1260 of the Code should be applied to such instruments. Both U.S. and non-U.S. holders are urged to consult their tax advisors concerning the significance  and the potential impact  of the above considerations on their investments in the Notes.Medicare Tax on Net Investment Income. U.S. holders that are individuals  estates or certain trusts are subject to an additional 3.8% tax on all or a portion of their ‚Äúnet investment income ‚Äù or ‚Äúundistributed net investment income‚Äù in the case of an estate or trust  which may include any income or gain realized with respect to the Notes  to the extent of their net investment income or undistributed net investment income (as the case may be) that when added to their other modified adjusted gross income  exceeds $200 000 for an unmarried individual  $250 000 for a married taxpayer filing a joint return (or a surviving spouse)  $125 000 for a married individual filing a separate return or the dollar amount at which the highest tax bracket begins for an estate or trust. The 3.8% Medicare tax is determined in a different manner than the regular income tax. U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors as to the consequences of the 3.8% Medicare tax.Specified Foreign Financial Assets. U.S. holders may be subject to reporting obligations with respect to their Notes if they do not hold their Notes in an account maintained by a financial institution and the aggregate value of their Notes and certain other ‚Äúspecified foreign financial assets‚Äù (applying certain attribution rules) exceeds an applicable threshold. Significant penalties can apply if a U.S. holder is required to disclose its Notes and fails to do so.P-25Non-U.S. Holders. If you are a non-U.S. holder  subject to Section 871(m) of the Code and FATCA  as discussed below  you should generally not be subject to U.S. withholding tax with respect to payments on your Notes or to generally applicable information reporting and backup withholding requirements with respect to payments on your Notes if you comply with certain certification and identification requirements as to your non-U.S. status including providing us (and/or the applicable withholding agent) a properly executed and fully completed applicable IRS Form W-8. Subject to Section 897 of the Code and Section 871(m) of the Code  as discussed below  gain realized from the taxable disposition of the Notes generally should not be subject to U.S. tax unless (i) such gain is effectively connected with a trade or business conducted by you in the U.S.  (ii) you are a non-resident alien individual and are present in the U.S. for 183 days or more during the taxable year of such taxable disposition and certain other conditions are satisfied or (iii) you have certain other present or former connections with the U.S.Section 897. We will not attempt to ascertain whether any Reference Asset Constituent Issuer would be treated as a ‚ÄúUnited States real property holding corporation‚Äù (a ‚ÄúUSRPHC‚Äù) within the meaning of Section 897 of the Code. We also have not attempted to determine whether the Notes should be treated as ‚ÄúUnited States real property interests‚Äù (‚ÄúUSRPI‚Äù) as defined in Section 897 of the Code. If any such entity and the Notes were so treated  certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences could possibly apply  including subjecting any gain to a non-U.S. holder in respect of a Note upon a taxable disposition of the Note to U.S. federal income tax on a net basis  and the proceeds from such a taxable disposition to a 15% withholding tax. Non-U.S. holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the potential treatment of any such entity as a USRPHC and the Notes as USRPI.Section 871(m).

Nomura is the structuring agent and underwriter  and Hitachi will monitor the carbon emissions prevented by renewable energy generation activities.Nomura and Nomura Research Institute started working on a blockchain bond solution in 2019  incorporating BOOSTRY later that year. SBI bought a 10% stake in 2020. The company open-sourced its ‚Äòibet‚Äô software solution for bonds.JPX plans to have a public security token offering (STO)  which JPX claims is the first digital green bond for wholesale trading in Japan.The bonds will be issued on the ‚ÄòIbet for Fin‚Äô network  a consortium network founded by BOOSTRY  Nomura Securities  SMBC Nikko Securities and SBI Securities. The network acts as the bond registry  which means the Japan Securities Depository Center will not be used as the central security depository (CSD).Data regarding the CO2 emission reductions will also be logged on the blockchain. This lays the groundwork for a future in which a bond interest rate might vary depending on whether the bond reaches a sustainability target.Hitachi will automatically measure the volume of electricity generated at the renewable plants which receive the funds and convert this to CO2 emission reduction measurements. These readings are accessible to investors at any time  in contrast to the conventional annual reports.The funds raised will be allocated to biomass and solar power generation.JPX has been ramping up its digital activities of late. Last year it announced the planned April 2022 launch of an innovation subsidiary  JPX Market Innovation & Research  which is participating in this green bond initiative. Earlier this month  as part of its medium term strategy  it said it planned to launch a digital securities market for security tokens by April 2025. In February  it mentioned it was exploring green bonds and  the same month  invested in Digital Asset Markets  which has been involved in the issuance of gold-backed tokens with Mitsui.The news also signals yet another stock exchange win for Digital Asset  as Boostry‚Äôs smart contracts use the DAML language.

(EURONEXT: HEIO; OTCQX: HKHHY) publishes its trading update for the first quarter of 2022.Key HighlightsRevenue growth 35.9%Net revenue (beia) organic growth 24.9%; per hectolitre 18.3%Beer volume 5.2% organic growth; premium volume 6.3% organicallyHeineken¬Æ volume growth 12.9%Outlook for full year 2022 unchangedHeineken Holding N.V. engages in no activities other than its participating interest in Heineken N.V. and the management or supervision of and provision of services to that company.Financial SummaryRevenue for the first quarter of 2022 was ‚Ç¨6 989 million (2021: ‚Ç¨5 145 million). Net revenue (beia) was ‚Ç¨5 753 million and increased by 24.9% organically  with total consolidated volume growing by 5.7% and net revenue (beia) per hectolitre up 18.3%. The latter was driven by assertive pricing and premiumisation across all regions  as well as a positive channel mix effect  particularly in Europe. Currency translation positively impacted net revenue (beia) by ‚Ç¨186 million or 4.3%  mainly driven by the Brazilian Real  the Mexican Peso and the Vietnamese Dong. The consolidation of United Breweries Limited (UBL) in India positively impacted net revenue (beia) by ‚Ç¨200 million or 4.6%.Revenue1 (in ‚Ç¨ million or %) 1Q22 Total growth Organic growth 1Q21 Revenue (IFRS) 6 989 35.9% 5 145 Net revenue (beia) 5 753 24.9% 4 307Beer volume grew 5.2% organically versus last year and came 2.8% ahead of 2019 on an organic basis. All regions contributed to the growth  especially Europe  given the low base last year due to the COVID-related restrictions in the on-trade. Asia Pacific returned to growth following the lockdown in the second part of last year. The Americas region recorded modest growth whilst Africa  Middle East & Eastern Europe continued its positive momentum.Beer volume (in mhl or %) 1Q22 Organic growth 1Q21 Heineken N.V. 56.4 5.2% 50.3Premium beer volume grew 6.3%  outperforming the portfolio in the majority of HEINEKEN's markets in the first three months of 2022. HEINEKEN's growth in premium is driven by Heineken¬Æ  which grew 12.9% in volume  significantly outperforming the total beer market and ahead of 2019 by close to one-third. Volume grew double-digits across all regions and in more than 45 markets. Growth was mainly driven by Brazil  China  the Netherlands  Spain  Ireland  Italy  the UK  Portugal  Nigeria  and the United Arab Emirates. Heineken¬Æ 0.0 grew in the twenties with strong momentum in Brazil  Mexico  the USA  Chile and South Korea. Heineken¬Æ Silver continued its strong growth in Vietnam and China.HEINEKEN also launched Heineken¬Æ Silver in Europe  reflecting its increased focus on consumers who are looking for more differentiated taste profiles and to drive further premiumisation. HEINEKEN kicked off in March with the first virtual beer launch in the Metaverse and in April HEINEKEN entered the next phase with the real launch  making Heineken¬Æ Silver available all over Europe. Overall  Heineken¬Æ Silver grew more than eighty percent.Story continuesHeineken¬Æ volume (in mhl or %) 1Q22 Organic growth Heineken N.V. 11.9 12.9%Reported Net Profit of Heineken N.V.The reported net profit of Heineken N.V. for the first three months of 2022 was ‚Ç¨417 million (2021: ‚Ç¨168 million). The net profit growth was driven by the top-line growth  with the partial recovery of the on-trade in Europe as the main factor. The reported net profit does not include the announced impairment and other non-cash exceptional charges of approximately ‚Ç¨0.4 billion related to the decision to transfer the ownership of the business in Russia. A further update will follow with the half-year results.Business OutlookThe war in Ukraine has brought additional uncertainty to the global economic outlook and commodity markets. HEINEKEN expects mounting inflationary pressures to impact household disposable income and a consequent risk to beer consumption later in the year. While HEINEKEN benefits from hedges taken in 2021  further cost pressures are emerging from rising input costs  supply chain challenges  and from the decision to leave Russia. HEINEKEN will take additional actions and maintain its guidance of a stable to modest sequential improvement in operating profit margin (beia) in 2022.Translational Currency Calculated ImpactBased on the impact to date  and applying spot rates of 14 April 2022 to the 2021 financial results as a baseline for the remainder of the year  HEINEKEN calculates a positive currency translational impact of approximately ‚Ç¨1 150 million in net revenue (beia)  ‚Ç¨160 million at operating profit (beia) and ‚Ç¨100 million at net profit (beia).Reconciliation of non-GAAP measuresIn the internal management reports  HEINEKEN uses the measure of net revenue (beia).Reconciliation net revenue (beia) In millions of ‚Ç¨ 1Q22 1Q21 Revenue (IFRS) 6 989 5 145 Excise tax expense (1 236) (837) Net revenue 5 753 4 307 Exceptional items included in net revenue ‚Äî (1) Net revenue (beia) 5 753 4 307Note: due to rounding  this table will not always castEnquiriesMedia Heineken Holding N.V.

For Q2 at constant currencies  we expect revenue of ‚Ç¨540-570 million  in line with our previous forecast for a further sequential increase in Q2. Based on the current visibility  we expect revenue in the second half of 2022 to be clearly higher than the level in the first half  to a certain extent depending on the pace of improvement in supply chain conditions.

This launch follows and contributes to Budweiser parent company AB InBev's recently announced ambition to achieve net zero across its value chain by 2040.Budweiser launches The Energy Collective to help power the world with renewable electricityTo date  the producers of Budweiser have converted more than 2 000 local pubs in Brazil and Ireland to renewable electricity. In Brazil  renewable electricity is supplied by Lemon Energy to business owners which has already reduced carbon dioxide emissions by more than 291 tonnes annually. The Energy Collective's ambition for Brazil is to have 250 000 locations converted to renewable electricity by 2025  estimated to save 36 375 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) per year  which is equivalent to removing 7 991 cars from the road.In 2015  Budweiser set out to brew every beer with 100% renewable electricity by 2025  taking the first step to a brighter future. Having already reached this goal in many markets  Budweiser is unveiling The Energy Collective to help connect bars  music venues and stadiums around the world to renewable energy sources. Budweiser's reach and resources  combined with its desire to make a positive impact on the planet  led to the decision to brew all beers with renewable electricity and the subsequent launch of The Energy Collective.""Consumers crave a better world where the things they love are sustainable. The Energy Collective is helping facilitate the powering of things people love with renewable electricity  while helping close the gap between what consumers want and what companies can do "" said Todd Allen  Vice President Global Marketing at Budweiser. ""We're just getting started. Our bold dream is that every bar  venue and stadium in the world that serves Budweiser would be powered by renewable electricity.""Story continuesBudweiser supports AB InBev's ambition to achieve net zero across its value chain by 2040. As part of this  The Energy Collective will help enable pub owners to reduce emissions by converting to 100% renewable electricity  and help facilitate renewable electricity to those who may not have access at a more affordable rate.""When Budweiser decided to brew beer with renewable electricity  we knew there was so much more we could be doing in the renewable space as a global brand. Launching The Energy Collective allows us to help businesses around the world  leveraging our scale to enable our customers to obtain more sustainable power at more affordable rates "" said Ezgi Barcenas  Chief Sustainability Officer at AB InBev.Energy bills are often one of the highest costs for bars. The Energy Collective  in partnership with a local energy provider  could offer cost savings while providing access to renewable energy infrastructure. The Energy Collective will help advance Budweiser's mission of powering the things consumers love with renewable electricity.""By being connected to renewable electricity via local providers through The Energy Collective  I've already been able to reduce my monthly electricity costs by about 10 percent "" said Will Morgan  General Manager of Jerry Flannery's in Limerick  Ireland. ""It's also been a conversation starter with many of my customers to discuss the importance of renewable electricity and creating a brighter future for us all.""The Energy Collective is now facilitating connection to renewable electricity in select countries including Ireland and Brazil and will be piloting the program in Colombia in 2022.

This was mainly driven by low occupancy performance in oil storage in the Netherlands as a result of continued soft storage markets for oil.Cost level for Q1 2022 amounted to EUR 165 million (Q1 2021: EUR 151 million) mainly related to increases in utility prices  currency exchange movements and including costs for delivered growth projects and new business development efforts.EBIT of EUR 126 million (Q1 2021: EUR 121 million)  increased due to positive business performance  positive currency translation effect  partially offset by higher depreciation.Net profit attributable to holders of ordinary shares of EUR 75 million (Q1 2021: EUR 73 million).Cash Flow From Operations (excluding derivatives) of EUR 169 million increased compared to Q1 2021 EUR 140 million driven by business performance and receipt of dividends from joint ventures slightly offset by working capital movements.Return on capital employed (ROCE) of 9.1% decreased from Q1 2021: ROCE of 10.3% as a result of higher capital employed from new capacity and investments in sustaining and IT capex.The senior net debt: EBITDA ratio is 2.70 (Q4 2021: 2.93) mainly due to positive EBITDA performance and receipt of joint venture dividends.Portfolio items:Story continuesVopak has signed an agreement subject to customary closing conditions for the divestment of 4 Canadian terminals located in Hamilton  Montreal East and West and Quebec City. Proceeds of around EUR 116 million are expected and will be used for debt repayments. We expect a limited exceptional divestment result upon closing.Following the outcome of the previously announced strategic review of our assets in Australia  Vopak decided to continue to operate these terminals. The Australian market is solid and will continue to support the cash flow generation of Vopak.Gate terminal  our joint venture with Gasunie for LNG in Rotterdam  continues to play a key role in the security of natural gas supplies in Northwest Europe supplying the equivalent of 25% of the Netherlands‚Äô gas needs. One of our customers  Uniper  will increase its capacity rights by 1 BCM as of October 2022. Following last year's announcement on expansion of send out capacity which will become available in October 2024  it is currently also being investigated if  in the short term  the send out capacity of the Gate terminal can be expanded further.Delivery of new capacity of 44 500 cbm during Q1 2022 in Altamira and Deer Park.Exceptional items Q1 2022:There were no exceptional items in Q1 2022.Subsequent events:Vopak will be working together with partners Gasunie and HES International to develop an import terminal for green ammonia as a hydrogen carrier in Rotterdam  the Netherlands. The companies have signed a cooperation agreement which is a response to growing global demand for import and storage of green energy. In Q2 2022  work will be started on the basic design of the import terminal. The terminal  which will operate on the Maasvlakte under the name ACE Terminal  is planned to be operational from 2026.Looking ahead:Vopak is on track with the prior announced target of EUR 110 million to EUR 125 million EBITDA contribution in 2023 from growth projects.We expect to manage the 2022 cost base including additional cost for new growth projects around EUR 645 million  subject to currency exchange and utilities price movements. In Q1 2022 there was upward pressure on currency exchange and utilities price movements.In 2022  growth investments are expected to be below EUR 300 million. The allocation of these investments will be through existing committed projects  new business development and pre-FID (Final Investment Decision) feasibility studies in new energies including hydrogen.For the period 2020-2022  Vopak expects to be at the higher end of the range EUR 750 million to EUR 850 million for sustaining and service improvement capex  subject to additional discretionary decisions  policy changes and regulatory requirements.As part of the strategic direction for the period 2020-2022  Vopak indicated to invest annually up to a maximum of EUR 45 million in IT capex  to complete Vopak‚Äôs digital terminal management system. We expect to complete the roll out of our Vopak Terminal System to our terminal network and joint ventures by the end of 2023.I mpact of the Russia-Ukraine war:The Russian invasion of Ukraine is a major humanitarian drama and we sympathize with the people who are now suffering from the violence of war. Vopak is monitoring the situation closely and is fully committed to adhere to relevant sanctions laws and regulations. At the moment  restrictions under applicable EU sanctions are in general exempted in relation to the import of energy products into the EU. As governments try to ensure energy security and affordability  Vopak follows applicable government regulations with regard to energy imports from Russia.The Russia-Ukraine war and the international sanction regimes make the market situation volatile and uncertain. Vopak‚Äôs direct exposure is assessed to be limited. There is  however  an indirect exposure through factors such as utility prices  inflation  market conditions and exchange rates.Impact of Covid-19 pandemic in 2022 :The pandemic spread of Covid-19 remains an impactful event in several regions around the world  such as recently China. Our first priority in the Covid-19 response continues to be to protect the health and well-being of our people  their families and the communities in which we operate. Also in times of crisis  Vopak plays an important role within society by storing vital products with care.Financial calendar20 April 2022 Annual General Meeting22 April 2022 Ex-dividend quotation25 April 2022 Dividend record date28 April 2022 Dividend payment date12 May 2022 Capital Markets Day27 July 2022 Publication of 2022 half-year results11 November 2022 Publication of 2022 third-quarter interim updateDisclaimerAny statement  presentation or other information contained herein that relates to future events  goals or conditions is  or should be considered  a forward-looking statement.Although Vopak believes these forward-looking statements are reasonable  based on the information available to Vopak on the date such statements are made  such statements are not guarantees of future performance and readers are cautioned against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

The only way to go to the event was with the shuttles provided by Revolve ‚Äî guests were not allowed to arrive by any other means of transportation.‚ÄúAs the festival was reaching capacity late Saturday afternoon  shuttle access to the venue was limited in order to remain in compliance with safety requirements causing longer wait times for entry and resulting in some guests not being able to attend the festival ‚Äù the statement continued. ‚ÄúThe safety of our guests is of the utmost importance to us and we will always make that a priority.‚ÄùIt continued  ‚ÄúWe sincerely apologize to all the guests who were impacted. We always strive to provide a great experience and we promise to do better.‚ÄùIn Bishop‚Äôs TikTok  she and her friend discuss how the logistics of the event were reminiscent of the notorious Fyre Festival from 2017  in which guests were stranded in the Bahamas without proper accommodations or food when they thought they were attending a luxurious and exclusive music festival hosted by Billy McFarland and Ja Rule.The invite-only Revolve Festival was held on the first weekend of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and produced in collaboration with The h.wood Group on April 16 and 17. ‚Äî CONCHITA WIDJOJOBLUE SUMMER: British department store Selfridges is teaming with Jacquemus on a takeover project titled ‚ÄúLe Bleu‚Äù ahead of the summer.From May 3  the retailer‚Äôs The Corner Shop space on Oxford Street will be turned into a surrealist retail concept inspired by Simon Porte Jacquemus‚Äô own bathroom.The space will offer the brand‚Äôs bestselling Chiquito and Bambino bags in exclusive colorways; an exclusive range of hoodies  T-shirts and towels; the brand‚Äôs photography book  ‚ÄúJacquemus‚Äôs Je T‚Äôaime ‚Äù and pieces from the Le Splash ready-to-wear collection.With the project  the designer said he wants to ‚Äúcreate a visual and sensorial experience inspired by casual  everyday life places and play with the color blue and the concept of water  and to ‚Äúplay with the proportions of all the bathroom accessories and make them in a very pop and disproportional way.‚ÄùOn top of taking over the pop-up space  Jacquemus will be the first fashion brand to take over the Selfridges Mews  which is located behind the store where the Christmas market is traditionally held  for the brand‚Äôs Jacquemus 24/24 vending machine installation.

3264,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-faces-urgency-avoid-default-230000354.html,Russia Faces New Urgency to Dodge Default  Avoid Wall Street,(Bloomberg) -- Russia‚Äôs race to avoid default just escalated.Most Read from BloombergKremlin Insiders Alarmed Over Growing Toll of Putin‚Äôs War in...,(Bloomberg) -- Russia‚Äôs race to avoid default just escalated.Most Read from BloombergThe country has been inching closer after JPMorgan Chase & Co.  under orders from the U.S. Department of the Treasury  halted interest payments the country owed on two dollar-denominated bonds in recent weeks. The move forced the Russian central bank to make the payments in rubles instead and left it scrambling for ways to sidestep JPMorgan and rival Citigroup Inc. to make good on its debt.The situation got more serious on Wednesday: The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee said the ruble payment was a potential default  fueling growing consensus that Russia may have reneged on its debt obligations. The CDDC‚Äôs ruling  which doesn‚Äôt directly impact the debt  could trigger payment of credit-default swaps if Russia doesn‚Äôt pay bondholders in dollars before the debt‚Äôs grace period ends on May 4. The nation could still avert a default if it pays bondholders in dollars before that period ends.Russia ‚Äúis not at threat of default‚Äù and ‚Äúhas enough financial resources ‚Äù central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Thursday.The country is exploring ways to reroute payments through domestic institutions as well as its own clearing agent. But it remains unclear if the efforts stand any chance of success and whether the moves would even help the country avoid default.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no clarity about any of this in the language‚Äù of the bond documents  Mitu Gulati  a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law  said in an interview. ‚ÄúSome judge would presumably have to decide all of this.‚ÄùOne option being considered is replacing the foreign banks acting as correspondent banks and paying agents on foreign-debt deals with the Central Bank of Russia  according to the Russian newspaper Vedomosti. A correspondent bank performs basic treasury services and manages foreign exchange for clients  while a paying-agent bank handles housekeeping on bonds  collecting interest from issuers and helping distribute it to investors.Story continuesUnder this scenario  payments to bondholders would progress to the Central Bank of Russia instead of the foreign correspondent bank and paying agent. They would then move to Russia‚Äôs domestic clearing agent  the National Settlement Depository. From there  the money would end up with local bondholders or in specially created ‚ÄúType C‚Äù accounts for bondholders from so-called hostile nations  like the U.S.For Russia  relying on its own domestic clearing agent would also allow it to sidestep foreign rivals that have held up payments to Russian investors. Euroclear and Clearstream  which process payments as central securities depositories  have blocked accounts the national Russian depository has with them  leaving payments to local bondholders in limbo.Russia‚Äôs big-business lobby  the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs  pitched a similar proposal for corporate borrowers as part of the group‚Äôs plan to avoid a wave of cross-defaults and foreign-asset freezes. In their pitch  nonresidents would receive payments for the bonds in special foreign-currency accounts with Russian banks  along with the right to sell the notes to the finance ministry or its agent.The move seeks to help a bevy of Russian companies that have been forced into technical default as their interest payments get held up in the web of foreign banks‚Äô due-diligence processes. Even Russian entities not subject to U.S. penalties have run into delays: Citigroup  for instance  ordered Severstal PJSC to seek a special waiver from the U.S. Treasury Department before it would process the steelmaker‚Äôs interest payment.Citigroup‚Äôs action -- which came after the Treasury issued a blocked-pending-investigation order  or BPI -- meant Severstal ran out of time to pay interest on the dollar debt. Representatives for Citigroup and Severstal declined to comment while the Treasury didn‚Äôt immediately respond to requests for comment.State-controlled lender VTB gave investors a glimpse into how these scenarios could work when it paid coupons on a dollar-denominated eurobond in rubles  Vedomosti reported on Wednesday. Investors from Russia and ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù nations received funds in their ruble accounts  while Russian currency was transferred to special ‚ÄúC‚Äù accounts for residents of hostile countries  the newspaper said.Still  switching paying agents likely won‚Äôt be easy: It requires agreement from a majority of creditors and  in some cases  bond documents require borrowers to give investors months of notice before they could make such a change.‚ÄòSelective Default‚ÄôIt‚Äôs also not clear that paying out in rubles would even help Russia or large Russian corporations avoid default. The country‚Äôs move to pay its sovereign dollar bonds maturing in 2022 and 2042 in rubles  for instance  resulted in S&P Global Ratings cutting Russia‚Äôs unsolicited foreign currency issuer credit ratings to ‚Äúselective default.‚Äù‚ÄúAlthough the default could be remedied under a 30-day grace period allowed under the terms and conditions of the bonds  we don‚Äôt expect that investors will be able to convert those ruble payments into dollars equivalent to the originally due amounts  or that the government will convert those payments within that grace period ‚Äù S&P said.But Gulati  who focuses on sovereign debt restructuring  said Russia‚Äôs bond documents do include a currency indemnity provision that appears to allow Russia to discharge its debt by paying in rubles  so long as the recipient can use those rubles to buy a sufficient number of dollars.‚ÄúBoiled down  the clause seems to say that payment in a different currency can constitute a ‚Äòdischarge ‚Äô so long as the recipient can use those rubles to buy a sufficient number of dollars ‚Äù Gulati said in a post on his blog. ‚ÄúThat seems to mean that Russia can discharge its obligations by paying in rubles.‚ÄùUnder a second proposal recommended by the Russian government  borrowers would make interest payments to investors through separate channels depending on where an investor is based. Payments to foreign holders would be handled by a foreign payment agent  though that entity could run into similar restrictions. Russian holders would get their funds via domestic institutions.The Russian government subcommittee that put forward the plan also recommended using rubles to buy back eurobonds from Russian investors as an alternative  a move Russia already made with a $2 billion bond that matured on Apr. 4.The stalled coupon payments -- along with a bevy of others that are linked to debt from Russia‚Äôs biggest companies -- have thrust the normally staid back office of Wall Street into the spotlight. It also underscores the quagmire Wall Street‚Äôs biggest banks have found themselves in as de facto enforcers of U.S. President Joe Biden‚Äôs sanctions  an outcome they‚Äôd anticipated since Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine first began.‚ÄúWe are in continuous communication with the U.S. government and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime ‚Äù Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser told analysts on a conference call last week. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine.‚Äù(Updates with comments from Russia‚Äôs central bank governor in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek¬©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.02,0.53,0.45,mixed,0.04,0.15,0.81,True,English,"['New Urgency', 'Dodge Default', 'Wall Street', 'Russia', 'unsolicited foreign currency issuer credit ratings', 'The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee', 'central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina', 'S&P Global Ratings', 'foreign banks‚Äô due-diligence processes', 'U.S. Treasury Department', 'U.S. Department', 'U.S. penalties', 'enough financial resources', 'National Settlement Depository', 'central securities depositories', 'State-controlled lender VTB', 'Type C‚Äù accounts', 'national Russian depository', 'large Russian corporations', 'foreign correspondent bank', 'special foreign-currency accounts', 'special ‚ÄúC‚Äù accounts', 'Russian central bank', 'basic treasury services', 'domestic clearing agent', 'rival Citigroup Inc.', '30-day grace period', 'two dollar-denominated bonds', 'sovereign dollar bonds', 'Russian currency', 'The CDDC', 'foreign exchange', 'foreign rivals', 'correspondent banks', 'Russian banks', 'paying-agent bank', 'domestic institutions', 'special waiver', 'dollar-denominated eurobond', 'ruble accounts', 'Russian companies', 'Russian entities', 'paying agent', 'recent weeks', 'growing consensus', 'credit-default swaps', 'bond documents', 'Mitu Gulati', 'Virginia School', 'One option', 'foreign-debt deals', 'hostile nations', 'big-business lobby', 'similar proposal', 'foreign-asset freezes', 'finance ministry', 'pending-investigation order', 'friendly‚Äù nations', 'hostile countries', 'dollar debt', 'Russian newspaper', 'ruble payment', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'Russian investors', 'corporate borrowers', 'potential default', 'debt obligations', 'technical default', 'Selective Default', 'local bondholders', 'Severstal PJSC', 'interest payment', 'agents', 'payments', 'Bloomberg', 'country', 'Co.', 'orders', 'move', 'rubles', 'ways', 'situation', 'Wednesday', 'ruling', 'dollars', 'May', 'threat', 'Thursday', 'efforts', 'chance', 'success', 'clarity', 'language', 'professor', 'University', 'Law', 'interview', 'judge', 'Vedomosti', 'clients', 'housekeeping', 'issuers', 'Story', 'scenario', 'money', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'limbo', 'Union', 'Industrialists', 'Entrepreneurs', 'plan', 'wave', 'cross-defaults', 'pitch', 'nonresidents', 'right', 'notes', 'bevy', 'web', 'delays', 'instance', 'steelmaker', 'action', 'BPI', 'time', 'Representatives', 'requests', 'comment', 'glimpse', 'coupons', 'funds', 'agreement', 'majority', 'creditors', 'cases', 'months', 'notice', 'terms', 'conditions']",2022-04-21,2022-04-21,finance.yahoo.com

The conventional T-Bonds will be denominated in UAE dirhams to develop the local bonds debt market and ultimately  the aim is to help develop the mid-term yield curve. The Securities will be issued initially in 2/3/5 year tenures; followed by a 10-year bond at a later date.These securities will be auctioned and traded through Bloomberg‚Äôs Auction System and settled through a local platform  compliant with international standards  built and operated by Euroclear Bank.The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of the UAE worked with relevant government entities and international financial bodies to ensure best practice was followed when structuring the T-Bonds.The Ministry has published a robust Primary Dealers code and on boarded six banks namely ADCB  Emirates NBD  FAB  HSBC  Mashreq and Standard Chartered as Primary Dealers to participate in the T-Bonds primary market auction and to actively develop the secondary market.Commenting on the announcement of T-Bonds issuance  His Excellency Mohamed Bin Hadi Al Hussaini  Minister of State for Financial Affairs  emphasized that the issuance of the United Arab Emirates Dirham-denominated T-Bond tranches followed the government‚Äôs directives and aligned with international best practice when he said: ‚ÄúIssuing the T-Bonds in local currency will contribute to building a local currency bond market  diversifying financing resources  boosting the local financial and banking sector  as well as providing safe investment alternatives for local and foreign investors. This issuance will also help build the UAE Dirham-denominated yield curve  thereby strengthening the local financial market and developing the investment environment"".Additionally  the issuance provides pricing reference for other UAE markets (bond and equity)  enhances the ability to cover future funding needs in UAE dirham  and provides opportunities for foreign investors to invest in UAE dirham-denominated bonds (in local currency) ‚Äù His Excellency added.Commenting on the launch of the T-Bonds program  H.E. Khaled Mohamed Balama  Governor of the Central Bank of the UAE  stated: ‚ÄúThe launch of the T-Bonds program represents another milestone towards the development of a Dirham local market for securities issued by the public sector in the UAE and follows the launch of the Monetary Bills program earlier last year. With the robust financial market infrastructure developed for the purpose  we are confident that the launch of such a program will enable market participants in the UAE to maintain a transparent  single  diversified and sustainable pool of Dirham liquidity. It shall also contribute to the implementation of the new Dirham Monetary Framework and support the ongoing work on establishing the Dirham risk-free pricing benchmark (yield curve)  which would stimulate further domestic market activities.

The LTI has been discussed at board meetings during the fourth quarter of 2021 and first quarter of 2022. The board of directors or the remuneration committee shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of the LTI Bonus in accordance with the terms and guidelines resolved on by the annual general meeting.Objectives of the LTI BonusThe main objective of the LTI Bonus is to  by promoting a common interest between the participants and Haldex as well as creating conditions to retain key competences  strengthen Haldex's financial development. The board of directors believes that the LTI Bonus will have a positive effect on the group's long-term growth as well as the participant's long-term commitment to Haldex's development through a long-term shareholding in Haldex and will thus be beneficial to both the shareholders and Haldex. The long-term objective of the LTI Bonus is reflected in the agreement with the participant of the LTI Bonus.Participants and bonus levelsParticipants in the LTI Bonus are up to 26 key employees  including members of the executive management  in Haldex  as selected by the board of directors. On the main terms and conditions presented herein  the participants will receive a cash bonus that they will use to purchase shares in Haldex. The maximum bonus amount payable to each participant corresponds to 60% of the relevant participant's annual  gross base salary. The bonus amount will be determined by the level of fulfilment of the performance criteria  as per below.Main terms of the LTI BonusThe LTI Bonus shall be governed by the following main terms and conditions:The LTI Bonus is vested during the calendar years 2022 and 2023 (the ""Vesting Period"") and is conditional upon  among other things  the fulfilment of certain performance criteria and that the participant is employed by the Haldex group  in accordance with the main terms stipulated herein and the specific terms which will be included in the agreement with the participant.The participants undertake to purchase shares in Haldex for the full net of tax amount of the cash bonus. The share purchases will take place on the stock exchange where the Haldex shares are listed and at the price per share that the shares are currently traded for at the time of the acquisition  why the share purchases will be made at the market value.The LTI Bonus will not result in any dilution of the existing shareholders' shares in the company as the participants acquires shares that are already traded on the stock exchange. This also means that Haldex does not have to take any measures to ensure delivery of the shares to the participants.The participants must in general be employed by the Haldex group during the entire Vesting Period  i.e. January 1  2022 ‚Äì December 31  2023  to be eligible for the bonus. If a participant has been employed during the Vesting Period  the bonus amount shall be reduced pro rata the employment period. A participant who has terminated his or her employment during the Vesting Period shall not be eligible for the bonus.The participants may not dispose of the shares until  at the earliest  January 1  2026.To ensure an effective administration of the LTI Bonus  Haldex has contracted a share plan administrator. Via the administrator  the participants will be able to acquire the shares in Haldex and  as of January 1  2026  dispose of the shares.Performance criteria for LTI BonusIn addition to the other conditions  in order for a cash bonus to be made payable to the participants  two performance criteria must be met during the calendar year 2022. The level of fulfilment of the performance criteria will determine the cash bonus amount. The two performance criteria are:Return on capital employed (ROCE)  which represents 70% of the total award; and Operating profit  which represents 30% of the total award.The level of fulfilment of the performance criteria is measured against the budget approved by the board of directors for 2022.Timing of the share acquisitionLTI Bonus is constructed so that at the expiry of the Vesting Period  i.e. during 2024  the board of directors shall assess the level of fulfilment of the performance criteria in the calendar year 2022 as well as whether the other conditions for LTI-Bonus have been fulfilled. Thereafter  the bonus amount is paid out and shares can be acquired. The shares will thus be acquired in 2024  the year after the expiry of the Vesting Period. The reason why the share acquisition takes place earlier than three years from the conclusion of the LTI Bonus agreement is that the participants shall be able to take part in the shares' value development in the coming years. The participants undertake not to sell the acquired shares until after December 31  2025 at the earliest. As a result  the program as a whole is ongoing for a longer period than three years.Cost of the LTI BonusIn addition to the bonus amounts being paid out  the costs for the LTI Bonus consist of regular personnel costs associated with cash compensation and an administration cost for the administrator's handling of the LTI Bonus. The costs will vary depending on the level of fulfilment of the performance criteria and the participants' salary and tax domicile. According to initial calculations  Haldex's costs for the bonus are estimated at between SEK 6‚Äì24 million. The administrator's costs for the administration of the LTI Bonus consist of an annual fee that will be recurrent throughout the years that the administration is ongoing.Administration of the LTI BonusThe detailed terms and conditions of the LTI Bonus shall be decided by the board of directors or the remuneration committee  but shall remain within the framework of the terms and guidelines resolved on by the annual general meetingIt is proposed that the board of directors shall be entitled to make other adjustments to the LTI Bonus  if it so deems appropriate  if changes occur in Haldex  its operation environment or the market that results in a situation where the conditions for the participants' share acquisitions becomes unreasonable. Any such adjustments shall only be made in order to fulfil the main objectives of the LTI Bonus.Majority requirementsResolutions passed by the annual general meeting in accordance with the board of director's proposal item 14 are valid if supported by simple majority.Item 15: Confirmation of 2021 LTI allotmentAt the 2021 annual general meeting  a long-term incentive program for the CEO was approved (the ""2021 LTI"").

In this edition we summarise the key developments in debt capital markets in the first quarter of 2022.We have a number of different developments to report on in this edition:LIBOR transition: FCA publishes final tough legacy and synthetic LIBOR noticesRussia sanctionsHM Treasury proposals to replace the UK Prospectus Regulation regimeICMA updated standard form ECP documentation referencing SONIA  SOFR  ‚Ç¨STR and EURIBORSyndicated distribution of debt securities: New DvP modelLIBOR transition: USD LIBOR tough legacy federal legislation signed into lawLaw Commission report on electronic trade documentsCOVID-19: FCA statement on extended financial information timelinesUK PRIIPs Regulation Regime: FCA guidance on scope and certain changes to the UK PRIIPs KID RTSLIBOR Transition: FCA publishes final tough legacy and synthetic LIBOR noticesOn 1 January 2021  the designation of 1m  3m and 6m GBP and JPY LIBOR as ""Article 23A benchmarks"" under the UK Benchmarks Regulation (UK BMR) took effect. In connection with this  the FCA published the following:Notice of permitted legacy use by supervised entities (previously published in draft form only)  published under Article 23C of the UK BMR  confirming that supervised entities under the UK BMR can continue to use 1m  3m and 6m GBP and JPY LIBOR in synthetic form after 1 January 2022 in all in-scope legacy contracts that have not transitioned to an alternative rate by 31 December 2021 (except for cleared derivatives  which have already transitioned through amendments to CCP rules);Notice of requirements  published under Article 23D of the UK BMR  setting out the new calculation methodology required by the FCA for 1m  3m and 6m GBP and JPY LIBOR;Additional notice of proposed modifications and Notice of modifications  each under Annex 4 of the UK BMR  setting out the modifications to the UK BMR and related delegated legislation to be made in respect of the synthetic LIBOR rates.Russia sanctionsThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered a swift international response. The US  EU  UK  Canada  Australia and others have imposed a series of sanctions (many joint and coordinated) against Russia. Ashurst has created this Tracker of Sanctions in response to the Ukraine crisis which is an up to date  high-level summary of the measures imposed by the UK  EU  and Japan and Australia in response to the situation in Ukraine.HM Treasury proposals to replace the UK Prospectus Regulation regimeOn 1 March 2022 HM Treasury published its proposals to replace the UK Prospectus Regulation regime inherited from the EU with a more flexible regime designed to take advantage of the UK's perceived new freedoms in financial services following withdrawal from the EU.Under the proposed new regime a prospectus will still be required for admission of securities to trading on a UK regulated market. However rule-making responsibilities regarding admission of securities to trading on UK regulated markets will be delegated to the FCA  allowing the FCA to specify in its rulebook if and when a prospectus is required  what a prospectus should contain and the manner and timing of publication. The FCA will also be given discretion to decide whether ‚Äì and  if so  in which circumstances ‚Äì prospectuses must be reviewed and approved by it prior to publication.Also under the proposed new regime there will be a general prohibition on public offerings of securities which will be subject to a number of exemptions. These will essentially be those currently appearing in Article 1(4) of the UK Prospectus Regulation. However  the list of exemptions will be expanded to cover:offerings of securities which are  or will be  admitted to trading on a UK regulated market or certain UK MTFs;offerings of securities to those who already hold equity securities of the issuer  subject to certain conditions  including that the offer is made pro-rata to a person's existing holding; andcertain other categories of offerings by unlisted issuers and non-UK issuers.The qualified investor and 150 persons exemptions will be retained as will the ""wholesale"" exemption  though here the threshold will be set at GBP50 000 rather than EUR100 000 (subject to this  all thresholds currently stated in Euros in the UK Prospectus Regulation regime will be re-stated into sterling at 1 for 1).HM Treasury's proposals contain no express time line but say the government will legislate to implement these proposals when parliamentary time allows. However  as the government will delegate a greater degree of responsibility to the FCA to set out the detail of the new regime  it will also require the FCA to go through a process of consulting on  and then implementing  new rules. This suggests the new regime is unlikely to be in place any time soon.ICMA updated standard form ECP documentation referencing SONIA  SOFR  ‚Ç¨STR and EURIBOROn 2 March 2022 ICMA published amended Appendix A7 to its Primary Market Handbook containing the following standard form ECP documentation for investment grade issuers:Dealer Agreement;Multicurrency Bearer Permanent Global Note; andInformation Memorandum.These new  amended versions cater for ECP to be issued referencing SONIA  SOFR  ‚Ç¨STR or EURIBOR by reference to the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions.Syndicated distribution of debt securities: New DvP modelWith effect from 14 March 2022 the two International Central Securities Depositories (ICSDs)  Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg  have implemented a new model for the traditional delivery versus payment (DvP) closing of syndicated new issues of debt securities. The ICSDs say that after this date it will no longer be possible to close a syndicated new issue under the traditional DvP model.The principal feature of this new syndicate closing model is that the ICSDs will require every bank which acts as a lead manager to open a new ""commissionaire account"" with one or other of the ICSDs. This commissionaire account will be governed by Belgian law (in the case of Euroclear) or Luxembourg law (in the case of Clearstream) and will be for the benefit of the lead manager but will grant the issuer third party rights under a third-party beneficiary clause (‚Äòstipulation pour autrui‚Äô).LIBOR transition: USD LIBOR tough legacy federal legislation signed into lawOn 15 March 2022 US President Joe Biden signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act  2022 which  amongst other things  contains a federal legislative solution to the problem of ""tough legacy"" USD LIBOR contracts. This new federal LIBOR law takes an approach similar to the legislation that was initially proposed by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) in 2020 and has since been passed by the State of New York and several other states. For more information  please read this Ashurst briefing.Law Commission report on electronic trade documentsOn 15 March 2022 the Law Commission published its proposals for reform of English law to allow trade documents in electronic form to have the same legal effect as their paper equivalents  provided that they meet certain requirements to enable their possession in a digital context. While in principle bearer form debt securities would fall within the scope of the Commission's proposed new category of documents in electronic form  the proposals expressly exclude bearer form debt securities from this new category. This despite both ICMA and ICMSA arguing strongly in favour of including them.The Law Commission's reason for excluding bearer form debt securities is simply that they are used in financial markets and not in international trade and as such are better dealt with in the Law Commission‚Äôs ongoing general digital assets project rather than in this project which is focused on international trade documents.COVID-19: FCA statement on extended financial information timelinesSince the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in 2020 the FCA has provided temporary relief for reporting published financial information  including:An additional 2 months to publish annual financial reports (ie within 6 rather than 4 months of the financial year end date); andAn additional month to publish half yearly financial reports (ie within 4 rather than 3 months of the financial half year end date).In its Primary Market Bulletin 39 published on 23 March 2022 the FCA announced the withdrawal of this temporary relief with the result that it will no longer be available for reporting periods ending on or after 28 June 2022.UK PRIIPs Regulation Regime: FCA guidance on scope and certain changes to the UK PRIIPs KID RTSOn 25 March 2022  the FCA published Policy Statement PS22/2 which sets out changes to the FCA Handbook and the UK PRIIPs Regulation Regulatory Technical Standards (the UK PRIIPs KID RTS) to address a number of concerns relating to the UK PRIIPs Regulation regime.The changes to the FCA Handbook include the addition of a new sourcebook  the Product Disclosure sourcebook (DISC)  which contains new rules describing circumstances in which a debt security definitely is or is not a PRIIP and a number of features which are ""neutral"" (that is  by themselves they will not determine whether a debt security definitely is or is not a PRIIP).The amendments to the UK PRIIPs KID RTS:replace the requirements and methodologies for presentation of performance scenarios in a UK KID with a requirement for narrative information on performance to be provided;address the potential for some PRIIPs to be assigned an inappropriately low summary risk indicator in a UK KID; andaddress concerns about certain applications of the ‚Äòslippage‚Äô methodology when calculating transaction costs.While these changes came into effect on 25 March 2022  there are transitional provisions which in many respects allow market participants t to choose which version of the UK PRIIPs Regulation regime to apply until 31 December 2022.",neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,negative,0.02,0.21,0.76,True,English,"['Ashurst Quarterly Debt Capital Markets Update', 'Q1', 'Ashurst Quarterly Debt Capital Markets Update', 'USD LIBOR tough legacy federal legislation', 'law Law Commission report', 'extended financial information timelines', 'UK PRIIPs KID RTS', 'UK PRIIPs Regulation Regime', 'UK Prospectus Regulation regime', 'related delegated legislation', 'final tough legacy', 'UK regulated markets', 'UK Benchmarks Regulation', 'electronic trade documents', 'Primary Market Handbook', 'express time line', 'synthetic LIBOR notices', 'synthetic LIBOR rates', 'scope legacy contracts', 'New DvP model', 'new calculation methodology', 'Article 23A benchmarks', 'swift international response', 'HM Treasury proposals', 'legacy use', 'new regime', 'flexible regime', 'financial services', 'debt securities', 'synthetic form', 'LIBOR transition', 'JPY LIBOR', 'UK BMR', 'UK MTFs', 'UK issuers', 'parliamentary time', 'new freedoms', 'new rules', 'key developments', 'first quarter', 'different developments', 'standard form', 'ECP documentation', 'Syndicated distribution', '6m GBP', 'draft form', 'Article 23C', 'alternative rate', 'CCP rules', 'Article 23D', 'Russian invasion', 'The US', 'high-level summary', 'rule-making responsibilities', 'general prohibition', 'existing holding', 'other categories', 'unlisted issuers', 'qualified investor', 'wholesale"" exemption', 'greater degree', 'Appendix A7', '1m, 3m', 'second edition', 'proposed modifications', 'Ukraine crisis', '150 persons exemptions', 'equity securities', 'FCA statement', 'FCA guidance', 'The FCA', 'Additional notice', 'public offerings', 'Russia sanctions', 'supervised entities', 'Article 1', 'number', 'ICMA', 'SONIA', 'SOFR', '‚Ç¨STR', 'EURIBOR', 'COVID', 'changes', '1 January', 'designation', 'effect', 'connection', '31 December', 'derivatives', 'amendments', 'requirements', 'Annex', 'respect', 'Canada', 'Australia', 'others', 'series', 'Tracker', 'measures', 'Japan', 'situation', '1 March', 'advantage', 'withdrawal', 'admission', 'rulebook', 'manner', 'timing', 'publication', 'discretion', 'circumstances', 'prospectuses', 'conditions', 'threshold', 'Euros', 'sterling', 'government', 'responsibility', 'detail', 'process', 'place', '2 March', 'followin']",2022-04-21,2022-04-21,lexology.com

It will also provide international investors  funds and financial institutions another avenue of investment in the UAE  boosting foreign capital flows into the country as part of its capital markets development plan.A proposed schedule of auctions on the finance ministry's website shows planned T-bonds will have different tenors  ranging from two to 10 years in the short-to medium-term.The National explains the difference between bonds and T-bonds; why the UAE is selling dirham-denominated paper; and the schedule of proposed auctions this year.What is a bond?A bond  also known as a security  note or paper  is a financial instrument that represents a sum loaned by an investor to a borrower  which is typically a corporate entity or a sovereign. Companies  governments and other financial institutions raise funds by selling these fixed-income instruments to investors. Proceeds can be used for financing projects  boosting capital buffers or for paying existing debt  according to online financial encyclopaedia Investopedia.They have different maturities  or tenors  and a fixed date at which the principal amount loaned by bondholders or creditors is repaid. Borrowers or issuers  as they are known  pay variable or fixed-interest payments according to the covenants of the bond.What is a local currency treasury bond?T-bonds are fixed-rate government debt securities that pay semi-annual interest payments until maturity  which could be short-term  as well as long-term  between 10 and 30 years. They are also considered relatively risk-free as they are sold by sovereigns.Why is the UAE issuing bonds in local currency?The UAE raised $4bn last year through the issuance of multi-tranche sovereign bonds  marking the first time it issued bonds at federal level. The sale of T-bonds in dirhams will bring the UAE in line with other countries in the six-member economic bloc of GCC that already issue debt securities in local currencies.In January  the UAE Cabinet announced the country‚Äôs public debt strategy  which includes the development of its local currency bond market.‚ÄúIssuing the T-bonds in local currency will contribute to building a local currency bond market  diversifying financing resources  boosting the local financial and banking sector  as well as providing safe investment alternatives for local and foreign investors ‚Äù said Mohamed Al Hussaini  Minister of State for Financial Affairs said on Wednesday.‚ÄúThis issuance will also help build the UAE dirham-denominated yield curve  thereby strengthening the local financial market and developing the investment environment.‚ÄùWhat is the schedule of the bonds auction?The T-bonds will be issued with varying tenors of two  three and five years in an initial phase  which will be followed by a 10-year deal in the medium term. The first sale is due in May for two- and three-year notes. There will be auctions in June  August and October for the same tenor T-bonds  according to the schedule of auctions.Investors will be able to buy two-year notes as well as five-year papers in a September auction. Three- and five-year bonds would be sold in December  the scheduled showed.These securities will be auctioned and traded through Bloomberg‚Äôs Auction System and settled through a local platform  compliant with international standards  built and operated by Euroclear Bank  the ministry said.,neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,positive,0.68,0.29,0.03,True,English,"['local currency T-bonds', 'capital markets', 'UAE', 'online financial encyclopaedia Investopedia', 'UAE dirham-denominated yield curve', 'capital markets development plan', 'local currency bond market', 'local currency treasury bond', 'six-member economic bloc', 'Mohamed Al Hussaini', 'local financial market', 'foreign capital flows', 'semi-annual interest payments', 'dirham-denominated treasury bonds', 'public debt strategy', 'safe investment alternatives', 'two to 10 years', 'other financial institutions', 'same tenor T-bonds', 'dirham treasury bonds', 'multi-tranche sovereign bonds', 'financial markets', 'capital buffers', 'local currencies', 'local platform', 'bond sales', 'dirham-denominated paper', 'fixed-interest payments', 'other countries', 'two, three', 'financial resources', 'financial instrument', 'Financial Affairs', 'existing debt', 'benchmark size', 'Arab world', 'largest economy', 'financing needs', 'corporate entity', 'fixed-income instruments', 'financing projects', 'different maturities', 'first time', 'federal level', 'financing resources', 'banking sector', 'foreign investors', 'investment environment', 'bonds auction', 'five years', 'initial phase', '10-year deal', 'medium term', 'three-year notes', 'two-year notes', 'five-year papers', 'September auction', 'five-year bonds', 'Auction System', 'international standards', 'Euroclear Bank', 'debt securities', 'The National', 'different tenors', 'varying tenors', 'UAE Cabinet', 'GCC currencies', 'international investors', 'first sale', 'planned T-bonds', 'The UAE', 'issuance size', 'finance ministry', '30 years', 'Dh', 'government', 'statement', 'Tuesday', 'move', 'attraction', 'value', 'funds', 'avenue', 'country', 'part', 'schedule', 'auctions', 'website', 'short-to', 'medium-term', 'difference', 'security', 'sum', 'borrower', 'Companies', 'Proceeds', 'date', 'principal', 'creditors', 'issuers', 'variable', 'covenants', 'maturity', 'sovereigns', 'dirhams', 'January', 'Minister', 'Wednesday', 'May', 'June', 'August', 'October', 'December', 'Bloomberg']",2022-04-21,2022-04-21,thenationalnews.com

More infoMoscow is now seeking alternative ways to trade in rubles in an attempt to bypass the US and sanctions. According to a report  Russia has been getting ever closer to default after Wall Street banks stopped interest payments on two dollar bonds  forcing it to pay in rubles instead.On Wednesday  the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee said the ruble payment was a potential default. Putin‚Äôs bankers and economists are now seeking ways to reroute bond payments through homegrown institutions  yet  with sanctions affecting a wide body of Russian financial means  it is not yet clear how this can be achieved. One potential route available for Russia to avoid the default would be using the Russian Central Bank as an intermediary and paying agent for any foreign-related payments on non-domestic debt. This would see the Russian system avoiding US institutions.Putin may face a default on interest paymentsThe Ruble was heavily impacted during the start of the warAccording to Bloomberg: ‚ÄúA correspondent bank performs basic treasury services and manages foreign exchange for clients  while a paying agent bank handles housekeeping on bonds  collecting interest from issuers and helping distribute it to investors. ‚ÄúUnder this scenario  payments to bondholders would progress to the Central Bank of Russia instead of the foreign correspondent bank and paying agent. ‚ÄúFor Russia  relying on its own domestic clearing agent would also allow it to sidestep foreign rivals that have held up payments to Russian investors. ‚ÄúEuroclear and Clearstream  which process payments as central securities depositories  have blocked accounts the national Russian depository has with them  leaving payments to local bondholders in limbo.‚Äù It's not clear that paying out in rubles would even help Russia or large Russian companies to avoid default. For example  when the country sovereign dollar bonds in roubles  S&P cut its credit ratings to ""selective default"".

The ruble crashed in value by more than 40 percent after western governments first imposed sweeping economic sanctions  although it has recovered to pre-invasion levels over recent weeks. Without access to half of its foreign currency reserves  the Russian central bank imposed tight capital controls and raised interest rates in an attempt to bolster the currency. The current value of the ruble is also up against recent slumps. According to latest figures  the ruble cleared 77 to the dollar on Wednesday.

3274,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/russia-faces-new-urgency-to-avoid-default-sidestep-wall-street,Russia faces new urgency to avoid default  sidestep Wall Street,Russia's race to avoid default just escalated. The country has been inching closer after JPMorgan Chase & Co  under orders from the US Department of the Treasury  halted interest payments the country owed on two US dollar-denominated bonds in recent weeks.,"NEW YORK (BLOOMBERG) - Russia's race to avoid default just escalated.The country has been inching closer after JPMorgan Chase & Co  under orders from the United States Department of the Treasury  halted interest payments the country owed on two US dollar-denominated bonds in recent weeks. The move forced the Russian central bank to make the payments in roubles instead and left it scrambling for ways to sidestep JPMorgan and rival Citigroup to make good on its debt.The situation got more serious on Wednesday (April 20). The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee (CDDC) said the rouble payment was a potential default  fuelling growing consensus that Russia may have reneged on its debt obligations.The CDDC's ruling  which does not directly impact the debt  could trigger payment of credit-default swaps if Russia does not pay bond holders in US dollars before the debt's grace period ends on May 4. The nation could still avert a default if it pays bond holders in dollars before that period ends.Russia is exploring ways to reroute payments through domestic institutions as well as its own clearing agent. But it remains unclear if the efforts stand any chance of success and whether the moves would even help the country avoid default.There is ""no clarity about any of this in the language"" of the bond documents  Professor Mitu Gulati of the University of Virginia School of Law said in an interview. ""Some judge would presumably have to decide all of this.""One option being considered is replacing the foreign banks acting as correspondent banks and paying agents on foreign debt deals with the Central Bank of Russia  according to the Russian newspaper Vedomosti. A correspondent bank performs basic treasury services and manages foreign exchange for clients  while a paying-agent bank handles housekeeping on bonds  collecting interest from issuers and helping distribute it to investors.Under this scenario  payments to bond holders would progress to the Central Bank of Russia instead of the foreign correspondent bank and paying agent. These would then move to Russia's domestic clearing agent  the National Settlement Depository. From there  the money would end up with local bond holders or in specially created accounts for bond holders from so-called hostile nations  like the US.For Russia  relying on its own domestic clearing agent would also allow it to sidestep foreign rivals that have held up payments to Russian investors. Euroclear and Clearstream  which process payments as central securities depositories  have blocked accounts that the national Russian depository has with them  leaving payments to local bond holders in limbo.Russia's big-business lobby  the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs  pitched a similar proposal for corporate borrowers as part of the group's plan to avoid a wave of cross-defaults and foreign asset freezes. In its pitch  non-residents would receive payments for the bonds in special foreign currency accounts with Russian banks  along with the right to sell the notes to the Finance Ministry or its agent.The move seeks to help a bevy of Russian companies that have been forced into technical default as their interest payments get held up in the web of foreign banks' due-diligence processes. Even Russian entities not subject to US penalties have run into delays: Citigroup  for instance  ordered Severstal to seek a special waiver from the Treasury Department before it would process the steelmaker's interest payment.State-controlled lender VTB gave investors a glimpse into how these scenarios could work when it paid coupons on a dollar-denominated euro bond in roubles  Vedomosti reported on Wednesday. Investors from Russia and ""friendly"" nations received funds in their rouble accounts  while Russian currency was transferred to special accounts for residents of hostile countries  the newspaper said.Still  switching paying agents likely will not be easy. It requires agreement from a majority of creditors and  in some cases  bond documents require borrowers to give investors months of notice before they can make such a change.",negative,0.03,0.39,0.58,negative,0.01,0.13,0.86,True,English,"['new urgency', 'Wall Street', 'Russia', 'default', 'The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee', ""foreign banks' due-diligence processes"", 'two US dollar-denominated bonds', 'special foreign currency accounts', 'Professor Mitu Gulati', 'National Settlement Depository', 'State-controlled lender VTB', 'foreign asset freezes', 'dollar-denominated euro bond', 'United States Department', 'central securities depositories', 'national Russian depository', 'basic treasury services', 'local bond holders', 'foreign correspondent bank', 'domestic clearing agent', 'foreign debt deals', 'Russian central bank', 'Russian newspaper Vedomosti', 'Russian currency', 'The CDDC', 'foreign exchange', 'foreign rivals', 'Russian banks', 'correspondent banks', 'domestic institutions', 'special waiver', 'special accounts', 'Treasury Department', 'Russian companies', 'Russian entities', 'bond documents', 'paying-agent bank', 'US penalties', 'paying agent', 'NEW YORK', 'recent weeks', 'growing consensus', 'credit-default swaps', 'Virginia School', 'One option', 'hostile nations', 'big-business lobby', 'similar proposal', 'Finance Ministry', 'friendly"" nations', 'rouble accounts', 'hostile countries', 'US dollars', 'rouble payment', 'debt obligations', 'Russian investors', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'rival Citigroup', 'grace period', 'corporate borrowers', 'interest payment', 'potential default', 'technical default', 'agents', 'payments', 'BLOOMBERG', 'country', 'orders', 'move', 'roubles', 'ways', 'situation', 'Wednesday', 'April', 'ruling', 'May', 'efforts', 'chance', 'success', 'clarity', 'language', 'University', 'Law', 'interview', 'judge', 'clients', 'housekeeping', 'issuers', 'scenario', 'money', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'limbo', 'Union', 'Industrialists', 'Entrepreneurs', 'plan', 'wave', 'cross-defaults', 'pitch', 'non-residents', 'right', 'notes', 'bevy', 'web', 'delays', 'instance', 'Severstal', 'steelmaker', 'glimpse', 'coupons', 'funds', 'agreement', 'majority', 'creditors', 'cases', 'months', 'notice']",2022-04-21,2022-04-21,straitstimes.com

3280,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-faces-urgency-avoid-default-230000354.html,Russia Faces New Urgency to Dodge Default  Avoid Wall Street,(Bloomberg) -- Russia‚Äôs race to avoid default just escalated.Most Read from BloombergKremlin Insiders Alarmed Over Growing Toll of Putin‚Äôs War in...,(Bloomberg) -- Russia‚Äôs race to avoid default just escalated.Most Read from BloombergThe country has been inching closer after JPMorgan Chase & Co.  under orders from the U.S. Department of the Treasury  halted interest payments the country owed on two dollar-denominated bonds in recent weeks. The move forced the Russian central bank to make the payments in rubles instead and left it scrambling for ways to sidestep JPMorgan and rival Citigroup Inc. to make good on its debt.The situation got more serious on Wednesday: The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee said the ruble payment was a potential default  fueling growing consensus that Russia may have reneged on its debt obligations. The CDDC‚Äôs ruling  which doesn‚Äôt directly impact the debt  could trigger payment of credit-default swaps if Russia doesn‚Äôt pay bondholders in dollars before the debt‚Äôs grace period ends on May 4. The nation could still avert a default if it pays bondholders in dollars before that period ends.Russia ‚Äúis not at threat of default‚Äù and ‚Äúhas enough financial resources ‚Äù central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Thursday.The country is exploring ways to reroute payments through domestic institutions as well as its own clearing agent. But it remains unclear if the efforts stand any chance of success and whether the moves would even help the country avoid default.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no clarity about any of this in the language‚Äù of the bond documents  Mitu Gulati  a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law  said in an interview. ‚ÄúSome judge would presumably have to decide all of this.‚ÄùOne option being considered is replacing the foreign banks acting as correspondent banks and paying agents on foreign-debt deals with the Central Bank of Russia  according to the Russian newspaper Vedomosti. A correspondent bank performs basic treasury services and manages foreign exchange for clients  while a paying-agent bank handles housekeeping on bonds  collecting interest from issuers and helping distribute it to investors.Story continuesUnder this scenario  payments to bondholders would progress to the Central Bank of Russia instead of the foreign correspondent bank and paying agent. They would then move to Russia‚Äôs domestic clearing agent  the National Settlement Depository. From there  the money would end up with local bondholders or in specially created ‚ÄúType C‚Äù accounts for bondholders from so-called hostile nations  like the U.S.For Russia  relying on its own domestic clearing agent would also allow it to sidestep foreign rivals that have held up payments to Russian investors. Euroclear and Clearstream  which process payments as central securities depositories  have blocked accounts the national Russian depository has with them  leaving payments to local bondholders in limbo.Russia‚Äôs big-business lobby  the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs  pitched a similar proposal for corporate borrowers as part of the group‚Äôs plan to avoid a wave of cross-defaults and foreign-asset freezes. In their pitch  nonresidents would receive payments for the bonds in special foreign-currency accounts with Russian banks  along with the right to sell the notes to the finance ministry or its agent.The move seeks to help a bevy of Russian companies that have been forced into technical default as their interest payments get held up in the web of foreign banks‚Äô due-diligence processes. Even Russian entities not subject to U.S. penalties have run into delays: Citigroup  for instance  ordered Severstal PJSC to seek a special waiver from the U.S. Treasury Department before it would process the steelmaker‚Äôs interest payment.Citigroup‚Äôs action -- which came after the Treasury issued a blocked-pending-investigation order  or BPI -- meant Severstal ran out of time to pay interest on the dollar debt. Representatives for Citigroup and Severstal declined to comment while the Treasury didn‚Äôt immediately respond to requests for comment.State-controlled lender VTB gave investors a glimpse into how these scenarios could work when it paid coupons on a dollar-denominated eurobond in rubles  Vedomosti reported on Wednesday. Investors from Russia and ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù nations received funds in their ruble accounts  while Russian currency was transferred to special ‚ÄúC‚Äù accounts for residents of hostile countries  the newspaper said.Still  switching paying agents likely won‚Äôt be easy: It requires agreement from a majority of creditors and  in some cases  bond documents require borrowers to give investors months of notice before they could make such a change.‚ÄòSelective Default‚ÄôIt‚Äôs also not clear that paying out in rubles would even help Russia or large Russian corporations avoid default. The country‚Äôs move to pay its sovereign dollar bonds maturing in 2022 and 2042 in rubles  for instance  resulted in S&P Global Ratings cutting Russia‚Äôs unsolicited foreign currency issuer credit ratings to ‚Äúselective default.‚Äù‚ÄúAlthough the default could be remedied under a 30-day grace period allowed under the terms and conditions of the bonds  we don‚Äôt expect that investors will be able to convert those ruble payments into dollars equivalent to the originally due amounts  or that the government will convert those payments within that grace period ‚Äù S&P said.But Gulati  who focuses on sovereign debt restructuring  said Russia‚Äôs bond documents do include a currency indemnity provision that appears to allow Russia to discharge its debt by paying in rubles  so long as the recipient can use those rubles to buy a sufficient number of dollars.‚ÄúBoiled down  the clause seems to say that payment in a different currency can constitute a ‚Äòdischarge ‚Äô so long as the recipient can use those rubles to buy a sufficient number of dollars ‚Äù Gulati said in a post on his blog. ‚ÄúThat seems to mean that Russia can discharge its obligations by paying in rubles.‚ÄùUnder a second proposal recommended by the Russian government  borrowers would make interest payments to investors through separate channels depending on where an investor is based. Payments to foreign holders would be handled by a foreign payment agent  though that entity could run into similar restrictions. Russian holders would get their funds via domestic institutions.The Russian government subcommittee that put forward the plan also recommended using rubles to buy back eurobonds from Russian investors as an alternative  a move Russia already made with a $2 billion bond that matured on Apr. 4.The stalled coupon payments -- along with a bevy of others that are linked to debt from Russia‚Äôs biggest companies -- have thrust the normally staid back office of Wall Street into the spotlight. It also underscores the quagmire Wall Street‚Äôs biggest banks have found themselves in as de facto enforcers of U.S. President Joe Biden‚Äôs sanctions  an outcome they‚Äôd anticipated since Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine first began.‚ÄúWe are in continuous communication with the U.S. government and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime ‚Äù Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser told analysts on a conference call last week. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine.‚Äù(Updates with comments from Russia‚Äôs central bank governor in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek¬©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.02,0.53,0.45,mixed,0.04,0.15,0.81,True,English,"['New Urgency', 'Dodge Default', 'Wall Street', 'Russia', 'unsolicited foreign currency issuer credit ratings', 'The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee', 'central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina', 'S&P Global Ratings', 'foreign banks‚Äô due-diligence processes', 'U.S. Treasury Department', 'U.S. Department', 'U.S. penalties', 'enough financial resources', 'National Settlement Depository', 'central securities depositories', 'State-controlled lender VTB', 'Type C‚Äù accounts', 'national Russian depository', 'large Russian corporations', 'foreign correspondent bank', 'special foreign-currency accounts', 'special ‚ÄúC‚Äù accounts', 'Russian central bank', 'basic treasury services', 'domestic clearing agent', 'rival Citigroup Inc.', '30-day grace period', 'two dollar-denominated bonds', 'sovereign dollar bonds', 'Russian currency', 'The CDDC', 'foreign exchange', 'foreign rivals', 'correspondent banks', 'Russian banks', 'paying-agent bank', 'domestic institutions', 'special waiver', 'dollar-denominated eurobond', 'ruble accounts', 'Russian companies', 'Russian entities', 'paying agent', 'recent weeks', 'growing consensus', 'credit-default swaps', 'bond documents', 'Mitu Gulati', 'Virginia School', 'One option', 'foreign-debt deals', 'hostile nations', 'big-business lobby', 'similar proposal', 'foreign-asset freezes', 'finance ministry', 'pending-investigation order', 'friendly‚Äù nations', 'hostile countries', 'dollar debt', 'Russian newspaper', 'ruble payment', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'Russian investors', 'corporate borrowers', 'potential default', 'debt obligations', 'technical default', 'Selective Default', 'local bondholders', 'Severstal PJSC', 'interest payment', 'agents', 'payments', 'Bloomberg', 'country', 'Co.', 'orders', 'move', 'rubles', 'ways', 'situation', 'Wednesday', 'ruling', 'dollars', 'May', 'threat', 'Thursday', 'efforts', 'chance', 'success', 'clarity', 'language', 'professor', 'University', 'Law', 'interview', 'judge', 'Vedomosti', 'clients', 'housekeeping', 'issuers', 'Story', 'scenario', 'money', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'limbo', 'Union', 'Industrialists', 'Entrepreneurs', 'plan', 'wave', 'cross-defaults', 'pitch', 'nonresidents', 'right', 'notes', 'bevy', 'web', 'delays', 'instance', 'steelmaker', 'action', 'BPI', 'time', 'Representatives', 'requests', 'comment', 'glimpse', 'coupons', 'funds', 'agreement', 'majority', 'creditors', 'cases', 'months', 'notice', 'terms', 'conditions']",2022-04-21,2022-04-21,finance.yahoo.com

In this edition we summarise the key developments in debt capital markets in the first quarter of 2022.We have a number of different developments to report on in this edition:LIBOR transition: FCA publishes final tough legacy and synthetic LIBOR noticesRussia sanctionsHM Treasury proposals to replace the UK Prospectus Regulation regimeICMA updated standard form ECP documentation referencing SONIA  SOFR  ‚Ç¨STR and EURIBORSyndicated distribution of debt securities: New DvP modelLIBOR transition: USD LIBOR tough legacy federal legislation signed into lawLaw Commission report on electronic trade documentsCOVID-19: FCA statement on extended financial information timelinesUK PRIIPs Regulation Regime: FCA guidance on scope and certain changes to the UK PRIIPs KID RTSLIBOR Transition: FCA publishes final tough legacy and synthetic LIBOR noticesOn 1 January 2021  the designation of 1m  3m and 6m GBP and JPY LIBOR as ""Article 23A benchmarks"" under the UK Benchmarks Regulation (UK BMR) took effect. In connection with this  the FCA published the following:Notice of permitted legacy use by supervised entities (previously published in draft form only)  published under Article 23C of the UK BMR  confirming that supervised entities under the UK BMR can continue to use 1m  3m and 6m GBP and JPY LIBOR in synthetic form after 1 January 2022 in all in-scope legacy contracts that have not transitioned to an alternative rate by 31 December 2021 (except for cleared derivatives  which have already transitioned through amendments to CCP rules);Notice of requirements  published under Article 23D of the UK BMR  setting out the new calculation methodology required by the FCA for 1m  3m and 6m GBP and JPY LIBOR;Additional notice of proposed modifications and Notice of modifications  each under Annex 4 of the UK BMR  setting out the modifications to the UK BMR and related delegated legislation to be made in respect of the synthetic LIBOR rates.Russia sanctionsThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered a swift international response. The US  EU  UK  Canada  Australia and others have imposed a series of sanctions (many joint and coordinated) against Russia. Ashurst has created this Tracker of Sanctions in response to the Ukraine crisis which is an up to date  high-level summary of the measures imposed by the UK  EU  and Japan and Australia in response to the situation in Ukraine.HM Treasury proposals to replace the UK Prospectus Regulation regimeOn 1 March 2022 HM Treasury published its proposals to replace the UK Prospectus Regulation regime inherited from the EU with a more flexible regime designed to take advantage of the UK's perceived new freedoms in financial services following withdrawal from the EU.Under the proposed new regime a prospectus will still be required for admission of securities to trading on a UK regulated market. However rule-making responsibilities regarding admission of securities to trading on UK regulated markets will be delegated to the FCA  allowing the FCA to specify in its rulebook if and when a prospectus is required  what a prospectus should contain and the manner and timing of publication. The FCA will also be given discretion to decide whether ‚Äì and  if so  in which circumstances ‚Äì prospectuses must be reviewed and approved by it prior to publication.Also under the proposed new regime there will be a general prohibition on public offerings of securities which will be subject to a number of exemptions. These will essentially be those currently appearing in Article 1(4) of the UK Prospectus Regulation. However  the list of exemptions will be expanded to cover:offerings of securities which are  or will be  admitted to trading on a UK regulated market or certain UK MTFs;offerings of securities to those who already hold equity securities of the issuer  subject to certain conditions  including that the offer is made pro-rata to a person's existing holding; andcertain other categories of offerings by unlisted issuers and non-UK issuers.The qualified investor and 150 persons exemptions will be retained as will the ""wholesale"" exemption  though here the threshold will be set at GBP50 000 rather than EUR100 000 (subject to this  all thresholds currently stated in Euros in the UK Prospectus Regulation regime will be re-stated into sterling at 1 for 1).HM Treasury's proposals contain no express time line but say the government will legislate to implement these proposals when parliamentary time allows. However  as the government will delegate a greater degree of responsibility to the FCA to set out the detail of the new regime  it will also require the FCA to go through a process of consulting on  and then implementing  new rules. This suggests the new regime is unlikely to be in place any time soon.ICMA updated standard form ECP documentation referencing SONIA  SOFR  ‚Ç¨STR and EURIBOROn 2 March 2022 ICMA published amended Appendix A7 to its Primary Market Handbook containing the following standard form ECP documentation for investment grade issuers:Dealer Agreement;Multicurrency Bearer Permanent Global Note; andInformation Memorandum.These new  amended versions cater for ECP to be issued referencing SONIA  SOFR  ‚Ç¨STR or EURIBOR by reference to the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions.Syndicated distribution of debt securities: New DvP modelWith effect from 14 March 2022 the two International Central Securities Depositories (ICSDs)  Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg  have implemented a new model for the traditional delivery versus payment (DvP) closing of syndicated new issues of debt securities. The ICSDs say that after this date it will no longer be possible to close a syndicated new issue under the traditional DvP model.The principal feature of this new syndicate closing model is that the ICSDs will require every bank which acts as a lead manager to open a new ""commissionaire account"" with one or other of the ICSDs. This commissionaire account will be governed by Belgian law (in the case of Euroclear) or Luxembourg law (in the case of Clearstream) and will be for the benefit of the lead manager but will grant the issuer third party rights under a third-party beneficiary clause (‚Äòstipulation pour autrui‚Äô).LIBOR transition: USD LIBOR tough legacy federal legislation signed into lawOn 15 March 2022 US President Joe Biden signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act  2022 which  amongst other things  contains a federal legislative solution to the problem of ""tough legacy"" USD LIBOR contracts. This new federal LIBOR law takes an approach similar to the legislation that was initially proposed by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) in 2020 and has since been passed by the State of New York and several other states.

While in principle bearer form debt securities would fall within the scope of the Commission's proposed new category of documents in electronic form  the proposals expressly exclude bearer form debt securities from this new category. This despite both ICMA and ICMSA arguing strongly in favour of including them.The Law Commission's reason for excluding bearer form debt securities is simply that they are used in financial markets and not in international trade and as such are better dealt with in the Law Commission‚Äôs ongoing general digital assets project rather than in this project which is focused on international trade documents.COVID-19: FCA statement on extended financial information timelinesSince the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in 2020 the FCA has provided temporary relief for reporting published financial information  including:An additional 2 months to publish annual financial reports (ie within 6 rather than 4 months of the financial year end date); andAn additional month to publish half yearly financial reports (ie within 4 rather than 3 months of the financial half year end date).In its Primary Market Bulletin 39 published on 23 March 2022 the FCA announced the withdrawal of this temporary relief with the result that it will no longer be available for reporting periods ending on or after 28 June 2022.UK PRIIPs Regulation Regime: FCA guidance on scope and certain changes to the UK PRIIPs KID RTSOn 25 March 2022  the FCA published Policy Statement PS22/2 which sets out changes to the FCA Handbook and the UK PRIIPs Regulation Regulatory Technical Standards (the UK PRIIPs KID RTS) to address a number of concerns relating to the UK PRIIPs Regulation regime.The changes to the FCA Handbook include the addition of a new sourcebook  the Product Disclosure sourcebook (DISC)  which contains new rules describing circumstances in which a debt security definitely is or is not a PRIIP and a number of features which are ""neutral"" (that is  by themselves they will not determine whether a debt security definitely is or is not a PRIIP).The amendments to the UK PRIIPs KID RTS:replace the requirements and methodologies for presentation of performance scenarios in a UK KID with a requirement for narrative information on performance to be provided;address the potential for some PRIIPs to be assigned an inappropriately low summary risk indicator in a UK KID; andaddress concerns about certain applications of the ‚Äòslippage‚Äô methodology when calculating transaction costs.While these changes came into effect on 25 March 2022  there are transitional provisions which in many respects allow market participants t to choose which version of the UK PRIIPs Regulation regime to apply until 31 December 2022.",neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,negative,0.02,0.21,0.76,True,English,"['Ashurst Quarterly Debt Capital Markets Update', 'Q1', 'Ashurst Quarterly Debt Capital Markets Update', 'USD LIBOR tough legacy federal legislation', 'law Law Commission report', 'extended financial information timelines', 'UK PRIIPs KID RTS', 'UK PRIIPs Regulation Regime', 'UK Prospectus Regulation regime', 'related delegated legislation', 'final tough legacy', 'UK regulated markets', 'UK Benchmarks Regulation', 'electronic trade documents', 'Primary Market Handbook', 'express time line', 'synthetic LIBOR notices', 'synthetic LIBOR rates', 'scope legacy contracts', 'New DvP model', 'new calculation methodology', 'Article 23A benchmarks', 'swift international response', 'HM Treasury proposals', 'legacy use', 'new regime', 'flexible regime', 'financial services', 'debt securities', 'synthetic form', 'LIBOR transition', 'JPY LIBOR', 'UK BMR', 'UK MTFs', 'UK issuers', 'parliamentary time', 'new freedoms', 'new rules', 'key developments', 'first quarter', 'different developments', 'standard form', 'ECP documentation', 'Syndicated distribution', '6m GBP', 'draft form', 'Article 23C', 'alternative rate', 'CCP rules', 'Article 23D', 'Russian invasion', 'The US', 'high-level summary', 'rule-making responsibilities', 'general prohibition', 'existing holding', 'other categories', 'unlisted issuers', 'qualified investor', 'wholesale"" exemption', 'greater degree', 'Appendix A7', '1m, 3m', 'second edition', 'proposed modifications', 'Ukraine crisis', '150 persons exemptions', 'equity securities', 'FCA statement', 'FCA guidance', 'The FCA', 'Additional notice', 'public offerings', 'Russia sanctions', 'supervised entities', 'Article 1', 'number', 'ICMA', 'SONIA', 'SOFR', '‚Ç¨STR', 'EURIBOR', 'COVID', 'changes', '1 January', 'designation', 'effect', 'connection', '31 December', 'derivatives', 'amendments', 'requirements', 'Annex', 'respect', 'Canada', 'Australia', 'others', 'series', 'Tracker', 'measures', 'Japan', 'situation', '1 March', 'advantage', 'withdrawal', 'admission', 'rulebook', 'manner', 'timing', 'publication', 'discretion', 'circumstances', 'prospectuses', 'conditions', 'threshold', 'Euros', 'sterling', 'government', 'responsibility', 'detail', 'process', 'place', '2 March', 'followin']",2022-04-21,2022-04-21,lexology.com

The ERCC notes that these automated repo trading systems are predominantly used to support dealer-to-client business  whereas automatic systems primarily execute interdealer activity.The share of aggregate repo and reverse repo trades conducted through tri-party repo increased from 8.0 per cent in the June survey to 8.6 per cent in the latest December survey. However  the report finds that the outstanding value of all tri-party business reported separately by five main tri-party agents  namely BNY Mellon  Clearstream  Euroclear  JP Morgan and SIS  remained almost unchanged at ‚Ç¨670.8 billion and this would have been lower  but for significant tri-party activity of global custodians.The share of tri-party repo driven by GC financing activities ‚Äî electronic markets for centrally cleared tri-party repo trades ‚Äî continued to rise  with outstanding repo value on these platforms jumping by 8.1 per cent to ‚Ç¨78.4 billion between June and December 2021.The report finds that the percentage of repo and reverse-repo trades cleared through a central counterparty has continued to decline  extending a fluctuating downward trend that has been in evidence since June 2016. In the latest survey  the share of anonymous (CCP-cleared) repo trading contracted to 17.2 per cent  down from 17.9 per cent in the June 2021 survey and well below the 25 per cent high point attained in 2013.In evaluating collateral type delivered against repo transactions  ERCC indicates that the share of German (up from 14.8 to 16.5 per cent) and US government (up from 8.7 to 10.4 per cent) securities rose in the Dec survey  with more moderate increases also recorded for French (up from 13.2 to 13.7 per cent) and Japanese securities (up from 3.5 to 3.9 per cent).For tri-party repo managed by the ICSDs  the allocation of French  German  Italian  UK and US govvies increased sharply  with UK gilts providing the largest single share of the tri-party collateral pool.,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,negative,0.02,0.33,0.65,True,English,"['European Repo Survey', 'outstanding repo value', '5.4% rise', '6 months', 'Dec', 'principal automatic repo trading systems', 'The European Repo Market Survey', 'International Capital Market Association', 'five main tri-party agents', 'automated repo trading systems', 'Securities Financing Transactions Regulation', 'Total repo contract value', 'latest European Repo Survey', 'automated electronic trading', 'GC financing activities', 'cleared) repo trading', 'fluctuating downward trend', 'reverse repo contracts', 'average daily value', 'reverse repo trades', 'tri-party repo trades', 'aggregate repo trades', 'average daily turnover', 'significant tri-party activity', 'tri-party collateral pool', 'voice-brokered repo transactions', 'outstanding repo value', 'same time period', '5.4 per cent increase', '5.0 per cent contraction', 'ERCC survey sample', 'preceding June 2021 survey', 'automatic systems', 'largest single share', 'latest December survey', 'European market', '11 per cent rise', 'latest survey', 'RFQ) systems', 'total value', 'The ERCC', 'same period', 'OTC repo', 'outstanding value', 'reverse-repo trades', 'reverse repos', 'tri-party business', 'time measure', 'largest dealers', 'voice-brokered channels', 'electronic markets', 'last survey', 'outstanding repos', 'Collateral Council', 'interdealer activity', 'collateral type', 'Japanese securities', '5.9 per cent', '8.3 per cent', '9.6 per cent', '15.6 per cent', '7.8 per cent', '8.0 per cent', '8.6 per cent', '8.1 per cent', '17.2 per cent', '17.9 per cent', '25 per cent', '16.5 per cent', '10.4 per cent', '13.7 per cent', '3.9 per cent', 'ERCC) survey', 'June survey', '‚Ç¨8,726 billion figure', '57 reporting institutions', 'SFTR) data', 'Tradeweb data', 'client business', 'BNY Mellon', 'JP Morgan', 'global custodians', 'central counterparty', 'US government', 'moderate increases', 'US govvies', 'Dec survey', 'UK gilts', 'six months', '26.8 per', '5.4% rise', '6 months', '8 December', '12 months', 'books', 'firms', 'record', 'point', 'breakdown', 'close', 'ICMA', 'difference', 'trends', 'remainder', 'Growth', 'indicator', 'shift', 'percentage', 'ATS', 'terms', 'ADV', 'number', 'quote', 'H2', 'H1', 'decline', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'SIS', 'platforms', 'evidence', 'anonymous', 'CCP', 'German', 'French', 'ICSDs', 'allocation', 'Italian', '27.5', '14.8', '8.7', '13.2', '3.5']",2022-04-21,2022-04-21,securitiesfinancetimes.com

More infoMoscow is now seeking alternative ways to trade in rubles in an attempt to bypass the US and sanctions. According to a report  Russia has been getting ever closer to default after Wall Street banks stopped interest payments on two dollar bonds  forcing it to pay in rubles instead.On Wednesday  the Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee said the ruble payment was a potential default. Putin‚Äôs bankers and economists are now seeking ways to reroute bond payments through homegrown institutions  yet  with sanctions affecting a wide body of Russian financial means  it is not yet clear how this can be achieved. One potential route available for Russia to avoid the default would be using the Russian Central Bank as an intermediary and paying agent for any foreign-related payments on non-domestic debt. This would see the Russian system avoiding US institutions.Putin may face a default on interest paymentsThe Ruble was heavily impacted during the start of the warAccording to Bloomberg: ‚ÄúA correspondent bank performs basic treasury services and manages foreign exchange for clients  while a paying agent bank handles housekeeping on bonds  collecting interest from issuers and helping distribute it to investors. ‚ÄúUnder this scenario  payments to bondholders would progress to the Central Bank of Russia instead of the foreign correspondent bank and paying agent. ‚ÄúFor Russia  relying on its own domestic clearing agent would also allow it to sidestep foreign rivals that have held up payments to Russian investors. ‚ÄúEuroclear and Clearstream  which process payments as central securities depositories  have blocked accounts the national Russian depository has with them  leaving payments to local bondholders in limbo.‚Äù It's not clear that paying out in rubles would even help Russia or large Russian companies to avoid default. For example  when the country sovereign dollar bonds in roubles  S&P cut its credit ratings to ""selective default"".

The ruble crashed in value by more than 40 percent after western governments first imposed sweeping economic sanctions  although it has recovered to pre-invasion levels over recent weeks. Without access to half of its foreign currency reserves  the Russian central bank imposed tight capital controls and raised interest rates in an attempt to bolster the currency. The current value of the ruble is also up against recent slumps. According to latest figures  the ruble cleared 77 to the dollar on Wednesday.

3292,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.fidelity.co.uk/markets-insights/investing-ideas/funds/way-inflation-beating-income/,Is this the way to an inflation beating income?,6 hours ago,THIS month‚Äôs inflation data was hardly a surprise  but it did give pause for thought. UK consumer prices were 7% higher in March than a year previously  a rate of increase not seen since 19921.We all know it. From the cost of a weekly shop to filling the car with fuel  what we pay compared to last year or  in some cases  even last month  is going up.The good news is that the current rate of inflation is not expected to last. While consumer prices may well continue to increase at a high rate over the short term  the outlook into next year and beyond is more sanguine.The latest thinking at the Bank of England is that inflation could go even higher than 7% later this year. However  the Bank is sticking with its forecast that inflation will head back down to its 2% target in two to three years time2.That implies recent sharp hikes in the prices of some items ‚Äì like cars and hospitality ‚Äì may be a one-off  while drivers of inflation such as energy and food prices should relent as supply chains continue to adjust to where the demand is after the disruptions of the pandemic.Prices aren‚Äôt expected to fall  but they should be increasing at a much slower pace from next year  as comparisons are drawn with high starting points in 2022.That‚Äôs just as well. To achieve an investment income that rises consistently by 7% per annum is undoubtedly a demanding task. If the Bank of England is right  the actual task ‚Äì over the medium-term run at least ‚Äì is probably to try to achieve an income that grows sustainably by 3% or more.The first thing to say is that most bonds don‚Äôt cut it in this environment. Bonds are built to pay a fixed income until they mature  not a rising one.What‚Äôs more  rising inflation and higher interest rates tend to force bond prices lower. Bonds could  of course  perform well in capital terms should inflation expectations moderate from here. But that  in itself  may be of no additional help to income seekers.The exception is inflation-linked bonds  which increase in value as inflation rises. However  even these do not promise to outpace inflation over time. Their primary purpose is to insulate investors from the inflation risk that comes from holding conventional bonds.Cash is beginning to look like a better bet than it has for a long time  and it‚Äôs risk free too. However  the Bank of England‚Äôs Bank Rate is only expected to get to about 2% by the end of this year3. With the Bank Rate currently at 0.75%  the best return you can expect from an easy access cash account is about 1%4.Of the main asset classes  that leaves shares  which have a good track record of shielding investors from inflation over the long run  if not through shorter term crises such as the Covid pandemic.The dividends from UK companies rose by 46% in 2021  but don‚Äôt expect the same again this year. According to Link Group‚Äôs latest Dividend Monitor  fewer special dividends could result in a 7% fall in headline payments this year.However  dividends are still expected to increase by 5% on an underlying basis  giving scope for investors to derive an attractive income compared to 2021 levels5.Some companies at least have the flexibility to stand up to or even benefit from higher inflation  as the prices of their goods and services increase. That  in turn  raises their ability to maintain or increase shareholder payouts.So strategies that feature investments in the beneficiaries of higher inflation ‚Äì for example  supermarkets and diversified miners; higher interest rates ‚Äì for example  banks; and other companies with genuine pricing power could well be the best defence in the current environment.Companies that have maintained or grown their dividends over the longer run ‚Äì for at least ten consecutive years ‚Äì include British American Tobacco  Rio Tinto  BAE Systems  GlaxoSmithKline and Legal & General.All of these are constituents of the S&P UK High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index and feature regularly among the portfolio holdings of many UK equity income funds6.There are also a number of dividend heroes in the world of investment trusts  which have consistently increased their dividend payouts over the long term. Top of the pile is the City of London Investment Trust  which has raised its payout for a remarkable 55 years in a row7.Investment trusts have an advantage over open-ended funds  in that they are not required to distribute all of their income to investors and can hold some of it back to pay out in lean times.A disadvantage is that trusts with a very strong payments record can trade at a premium to the value of the assets they invest in  potentially making access to an ultra-reliable income stream for new investors a relatively costly affair in capital terms.Fidelity‚Äôs Select 50 list includes several high-quality equity income funds offering attractive yields and the potential to produce an income that grows over time. They lend themselves to investors able to take a longer-term view and who wish to benefit from an increasing investment income over the years that lie ahead.The Franklin UK Equity Income Fund benefits from a four-strong management team based in Leeds. Its objective is to generate an income higher than that of the FTSE All-Share Index plus investment growth over a three-to-five year period after fees and costs.Among the fund‚Äôs 48 investments are large holdings in Shell  AstraZeneca and Rio Tinto. The fund pays a quarterly dividend and currently yields approximately 3.6%  although this amount is not guaranteed8.The Fidelity Global Dividend Fund has a wider investing remit and the flexibility to invest in sectors and industries underrepresented in the UK  including technology. The fund has consistently grown its dividend payouts every year since launch in 2012  although this is not guaranteed to continue.Current large holdings include Proctor & Gamble  the scientific publisher RELX and the German stock markets operator Deutsche Boerse. The fund currently yields approximately 2.6%  an amount that is also not guaranteed9.Source:1 ONS  13.04.222 Bank of England  18.03.223 Bank of England  17.03.224 MoneySuperMarket.com  20.04.225 Link Group  20.01.226 FT and S&P Global  20.04.227 Janus Henderson  30.06.218 Franklin Templeton  31.03.229 Morningstar  19.04.2,negative,0.01,0.15,0.84,mixed,0.33,0.18,0.49,True,English,"['inflation beating income', 'way', 'S&P UK High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index', 'The Franklin UK Equity Income Fund', 'several high-quality equity income funds', 'many UK equity income funds', 'two to three years time', 'easy access cash account', 'high starting points', 'latest Dividend Monitor', 'UK consumer prices', 'recent sharp hikes', 'main asset classes', 'genuine pricing power', 'British American Tobacco', 'ten consecutive years', 'ultra-reliable income stream', 'higher interest rates', 'good track record', 'strong payments record', 'London Investment Trust', 'shorter term crises', 'increasing investment income', 'fewer special dividends', 'UK companies', 'high rate', 'open-ended funds', 'dividend heroes', 'dividend payouts', 'fixed income', 'income seekers', 'attractive income', 'remarkable 55 years', 'good news', 'latest thinking', 'headline payments', 'short term', 'long term', 'long time', 'investment trusts', 'weekly shop', 'supply chains', 'slower pace', 'demanding task', 'actual task', 'medium-term run', 'first thing', 'capital terms', 'additional help', 'primary purpose', 'best return', 'long run', 'Link Group', 'underlying basis', 'shareholder payouts', 'So strategies', 'diversified miners', 'best defence', 'longer run', 'Rio Tinto', 'BAE Systems', 'portfolio holdings', 'lean times', 'costly affair', 'Select 50 list', 'attractive yields', 'longer-term view', 'higher inflation', 'current rate', 'last year', 'next year', 'food prices', 'bond prices', 'most bonds', 'inflation-linked bonds', 'conventional bonds', 'rising one', 'Covid pandemic', 'other companies', 'current environment', 'inflation data', 'rising inflation', 'inflation expectations', 'inflation risk', 'new investors', 'Bank Rate', 'surprise', 'pause', 'thought', 'March', 'increase', 'car', 'fuel', 'cases', 'outlook', 'England', 'forecast', '2% target', 'items', 'hospitality', 'drivers', 'energy', 'disruptions', 'comparisons', 'annum', 'exception', 'value', 'bet', 'shares', '7% fall', 'scope', '2021 levels', 'flexibility', 'goods', 'services', 'ability', 'investments', 'beneficiaries', 'example', 'supermarkets', 'banks', 'GlaxoSmithKline', 'Legal', 'General', 'constituents', 'number', 'world', 'pile', 'City', 'row', 'advantage', 'premium', 'assets', 'Fidelity', 'potential']",2022-04-21,2022-04-21,fidelity.co.uk

Reportedly  these services will mainly target its institutional client base.German Bank Commerzbank pushing for crypto adoptionAs a rule  starting this year  any businesses in Germany wishing to offer crypto services had to acquire BaFin approval. Presently  the watchdog has only granted four companies a license to operate. Coinbase‚Äôs Germany branch was the first to get approval in June 2021. The most recent is the Berlin-based fintech firm Upvest  which acquired a license in March.Meanwhile  25 other businesses have their applications pending  with Commerzbank being the latest to join the queue.The move by Commerzbank is not a huge surprise since it has expressed huge interest in blockchain projects since 2018. The bank  alongside two others  conducted the first transactions on a security lending platform‚Äôs distributed ledger technology (DLT) in 2019.A more recent partnership was in August 2021. Commerzbank and Deutsche Boerse jointly invested in a company developing blockchain-based digital marketplaces for assets such as art and real estate.Crypto adoption in GermanyAll through 2021  Germany developed a set of regulations on blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The rules  though strict  concentrated on allowing adoption while protecting consumers and preventing criminal acts.For instance  laws under the ‚ÄúSpezialfonds‚Äù category allow institutional players to invest up to 20 percent of holdings in crypto. Union Investment  a 500-billion asset management giant in the country  was reportedly seeking Bitcoin exposure to several of its funds.Another law is the new German Money Laundering Act. went into effect at the beginning of the year. The Act allows financial institutions to offer their customers cryptocurrencies alongside traditional investment products  such as stocks and bonds.Already  Germany is showing signs of increased crypto adoption  other than the BaFin-approved crypto licenses. According to a March report by Kucoin  44 percent of Germans are ‚Äúmotivated to invest in cryptocurrencies.‚Äù Additionally  of those holding cryptocurrencies  37 percent of them began digital asset trading a year ago.,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.01,negative,0.03,0.21,0.77,True,English,"['German Bank Commerzbank Spearheads Crypto License Application', 'new German Money Laundering Act', '500-billion asset management giant', 'Federal Financial Supervisory Authority', 'Berlin-based fintech firm', 'security lending platform', 'distributed ledger technology', 'blockchain-based digital marketplaces', 'digital asset trading', 'local media outlet', 'largest banking institutions', 'traditional investment products', 'institutional client base', 'up to 20 percent', 'German Bank Commerzbank', 'crypto services license', 'crypto custody license', 'The Act', 'asset protection', 'financial institutions', 'financial regulator', 'Union Investment', '70,000 institutional clients', 'institutional players', 'crypto exchange', 'crypto licenses', 'local bank', 'first time', 'B√∂rsen-Zeitung', 'first quarter', 'crypto-related services', 'four companies', 'huge surprise', 'huge interest', 'two others', 'first transactions', 'recent partnership', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'real estate', 'criminal acts', 'Spezialfonds‚Äù category', 'Bitcoin exposure', 'crypto adoption', 'license application', 'first bank', '18 million customers', 'blockchain projects', 'March report', '25 other businesses', 'Germany branch', 'BaFin approval', '44 percent', '37 percent', 'Jan.', 'history', 'spokesperson', 'news', 'April', 'representative', 'feedback', 'country', 'note', 'list', 'rule', 'watchdog', 'Coinbase', 'June', 'Upvest', 'applications', 'queue', 'move', 'DLT', 'August', 'company', 'assets', 'regulations', 'cryptocurrencies', 'consumers', 'instance', 'laws', 'holdings', 'funds', 'effect', 'beginning', 'year', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'signs', 'BaFin-approved', 'Kucoin', 'Germans']",2022-04-21,2022-04-21,crypto-news-flash.com

The Notice of AGM and form of proxy have been published and are now available on the Company's website.Kenmare also announces  pursuant to FCA Listing Rule 12.4.4  that it is seeking authority from shareholders at the AGM to implement an odd-lot offer (""Odd-lot Offer"") at any time within 18 months from the date of the AGM. This is in addition to it seeking approval at the AGM of a renewal of the Company's existing authority to make market purchases of its own shares.Overview of Odd-Lot OfferUnder an Odd-lot Offer  eligible certificated shareholders holding fewer than 200 ordinary shares in Kenmare (the ‚ÄúOdd-lot Holders‚Äù) will be offered the opportunity to sell their shares at a 5% premium to the market price.As a result of Kenmare‚Äôs restructuring and recapitalisation in 2016  the Company‚Äôs share register has an unusually large number of small shareholders. Kenmare has a total of approximately 3 800 registered holders of ordinary shares  of which over 3 500 (92%) are small shareholders who hold fewer than 200 ordinary shares. This represents in aggregate  less than 0.2% of the total number of ordinary shares in issue.The rationale for an Odd-lot Offer is three-fold:‚Ä¢ the ability of small shareholders to deal their shares (and to cash their dividend cheques) is constrained by disproportionate dealing costs and banking charges;‚Ä¢ based on Kenmare‚Äôs experience with mailing Annual Reports and dividend cheques  the Company believes that a number of these small shareholders are inactive: they (or their estates) may not realise that they have a small holding in the Company or may not value that small holding; andStory continues‚Ä¢ the Company‚Äôs recurring costs of administration resulting from the relatively large number of shareholders are disproportionate to the size of these small shareholdings and affect shareholders as a whole.By carrying out an Odd-lot Offer  the Directors will facilitate the disposal by eligible Odd-lot Holders of their shares at a 5% premium without the dealing costs that would typically render such disposal uneconomic  whilst giving active shareholders the ability to opt-out.As part of the arrangements  shareholders are asked to approve a change to the Company‚Äôs Articles of Association so that eligible Odd-lot Holders who do not respond to the Odd-lot Offer  if made  are deemed to have agreed to accept it. Odd-lot Holders who wish to retain their Kenmare shares will be able to opt-out of participating in the Odd-lot Offer by completing and returning the relevant form in accordance with instructions.The actual timing for  and implementation of the proposed Odd-lot Offer will be decided by the Directors and will be at their sole discretion. Full details in respect of the proposed resolutions are set out in the Notice of AGM.Notice of AGMThe Notice of AGM and form of proxy are available on the Company's website  in addition to the Annual Report 2021 as previously announced  by clicking here .The Annual Report 2021 and Notice of AGM are today being posted to shareholders who have elected to receive them in the coming days.Copies of the above documents will be submitted to Euronext Dublin and the UK National Storage Mechanism and will shortly be available for inspection at the following links:Euronext Dublin OAM Filingand atNational Storage MechanismFor further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Doug Keatingedkeatinge@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 037 4163About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world‚Äôs largest producers of mineral sands products.

This valuation was impacted by the increase in the Median‚Äôs share price since the equity warrant issue. It was accounted for in the balance sheet under financial instruments  and will not impact Median‚Äôs cash position.Median Technologies informs its shareholders and the financial community that its annual financial report on the accounts for the year ending December 31  2021 has been made available and filed with the French financial markets authority (Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers).The annual financial report is available on the Company‚Äôs website: http://www.mediantechnologies.com/investors/Forward-looking statements This press release contains forward-looking statements.

Our financial metrics for the first quarter clearly demonstrated our ability to scale. Our commercial cartridge volumes continued to increase globally  with nearly 2 000 Idylla‚Ñ¢ instruments installed  increasing product revenues to EUR 10.1m in Q1 2022. The growth was particularly strong in oncology with 42% higher cartridge revenue compared to Q1 2021  whereas the revenue contribution for COVID-19 testing expectedly reduced by half year-on-year. The gross margin on product sales increased to 34.6%  a solid step-up from 16% in 2021. Unlike last year  we are producing at significantly higher capacity and productivity levels  as we leverage our fully automated second manufacturing line ML2.

The abstract publication receives a designated oral presentation during the 18th Congress of the European Association of Dermato-oncology (EADO) in Sevilla  Spain (21-23 April 2022).The Merlin Test identifies melanoma patients that have a low risk for nodal metastasis and therefore can safely forgo a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) surgery. This is an invasive surgical procedure used to determine metastatic spread of the cancer for staging purposes. In approximately 80% of the surgeries  the biopsy comes back negative for metastasis and does not further impact the patient pathway. The Merlin Test provides a more personalized insight on the metastatic propensity of the tumor  and how patients with a low-risk tumor could avoid the surgery2.Four melanoma medical centers from the Netherlands are leading this prospective multicenter study which is currently still ongoing. The study was initiated during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to allow for surgical triage on SLNB and to evaluate the implementation of the Merlin Test in clinical practice. Results of this prospective trial confirm the performance of previously published European and US retrospective validation studies in real world practice.On 22 April 2021  Biocartis and SkylineDx announced a partnership aimed at developing SkylineDx‚Äô novel proprietary test  the Merlin Test  on Biocartis‚Äô rapid and easy-to-use molecular diagnostics platform Idylla‚Ñ¢. In the US  the Merlin Test is already available as an internal Laboratory Developed Test in SkylineDx‚Äô CAP/CLIA laboratory in San Diego (California  US). Under the terms of the partnership agreement  SkylineDx will lead the development of the Merlin Test on Idylla‚Ñ¢  while Biocartis will lead the commercialization in Europe through its growing Idylla‚Ñ¢ network. Ahead of the launch of the Merlin Test on Idylla‚Ñ¢  Biocartis will already commercialize the test kit version of the Merlin Test for in vitro diagnostic use in Europe.Story continuesHerman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: ‚ÄúPresenting this new prospective data at the EADO conference is a great way to initiate our joint commercial activities with SkylineDx  addressing mainly centralized expert laboratories in Europe.‚Äù‚ÄúEADO 2022 will be the first European conference that we attend together with our collaboration partner Biocartis‚Äù  comments Dharminder Chahal  CEO SkylineDx. ‚ÄúIt is exciting that in our first collective outreach we are able to show new prospective data that further strengthens the scientific solidity and clinical relevance of our Merlin Test‚Äù.The commercial launch of the test kit version of the Merlin Test for in vitro diagnostic use in Europe is planned in the second half of 2022.--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisBiocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) is an innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) company providing next generation diagnostic solutions aimed at improving clinical practice for the benefit of patients  clinicians  payers and industry.

Our financial metrics for the first quarter clearly demonstrated our ability to scale. Our commercial cartridge volumes continued to increase globally  with nearly 2 000 Idylla‚Ñ¢ instruments installed  increasing product revenues to EUR 10.1m in Q1 2022. The growth was particularly strong in oncology with 42% higher cartridge revenue compared to Q1 2021  whereas the revenue contribution for COVID-19 testing expectedly reduced by half year-on-year. The gross margin on product sales increased to 34.6%  a solid step-up from 16% in 2021. Unlike last year  we are producing at significantly higher capacity and productivity levels  as we leverage our fully automated second manufacturing line ML2. As a result  our operating cash burn was reduced to EUR 10.3m  compared to EUR 13.7m in Q1 2021. We believe we are clearly on track to achieve our stated targets for 2022 and to take a next step towards profitability.‚ÄùQ1 2022 HIGHLIGHTSProduct revenue of EUR 10.1m (Q1 2021: EUR 8.6m)  of which EUR 8.1m revenue from 79.8k cartridges sold: Continued strong growth in oncology  led by the US  and an overall EUR 6.7m revenue in oncology  42% higher than in Q1 2021 As expected  the contribution of cartridge revenues in infectious diseases reduced to 10% of total product revenues as COVID-19 testing demand continues to diminish Average Sales Price (ASP) per commercial cartridge of EUR 114 in oncology and EUR 101 overall 48 net new Idylla‚Ñ¢ instruments placed  adding to a total global installed base of 1 960Gross margin on product sales of 35%  compared to 16% for the entire year 2021.Operating cash burn 1 of EUR -10.3m and cash position of EUR 37.3m (unaudited figure) end of Q1 2022.

Fuel prices surged  in a context of post-COVID economic recovery combined with a decline in supply since the onset of the conflict in Ukraine.Excluding the effect of fuel prices  revenue increased by 4% thanks to the good availability of the facilities  maintenance shutdowns during the quarter having been carried out without problems.The availability rate was 90.5% in the first quarter of 2022  as against 83.3% in the first quarter of 2021 and power generation from thermal facilities reached 399 GWh  compared with 437 GWh in the first quarter of 2021  reflecting the continued decline in call rates by EDF in R√©union in connection with the high prices of coal and CO 2 .Story continuesConstruction and development of projectsWork continues on converting Albioma‚Äôs Bois-Rouge power station to 100% biomassConversion of the Bois-Rouge power plant to 100% biomass moved ahead smoothly in the early part of 2022.

Edenred is thus confirming its sustainable and profitable growth trajectory. All regions delivered double-digit growth  driven by a remarkable performance from our Employee Benefits and Fleet & Mobility Solutions.Thanks to its unique digital platform  Edenred is asserting itself quarter after quarter as the innovation leader in its markets. Our value proposition is constantly being broadened with new solutions in line with our clients‚Äô expectations  as well as new features that improve and streamline the user experience.We are therefore confident in our ability to maintain a sustained pace of growth for the rest of the year  driven by favorable post-Covid trends and a macroeconomic environment that strengthens the appeal of our solutions.‚ÄùFIRST-QUARTER 2022 TOTAL REVENUEStory continues(in ‚Ç¨ millions) First-quarter 2022 First-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Operating revenue 426 363 +17.3% +15.3% Other revenue 13 10 +28.9% +29.7% Total revenue 439 373 +17.6% +15.7%Total revenueTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2022 came to ‚Ç¨439 million  up 17.6% year on year as reported  including a favorable currency effect (+2.4%) and a slightly negative scope effect (-0.5%). On a like-for-like basis  total revenue was up 15.7%.Operating revenueOperating revenue came to ‚Ç¨426 million in the first three months of 2022  up 17.3% as reported  including a favorable currency effect (+2.5%) and a negative scope effect (-0.5%). On a like-for-like basis  operating revenue rose by 15.3% year on year.This very good performance follows on from the positive trends already observed in 2021. Operating revenue growth was notably driven by continued strong sales momentum  both in the very buoyant SME segment and in key accounts  with contract wins with iconic clients such as Google in France and FedEx in Brazil and Mexico.During the first quarter  the Group also continued to develop new services as part of its Beyond Food and Beyond Fuel strategy. The partnership in Europe with ChargePoint  a leading global electric vehicle charging network provider  is just one example. This partnership provides Edenred clients in Europe with access to more than 240 000 public electric charge points across 32 countries  enabling Edenred to support fleet managers in their transition to electric mobility.The Group‚Äôs performance also benefited from a macroeconomic environment that further strengthened the appeal of Edenred‚Äôs solutions. With governments and companies looking to protect employees‚Äô purchasing power  introducing new benefits or increasing the face value of existing benefits have emerged as effective responses. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  the increase in fuel prices at the pump has encouraged fleet managers to exercise even tighter control over costs.Operating revenue by business line(in ‚Ç¨ millions) First-quarter 2022 First-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Employee Benefits 256 223 +15.1% +14.2% Fleet & Mobility Solutions 117 90 +29.6% +24.3% Complementary Solutions 53 50 +5.0% +3.9% Total 426 363 +17.3% +15.3%Operating revenue for the Employee Benefits business line  which accounts for 60% of the Group‚Äôs total operating revenue  was ‚Ç¨256 million in first-quarter 2022  a 15.1% year-on-year increase as reported (+14.2% like-for-like).This growth was once again driven by strong sales momentum  reflected in the ever-increasing penetration of the SME segment  as well as the success of the Group‚Äôs solutions with key accounts. With the world of work undergoing a radical transformation  Edenred continued to roll out its Beyond Food offering  designed notably to support clients looking to enhance their appeal and boost staff engagement. The multi-product offering of employee benefits in Brazil (Ticket Superflex)  for example  met with major commercial success  as did platforms to equip employees for remote working in France and Mexico. Lastly  the first-quarter performance also benefited from a favorable basis of comparison due to the impact of Covid-related restrictions  notably in Europe  in the first quarter of 2021.In the Fleet & Mobility Solutions business line  which accounts for 27% of the Group‚Äôs total operating revenue  operating revenue for first-quarter 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨117 million  up 29.6% year on year as reported (+24.3% like-for-like).This strong growth reflects the continued rollout of the Beyond Fuel strategy  notably through the maintenance and toll offering  which is proving highly successful in Europe and Latin America. The February acquisition of Greenpass  an issuer of e-toll solutions in Brazil  is fully in line with this strategy. The business also enjoyed strong sales momentum once again  driven by the relevance of its digital and multi-product offering for fleet managers. In addition  high oil prices in the first three months of the year contributed to greater business volumes compared with the first quarter of 2021.The Complementary Solutions business line  which includes Corporate Payment Services  Incentive & Rewards and Public Social Programs  generated revenue of ‚Ç¨53 million in first-quarter 2022  representing 13% of the Group total. This figure was up 5.0% as reported (+3.9% like-for-like) compared with the first quarter of 2021.Corporate Payment Services in North America  operated through CSI  recorded a solid performance  driven by new contract wins and the steady improvement in volumes generated by clients in the media and hospitality segments.The growth posted in this business line was impacted by a high basis of comparison as a result of the implementation in first-quarter 2021 of several specific earmarked funds programs for people hard hit by the health crisis  notably in Romania and the United Kingdom.Operating revenue by region(in ‚Ç¨ millions) First-quarter 2022 First-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 270 237 +13.8% +13.4% Latin America 123 97 +26.5% +16.5% Rest of the World 33 29 +14.3% +26.0% Total 426 363 +17.3% +15.3%In Europe   operating revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨270 million in the first quarter  a year-on-year increase of 13.8% as reported (+13.4% like-for-like). Europe accounted for 63% of total consolidated operating revenue in first-quarter 2022.In France  operating revenue came in at ‚Ç¨76 million for the first quarter  up 10.3% as reported and like-for-like. This performance notably reflects the commercial success of Ticket Restaurant¬Æ  the market‚Äôs number one name and digital leader  offering a simple and flexible solution for clients and a constantly improving experience based on innovative new features for users. Solutions rolled out as part of the Beyond Food strategy (such as Ticket Mobilit√©¬Æ and the remote working platform) and the Fleet & Mobility Solutions offering also contributed to sharp growth in the first quarter.Operating revenue in Europe excluding France totaled ‚Ç¨194 million in first-quarter 2022  an increase of 15.3% as reported (+14.8% like-for-like) versus the prior-year period. Employee Benefits recorded a solid performance  driven by robust growth in Ticket Restaurant¬Æ. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  continued rollout of the Beyond Fuel strategy also contributed to the significant growth recorded in the first quarter.Operating revenue in Latin America came to ‚Ç¨123 million for the first quarter  a rise of 26.5% as reported (+16.5% like-for-like) compared with the same period in 2021.In Brazil  operating revenue rose by 29.1% as reported (+16.5% like-for-like) in first-quarter 2022 versus first-quarter 2021. This significant increase reflects strong momentum in Fleet & Mobility Solutions  driven notably by the ongoing deployment of maintenance and toll management solutions  along with the growing contribution of the partnership with Ita√∫ Unibanco to sales performance in Employee Benefits.In Hispanic Latin America  operating revenue was up 21.0% as reported (+16.6% like-for-like) in first-quarter 2022 versus the same period in 2021. Employee Benefits business in the region is recovering as the health crisis subsides. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  Edenred continued to gradually roll out its Beyond Fuel offering (tolls and maintenance).In the Rest of the World   operating revenue came to ‚Ç¨33 million for the first quarter  up 14.3% as reported and up 26.0% like-for-like. This performance was notably spurred by the success of paperless and plasticless digital solutions in Taiwan. In North America  CSI‚Äôs Corporate Payment Services maintained the good momentum seen in late 2021  fueled notably by the distribution partnerships entered into with several banks  including the Commercial Cards division of international bank Citi one year ago.Other revenueOther revenue for the first quarter of 2022 totaled ‚Ç¨13 million  up 28.9% as reported (+29.7% like-for-like). This rise reflects the increase in float2 resulting from the high level of business in the first quarter  as well as higher interest rates in European countries outside the euro zone and in Latin America.OUTLOOKFollowing on from historic results in 2021  the solid performance recorded in the first quarter of 2022 reflects Edenred‚Äôs ability to leverage its unique digital platform to continue along a sustainable and profitable growth trajectory. The Group‚Äôs commercial momentum continues to be driven by the addition of new digital  multi-product solutions adapted to the needs and expectations of clients in its three business lines. Building on these innovative and relevant solutions  Edenred will continue to penetrate its markets and thereby support changing behaviors and structural trends  such as remote working as a permanent feature in the workplace  green commuting  the consumption of eco-friendly products and the transition of fleets to electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.Edenred also expects to continue benefiting from a favorable macroeconomic environment  and in particular from the inflationary context  which is encouraging public authorities and companies to increase the face value of Employee Benefits solutions and prompting fleet managers to prioritize expense management solutions.Edenred is therefore reaffirming its confidence for 2022  and intends to maintain a sustained pace of growth in all regions where the Group operates and in each business line.As a result  for 2022  the Group is confirming the annual targets set in its Next Frontier strategic plan:like-for-like operating revenue growth of more than 8%;like-for-like EBITDA growth of more than 10%;free cash flowithEBITDA conversion rate of more than 65%3.SIGNIFICANT EVENT IN THE FIRST QUARTEREdenred strengthens its toll offering in Brazil with the acquisition of GreenpassOn February 22  Edenred announced that it had acquired a 51% controlling interest in Greenpass  an issuer of electronic toll solutions in Brazil. The deal strengthens Edenred‚Äôs position in this business as well as its technology and sales capabilities in an attractive market offering significant cross-selling potential with its client base. It is fully in line with the Group‚Äôs Beyond Fuel strategy to develop new non-fuel fleet and mobility services  enhancing its value proposition for fleet managers and expanding its addressable market.SUBSEQUENT EVENTUTA Edenred partners with ChargePointOn April 5  Edenred announced a partnership with ChargePoint  a leading electric vehicle charging network provider in Europe and in the USA. This partnership enables customers of UTA Edenred  a leading mobility service provider in Europe  to access over 240 000 public electric charge points across 32 European countries.

We will present our medium-term roadmap at our Capital Markets Day on June 16.‚ÄùSALES REVIEW FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31  2022Unless otherwise stated  all comments are on a constant and adjusted basis and  for sales  at same number of working days.SALESIn Q1  sales were up +31.4% year-on-year on a reported basis and +16.0% on a constant and same-day basis  reflecting positive momentum in all three geographies.Key figures (‚Ç¨m) Q1 2022 YoY change Sales on a reported basis 4 377.4 +31.4% On a constant and actual-day basis +19.1% On a constant and same-day basis +16.0%In the first quarter Rexel posted sales of ‚Ç¨4 377.4m  up +31.4% on a reported basis  including:A positive currency effect of ‚Ç¨104.3m (i.e. +3.1% of Q1 2021 sales)  mainly due to the appreciation of the US & Canadian dollars against the euroA positive net scope effect of ‚Ç¨240.0m (i.e. +7.2% of Q1 2021 sales) mainly due to Mayer acquisition in the USA positive calendar effect of +3.1%  largely resulting from specific US accounting rules.On a constant and same-day basis  sales were up +16.0%  as a result of:An excellent performance in North America  with further recovery  and strong resilience in Europe on more difficult base effects  offsetting lower growth in Asia-Pacific as business recovered from the pandemic earlier than in other geographiesStrong underlying trends from electrification and growing demand for energy efficiency solutions in a context of rising energy costs  as illustrated by growth of product categories such as PV  EV or HVAC at rates above Group averageA favorable pricing environment for both cable (4.1% contribution in Q1 2022 vs 2.9% in Q1 2021) and non-cable (9.1% contribution in the quarter) products  resulting from a carryover effect of price increases passed in 2021 and an additional rise recorded in 2022Further growth in digitalization in all three geographies  with digital sales now representing 25.5% of Group sales excluding Mayer  up +201bps compared to Q1 2021  or 23.6% of sales  up +177bps including Mayer  considering its low digital penetration. Trends were positive in Europe (up to 35.0% of sales  an increase of +166bps)  North America (up to 12.4% of sales  an increase of +304bps including Mayer) and Asia-Pacific (4.6% of sales  up +72bps).In the quarter  the tensions on the supply chain remained unchanged and we don‚Äôt expect any improvement before the second part of the year  as visibility remains low (lockdown in China  Russia/Ukraine war). This ‚Äúscarcity environment‚Äù continues to be an opportunity for Rexel  as we continue to help our customers deal with product shortages and labor availability to unlock productivity gains.Europe (52% of Group sales): +13.6% in Q1 on a constant and same-day basisIn the first quarter  sales in Europe increased by +15.6% on a reported basis  including a positive currency effect of +0.6%  or ‚Ç¨12.1m  mainly due to the appreciation of the British pound and the Swiss Franc against the euro and a negative scope effect of (0.2)%  or ‚Ç¨(4.9)m  from the disposals of our activity in Russia in March 2022 and a small business in France in Q1 2021. On a constant and same-day basis  sales were up +13.6%.Key figures (‚Ç¨m) Q1 2022 YoY change Europe 2 284.8 +13.6% France 865.5 +10.4% Scandinavia 278.5 +12.5% Benelux 257.5 +16.8% Germany 226.5 +17.0% UK 223.4 +18.0% Switzerland 145.3 +5.6% Austria 129.3 +16.7% Southern Europe 85.8 +21.9%Overall in Europe  activity remained robust  still driven by proximity and renovation activities. Acceleration in volume and price increases on non-cable products drove the good performance in Q1 22  despite continuing limitations caused by supply chain tensions. More specifically  in our larger countries:Sales in France (38% of the region‚Äôs sales) were up +10.4%  with similar progression in all 3 end-markets. The quarter was marked by significant market outperformance and increased digital penetration (28.4% of sales  up 328bps). Service and EV activities contributed positively to the overall performance.Sales in Scandinavia (12% of the region‚Äôs sales) were up +12.5%  with a slow start to the year  notably in Sweden  due to the pandemic. Trends significantly accelerated in March. Q1 sales growth was largely driven by the residential & commercial markets and boosted by PV activity.Benelux (11% of the region‚Äôs sales) grew by +16.8%  with strong demand in the residential market in Belux  boosted by robust growth from green products  now representing 10% of sales. Growth in the Netherlands was also boosted by renewable energy products (PV/EV/HVAC up c. 40% yoy)  in a context of rising energy prices.Sales in Germany (10% of the region‚Äôs sales) posted strong +17.0% growth  supported by residential & industrial markets. Residential was boosted by PV demand (up 190%  contributing for 550bps). Industrial demand was driven by metal  energy & water markets offsetting low demand in automotive.In the UK (10% of the region‚Äôs sales)  sales increased by +18.0%  with a strong demand in residential and commercial markets. The pipeline is robust in all 3 markets.Disposal of our Russian activityWith circa ‚Ç¨10m of revenues generated in 2021  Rexel had limited exposure to Russia (below 0.1% of Group sales).Following recent events in the region  Rexel took the decision to fully dispose this activity through a Management Buy Out (MBO) that was completed on March 23  2022.North America (40% of Group sales): +21.6% in Q1 on a constant and same-day basisIn the first quarter  sales in North America increased by +67.5% on a reported basis  including a positive currency effect of +7.4%  or ‚Ç¨78.1m  due to the appreciation of the US & Canadian dollars against the euro  a positive scope effect of +23.7%  or ‚Ç¨249.8m  from the acquisition of Mayer in the US  as well as a positive calendar effect of +6.1%. On a constant and same-day basis  sales were up +21.6%  driven by the US and Canada.Key figures (‚Ç¨m) Q1 2022 YoY change North America 1 764.6 +21.6% Total US 1 432.3 +23.2% Mayer +27.5% US excl.

Backlogs further increased in the quarter.In the US (81% of the region‚Äôs sales)  sales posted solid +23.2% growth on a same-day basis  with positive trends in all regions including the Northwest  despite a difficult base effect  and significant recovery in the Mountain Plains (robust demand in Las Vegas and Denver) and Gulf Central (recovery in Oil & Gas sector) regions. By market  all three end-markets grew at a similar pace with further positive development in commercial and residential and recovery from a lower base in industry. The backlog remains healthy  up +63% at end of March 2022 yoy. Mayer is progressing well  up +27.5%  and the integration process is occurring smoothly. We are on track to achieve our upgraded synergy ambitions presented in February 2022.In Canada (19% of the region‚Äôs sales)  sales grew by +14.9% on a same-day basis  Q1 performance was driven by the industrial end-market up c. 20%  contributing for c. 900bps notably boosted by robust demand in oil & gas and mining.Asia-Pacific (8% of Group sales): +5.5% in Q1 on a constant and same-day basisIn the first quarter  sales in Asia-Pacific were up +9.1% on a reported basis  including a positive currency effect of +4.7%  or ‚Ç¨14.2m  mainly due to the appreciation of the Chinese renminbi against the euro and a negative scope effect of (1.7)%  or ‚Ç¨(5.0)m  related to the disposal of Rexel Saudi Arabia in Q4 2021. On a constant and same-day basis  sales were up +5.5%.Key figures (‚Ç¨m) Q1 2022 YoY change Asia-Pacific 328.0 +5.5% Australia 131.3 +4.1% China 145.5 +4.8%In the Pacific (49% of the region‚Äôs sales)  sales were up +5.5% on a constant and same-day basis. More specifically: In Australia (82% of Pacific‚Äôs sales)  sales increased by +4.1%  boosted by price increases  offsetting a slow start to the year  impacted by difficult weather conditions notably in the New South Wales & Queensland regions as well as Covid-related staff shortages.In Asia (51% of the region‚Äôs sales)  sales increased by +5.5% on a constant and same-day basis: In China (86% of Asia‚Äôs sales)  sales were up +4.8%. The acceleration was supported by demand from municipalities  renewables and infrastructure & transportation  offsetting the lack of demand in automotive and food & beverage as a result of chip shortages as well as the continuing pandemic situation. The quarter benefited from selling price increases. Orders are growing significantly. We anticipate the coming quarter to be impacted by the recent local lockdowns that took place in large cities.FY 2022 OUTLOOKWe remain confident we will achieve our 2022 objectives despite geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties.Leveraging our transformation and enhanced efficiency  we target for 2022  at comparable scope of consolidation and exchange rates*:Same-day sales growth of between 4% and 6%An adjusted EBITA 1 margin above 6%Free cash flow conversion2 above 60%* Assuming no severe deterioration of the sanitary environmentAn updated strategic roadmap  will be presented at a Capital Markets Day to be held at our Group's biggest branch in Zurich on June 16  2022.1 Excluding (i) amortization of PPA and (ii) the non-recurring effect related to changes in copper-based cable prices.2 FCF Before interest and tax/EBITDAaLNB: The estimated impacts per quarter of (i) calendar effects by geography  (ii) changes in the consolidation scope and (iii) currency fluctuations (based on assumptions of average rates over the rest of the year for the Group's main currencies) are detailed in appendix 2.CALENDARJune 3  2022 Ex-dividend dateJune 7  2022 Dividend Payment of ‚Ç¨0.75 per share (issue premium)June 16  2022 Capital Markets DayJuly 28  2022 First-half 2022 resultsFINANCIAL INFORMATIONA slideshow of the first quarter 2022 sales is available on the Group‚Äôs website.ABOUT REXEL GROUPRexel  worldwide expert in the multichannel professional distribution of products and services for the energy world  addresses three main markets: residential  commercial  and industrial.

Cables accounted for approximately 17% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group‚Äôs sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group‚Äôs total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

Based on its performance in the first three months  Sartorius Stedim Biotech confirms its outlook for fiscal 2022.Sartorius (PRNewsfoto/Sartorius AG)""Sartorius Stedim Biotech had a good start to 2022. We continued to grow  and our margin remained at a high level despite rising logistics and material costs as well as negative influences from currencies. The pandemic-related effects and the development of order intake are normalizing  as expected. Demand for our products is high in all segments and our investments in the expansion of production capacities are making good progress. In addition  the acquisition of the chromatography business of Novasep further strengthened our positioning in downstream processing. In light of the positive performance in the first three months and the healthy demand situation  we are confirming our outlook for the current fiscal year. However  the global political and economic uncertainties have increased substantially with the outbreak of war in Ukraine  further increasing the strain on supply chains and the risks arising from significantly higher inflation rates "" said Joachim Kreuzburg  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.Business development of the Group1Story continuesIn the first quarter  Group sales revenue rose by 27.6 percent year-over-year in constant currencies (reported: +31.6 percent) to around 862 million euros. The performance was driven by strong organic growth across the portfolio  while acquisitions2 contributed almost 2 percentage points to the increase. All three business regions ‚Äì EMEA3  Americas  and Asia | Pacific ‚Äì posted double-digit percentage growth in constant currencies.Order intake was in line with expectations compared with the exceptionally strong prior-year quarter  reaching 950 million euros (- 8.6 percent in constant currencies; reported: - 5.5 percent). The first quarters of 2021 were influenced by extraordinarily high demand related to the coronavirus pandemic and changed ordering patterns by some customers  who placed their orders further in advance than usual.As a result from the growth in sales revenue  underlying EBITDA rose by 31.1 percent to 304 million euros in the first quarter. The corresponding margin remained largely stable at 35.2 percent (prior-year quarter: 35.4 percent) despite being impacted by negative currency effects. Relevant net profit rose 34.4 percent to 203 million euros  and underlying earnings per share were 2.21 euros (prior-year quarter: 1.64 euros).Key financial indicatorsThe Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base. As of March 31  2022  its equity ratio stood at 48.1 percent (December 31  2021: 43.9 percent). Net debt to underlying EBITDA remained at 0.4 percent  as at year-end 2021. Cash flow from investing activities stood at ‚Äì77 million euros as planned  compared to ‚Äì62 million euros in the first quarter of 2021. The ratio of capital expenditures (CAPEX) to sales revenue reached 8.9 percent  compared with 9.5 percent in the prior-year period.Increase in the number of employeesAs of March 31  2022  Sartorius Stedim Biotech employed a total of 11 400 people worldwide  representing a headcount increase of 991 from the end of December 2021.Outlook for fiscal 2022 confirmedThe management confirms the outlook for the current fiscal year. Consolidated sales revenue is expected to increase by about 15 percent to 19 percent  with non-organic growth from acquisitions projected to contribute about 2 percentage points. The company's underlying EBITDA margin is expected to reach more than 35 percent this year.The CAPEX ratio is anticipated to be about 14.5 percent and net debt to underlying EBITDA to be about 0.2 at year-end. Possible further acquisitions are not included in this projection.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. In addition  management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the life science and biopharma sectors have increased over the past years and the coronavirus pandemic has further amplified these trends. Accordingly  current forecasts show even higher uncertainties than usual. Furthermore  the forecasts are based on the assumption of no further deterioration in the geopolitical and global economic situation  supply chains and inflation  and no new large-scale restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic.1 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

It makes data accessible to all for innovation and competitiveness purposes. .To meet these challenges  WALLIX has developed a vision  ""PAM for all""  an approach that has given rise to WALLIX PAM4ALL  a unified solution bringing together all WALLIX technologies to secure all user access - human or machine - in an organization  according to the principle of least privilege.PARIS  April 21  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- To meet the new challenges of the digital world  WALLIX (Euronext: ALLIX)  a European publisher of cybersecurity software and expert in access and identity security  has developed a vision  ""PAM for all""  enabling it to offer its customers the promise of a secure digital transformation for all. To realize this vision  WALLIX now offers WALLIX PAM4ALL  a unified solution that brings together all WALLIX technologies and goes beyond the protection of privileged accounts by securing  according to the principle of least privilege  all at-risk users and workstations in an organization.The new challenges of digital technologyThe need to secure access to data has never been greater. With the pandemic  our world is experiencing an acceleration of its digital transformation (standardization of teleworking  massification of cloud services  strong growth in the number of mobile terminals...). These new uses  which allowed organizations to continue to operate during these long months of lockdown  considerably multiply the number of access points to organizations' IT infrastructure. There are so many new potential entry points for hackers that they must be secured urgently to protect data. Moreover  the results of 2021 are clear: 40 billion pieces of personal data have been hacked  an increase of 78% compared to 2020[1].This figure will grow as cybercrime becomes more industrialized  thus considerably increasing the cyber risk to our economy. Today  hacker organizations operate like companies  which is why cybercrime is currently considered the third largest economy in the world. Its global cost is estimated to be $6 trillion by 2021 and $10.5 trillion by 2025  up from $3 trillion in 2015[2] This cost includes damage and destruction of personal and/or financial data  loss of productivity  embezzlement  fraud  theft of money  but also of intellectual property and damage to reputation. There are also the costs incurred by the disruption of the organization's activity  sometimes for a long period of time after the attack  and finally the investments required to restore the hacked data and systems.We are living in a paradigm shift where perimeter security no longer exists  where users - whether humans or machines - are increasingly mobile and need to access organizations' data  at any time  from anywhere. Data itself is becoming volatile (cloud storage  SaaS solutions  automation...) to control costs and gain agility. This affects all sectors  especially the most critical ones such as healthcare  industry  insurance  or public services  which urgently need to secure all these access  to ensure business continuity  while respecting regulatory requirements in terms of risk management and data protection. Data must remain accessible to all in order to continue to innovate and thus ensure economic competitiveness.The answer: WALLIX PAM4ALLIn the current context  it is essential for organizations to secure their IT access and not only the most sensitive accounts (privileged accounts). WALLIX PAM4ALL is a unified solution combining all WALLIX technologies  which goes beyond securing privileged accounts  and protects  according to the principle of least privilege  user access and workstations  to avoid contamination by malware or ransomware. At some point in their daily functions  all users need privileges to access certain digital resources in the organization. The challenge is to provide access at the right time  at the right privilege level  to perform the expected task  regardless of where the user is located  whether inside or outside the company.WALLIX PAM4ALL provides access control and visibility over:All users: employees  suppliers  partners  humans  or machinesemployees  suppliers  partners  humans  or machines All sessionsAll the company's strategic assetsAll the company's endpointsTo do this  WALLIX PAM4ALL combines WALLIX technologies in one single solution:Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):To neutralize the risks associated with compromised credentialsTo neutralize the risks associated with compromised credentials Remote Access Management:To enable remote access for vendors  employees  or third-party maintainersTo enable remote access for vendors  employees  or third-party maintainers Session Management:To monitor  track  and audit sessionsTo monitor  track  and audit sessions Password management:To secure and rotate passwords and keys  and remove hard passwordsTo secure and rotate passwords and keys  and remove hard passwords Least privilege management:To grant the right access rights to the right user at the right time  thus stopping the spread of malware by blocking lateral and vertical movement in the network.""WALLIX PAM4ALL is the promise of a secure digital transformation for all organizations  in a rapidly changing digital context. With PAM4ALL  our customers have the means to quickly implement a Zero-Trust architecture thanks to strong user authentication  access control adapted to each user (human or machine)  at the right time (Just-In-Time)  and to integrate traceability in the IT infrastructure. It is also the possibility to have a dynamic view of the activity on your network and to protect yourself from advanced threats  particularly malware.

Based on its performance in the first three months  Sartorius Stedim Biotech confirms its outlook for fiscal 2022.""Sartorius Stedim Biotech had a good start to 2022. We continued to grow  and our margin remained at a high level despite rising logistics and material costs as well as negative influences from currencies. The pandemic-related effects and the development of order intake are normalizing  as expected. Demand for our products is high in all segments and our investments in the expansion of production capacities are making good progress. In addition  the acquisition of the chromatography business of Novasep further strengthened our positioning in downstream processing. In light of the positive performance in the first three months and the healthy demand situation  we are confirming our outlook for the current fiscal year. However  the global political and economic uncertainties have increased substantially with the outbreak of war in Ukraine  further increasing the strain on supply chains and the risks arising from significantly higher inflation rates "" said Joachim Kreuzburg  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.Business development of the Group1In the first quarter  Group sales revenue rose by 27.6 percent year-over-year in constant currencies (reported: +31.6 percent) to around 862 million euros. The performance was driven by strong organic growth across the portfolio  while acquisitions2 contributed almost 2 percentage points to the increase. All three business regions ‚Äì EMEA3  Americas  and Asia | Pacific ‚Äì posted double-digit percentage growth in constant currencies.Order intake was in line with expectations compared with the exceptionally strong prior-year quarter  reaching 950 million euros (- 8.6 percent in constant currencies; reported: - 5.5 percent). The first quarters of 2021 were influenced by extraordinarily high demand related to the coronavirus pandemic and changed ordering patterns by some customers  who placed their orders further in advance than usual.As a result from the growth in sales revenue  underlying EBITDA rose by 31.1 percent to 304 million euros in the first quarter. The corresponding margin remained largely stable at 35.2 percent (prior-year quarter: 35.4 percent) despite being impacted by negative currency effects. Relevant net profit rose 34.4 percent to 203 million euros  and underlying earnings per share were 2.21 euros (prior-year quarter: 1.64 euros).Key financial indicatorsThe Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base.

Consolidated sales revenue is expected to increase by about 15 percent to 19 percent  with non-organic growth from acquisitions projected to contribute about 2 percentage points. The company's underlying EBITDA margin is expected to reach more than 35 percent this year.The CAPEX ratio is anticipated to be about 14.5 percent and net debt to underlying EBITDA to be about 0.2 at year-end. Possible further acquisitions are not included in this projection.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. In addition  management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the life science and biopharma sectors have increased over the past years and the coronavirus pandemic has further amplified these trends. Accordingly  current forecasts show even higher uncertainties than usual. Furthermore  the forecasts are based on the assumption of no further deterioration in the geopolitical and global economic situation  supply chains and inflation  and no new large-scale restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic.1 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

Every year  more than 10 000 people are diagnosed in Europe and in the United States of America1  and the prognosis for the patients with the most advanced form is poor with a mortality rate of up to 80%2 in the first year. This new milestone for MaaT Pharma  the first Euronext-listed company developing microbiome-based therapies  builds on the success story of its founding partnership with INRAE initiated in 2014  in particular via the scientific support agreement3 between MaaT Pharma  INRAE and Dr. Jo√´l Dor√©  INRAE Research Director  Scientific Director of M√©tag√©nopolis  author of nearly 500 publications  and one of the world's most cited authors in the microbiome sphere today.At the end of 2014  following a project development period as an entrepreneur-in-residence with Seventure Partners  Herv√© Affagard  currently CEO  founded MaaT Pharma alongside Dr. Jo√´l Dor√©  now MaaT Pharma's Scientific Advisor. As early as 2015  MaaT Pharma and INRAE co-filed three patents  for which the Company now holds exclusive exploitation rights. These patents are also at the root of the development of the Company‚Äôs native products  MaaT013 and MaaT033  both currently in clinical trials.""Microbiome science has been at the heart of my research for more than 30 years. INRAE has established itself first as a pioneer  then as an international center of excellence in the field. In 2021  for example  INRAE was the 5th largest academic player in the world in terms of microbiome-related patents. In my opinion  the rapid growth of MaaT Pharma  which has entered a Phase 3 clinical trial  perfectly illustrates the efficient and successful transition from pioneering science to innovative therapeutic development for the benefit of patients. Through my research  I hope to contribute to the fast emergence of a new medicinal modality  that takes into account the symbiotic relationship between human health and the microbiome "" said Dr. Dor√©.Following the advent of metagenomics4  the research produced at INRAE on the gut microbiome has led to unprecedented results disrupting our understanding of the digestive ecosystem  and opening novel avenues for improving the health of millions of patients worldwide suffering from cancers  metabolic diseases  or inflammatory diseases to name just a few of the potential indications.MaaT Pharma has developed a portfolio of three products since its creation including two currently in clinical phases. The Company has initiated five Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials  consolidated its patent portfolio (including 13 international patent families)  and raised a total of ‚Ç¨83 million. The Company currently employs 45 people and MaaT013 has been administered to more than 100 people with aGvHD in a Phase 2 clinical trial and in an ongoing compassionate access program5 in France.Herv√© Affagard  CEO and co-founder of MaaT Pharma commented  ""Since our foundation  we have been looking to develop the microbiome ecosystem in France and have forged partnerships with medical and scientific centers of excellence as well as with renowned industrial players to develop the Company. In 2016  we launched our first clinical trial just 18 months after the company's creation  and we have since strengthened our position as a pioneer in microbiome-based therapies in oncology. Our translational expertise allows us to rapidly transform science into groundbreaking and safe drug candidates  with the support of our scientific partners  to improve survival outcome for cancer patients.""The collaboration between these two pioneers continues to move forward with the formation of industry structures and the growth of national expertise in the microbiome space in Europe with the Alliance Promotion Microbiote (APM)  of which both organizations are among the co-founders. APM is an association under the French law of 1901 and includes 25 private and public players (companies  clusters  research institutes  investment funds)  of which Herv√© Affagard was elected president in January 2022. APM aims to contribute to making France  a pioneering nation in microbiome research and engineering  into a European leader to meet the current and future challenges of this sector recognized in 2021 as a priority in the ""Health Innovation Plan 2030 "".About INRAECreated on January 1  2020  the French National Research Institute for Agriculture  Food  and Environment (INRAE) is a major player in research and innovation. INRAE carries out targeted research and resulted from the merger of INRA and IRSTEA. It is a community of 12 000 people with 273 research  experimental research  and support units located in 18 regional centres throughout France.

Operating cash flow remained stable in 2021 relative to 2020.Net income statement under IFRS accounting rulesNet profit (loss ) (‚Ç¨K) 12/31/2021 12/31/2020 Revenue 20 547 13 478 Income from ordinary activities 20 747 13 591 Staff costs (17 399) (11 718) External expenses (13 845) (9 468) Operating results (11 569) (8 819) Net financial results (7 286) (3 991) Net results (19 292) (12 802)The operating loss stood at ‚Ç¨11.6 million  representing a ‚Ç¨2.8 million increase over the year  of which ‚Ç¨1.6 million for the IFRS accounting of free shares for Median‚Äôs employees and top management in October 2021 (with no impact on cash)  and also in view of the investments made in R&D works for the iBiopsy¬Æ platform.Robust revenue and margin growth generated by the iCRO business nevertheless helped reduce the impact of investments related to iBiopsy¬Æ at the operating level.The financial loss totaled ‚Ç¨7.3 million and stemmed primarily from an adjustment under IFRS accounting  with no impact on Median Technologies‚Äô cash  consisting of valuing the equity warrants issued in favor of the EIB when the first ‚Ç¨15 million tranche of the loan was drawn in H1 2020. This valuation was impacted by the increase in the Median‚Äôs share price since the equity warrant issue. It was accounted for in the balance sheet under financial instruments  and will not impact Median‚Äôs cash position.Median Technologies informs its shareholders and the financial community that its annual financial report on the accounts for the year ending December 31  2021 has been made available and filed with the French financial markets authority (Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers).The annual financial report is available on the Company‚Äôs website: http://www.mediantechnologies.com/investors/Forward-looking statements This press release contains forward-looking statements.
