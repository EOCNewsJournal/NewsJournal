3264,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-faces-urgency-avoid-default-230000354.html,Russia Faces New Urgency to Dodge Default  Avoid Wall Street,(Bloomberg) -- Russia‚Äôs race to avoid default just escalated.Most Read from BloombergKremlin Insiders Alarmed Over Growing Toll of Putin‚Äôs War in...,(Bloomberg) -- Russia‚Äôs race to avoid default just escalated.Most Read from BloombergThe country has been inching closer after JPMorgan Chase & Co.  under orders from the U.S. Department of the Treasury  halted interest payments the country owed on two dollar-denominated bonds in recent weeks. The move forced the Russian central bank to make the payments in rubles instead and left it scrambling for ways to sidestep JPMorgan and rival Citigroup Inc. to make good on its debt.The situation got more serious on Wednesday: The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee said the ruble payment was a potential default  fueling growing consensus that Russia may have reneged on its debt obligations. The CDDC‚Äôs ruling  which doesn‚Äôt directly impact the debt  could trigger payment of credit-default swaps if Russia doesn‚Äôt pay bondholders in dollars before the debt‚Äôs grace period ends on May 4. The nation could still avert a default if it pays bondholders in dollars before that period ends.Russia ‚Äúis not at threat of default‚Äù and ‚Äúhas enough financial resources ‚Äù central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Thursday.The country is exploring ways to reroute payments through domestic institutions as well as its own clearing agent. But it remains unclear if the efforts stand any chance of success and whether the moves would even help the country avoid default.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no clarity about any of this in the language‚Äù of the bond documents  Mitu Gulati  a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law  said in an interview. ‚ÄúSome judge would presumably have to decide all of this.‚ÄùOne option being considered is replacing the foreign banks acting as correspondent banks and paying agents on foreign-debt deals with the Central Bank of Russia  according to the Russian newspaper Vedomosti. A correspondent bank performs basic treasury services and manages foreign exchange for clients  while a paying-agent bank handles housekeeping on bonds  collecting interest from issuers and helping distribute it to investors.Story continuesUnder this scenario  payments to bondholders would progress to the Central Bank of Russia instead of the foreign correspondent bank and paying agent. They would then move to Russia‚Äôs domestic clearing agent  the National Settlement Depository. From there  the money would end up with local bondholders or in specially created ‚ÄúType C‚Äù accounts for bondholders from so-called hostile nations  like the U.S.For Russia  relying on its own domestic clearing agent would also allow it to sidestep foreign rivals that have held up payments to Russian investors. Euroclear and Clearstream  which process payments as central securities depositories  have blocked accounts the national Russian depository has with them  leaving payments to local bondholders in limbo.Russia‚Äôs big-business lobby  the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs  pitched a similar proposal for corporate borrowers as part of the group‚Äôs plan to avoid a wave of cross-defaults and foreign-asset freezes. In their pitch  nonresidents would receive payments for the bonds in special foreign-currency accounts with Russian banks  along with the right to sell the notes to the finance ministry or its agent.The move seeks to help a bevy of Russian companies that have been forced into technical default as their interest payments get held up in the web of foreign banks‚Äô due-diligence processes. Even Russian entities not subject to U.S. penalties have run into delays: Citigroup  for instance  ordered Severstal PJSC to seek a special waiver from the U.S. Treasury Department before it would process the steelmaker‚Äôs interest payment.Citigroup‚Äôs action -- which came after the Treasury issued a blocked-pending-investigation order  or BPI -- meant Severstal ran out of time to pay interest on the dollar debt. Representatives for Citigroup and Severstal declined to comment while the Treasury didn‚Äôt immediately respond to requests for comment.State-controlled lender VTB gave investors a glimpse into how these scenarios could work when it paid coupons on a dollar-denominated eurobond in rubles  Vedomosti reported on Wednesday. Investors from Russia and ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù nations received funds in their ruble accounts  while Russian currency was transferred to special ‚ÄúC‚Äù accounts for residents of hostile countries  the newspaper said.Still  switching paying agents likely won‚Äôt be easy: It requires agreement from a majority of creditors and  in some cases  bond documents require borrowers to give investors months of notice before they could make such a change.‚ÄòSelective Default‚ÄôIt‚Äôs also not clear that paying out in rubles would even help Russia or large Russian corporations avoid default. The country‚Äôs move to pay its sovereign dollar bonds maturing in 2022 and 2042 in rubles  for instance  resulted in S&P Global Ratings cutting Russia‚Äôs unsolicited foreign currency issuer credit ratings to ‚Äúselective default.‚Äù‚ÄúAlthough the default could be remedied under a 30-day grace period allowed under the terms and conditions of the bonds  we don‚Äôt expect that investors will be able to convert those ruble payments into dollars equivalent to the originally due amounts  or that the government will convert those payments within that grace period ‚Äù S&P said.But Gulati  who focuses on sovereign debt restructuring  said Russia‚Äôs bond documents do include a currency indemnity provision that appears to allow Russia to discharge its debt by paying in rubles  so long as the recipient can use those rubles to buy a sufficient number of dollars.‚ÄúBoiled down  the clause seems to say that payment in a different currency can constitute a ‚Äòdischarge ‚Äô so long as the recipient can use those rubles to buy a sufficient number of dollars ‚Äù Gulati said in a post on his blog. ‚ÄúThat seems to mean that Russia can discharge its obligations by paying in rubles.‚ÄùUnder a second proposal recommended by the Russian government  borrowers would make interest payments to investors through separate channels depending on where an investor is based. Payments to foreign holders would be handled by a foreign payment agent  though that entity could run into similar restrictions. Russian holders would get their funds via domestic institutions.The Russian government subcommittee that put forward the plan also recommended using rubles to buy back eurobonds from Russian investors as an alternative  a move Russia already made with a $2 billion bond that matured on Apr. 4.The stalled coupon payments -- along with a bevy of others that are linked to debt from Russia‚Äôs biggest companies -- have thrust the normally staid back office of Wall Street into the spotlight. It also underscores the quagmire Wall Street‚Äôs biggest banks have found themselves in as de facto enforcers of U.S. President Joe Biden‚Äôs sanctions  an outcome they‚Äôd anticipated since Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine first began.‚ÄúWe are in continuous communication with the U.S. government and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime ‚Äù Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser told analysts on a conference call last week. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine.‚Äù(Updates with comments from Russia‚Äôs central bank governor in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek¬©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.02,0.53,0.45,mixed,0.04,0.15,0.81,True,English,"['New Urgency', 'Dodge Default', 'Wall Street', 'Russia', 'unsolicited foreign currency issuer credit ratings', 'The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee', 'central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina', 'S&P Global Ratings', 'foreign banks‚Äô due-diligence processes', 'U.S. Treasury Department', 'U.S. Department', 'U.S. penalties', 'enough financial resources', 'National Settlement Depository', 'central securities depositories', 'State-controlled lender VTB', 'Type C‚Äù accounts', 'national Russian depository', 'large Russian corporations', 'foreign correspondent bank', 'special foreign-currency accounts', 'special ‚ÄúC‚Äù accounts', 'Russian central bank', 'basic treasury services', 'domestic clearing agent', 'rival Citigroup Inc.', '30-day grace period', 'two dollar-denominated bonds', 'sovereign dollar bonds', 'Russian currency', 'The CDDC', 'foreign exchange', 'foreign rivals', 'correspondent banks', 'Russian banks', 'paying-agent bank', 'domestic institutions', 'special waiver', 'dollar-denominated eurobond', 'ruble accounts', 'Russian companies', 'Russian entities', 'paying agent', 'recent weeks', 'growing consensus', 'credit-default swaps', 'bond documents', 'Mitu Gulati', 'Virginia School', 'One option', 'foreign-debt deals', 'hostile nations', 'big-business lobby', 'similar proposal', 'foreign-asset freezes', 'finance ministry', 'pending-investigation order', 'friendly‚Äù nations', 'hostile countries', 'dollar debt', 'Russian newspaper', 'ruble payment', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'Russian investors', 'corporate borrowers', 'potential default', 'debt obligations', 'technical default', 'Selective Default', 'local bondholders', 'Severstal PJSC', 'interest payment', 'agents', 'payments', 'Bloomberg', 'country', 'Co.', 'orders', 'move', 'rubles', 'ways', 'situation', 'Wednesday', 'ruling', 'dollars', 'May', 'threat', 'Thursday', 'efforts', 'chance', 'success', 'clarity', 'language', 'professor', 'University', 'Law', 'interview', 'judge', 'Vedomosti', 'clients', 'housekeeping', 'issuers', 'Story', 'scenario', 'money', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'limbo', 'Union', 'Industrialists', 'Entrepreneurs', 'plan', 'wave', 'cross-defaults', 'pitch', 'nonresidents', 'right', 'notes', 'bevy', 'web', 'delays', 'instance', 'steelmaker', 'action', 'BPI', 'time', 'Representatives', 'requests', 'comment', 'glimpse', 'coupons', 'funds', 'agreement', 'majority', 'creditors', 'cases', 'months', 'notice', 'terms', 'conditions']",2022-04-21,2022-04-22,finance.yahoo.com

In this edition we summarise the key developments in debt capital markets in the first quarter of 2022.We have a number of different developments to report on in this edition:LIBOR transition: FCA publishes final tough legacy and synthetic LIBOR noticesRussia sanctionsHM Treasury proposals to replace the UK Prospectus Regulation regimeICMA updated standard form ECP documentation referencing SONIA  SOFR  ‚Ç¨STR and EURIBORSyndicated distribution of debt securities: New DvP modelLIBOR transition: USD LIBOR tough legacy federal legislation signed into lawLaw Commission report on electronic trade documentsCOVID-19: FCA statement on extended financial information timelinesUK PRIIPs Regulation Regime: FCA guidance on scope and certain changes to the UK PRIIPs KID RTSLIBOR Transition: FCA publishes final tough legacy and synthetic LIBOR noticesOn 1 January 2021  the designation of 1m  3m and 6m GBP and JPY LIBOR as ""Article 23A benchmarks"" under the UK Benchmarks Regulation (UK BMR) took effect. In connection with this  the FCA published the following:Notice of permitted legacy use by supervised entities (previously published in draft form only)  published under Article 23C of the UK BMR  confirming that supervised entities under the UK BMR can continue to use 1m  3m and 6m GBP and JPY LIBOR in synthetic form after 1 January 2022 in all in-scope legacy contracts that have not transitioned to an alternative rate by 31 December 2021 (except for cleared derivatives  which have already transitioned through amendments to CCP rules);Notice of requirements  published under Article 23D of the UK BMR  setting out the new calculation methodology required by the FCA for 1m  3m and 6m GBP and JPY LIBOR;Additional notice of proposed modifications and Notice of modifications  each under Annex 4 of the UK BMR  setting out the modifications to the UK BMR and related delegated legislation to be made in respect of the synthetic LIBOR rates.Russia sanctionsThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered a swift international response. The US  EU  UK  Canada  Australia and others have imposed a series of sanctions (many joint and coordinated) against Russia. Ashurst has created this Tracker of Sanctions in response to the Ukraine crisis which is an up to date  high-level summary of the measures imposed by the UK  EU  and Japan and Australia in response to the situation in Ukraine.HM Treasury proposals to replace the UK Prospectus Regulation regimeOn 1 March 2022 HM Treasury published its proposals to replace the UK Prospectus Regulation regime inherited from the EU with a more flexible regime designed to take advantage of the UK's perceived new freedoms in financial services following withdrawal from the EU.Under the proposed new regime a prospectus will still be required for admission of securities to trading on a UK regulated market. However rule-making responsibilities regarding admission of securities to trading on UK regulated markets will be delegated to the FCA  allowing the FCA to specify in its rulebook if and when a prospectus is required  what a prospectus should contain and the manner and timing of publication. The FCA will also be given discretion to decide whether ‚Äì and  if so  in which circumstances ‚Äì prospectuses must be reviewed and approved by it prior to publication.Also under the proposed new regime there will be a general prohibition on public offerings of securities which will be subject to a number of exemptions. These will essentially be those currently appearing in Article 1(4) of the UK Prospectus Regulation. However  the list of exemptions will be expanded to cover:offerings of securities which are  or will be  admitted to trading on a UK regulated market or certain UK MTFs;offerings of securities to those who already hold equity securities of the issuer  subject to certain conditions  including that the offer is made pro-rata to a person's existing holding; andcertain other categories of offerings by unlisted issuers and non-UK issuers.The qualified investor and 150 persons exemptions will be retained as will the ""wholesale"" exemption  though here the threshold will be set at GBP50 000 rather than EUR100 000 (subject to this  all thresholds currently stated in Euros in the UK Prospectus Regulation regime will be re-stated into sterling at 1 for 1).HM Treasury's proposals contain no express time line but say the government will legislate to implement these proposals when parliamentary time allows. However  as the government will delegate a greater degree of responsibility to the FCA to set out the detail of the new regime  it will also require the FCA to go through a process of consulting on  and then implementing  new rules. This suggests the new regime is unlikely to be in place any time soon.ICMA updated standard form ECP documentation referencing SONIA  SOFR  ‚Ç¨STR and EURIBOROn 2 March 2022 ICMA published amended Appendix A7 to its Primary Market Handbook containing the following standard form ECP documentation for investment grade issuers:Dealer Agreement;Multicurrency Bearer Permanent Global Note; andInformation Memorandum.These new  amended versions cater for ECP to be issued referencing SONIA  SOFR  ‚Ç¨STR or EURIBOR by reference to the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions.Syndicated distribution of debt securities: New DvP modelWith effect from 14 March 2022 the two International Central Securities Depositories (ICSDs)  Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg  have implemented a new model for the traditional delivery versus payment (DvP) closing of syndicated new issues of debt securities. The ICSDs say that after this date it will no longer be possible to close a syndicated new issue under the traditional DvP model.The principal feature of this new syndicate closing model is that the ICSDs will require every bank which acts as a lead manager to open a new ""commissionaire account"" with one or other of the ICSDs. This commissionaire account will be governed by Belgian law (in the case of Euroclear) or Luxembourg law (in the case of Clearstream) and will be for the benefit of the lead manager but will grant the issuer third party rights under a third-party beneficiary clause (‚Äòstipulation pour autrui‚Äô).LIBOR transition: USD LIBOR tough legacy federal legislation signed into lawOn 15 March 2022 US President Joe Biden signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act  2022 which  amongst other things  contains a federal legislative solution to the problem of ""tough legacy"" USD LIBOR contracts. This new federal LIBOR law takes an approach similar to the legislation that was initially proposed by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) in 2020 and has since been passed by the State of New York and several other states. For more information  please read this Ashurst briefing.Law Commission report on electronic trade documentsOn 15 March 2022 the Law Commission published its proposals for reform of English law to allow trade documents in electronic form to have the same legal effect as their paper equivalents  provided that they meet certain requirements to enable their possession in a digital context. While in principle bearer form debt securities would fall within the scope of the Commission's proposed new category of documents in electronic form  the proposals expressly exclude bearer form debt securities from this new category. This despite both ICMA and ICMSA arguing strongly in favour of including them.The Law Commission's reason for excluding bearer form debt securities is simply that they are used in financial markets and not in international trade and as such are better dealt with in the Law Commission‚Äôs ongoing general digital assets project rather than in this project which is focused on international trade documents.COVID-19: FCA statement on extended financial information timelinesSince the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in 2020 the FCA has provided temporary relief for reporting published financial information  including:An additional 2 months to publish annual financial reports (ie within 6 rather than 4 months of the financial year end date); andAn additional month to publish half yearly financial reports (ie within 4 rather than 3 months of the financial half year end date).In its Primary Market Bulletin 39 published on 23 March 2022 the FCA announced the withdrawal of this temporary relief with the result that it will no longer be available for reporting periods ending on or after 28 June 2022.UK PRIIPs Regulation Regime: FCA guidance on scope and certain changes to the UK PRIIPs KID RTSOn 25 March 2022  the FCA published Policy Statement PS22/2 which sets out changes to the FCA Handbook and the UK PRIIPs Regulation Regulatory Technical Standards (the UK PRIIPs KID RTS) to address a number of concerns relating to the UK PRIIPs Regulation regime.The changes to the FCA Handbook include the addition of a new sourcebook  the Product Disclosure sourcebook (DISC)  which contains new rules describing circumstances in which a debt security definitely is or is not a PRIIP and a number of features which are ""neutral"" (that is  by themselves they will not determine whether a debt security definitely is or is not a PRIIP).The amendments to the UK PRIIPs KID RTS:replace the requirements and methodologies for presentation of performance scenarios in a UK KID with a requirement for narrative information on performance to be provided;address the potential for some PRIIPs to be assigned an inappropriately low summary risk indicator in a UK KID; andaddress concerns about certain applications of the ‚Äòslippage‚Äô methodology when calculating transaction costs.While these changes came into effect on 25 March 2022  there are transitional provisions which in many respects allow market participants t to choose which version of the UK PRIIPs Regulation regime to apply until 31 December 2022.",neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,negative,0.02,0.21,0.76,True,English,"['Ashurst Quarterly Debt Capital Markets Update', 'Q1', 'Ashurst Quarterly Debt Capital Markets Update', 'USD LIBOR tough legacy federal legislation', 'law Law Commission report', 'extended financial information timelines', 'UK PRIIPs KID RTS', 'UK PRIIPs Regulation Regime', 'UK Prospectus Regulation regime', 'related delegated legislation', 'final tough legacy', 'UK regulated markets', 'UK Benchmarks Regulation', 'electronic trade documents', 'Primary Market Handbook', 'express time line', 'synthetic LIBOR notices', 'synthetic LIBOR rates', 'scope legacy contracts', 'New DvP model', 'new calculation methodology', 'Article 23A benchmarks', 'swift international response', 'HM Treasury proposals', 'legacy use', 'new regime', 'flexible regime', 'financial services', 'debt securities', 'synthetic form', 'LIBOR transition', 'JPY LIBOR', 'UK BMR', 'UK MTFs', 'UK issuers', 'parliamentary time', 'new freedoms', 'new rules', 'key developments', 'first quarter', 'different developments', 'standard form', 'ECP documentation', 'Syndicated distribution', '6m GBP', 'draft form', 'Article 23C', 'alternative rate', 'CCP rules', 'Article 23D', 'Russian invasion', 'The US', 'high-level summary', 'rule-making responsibilities', 'general prohibition', 'existing holding', 'other categories', 'unlisted issuers', 'qualified investor', 'wholesale"" exemption', 'greater degree', 'Appendix A7', '1m, 3m', 'second edition', 'proposed modifications', 'Ukraine crisis', '150 persons exemptions', 'equity securities', 'FCA statement', 'FCA guidance', 'The FCA', 'Additional notice', 'public offerings', 'Russia sanctions', 'supervised entities', 'Article 1', 'number', 'ICMA', 'SONIA', 'SOFR', '‚Ç¨STR', 'EURIBOR', 'COVID', 'changes', '1 January', 'designation', 'effect', 'connection', '31 December', 'derivatives', 'amendments', 'requirements', 'Annex', 'respect', 'Canada', 'Australia', 'others', 'series', 'Tracker', 'measures', 'Japan', 'situation', '1 March', 'advantage', 'withdrawal', 'admission', 'rulebook', 'manner', 'timing', 'publication', 'discretion', 'circumstances', 'prospectuses', 'conditions', 'threshold', 'Euros', 'sterling', 'government', 'responsibility', 'detail', 'process', 'place', '2 March', 'followin']",2022-04-22,2022-04-22,lexology.com

In this edition we summarise the key developments in debt capital markets in the first quarter of 2022.We have a number of different developments to report on in this edition:LIBOR transition: FCA publishes final tough legacy and synthetic LIBOR noticesRussia sanctionsHM Treasury proposals to replace the UK Prospectus Regulation regimeICMA updated standard form ECP documentation referencing SONIA  SOFR  ‚Ç¨STR and EURIBORSyndicated distribution of debt securities: New DvP modelLIBOR transition: USD LIBOR tough legacy federal legislation signed into lawLaw Commission report on electronic trade documentsCOVID-19: FCA statement on extended financial information timelinesUK PRIIPs Regulation Regime: FCA guidance on scope and certain changes to the UK PRIIPs KID RTSLIBOR Transition: FCA publishes final tough legacy and synthetic LIBOR noticesOn 1 January 2021  the designation of 1m  3m and 6m GBP and JPY LIBOR as ""Article 23A benchmarks"" under the UK Benchmarks Regulation (UK BMR) took effect. In connection with this  the FCA published the following:Notice of permitted legacy use by supervised entities (previously published in draft form only)  published under Article 23C of the UK BMR  confirming that supervised entities under the UK BMR can continue to use 1m  3m and 6m GBP and JPY LIBOR in synthetic form after 1 January 2022 in all in-scope legacy contracts that have not transitioned to an alternative rate by 31 December 2021 (except for cleared derivatives  which have already transitioned through amendments to CCP rules);Notice of requirements  published under Article 23D of the UK BMR  setting out the new calculation methodology required by the FCA for 1m  3m and 6m GBP and JPY LIBOR;Additional notice of proposed modifications and Notice of modifications  each under Annex 4 of the UK BMR  setting out the modifications to the UK BMR and related delegated legislation to be made in respect of the synthetic LIBOR rates.Russia sanctionsThe Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered a swift international response. The US  EU  UK  Canada  Australia and others have imposed a series of sanctions (many joint and coordinated) against Russia. Ashurst has created this Tracker of Sanctions in response to the Ukraine crisis which is an up to date  high-level summary of the measures imposed by the UK  EU  and Japan and Australia in response to the situation in Ukraine.HM Treasury proposals to replace the UK Prospectus Regulation regimeOn 1 March 2022 HM Treasury published its proposals to replace the UK Prospectus Regulation regime inherited from the EU with a more flexible regime designed to take advantage of the UK's perceived new freedoms in financial services following withdrawal from the EU.Under the proposed new regime a prospectus will still be required for admission of securities to trading on a UK regulated market. However rule-making responsibilities regarding admission of securities to trading on UK regulated markets will be delegated to the FCA  allowing the FCA to specify in its rulebook if and when a prospectus is required  what a prospectus should contain and the manner and timing of publication. The FCA will also be given discretion to decide whether ‚Äì and  if so  in which circumstances ‚Äì prospectuses must be reviewed and approved by it prior to publication.Also under the proposed new regime there will be a general prohibition on public offerings of securities which will be subject to a number of exemptions. These will essentially be those currently appearing in Article 1(4) of the UK Prospectus Regulation. However  the list of exemptions will be expanded to cover:offerings of securities which are  or will be  admitted to trading on a UK regulated market or certain UK MTFs;offerings of securities to those who already hold equity securities of the issuer  subject to certain conditions  including that the offer is made pro-rata to a person's existing holding; andcertain other categories of offerings by unlisted issuers and non-UK issuers.The qualified investor and 150 persons exemptions will be retained as will the ""wholesale"" exemption  though here the threshold will be set at GBP50 000 rather than EUR100 000 (subject to this  all thresholds currently stated in Euros in the UK Prospectus Regulation regime will be re-stated into sterling at 1 for 1).HM Treasury's proposals contain no express time line but say the government will legislate to implement these proposals when parliamentary time allows. However  as the government will delegate a greater degree of responsibility to the FCA to set out the detail of the new regime  it will also require the FCA to go through a process of consulting on  and then implementing  new rules. This suggests the new regime is unlikely to be in place any time soon.ICMA updated standard form ECP documentation referencing SONIA  SOFR  ‚Ç¨STR and EURIBOROn 2 March 2022 ICMA published amended Appendix A7 to its Primary Market Handbook containing the following standard form ECP documentation for investment grade issuers:Dealer Agreement;Multicurrency Bearer Permanent Global Note; andInformation Memorandum.These new  amended versions cater for ECP to be issued referencing SONIA  SOFR  ‚Ç¨STR or EURIBOR by reference to the 2021 ISDA Interest Rate Derivatives Definitions.Syndicated distribution of debt securities: New DvP modelWith effect from 14 March 2022 the two International Central Securities Depositories (ICSDs)  Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg  have implemented a new model for the traditional delivery versus payment (DvP) closing of syndicated new issues of debt securities. The ICSDs say that after this date it will no longer be possible to close a syndicated new issue under the traditional DvP model.The principal feature of this new syndicate closing model is that the ICSDs will require every bank which acts as a lead manager to open a new ""commissionaire account"" with one or other of the ICSDs. This commissionaire account will be governed by Belgian law (in the case of Euroclear) or Luxembourg law (in the case of Clearstream) and will be for the benefit of the lead manager but will grant the issuer third party rights under a third-party beneficiary clause (‚Äòstipulation pour autrui‚Äô).LIBOR transition: USD LIBOR tough legacy federal legislation signed into lawOn 15 March 2022 US President Joe Biden signed into law the Consolidated Appropriations Act  2022 which  amongst other things  contains a federal legislative solution to the problem of ""tough legacy"" USD LIBOR contracts. This new federal LIBOR law takes an approach similar to the legislation that was initially proposed by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) in 2020 and has since been passed by the State of New York and several other states. For more information  please read this Ashurst briefing.Law Commission report on electronic trade documentsOn 15 March 2022 the Law Commission published its proposals for reform of English law to allow trade documents in electronic form to have the same legal effect as their paper equivalents  provided that they meet certain requirements to enable their possession in a digital context. While in principle bearer form debt securities would fall within the scope of the Commission's proposed new category of documents in electronic form  the proposals expressly exclude bearer form debt securities from this new category. This despite both ICMA and ICMSA arguing strongly in favour of including them.The Law Commission's reason for excluding bearer form debt securities is simply that they are used in financial markets and not in international trade and as such are better dealt with in the Law Commission‚Äôs ongoing general digital assets project rather than in this project which is focused on international trade documents.COVID-19: FCA statement on extended financial information timelinesSince the outbreak of the Covid pandemic in 2020 the FCA has provided temporary relief for reporting published financial information  including:An additional 2 months to publish annual financial reports (ie within 6 rather than 4 months of the financial year end date); andAn additional month to publish half yearly financial reports (ie within 4 rather than 3 months of the financial half year end date).In its Primary Market Bulletin 39 published on 23 March 2022 the FCA announced the withdrawal of this temporary relief with the result that it will no longer be available for reporting periods ending on or after 28 June 2022.UK PRIIPs Regulation Regime: FCA guidance on scope and certain changes to the UK PRIIPs KID RTSOn 25 March 2022  the FCA published Policy Statement PS22/2 which sets out changes to the FCA Handbook and the UK PRIIPs Regulation Regulatory Technical Standards (the UK PRIIPs KID RTS) to address a number of concerns relating to the UK PRIIPs Regulation regime.The changes to the FCA Handbook include the addition of a new sourcebook  the Product Disclosure sourcebook (DISC)  which contains new rules describing circumstances in which a debt security definitely is or is not a PRIIP and a number of features which are ""neutral"" (that is  by themselves they will not determine whether a debt security definitely is or is not a PRIIP).The amendments to the UK PRIIPs KID RTS:replace the requirements and methodologies for presentation of performance scenarios in a UK KID with a requirement for narrative information on performance to be provided;address the potential for some PRIIPs to be assigned an inappropriately low summary risk indicator in a UK KID; andaddress concerns about certain applications of the ‚Äòslippage‚Äô methodology when calculating transaction costs.While these changes came into effect on 25 March 2022  there are transitional provisions which in many respects allow market participants t to choose which version of the UK PRIIPs Regulation regime to apply until 31 December 2022.",neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,negative,0.02,0.21,0.76,True,English,"['Ashurst Quarterly Debt Capital Markets Update', 'Q1', 'Ashurst Quarterly Debt Capital Markets Update', 'USD LIBOR tough legacy federal legislation', 'law Law Commission report', 'extended financial information timelines', 'UK PRIIPs KID RTS', 'UK PRIIPs Regulation Regime', 'UK Prospectus Regulation regime', 'related delegated legislation', 'final tough legacy', 'UK regulated markets', 'UK Benchmarks Regulation', 'electronic trade documents', 'Primary Market Handbook', 'express time line', 'synthetic LIBOR notices', 'synthetic LIBOR rates', 'scope legacy contracts', 'New DvP model', 'new calculation methodology', 'Article 23A benchmarks', 'swift international response', 'HM Treasury proposals', 'legacy use', 'new regime', 'flexible regime', 'financial services', 'debt securities', 'synthetic form', 'LIBOR transition', 'JPY LIBOR', 'UK BMR', 'UK MTFs', 'UK issuers', 'parliamentary time', 'new freedoms', 'new rules', 'key developments', 'first quarter', 'different developments', 'standard form', 'ECP documentation', 'Syndicated distribution', '6m GBP', 'draft form', 'Article 23C', 'alternative rate', 'CCP rules', 'Article 23D', 'Russian invasion', 'The US', 'high-level summary', 'rule-making responsibilities', 'general prohibition', 'existing holding', 'other categories', 'unlisted issuers', 'qualified investor', 'wholesale"" exemption', 'greater degree', 'Appendix A7', '1m, 3m', 'second edition', 'proposed modifications', 'Ukraine crisis', '150 persons exemptions', 'equity securities', 'FCA statement', 'FCA guidance', 'The FCA', 'Additional notice', 'public offerings', 'Russia sanctions', 'supervised entities', 'Article 1', 'number', 'ICMA', 'SONIA', 'SOFR', '‚Ç¨STR', 'EURIBOR', 'COVID', 'changes', '1 January', 'designation', 'effect', 'connection', '31 December', 'derivatives', 'amendments', 'requirements', 'Annex', 'respect', 'Canada', 'Australia', 'others', 'series', 'Tracker', 'measures', 'Japan', 'situation', '1 March', 'advantage', 'withdrawal', 'admission', 'rulebook', 'manner', 'timing', 'publication', 'discretion', 'circumstances', 'prospectuses', 'conditions', 'threshold', 'Euros', 'sterling', 'government', 'responsibility', 'detail', 'process', 'place', '2 March', 'followin']",2022-04-22,2022-04-22,lexology.com

The ERCC notes that these automated repo trading systems are predominantly used to support dealer-to-client business  whereas automatic systems primarily execute interdealer activity.The share of aggregate repo and reverse repo trades conducted through tri-party repo increased from 8.0 per cent in the June survey to 8.6 per cent in the latest December survey. However  the report finds that the outstanding value of all tri-party business reported separately by five main tri-party agents  namely BNY Mellon  Clearstream  Euroclear  JP Morgan and SIS  remained almost unchanged at ‚Ç¨670.8 billion and this would have been lower  but for significant tri-party activity of global custodians.The share of tri-party repo driven by GC financing activities ‚Äî electronic markets for centrally cleared tri-party repo trades ‚Äî continued to rise  with outstanding repo value on these platforms jumping by 8.1 per cent to ‚Ç¨78.4 billion between June and December 2021.The report finds that the percentage of repo and reverse-repo trades cleared through a central counterparty has continued to decline  extending a fluctuating downward trend that has been in evidence since June 2016. In the latest survey  the share of anonymous (CCP-cleared) repo trading contracted to 17.2 per cent  down from 17.9 per cent in the June 2021 survey and well below the 25 per cent high point attained in 2013.In evaluating collateral type delivered against repo transactions  ERCC indicates that the share of German (up from 14.8 to 16.5 per cent) and US government (up from 8.7 to 10.4 per cent) securities rose in the Dec survey  with more moderate increases also recorded for French (up from 13.2 to 13.7 per cent) and Japanese securities (up from 3.5 to 3.9 per cent).For tri-party repo managed by the ICSDs  the allocation of French  German  Italian  UK and US govvies increased sharply  with UK gilts providing the largest single share of the tri-party collateral pool.,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,negative,0.02,0.33,0.65,True,English,"['European Repo Survey', 'outstanding repo value', '5.4% rise', '6 months', 'Dec', 'principal automatic repo trading systems', 'The European Repo Market Survey', 'International Capital Market Association', 'five main tri-party agents', 'automated repo trading systems', 'Securities Financing Transactions Regulation', 'Total repo contract value', 'latest European Repo Survey', 'automated electronic trading', 'GC financing activities', 'cleared) repo trading', 'fluctuating downward trend', 'reverse repo contracts', 'average daily value', 'reverse repo trades', 'tri-party repo trades', 'aggregate repo trades', 'average daily turnover', 'significant tri-party activity', 'tri-party collateral pool', 'voice-brokered repo transactions', 'outstanding repo value', 'same time period', '5.4 per cent increase', '5.0 per cent contraction', 'ERCC survey sample', 'preceding June 2021 survey', 'automatic systems', 'largest single share', 'latest December survey', 'European market', '11 per cent rise', 'latest survey', 'RFQ) systems', 'total value', 'The ERCC', 'same period', 'OTC repo', 'outstanding value', 'reverse-repo trades', 'reverse repos', 'tri-party business', 'time measure', 'largest dealers', 'voice-brokered channels', 'electronic markets', 'last survey', 'outstanding repos', 'Collateral Council', 'interdealer activity', 'collateral type', 'Japanese securities', '5.9 per cent', '8.3 per cent', '9.6 per cent', '15.6 per cent', '7.8 per cent', '8.0 per cent', '8.6 per cent', '8.1 per cent', '17.2 per cent', '17.9 per cent', '25 per cent', '16.5 per cent', '10.4 per cent', '13.7 per cent', '3.9 per cent', 'ERCC) survey', 'June survey', '‚Ç¨8,726 billion figure', '57 reporting institutions', 'SFTR) data', 'Tradeweb data', 'client business', 'BNY Mellon', 'JP Morgan', 'global custodians', 'central counterparty', 'US government', 'moderate increases', 'US govvies', 'Dec survey', 'UK gilts', 'six months', '26.8 per', '5.4% rise', '6 months', '8 December', '12 months', 'books', 'firms', 'record', 'point', 'breakdown', 'close', 'ICMA', 'difference', 'trends', 'remainder', 'Growth', 'indicator', 'shift', 'percentage', 'ATS', 'terms', 'ADV', 'number', 'quote', 'H2', 'H1', 'decline', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'SIS', 'platforms', 'evidence', 'anonymous', 'CCP', 'German', 'French', 'ICSDs', 'allocation', 'Italian', '27.5', '14.8', '8.7', '13.2', '3.5']",2022-04-22,2022-04-22,securitiesfinancetimes.com

Germany had ranked fourth on Coincub‚Äôs list last year.videohiveAlso Read: Income Tax Department To Issue Notices To 700 Crypto Investors  Could Levy Penalty  30% Tax & InterestThe report ranked 46 countries based on a range of factors  including newly added categories such as the number of initial coin offerings (ICOs) in each country  fraud case prevalence and the availability of crypto courses by leading institutions.The three-place jump in Germany‚Äôs rank comes after crypto exchange KuCoin had published a report last month showing that 16% of the German population between ages 18 and 60 own crypto or have traded it in the past six months.41% of those investors intend to increase their allocations to the crypto space in the coming six months.German magazine Capital first reported in December 2021 that the country‚Äôs savings banks  which hold more than 1 trillion euros  were looking to offer a wallet to trade cryptocurrency. The Coincub report had called the decision a ‚Äúgroundbreaking‚Äù development that signals higher institutional acceptance of crypto  as per Blockworks.German stock market operator Deutsche Boerse has also listed more than 20 crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) on its digital exchange  Xetra  over the past few months.Others On The ListshuuterstockAlso Read: 2 More Countries Will Legalize Bitcoin In 2022  President Of World's First Country To Do So PredictsSingapore  which previously ranked number one on the list  dropped to second due to government decisions to restrict crypto services advertising and a clampdown on bitcoin ATMs  according to Coincub.The United States ranked third among crypto-friendly countries due in part to its decision to seek clearer crypto regulation  the report noted.The United Arab Emirates  which ranked 22  was a new addition to the list following its recent plans to become one of the world‚Äôs crypto hotspots.Crypto banning nation China remained at the list‚Äôs bottom following its widespread ban on trading and mining crypto.As per Blockworks  Coincub‚Äôs CEO said in a statement ‚ÄúAs events develop  we go beyond legislation or pure numbers and introduce new dimensions that are crucial for defining a country‚Äôs crypto friendliness or maturity.‚ÄùFor the latest financial news  keep reading Indiatimes Worth.

3292,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.fidelity.co.uk/markets-insights/investing-ideas/funds/way-inflation-beating-income/,Is this the way to an inflation beating income?,1 day ago,THIS month‚Äôs inflation data was hardly a surprise  but it did give pause for thought. UK consumer prices were 7% higher in March than a year previously  a rate of increase not seen since 19921.We all know it. From the cost of a weekly shop to filling the car with fuel  what we pay compared to last year or  in some cases  even last month  is going up.The good news is that the current rate of inflation is not expected to last. While consumer prices may well continue to increase at a high rate over the short term  the outlook into next year and beyond is more sanguine.The latest thinking at the Bank of England is that inflation could go even higher than 7% later this year. However  the Bank is sticking with its forecast that inflation will head back down to its 2% target in two to three years time2.That implies recent sharp hikes in the prices of some items ‚Äì like cars and hospitality ‚Äì may be a one-off  while drivers of inflation such as energy and food prices should relent as supply chains continue to adjust to where the demand is after the disruptions of the pandemic.Prices aren‚Äôt expected to fall  but they should be increasing at a much slower pace from next year  as comparisons are drawn with high starting points in 2022.That‚Äôs just as well. To achieve an investment income that rises consistently by 7% per annum is undoubtedly a demanding task. If the Bank of England is right  the actual task ‚Äì over the medium-term run at least ‚Äì is probably to try to achieve an income that grows sustainably by 3% or more.The first thing to say is that most bonds don‚Äôt cut it in this environment. Bonds are built to pay a fixed income until they mature  not a rising one.What‚Äôs more  rising inflation and higher interest rates tend to force bond prices lower. Bonds could  of course  perform well in capital terms should inflation expectations moderate from here. But that  in itself  may be of no additional help to income seekers.The exception is inflation-linked bonds  which increase in value as inflation rises. However  even these do not promise to outpace inflation over time. Their primary purpose is to insulate investors from the inflation risk that comes from holding conventional bonds.Cash is beginning to look like a better bet than it has for a long time  and it‚Äôs risk free too. However  the Bank of England‚Äôs Bank Rate is only expected to get to about 2% by the end of this year3. With the Bank Rate currently at 0.75%  the best return you can expect from an easy access cash account is about 1%4.Of the main asset classes  that leaves shares  which have a good track record of shielding investors from inflation over the long run  if not through shorter term crises such as the Covid pandemic.The dividends from UK companies rose by 46% in 2021  but don‚Äôt expect the same again this year. According to Link Group‚Äôs latest Dividend Monitor  fewer special dividends could result in a 7% fall in headline payments this year.However  dividends are still expected to increase by 5% on an underlying basis  giving scope for investors to derive an attractive income compared to 2021 levels5.Some companies at least have the flexibility to stand up to or even benefit from higher inflation  as the prices of their goods and services increase. That  in turn  raises their ability to maintain or increase shareholder payouts.So strategies that feature investments in the beneficiaries of higher inflation ‚Äì for example  supermarkets and diversified miners; higher interest rates ‚Äì for example  banks; and other companies with genuine pricing power could well be the best defence in the current environment.Companies that have maintained or grown their dividends over the longer run ‚Äì for at least ten consecutive years ‚Äì include British American Tobacco  Rio Tinto  BAE Systems  GlaxoSmithKline and Legal & General.All of these are constituents of the S&P UK High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index and feature regularly among the portfolio holdings of many UK equity income funds6.There are also a number of dividend heroes in the world of investment trusts  which have consistently increased their dividend payouts over the long term. Top of the pile is the City of London Investment Trust  which has raised its payout for a remarkable 55 years in a row7.Investment trusts have an advantage over open-ended funds  in that they are not required to distribute all of their income to investors and can hold some of it back to pay out in lean times.A disadvantage is that trusts with a very strong payments record can trade at a premium to the value of the assets they invest in  potentially making access to an ultra-reliable income stream for new investors a relatively costly affair in capital terms.Fidelity‚Äôs Select 50 list includes several high-quality equity income funds offering attractive yields and the potential to produce an income that grows over time. They lend themselves to investors able to take a longer-term view and who wish to benefit from an increasing investment income over the years that lie ahead.The Franklin UK Equity Income Fund benefits from a four-strong management team based in Leeds. Its objective is to generate an income higher than that of the FTSE All-Share Index plus investment growth over a three-to-five year period after fees and costs.Among the fund‚Äôs 48 investments are large holdings in Shell  AstraZeneca and Rio Tinto. The fund pays a quarterly dividend and currently yields approximately 3.6%  although this amount is not guaranteed8.The Fidelity Global Dividend Fund has a wider investing remit and the flexibility to invest in sectors and industries underrepresented in the UK  including technology. The fund has consistently grown its dividend payouts every year since launch in 2012  although this is not guaranteed to continue.Current large holdings include Proctor & Gamble  the scientific publisher RELX and the German stock markets operator Deutsche Boerse. The fund currently yields approximately 2.6%  an amount that is also not guaranteed9.Source:1 ONS  13.04.222 Bank of England  18.03.223 Bank of England  17.03.224 MoneySuperMarket.com  20.04.225 Link Group  20.01.226 FT and S&P Global  20.04.227 Janus Henderson  30.06.218 Franklin Templeton  31.03.229 Morningstar  19.04.2,negative,0.01,0.15,0.84,mixed,0.33,0.18,0.49,True,English,"['inflation beating income', 'way', 'S&P UK High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index', 'The Franklin UK Equity Income Fund', 'several high-quality equity income funds', 'many UK equity income funds', 'two to three years time', 'easy access cash account', 'high starting points', 'latest Dividend Monitor', 'UK consumer prices', 'recent sharp hikes', 'main asset classes', 'genuine pricing power', 'British American Tobacco', 'ten consecutive years', 'ultra-reliable income stream', 'higher interest rates', 'good track record', 'strong payments record', 'London Investment Trust', 'shorter term crises', 'increasing investment income', 'fewer special dividends', 'UK companies', 'high rate', 'open-ended funds', 'dividend heroes', 'dividend payouts', 'fixed income', 'income seekers', 'attractive income', 'remarkable 55 years', 'good news', 'latest thinking', 'headline payments', 'short term', 'long term', 'long time', 'investment trusts', 'weekly shop', 'supply chains', 'slower pace', 'demanding task', 'actual task', 'medium-term run', 'first thing', 'capital terms', 'additional help', 'primary purpose', 'best return', 'long run', 'Link Group', 'underlying basis', 'shareholder payouts', 'So strategies', 'diversified miners', 'best defence', 'longer run', 'Rio Tinto', 'BAE Systems', 'portfolio holdings', 'lean times', 'costly affair', 'Select 50 list', 'attractive yields', 'longer-term view', 'higher inflation', 'current rate', 'last year', 'next year', 'food prices', 'bond prices', 'most bonds', 'inflation-linked bonds', 'conventional bonds', 'rising one', 'Covid pandemic', 'other companies', 'current environment', 'inflation data', 'rising inflation', 'inflation expectations', 'inflation risk', 'new investors', 'Bank Rate', 'surprise', 'pause', 'thought', 'March', 'increase', 'car', 'fuel', 'cases', 'outlook', 'England', 'forecast', '2% target', 'items', 'hospitality', 'drivers', 'energy', 'disruptions', 'comparisons', 'annum', 'exception', 'value', 'bet', 'shares', '7% fall', 'scope', '2021 levels', 'flexibility', 'goods', 'services', 'ability', 'investments', 'beneficiaries', 'example', 'supermarkets', 'banks', 'GlaxoSmithKline', 'Legal', 'General', 'constituents', 'number', 'world', 'pile', 'City', 'row', 'advantage', 'premium', 'assets', 'Fidelity', 'potential']",2022-04-22,2022-04-22,fidelity.co.uk

This represents in aggregate  less than 0.2% of the total number of ordinary shares in issue.The rationale for an Odd-lot Offer is three-fold:‚Ä¢ the ability of small shareholders to deal their shares (and to cash their dividend cheques) is constrained by disproportionate dealing costs and banking charges;‚Ä¢ based on Kenmare‚Äôs experience with mailing Annual Reports and dividend cheques  the Company believes that a number of these small shareholders are inactive: they (or their estates) may not realise that they have a small holding in the Company or may not value that small holding; andStory continues‚Ä¢ the Company‚Äôs recurring costs of administration resulting from the relatively large number of shareholders are disproportionate to the size of these small shareholdings and affect shareholders as a whole.By carrying out an Odd-lot Offer  the Directors will facilitate the disposal by eligible Odd-lot Holders of their shares at a 5% premium without the dealing costs that would typically render such disposal uneconomic  whilst giving active shareholders the ability to opt-out.As part of the arrangements  shareholders are asked to approve a change to the Company‚Äôs Articles of Association so that eligible Odd-lot Holders who do not respond to the Odd-lot Offer  if made  are deemed to have agreed to accept it. Odd-lot Holders who wish to retain their Kenmare shares will be able to opt-out of participating in the Odd-lot Offer by completing and returning the relevant form in accordance with instructions.The actual timing for  and implementation of the proposed Odd-lot Offer will be decided by the Directors and will be at their sole discretion. Full details in respect of the proposed resolutions are set out in the Notice of AGM.Notice of AGMThe Notice of AGM and form of proxy are available on the Company's website  in addition to the Annual Report 2021 as previously announced  by clicking here .The Annual Report 2021 and Notice of AGM are today being posted to shareholders who have elected to receive them in the coming days.Copies of the above documents will be submitted to Euronext Dublin and the UK National Storage Mechanism and will shortly be available for inspection at the following links:Euronext Dublin OAM Filingand atNational Storage MechanismFor further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine SuttonInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Doug Keatingedkeatinge@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 037 4163About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world‚Äôs largest producers of mineral sands products.

This valuation was impacted by the increase in the Median‚Äôs share price since the equity warrant issue. It was accounted for in the balance sheet under financial instruments  and will not impact Median‚Äôs cash position.Median Technologies informs its shareholders and the financial community that its annual financial report on the accounts for the year ending December 31  2021 has been made available and filed with the French financial markets authority (Autorit√© des March√©s Financiers).The annual financial report is available on the Company‚Äôs website: http://www.mediantechnologies.com/investors/Forward-looking statements This press release contains forward-looking statements.

Our financial metrics for the first quarter clearly demonstrated our ability to scale. Our commercial cartridge volumes continued to increase globally  with nearly 2 000 Idylla‚Ñ¢ instruments installed  increasing product revenues to EUR 10.1m in Q1 2022. The growth was particularly strong in oncology with 42% higher cartridge revenue compared to Q1 2021  whereas the revenue contribution for COVID-19 testing expectedly reduced by half year-on-year. The gross margin on product sales increased to 34.6%  a solid step-up from 16% in 2021. Unlike last year  we are producing at significantly higher capacity and productivity levels  as we leverage our fully automated second manufacturing line ML2.

The abstract publication receives a designated oral presentation during the 18th Congress of the European Association of Dermato-oncology (EADO) in Sevilla  Spain (21-23 April 2022).The Merlin Test identifies melanoma patients that have a low risk for nodal metastasis and therefore can safely forgo a sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) surgery. This is an invasive surgical procedure used to determine metastatic spread of the cancer for staging purposes. In approximately 80% of the surgeries  the biopsy comes back negative for metastasis and does not further impact the patient pathway. The Merlin Test provides a more personalized insight on the metastatic propensity of the tumor  and how patients with a low-risk tumor could avoid the surgery2.Four melanoma medical centers from the Netherlands are leading this prospective multicenter study which is currently still ongoing. The study was initiated during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to allow for surgical triage on SLNB and to evaluate the implementation of the Merlin Test in clinical practice. Results of this prospective trial confirm the performance of previously published European and US retrospective validation studies in real world practice.On 22 April 2021  Biocartis and SkylineDx announced a partnership aimed at developing SkylineDx‚Äô novel proprietary test  the Merlin Test  on Biocartis‚Äô rapid and easy-to-use molecular diagnostics platform Idylla‚Ñ¢. In the US  the Merlin Test is already available as an internal Laboratory Developed Test in SkylineDx‚Äô CAP/CLIA laboratory in San Diego (California  US). Under the terms of the partnership agreement  SkylineDx will lead the development of the Merlin Test on Idylla‚Ñ¢  while Biocartis will lead the commercialization in Europe through its growing Idylla‚Ñ¢ network. Ahead of the launch of the Merlin Test on Idylla‚Ñ¢  Biocartis will already commercialize the test kit version of the Merlin Test for in vitro diagnostic use in Europe.Story continuesHerman Verrelst  Chief Executive Officer of Biocartis  commented: ‚ÄúPresenting this new prospective data at the EADO conference is a great way to initiate our joint commercial activities with SkylineDx  addressing mainly centralized expert laboratories in Europe.‚Äù‚ÄúEADO 2022 will be the first European conference that we attend together with our collaboration partner Biocartis‚Äù  comments Dharminder Chahal  CEO SkylineDx. ‚ÄúIt is exciting that in our first collective outreach we are able to show new prospective data that further strengthens the scientific solidity and clinical relevance of our Merlin Test‚Äù.The commercial launch of the test kit version of the Merlin Test for in vitro diagnostic use in Europe is planned in the second half of 2022.--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisBiocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) is an innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) company providing next generation diagnostic solutions aimed at improving clinical practice for the benefit of patients  clinicians  payers and industry.

Our financial metrics for the first quarter clearly demonstrated our ability to scale. Our commercial cartridge volumes continued to increase globally  with nearly 2 000 Idylla‚Ñ¢ instruments installed  increasing product revenues to EUR 10.1m in Q1 2022. The growth was particularly strong in oncology with 42% higher cartridge revenue compared to Q1 2021  whereas the revenue contribution for COVID-19 testing expectedly reduced by half year-on-year. The gross margin on product sales increased to 34.6%  a solid step-up from 16% in 2021. Unlike last year  we are producing at significantly higher capacity and productivity levels  as we leverage our fully automated second manufacturing line ML2. As a result  our operating cash burn was reduced to EUR 10.3m  compared to EUR 13.7m in Q1 2021. We believe we are clearly on track to achieve our stated targets for 2022 and to take a next step towards profitability.‚ÄùQ1 2022 HIGHLIGHTSProduct revenue of EUR 10.1m (Q1 2021: EUR 8.6m)  of which EUR 8.1m revenue from 79.8k cartridges sold: Continued strong growth in oncology  led by the US  and an overall EUR 6.7m revenue in oncology  42% higher than in Q1 2021 As expected  the contribution of cartridge revenues in infectious diseases reduced to 10% of total product revenues as COVID-19 testing demand continues to diminish Average Sales Price (ASP) per commercial cartridge of EUR 114 in oncology and EUR 101 overall 48 net new Idylla‚Ñ¢ instruments placed  adding to a total global installed base of 1 960Gross margin on product sales of 35%  compared to 16% for the entire year 2021.Operating cash burn 1 of EUR -10.3m and cash position of EUR 37.3m (unaudited figure) end of Q1 2022.

Fuel prices surged  in a context of post-COVID economic recovery combined with a decline in supply since the onset of the conflict in Ukraine.Excluding the effect of fuel prices  revenue increased by 4% thanks to the good availability of the facilities  maintenance shutdowns during the quarter having been carried out without problems.The availability rate was 90.5% in the first quarter of 2022  as against 83.3% in the first quarter of 2021 and power generation from thermal facilities reached 399 GWh  compared with 437 GWh in the first quarter of 2021  reflecting the continued decline in call rates by EDF in R√©union in connection with the high prices of coal and CO 2 .Story continuesConstruction and development of projectsWork continues on converting Albioma‚Äôs Bois-Rouge power station to 100% biomassConversion of the Bois-Rouge power plant to 100% biomass moved ahead smoothly in the early part of 2022.

Edenred is thus confirming its sustainable and profitable growth trajectory. All regions delivered double-digit growth  driven by a remarkable performance from our Employee Benefits and Fleet & Mobility Solutions.Thanks to its unique digital platform  Edenred is asserting itself quarter after quarter as the innovation leader in its markets. Our value proposition is constantly being broadened with new solutions in line with our clients‚Äô expectations  as well as new features that improve and streamline the user experience.We are therefore confident in our ability to maintain a sustained pace of growth for the rest of the year  driven by favorable post-Covid trends and a macroeconomic environment that strengthens the appeal of our solutions.‚ÄùFIRST-QUARTER 2022 TOTAL REVENUEStory continues(in ‚Ç¨ millions) First-quarter 2022 First-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Operating revenue 426 363 +17.3% +15.3% Other revenue 13 10 +28.9% +29.7% Total revenue 439 373 +17.6% +15.7%Total revenueTotal revenue for the first quarter of 2022 came to ‚Ç¨439 million  up 17.6% year on year as reported  including a favorable currency effect (+2.4%) and a slightly negative scope effect (-0.5%). On a like-for-like basis  total revenue was up 15.7%.Operating revenueOperating revenue came to ‚Ç¨426 million in the first three months of 2022  up 17.3% as reported  including a favorable currency effect (+2.5%) and a negative scope effect (-0.5%). On a like-for-like basis  operating revenue rose by 15.3% year on year.This very good performance follows on from the positive trends already observed in 2021. Operating revenue growth was notably driven by continued strong sales momentum  both in the very buoyant SME segment and in key accounts  with contract wins with iconic clients such as Google in France and FedEx in Brazil and Mexico.During the first quarter  the Group also continued to develop new services as part of its Beyond Food and Beyond Fuel strategy. The partnership in Europe with ChargePoint  a leading global electric vehicle charging network provider  is just one example. This partnership provides Edenred clients in Europe with access to more than 240 000 public electric charge points across 32 countries  enabling Edenred to support fleet managers in their transition to electric mobility.The Group‚Äôs performance also benefited from a macroeconomic environment that further strengthened the appeal of Edenred‚Äôs solutions. With governments and companies looking to protect employees‚Äô purchasing power  introducing new benefits or increasing the face value of existing benefits have emerged as effective responses. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  the increase in fuel prices at the pump has encouraged fleet managers to exercise even tighter control over costs.Operating revenue by business line(in ‚Ç¨ millions) First-quarter 2022 First-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Employee Benefits 256 223 +15.1% +14.2% Fleet & Mobility Solutions 117 90 +29.6% +24.3% Complementary Solutions 53 50 +5.0% +3.9% Total 426 363 +17.3% +15.3%Operating revenue for the Employee Benefits business line  which accounts for 60% of the Group‚Äôs total operating revenue  was ‚Ç¨256 million in first-quarter 2022  a 15.1% year-on-year increase as reported (+14.2% like-for-like).This growth was once again driven by strong sales momentum  reflected in the ever-increasing penetration of the SME segment  as well as the success of the Group‚Äôs solutions with key accounts. With the world of work undergoing a radical transformation  Edenred continued to roll out its Beyond Food offering  designed notably to support clients looking to enhance their appeal and boost staff engagement. The multi-product offering of employee benefits in Brazil (Ticket Superflex)  for example  met with major commercial success  as did platforms to equip employees for remote working in France and Mexico. Lastly  the first-quarter performance also benefited from a favorable basis of comparison due to the impact of Covid-related restrictions  notably in Europe  in the first quarter of 2021.In the Fleet & Mobility Solutions business line  which accounts for 27% of the Group‚Äôs total operating revenue  operating revenue for first-quarter 2022 amounted to ‚Ç¨117 million  up 29.6% year on year as reported (+24.3% like-for-like).This strong growth reflects the continued rollout of the Beyond Fuel strategy  notably through the maintenance and toll offering  which is proving highly successful in Europe and Latin America. The February acquisition of Greenpass  an issuer of e-toll solutions in Brazil  is fully in line with this strategy. The business also enjoyed strong sales momentum once again  driven by the relevance of its digital and multi-product offering for fleet managers. In addition  high oil prices in the first three months of the year contributed to greater business volumes compared with the first quarter of 2021.The Complementary Solutions business line  which includes Corporate Payment Services  Incentive & Rewards and Public Social Programs  generated revenue of ‚Ç¨53 million in first-quarter 2022  representing 13% of the Group total. This figure was up 5.0% as reported (+3.9% like-for-like) compared with the first quarter of 2021.Corporate Payment Services in North America  operated through CSI  recorded a solid performance  driven by new contract wins and the steady improvement in volumes generated by clients in the media and hospitality segments.The growth posted in this business line was impacted by a high basis of comparison as a result of the implementation in first-quarter 2021 of several specific earmarked funds programs for people hard hit by the health crisis  notably in Romania and the United Kingdom.Operating revenue by region(in ‚Ç¨ millions) First-quarter 2022 First-quarter 2021 % change (reported) % change(like-for-like) Europe 270 237 +13.8% +13.4% Latin America 123 97 +26.5% +16.5% Rest of the World 33 29 +14.3% +26.0% Total 426 363 +17.3% +15.3%In Europe   operating revenue amounted to ‚Ç¨270 million in the first quarter  a year-on-year increase of 13.8% as reported (+13.4% like-for-like). Europe accounted for 63% of total consolidated operating revenue in first-quarter 2022.In France  operating revenue came in at ‚Ç¨76 million for the first quarter  up 10.3% as reported and like-for-like. This performance notably reflects the commercial success of Ticket Restaurant¬Æ  the market‚Äôs number one name and digital leader  offering a simple and flexible solution for clients and a constantly improving experience based on innovative new features for users. Solutions rolled out as part of the Beyond Food strategy (such as Ticket Mobilit√©¬Æ and the remote working platform) and the Fleet & Mobility Solutions offering also contributed to sharp growth in the first quarter.Operating revenue in Europe excluding France totaled ‚Ç¨194 million in first-quarter 2022  an increase of 15.3% as reported (+14.8% like-for-like) versus the prior-year period. Employee Benefits recorded a solid performance  driven by robust growth in Ticket Restaurant¬Æ. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  continued rollout of the Beyond Fuel strategy also contributed to the significant growth recorded in the first quarter.Operating revenue in Latin America came to ‚Ç¨123 million for the first quarter  a rise of 26.5% as reported (+16.5% like-for-like) compared with the same period in 2021.In Brazil  operating revenue rose by 29.1% as reported (+16.5% like-for-like) in first-quarter 2022 versus first-quarter 2021. This significant increase reflects strong momentum in Fleet & Mobility Solutions  driven notably by the ongoing deployment of maintenance and toll management solutions  along with the growing contribution of the partnership with Ita√∫ Unibanco to sales performance in Employee Benefits.In Hispanic Latin America  operating revenue was up 21.0% as reported (+16.6% like-for-like) in first-quarter 2022 versus the same period in 2021. Employee Benefits business in the region is recovering as the health crisis subsides. In Fleet & Mobility Solutions  Edenred continued to gradually roll out its Beyond Fuel offering (tolls and maintenance).In the Rest of the World   operating revenue came to ‚Ç¨33 million for the first quarter  up 14.3% as reported and up 26.0% like-for-like. This performance was notably spurred by the success of paperless and plasticless digital solutions in Taiwan. In North America  CSI‚Äôs Corporate Payment Services maintained the good momentum seen in late 2021  fueled notably by the distribution partnerships entered into with several banks  including the Commercial Cards division of international bank Citi one year ago.Other revenueOther revenue for the first quarter of 2022 totaled ‚Ç¨13 million  up 28.9% as reported (+29.7% like-for-like). This rise reflects the increase in float2 resulting from the high level of business in the first quarter  as well as higher interest rates in European countries outside the euro zone and in Latin America.OUTLOOKFollowing on from historic results in 2021  the solid performance recorded in the first quarter of 2022 reflects Edenred‚Äôs ability to leverage its unique digital platform to continue along a sustainable and profitable growth trajectory. The Group‚Äôs commercial momentum continues to be driven by the addition of new digital  multi-product solutions adapted to the needs and expectations of clients in its three business lines. Building on these innovative and relevant solutions  Edenred will continue to penetrate its markets and thereby support changing behaviors and structural trends  such as remote working as a permanent feature in the workplace  green commuting  the consumption of eco-friendly products and the transition of fleets to electric or plug-in hybrid vehicles.Edenred also expects to continue benefiting from a favorable macroeconomic environment  and in particular from the inflationary context  which is encouraging public authorities and companies to increase the face value of Employee Benefits solutions and prompting fleet managers to prioritize expense management solutions.Edenred is therefore reaffirming its confidence for 2022  and intends to maintain a sustained pace of growth in all regions where the Group operates and in each business line.As a result  for 2022  the Group is confirming the annual targets set in its Next Frontier strategic plan:like-for-like operating revenue growth of more than 8%;like-for-like EBITDA growth of more than 10%;free cash flowithEBITDA conversion rate of more than 65%3.SIGNIFICANT EVENT IN THE FIRST QUARTEREdenred strengthens its toll offering in Brazil with the acquisition of GreenpassOn February 22  Edenred announced that it had acquired a 51% controlling interest in Greenpass  an issuer of electronic toll solutions in Brazil. The deal strengthens Edenred‚Äôs position in this business as well as its technology and sales capabilities in an attractive market offering significant cross-selling potential with its client base. It is fully in line with the Group‚Äôs Beyond Fuel strategy to develop new non-fuel fleet and mobility services  enhancing its value proposition for fleet managers and expanding its addressable market.SUBSEQUENT EVENTUTA Edenred partners with ChargePointOn April 5  Edenred announced a partnership with ChargePoint  a leading electric vehicle charging network provider in Europe and in the USA. This partnership enables customers of UTA Edenred  a leading mobility service provider in Europe  to access over 240 000 public electric charge points across 32 European countries.

We will present our medium-term roadmap at our Capital Markets Day on June 16.‚ÄùSALES REVIEW FOR THE PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31  2022Unless otherwise stated  all comments are on a constant and adjusted basis and  for sales  at same number of working days.SALESIn Q1  sales were up +31.4% year-on-year on a reported basis and +16.0% on a constant and same-day basis  reflecting positive momentum in all three geographies.Key figures (‚Ç¨m) Q1 2022 YoY change Sales on a reported basis 4 377.4 +31.4% On a constant and actual-day basis +19.1% On a constant and same-day basis +16.0%In the first quarter Rexel posted sales of ‚Ç¨4 377.4m  up +31.4% on a reported basis  including:A positive currency effect of ‚Ç¨104.3m (i.e. +3.1% of Q1 2021 sales)  mainly due to the appreciation of the US & Canadian dollars against the euroA positive net scope effect of ‚Ç¨240.0m (i.e. +7.2% of Q1 2021 sales) mainly due to Mayer acquisition in the USA positive calendar effect of +3.1%  largely resulting from specific US accounting rules.On a constant and same-day basis  sales were up +16.0%  as a result of:An excellent performance in North America  with further recovery  and strong resilience in Europe on more difficult base effects  offsetting lower growth in Asia-Pacific as business recovered from the pandemic earlier than in other geographiesStrong underlying trends from electrification and growing demand for energy efficiency solutions in a context of rising energy costs  as illustrated by growth of product categories such as PV  EV or HVAC at rates above Group averageA favorable pricing environment for both cable (4.1% contribution in Q1 2022 vs 2.9% in Q1 2021) and non-cable (9.1% contribution in the quarter) products  resulting from a carryover effect of price increases passed in 2021 and an additional rise recorded in 2022Further growth in digitalization in all three geographies  with digital sales now representing 25.5% of Group sales excluding Mayer  up +201bps compared to Q1 2021  or 23.6% of sales  up +177bps including Mayer  considering its low digital penetration. Trends were positive in Europe (up to 35.0% of sales  an increase of +166bps)  North America (up to 12.4% of sales  an increase of +304bps including Mayer) and Asia-Pacific (4.6% of sales  up +72bps).In the quarter  the tensions on the supply chain remained unchanged and we don‚Äôt expect any improvement before the second part of the year  as visibility remains low (lockdown in China  Russia/Ukraine war). This ‚Äúscarcity environment‚Äù continues to be an opportunity for Rexel  as we continue to help our customers deal with product shortages and labor availability to unlock productivity gains.Europe (52% of Group sales): +13.6% in Q1 on a constant and same-day basisIn the first quarter  sales in Europe increased by +15.6% on a reported basis  including a positive currency effect of +0.6%  or ‚Ç¨12.1m  mainly due to the appreciation of the British pound and the Swiss Franc against the euro and a negative scope effect of (0.2)%  or ‚Ç¨(4.9)m  from the disposals of our activity in Russia in March 2022 and a small business in France in Q1 2021. On a constant and same-day basis  sales were up +13.6%.Key figures (‚Ç¨m) Q1 2022 YoY change Europe 2 284.8 +13.6% France 865.5 +10.4% Scandinavia 278.5 +12.5% Benelux 257.5 +16.8% Germany 226.5 +17.0% UK 223.4 +18.0% Switzerland 145.3 +5.6% Austria 129.3 +16.7% Southern Europe 85.8 +21.9%Overall in Europe  activity remained robust  still driven by proximity and renovation activities. Acceleration in volume and price increases on non-cable products drove the good performance in Q1 22  despite continuing limitations caused by supply chain tensions. More specifically  in our larger countries:Sales in France (38% of the region‚Äôs sales) were up +10.4%  with similar progression in all 3 end-markets. The quarter was marked by significant market outperformance and increased digital penetration (28.4% of sales  up 328bps). Service and EV activities contributed positively to the overall performance.Sales in Scandinavia (12% of the region‚Äôs sales) were up +12.5%  with a slow start to the year  notably in Sweden  due to the pandemic. Trends significantly accelerated in March. Q1 sales growth was largely driven by the residential & commercial markets and boosted by PV activity.Benelux (11% of the region‚Äôs sales) grew by +16.8%  with strong demand in the residential market in Belux  boosted by robust growth from green products  now representing 10% of sales. Growth in the Netherlands was also boosted by renewable energy products (PV/EV/HVAC up c. 40% yoy)  in a context of rising energy prices.Sales in Germany (10% of the region‚Äôs sales) posted strong +17.0% growth  supported by residential & industrial markets. Residential was boosted by PV demand (up 190%  contributing for 550bps). Industrial demand was driven by metal  energy & water markets offsetting low demand in automotive.In the UK (10% of the region‚Äôs sales)  sales increased by +18.0%  with a strong demand in residential and commercial markets. The pipeline is robust in all 3 markets.Disposal of our Russian activityWith circa ‚Ç¨10m of revenues generated in 2021  Rexel had limited exposure to Russia (below 0.1% of Group sales).Following recent events in the region  Rexel took the decision to fully dispose this activity through a Management Buy Out (MBO) that was completed on March 23  2022.North America (40% of Group sales): +21.6% in Q1 on a constant and same-day basisIn the first quarter  sales in North America increased by +67.5% on a reported basis  including a positive currency effect of +7.4%  or ‚Ç¨78.1m  due to the appreciation of the US & Canadian dollars against the euro  a positive scope effect of +23.7%  or ‚Ç¨249.8m  from the acquisition of Mayer in the US  as well as a positive calendar effect of +6.1%. On a constant and same-day basis  sales were up +21.6%  driven by the US and Canada.Key figures (‚Ç¨m) Q1 2022 YoY change North America 1 764.6 +21.6% Total US 1 432.3 +23.2% Mayer +27.5% US excl.

Backlogs further increased in the quarter.In the US (81% of the region‚Äôs sales)  sales posted solid +23.2% growth on a same-day basis  with positive trends in all regions including the Northwest  despite a difficult base effect  and significant recovery in the Mountain Plains (robust demand in Las Vegas and Denver) and Gulf Central (recovery in Oil & Gas sector) regions. By market  all three end-markets grew at a similar pace with further positive development in commercial and residential and recovery from a lower base in industry. The backlog remains healthy  up +63% at end of March 2022 yoy. Mayer is progressing well  up +27.5%  and the integration process is occurring smoothly. We are on track to achieve our upgraded synergy ambitions presented in February 2022.In Canada (19% of the region‚Äôs sales)  sales grew by +14.9% on a same-day basis  Q1 performance was driven by the industrial end-market up c. 20%  contributing for c. 900bps notably boosted by robust demand in oil & gas and mining.Asia-Pacific (8% of Group sales): +5.5% in Q1 on a constant and same-day basisIn the first quarter  sales in Asia-Pacific were up +9.1% on a reported basis  including a positive currency effect of +4.7%  or ‚Ç¨14.2m  mainly due to the appreciation of the Chinese renminbi against the euro and a negative scope effect of (1.7)%  or ‚Ç¨(5.0)m  related to the disposal of Rexel Saudi Arabia in Q4 2021. On a constant and same-day basis  sales were up +5.5%.Key figures (‚Ç¨m) Q1 2022 YoY change Asia-Pacific 328.0 +5.5% Australia 131.3 +4.1% China 145.5 +4.8%In the Pacific (49% of the region‚Äôs sales)  sales were up +5.5% on a constant and same-day basis. More specifically: In Australia (82% of Pacific‚Äôs sales)  sales increased by +4.1%  boosted by price increases  offsetting a slow start to the year  impacted by difficult weather conditions notably in the New South Wales & Queensland regions as well as Covid-related staff shortages.In Asia (51% of the region‚Äôs sales)  sales increased by +5.5% on a constant and same-day basis: In China (86% of Asia‚Äôs sales)  sales were up +4.8%. The acceleration was supported by demand from municipalities  renewables and infrastructure & transportation  offsetting the lack of demand in automotive and food & beverage as a result of chip shortages as well as the continuing pandemic situation. The quarter benefited from selling price increases. Orders are growing significantly. We anticipate the coming quarter to be impacted by the recent local lockdowns that took place in large cities.FY 2022 OUTLOOKWe remain confident we will achieve our 2022 objectives despite geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties.Leveraging our transformation and enhanced efficiency  we target for 2022  at comparable scope of consolidation and exchange rates*:Same-day sales growth of between 4% and 6%An adjusted EBITA 1 margin above 6%Free cash flow conversion2 above 60%* Assuming no severe deterioration of the sanitary environmentAn updated strategic roadmap  will be presented at a Capital Markets Day to be held at our Group's biggest branch in Zurich on June 16  2022.1 Excluding (i) amortization of PPA and (ii) the non-recurring effect related to changes in copper-based cable prices.2 FCF Before interest and tax/EBITDAaLNB: The estimated impacts per quarter of (i) calendar effects by geography  (ii) changes in the consolidation scope and (iii) currency fluctuations (based on assumptions of average rates over the rest of the year for the Group's main currencies) are detailed in appendix 2.CALENDARJune 3  2022 Ex-dividend dateJune 7  2022 Dividend Payment of ‚Ç¨0.75 per share (issue premium)June 16  2022 Capital Markets DayJuly 28  2022 First-half 2022 resultsFINANCIAL INFORMATIONA slideshow of the first quarter 2022 sales is available on the Group‚Äôs website.ABOUT REXEL GROUPRexel  worldwide expert in the multichannel professional distribution of products and services for the energy world  addresses three main markets: residential  commercial  and industrial.

Cables accounted for approximately 17% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group‚Äôs sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group‚Äôs total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

Based on its performance in the first three months  Sartorius Stedim Biotech confirms its outlook for fiscal 2022.Sartorius (PRNewsfoto/Sartorius AG)""Sartorius Stedim Biotech had a good start to 2022. We continued to grow  and our margin remained at a high level despite rising logistics and material costs as well as negative influences from currencies. The pandemic-related effects and the development of order intake are normalizing  as expected. Demand for our products is high in all segments and our investments in the expansion of production capacities are making good progress. In addition  the acquisition of the chromatography business of Novasep further strengthened our positioning in downstream processing. In light of the positive performance in the first three months and the healthy demand situation  we are confirming our outlook for the current fiscal year. However  the global political and economic uncertainties have increased substantially with the outbreak of war in Ukraine  further increasing the strain on supply chains and the risks arising from significantly higher inflation rates "" said Joachim Kreuzburg  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.Business development of the Group1Story continuesIn the first quarter  Group sales revenue rose by 27.6 percent year-over-year in constant currencies (reported: +31.6 percent) to around 862 million euros. The performance was driven by strong organic growth across the portfolio  while acquisitions2 contributed almost 2 percentage points to the increase. All three business regions ‚Äì EMEA3  Americas  and Asia | Pacific ‚Äì posted double-digit percentage growth in constant currencies.Order intake was in line with expectations compared with the exceptionally strong prior-year quarter  reaching 950 million euros (- 8.6 percent in constant currencies; reported: - 5.5 percent). The first quarters of 2021 were influenced by extraordinarily high demand related to the coronavirus pandemic and changed ordering patterns by some customers  who placed their orders further in advance than usual.As a result from the growth in sales revenue  underlying EBITDA rose by 31.1 percent to 304 million euros in the first quarter. The corresponding margin remained largely stable at 35.2 percent (prior-year quarter: 35.4 percent) despite being impacted by negative currency effects. Relevant net profit rose 34.4 percent to 203 million euros  and underlying earnings per share were 2.21 euros (prior-year quarter: 1.64 euros).Key financial indicatorsThe Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base. As of March 31  2022  its equity ratio stood at 48.1 percent (December 31  2021: 43.9 percent). Net debt to underlying EBITDA remained at 0.4 percent  as at year-end 2021. Cash flow from investing activities stood at ‚Äì77 million euros as planned  compared to ‚Äì62 million euros in the first quarter of 2021. The ratio of capital expenditures (CAPEX) to sales revenue reached 8.9 percent  compared with 9.5 percent in the prior-year period.Increase in the number of employeesAs of March 31  2022  Sartorius Stedim Biotech employed a total of 11 400 people worldwide  representing a headcount increase of 991 from the end of December 2021.Outlook for fiscal 2022 confirmedThe management confirms the outlook for the current fiscal year. Consolidated sales revenue is expected to increase by about 15 percent to 19 percent  with non-organic growth from acquisitions projected to contribute about 2 percentage points. The company's underlying EBITDA margin is expected to reach more than 35 percent this year.The CAPEX ratio is anticipated to be about 14.5 percent and net debt to underlying EBITDA to be about 0.2 at year-end. Possible further acquisitions are not included in this projection.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. In addition  management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the life science and biopharma sectors have increased over the past years and the coronavirus pandemic has further amplified these trends. Accordingly  current forecasts show even higher uncertainties than usual. Furthermore  the forecasts are based on the assumption of no further deterioration in the geopolitical and global economic situation  supply chains and inflation  and no new large-scale restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic.1 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

It makes data accessible to all for innovation and competitiveness purposes. .To meet these challenges  WALLIX has developed a vision  ""PAM for all""  an approach that has given rise to WALLIX PAM4ALL  a unified solution bringing together all WALLIX technologies to secure all user access - human or machine - in an organization  according to the principle of least privilege.PARIS  April 21  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- To meet the new challenges of the digital world  WALLIX (Euronext: ALLIX)  a European publisher of cybersecurity software and expert in access and identity security  has developed a vision  ""PAM for all""  enabling it to offer its customers the promise of a secure digital transformation for all. To realize this vision  WALLIX now offers WALLIX PAM4ALL  a unified solution that brings together all WALLIX technologies and goes beyond the protection of privileged accounts by securing  according to the principle of least privilege  all at-risk users and workstations in an organization.The new challenges of digital technologyThe need to secure access to data has never been greater. With the pandemic  our world is experiencing an acceleration of its digital transformation (standardization of teleworking  massification of cloud services  strong growth in the number of mobile terminals...). These new uses  which allowed organizations to continue to operate during these long months of lockdown  considerably multiply the number of access points to organizations' IT infrastructure. There are so many new potential entry points for hackers that they must be secured urgently to protect data. Moreover  the results of 2021 are clear: 40 billion pieces of personal data have been hacked  an increase of 78% compared to 2020[1].This figure will grow as cybercrime becomes more industrialized  thus considerably increasing the cyber risk to our economy. Today  hacker organizations operate like companies  which is why cybercrime is currently considered the third largest economy in the world. Its global cost is estimated to be $6 trillion by 2021 and $10.5 trillion by 2025  up from $3 trillion in 2015[2] This cost includes damage and destruction of personal and/or financial data  loss of productivity  embezzlement  fraud  theft of money  but also of intellectual property and damage to reputation. There are also the costs incurred by the disruption of the organization's activity  sometimes for a long period of time after the attack  and finally the investments required to restore the hacked data and systems.We are living in a paradigm shift where perimeter security no longer exists  where users - whether humans or machines - are increasingly mobile and need to access organizations' data  at any time  from anywhere. Data itself is becoming volatile (cloud storage  SaaS solutions  automation...) to control costs and gain agility. This affects all sectors  especially the most critical ones such as healthcare  industry  insurance  or public services  which urgently need to secure all these access  to ensure business continuity  while respecting regulatory requirements in terms of risk management and data protection. Data must remain accessible to all in order to continue to innovate and thus ensure economic competitiveness.The answer: WALLIX PAM4ALLIn the current context  it is essential for organizations to secure their IT access and not only the most sensitive accounts (privileged accounts). WALLIX PAM4ALL is a unified solution combining all WALLIX technologies  which goes beyond securing privileged accounts  and protects  according to the principle of least privilege  user access and workstations  to avoid contamination by malware or ransomware. At some point in their daily functions  all users need privileges to access certain digital resources in the organization. The challenge is to provide access at the right time  at the right privilege level  to perform the expected task  regardless of where the user is located  whether inside or outside the company.WALLIX PAM4ALL provides access control and visibility over:All users: employees  suppliers  partners  humans  or machinesemployees  suppliers  partners  humans  or machines All sessionsAll the company's strategic assetsAll the company's endpointsTo do this  WALLIX PAM4ALL combines WALLIX technologies in one single solution:Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):To neutralize the risks associated with compromised credentialsTo neutralize the risks associated with compromised credentials Remote Access Management:To enable remote access for vendors  employees  or third-party maintainersTo enable remote access for vendors  employees  or third-party maintainers Session Management:To monitor  track  and audit sessionsTo monitor  track  and audit sessions Password management:To secure and rotate passwords and keys  and remove hard passwordsTo secure and rotate passwords and keys  and remove hard passwords Least privilege management:To grant the right access rights to the right user at the right time  thus stopping the spread of malware by blocking lateral and vertical movement in the network.""WALLIX PAM4ALL is the promise of a secure digital transformation for all organizations  in a rapidly changing digital context. With PAM4ALL  our customers have the means to quickly implement a Zero-Trust architecture thanks to strong user authentication  access control adapted to each user (human or machine)  at the right time (Just-In-Time)  and to integrate traceability in the IT infrastructure. It is also the possibility to have a dynamic view of the activity on your network and to protect yourself from advanced threats  particularly malware.

Based on its performance in the first three months  Sartorius Stedim Biotech confirms its outlook for fiscal 2022.""Sartorius Stedim Biotech had a good start to 2022. We continued to grow  and our margin remained at a high level despite rising logistics and material costs as well as negative influences from currencies. The pandemic-related effects and the development of order intake are normalizing  as expected. Demand for our products is high in all segments and our investments in the expansion of production capacities are making good progress. In addition  the acquisition of the chromatography business of Novasep further strengthened our positioning in downstream processing. In light of the positive performance in the first three months and the healthy demand situation  we are confirming our outlook for the current fiscal year. However  the global political and economic uncertainties have increased substantially with the outbreak of war in Ukraine  further increasing the strain on supply chains and the risks arising from significantly higher inflation rates "" said Joachim Kreuzburg  Chairman of the Board of Directors and CEO.Business development of the Group1In the first quarter  Group sales revenue rose by 27.6 percent year-over-year in constant currencies (reported: +31.6 percent) to around 862 million euros. The performance was driven by strong organic growth across the portfolio  while acquisitions2 contributed almost 2 percentage points to the increase. All three business regions ‚Äì EMEA3  Americas  and Asia | Pacific ‚Äì posted double-digit percentage growth in constant currencies.Order intake was in line with expectations compared with the exceptionally strong prior-year quarter  reaching 950 million euros (- 8.6 percent in constant currencies; reported: - 5.5 percent). The first quarters of 2021 were influenced by extraordinarily high demand related to the coronavirus pandemic and changed ordering patterns by some customers  who placed their orders further in advance than usual.As a result from the growth in sales revenue  underlying EBITDA rose by 31.1 percent to 304 million euros in the first quarter. The corresponding margin remained largely stable at 35.2 percent (prior-year quarter: 35.4 percent) despite being impacted by negative currency effects. Relevant net profit rose 34.4 percent to 203 million euros  and underlying earnings per share were 2.21 euros (prior-year quarter: 1.64 euros).Key financial indicatorsThe Sartorius Stedim Biotech Group continues to have a very sound balance sheet and financial base. As of March 31  2022  its equity ratio stood at 48.1 percent (December 31  2021: 43.9 percent). Net debt to underlying EBITDA remained at 0.4 percent  as at year-end 2021. Cash flow from investing activities stood at ‚Äì77 million euros as planned  compared to ‚Äì62 million euros in the first quarter of 2021. The ratio of capital expenditures (CAPEX) to sales revenue reached 8.9 percent  compared with 9.5 percent in the prior-year period.Increase in the number of employeesAs of March 31  2022  Sartorius Stedim Biotech employed a total of 11 400 people worldwide  representing a headcount increase of 991 from the end of December 2021.Outlook for fiscal 2022 confirmedThe management confirms the outlook for the current fiscal year. Consolidated sales revenue is expected to increase by about 15 percent to 19 percent  with non-organic growth from acquisitions projected to contribute about 2 percentage points. The company's underlying EBITDA margin is expected to reach more than 35 percent this year.The CAPEX ratio is anticipated to be about 14.5 percent and net debt to underlying EBITDA to be about 0.2 at year-end. Possible further acquisitions are not included in this projection.All forecasts are based on constant currencies  as in the past years. In addition  management points out that the dynamics and volatilities in the life science and biopharma sectors have increased over the past years and the coronavirus pandemic has further amplified these trends. Accordingly  current forecasts show even higher uncertainties than usual. Furthermore  the forecasts are based on the assumption of no further deterioration in the geopolitical and global economic situation  supply chains and inflation  and no new large-scale restrictions in connection with the coronavirus pandemic.1 Sartorius Stedim Biotech publishes alternative performance measures that are not defined by international accounting standards.

The board of directors' accounts of the remuneration committee's evaluation of the principles for remuneration to senior executives which are published on Truecaller's website  describes how Truecaller applies its principles for remuneration to senior executives in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.Authorization for the board of directorsThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board of directors to execute the resolution in accordance with the above and to ensure that the Subsidiary's board of directors carries out the transfer of the warrants in accordance with the above.Item 18: Resolution on the implementation of a long-term share program  amendments to the articles of association and hedging arrangements in respect of the programThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on:(A) implementation of a long-term share program (the ""Share Program 2022"") for employees in the Truecaller group;(B) amendments to the articles of association whereby the possibility to issue redeemable and convertible C shares is introduced; and(C) hedging arrangements in respect of the Share Program 2022  consisting of:(I) an authorization for the board of directors to decide on a directed issue of redeemable and convertible C shares;(II) an authorization for the board of directors to decide on a repurchase of C shares; and(III) transfers of own ordinary shares of series B to Share Program 2022 participants (employees in the Truecaller group).Should the majority requirement under item 18 (C) not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting approves that the company enters into an equity swap agreement with a third party (item 18 (D)).Implementation of Share Program 2022 (Item 18 (A))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on the implementation of the Share Program 2022 in accordance with the below.Objectives and reasons for the proposalTruecaller has during a number of years resolved to implement long-term incentive programs. The board of directors has  when evaluating previous incentive programs  concluded that it would be effective to resolve on implementing a new incentive program at the annual general meeting; adapting the structure with the aim of recruiting  rewarding and retaining valuable employees in a more appropriate manner and promote and create long-term participation in the Truecaller group  thereby closely aligning the employees' interests with those of Truecaller's shareholders. Consequently  the Share Program 2022 is structured to create long-term incentives for members of the senior executives and certain other employees in order to improve Truecaller's development and create long-term values. In view of the terms proposed below  the size of the allotment and other circumstances  the board of directors assesses that the proposed Share Program 2022 is well-balanced and that it will be beneficial for the company and its shareholders.Description of Share Program 20221. The Share Program 2022 shall comprise not more than 5 100 000 ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller  corresponding to approximately 1.36 percent of the total number of issued shares and approximately 0.64 percent of the total number of votes in Truecaller.2. The Share Program 2022 is proposed to include senior executives and key employees (""Group 1"") together with certain other employees (""Group 2"") (jointly the ""Participants"").3. It is proposed that the Share Program 2022 shall grant the possibility of allotment of ordinary shares of series B free of charge (""Performance Shares"")  subject to the fulfilment of the performance target during certain measurement periods (the ""Performance Periods"").4. Under the Share Program 2022  the Participants will receive a certain number of rights free of charge  which entitle the Participants to receive a certain number of ordinary shares of series B in the company following the expiration of a vesting period of three years for certain Participants and three and four years  respectively  for certain Participants (""Performance Share Rights""). At the implementation of the Share Program 2022  each Performance Share Right entitles the holder to one (1) ordinary share of series B (subject to the achievement of the Share Program 2022's performance target). With respect to Participants who participate in existing incentive programs in the Truecaller group (""Participants in Previous Programs"")  allotment of all Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026. With respect to Participants who do not participate in any existing incentive programs in the Truecaller group (""New Participants"")  allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2025 and allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026. Any allotment of ordinary shares of series B pursuant to Performance Share Rights will be subject to the achievement of the performance target  as set out below  and will generally require that the Participant retains his or her employment until the respective allotment date (the ""Vesting Period"").5. Within Group 1  allotment per Participant will depend on performance and position within the group and may not exceed 100 000 Performance Share Rights per Participant. The number of Participants in Group 1 shall not exceed 30 persons.6. Within Group 2  allotment per Participant will depend on performance and position within the group and may not exceed 40 000 Performance Share Rights per Participant. The number of Participants in Group 2 shall not exceed 350 persons.7. For full allotment  the company must achieve a combination of revenue growth rate (%) and adjusted EBITDA (%) of at least 50 percent annually  on average during the three financial years preceding the respective allotment date. In the event that the performance target falls below 50 percent  the allotment of Performance Shares shall decrease linearly  and in the event that the performance target falls below 25 percent  no allotment of Performance Shares shall be made. Accordingly  the Performance Period for Participants in Previous Programs runs during the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025  and the Performance Periods for New Participants run during the financial years 2022  2023 and 2024 with respect to 1/2 of the Performance Shares and during the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025 with respect to 1/2 of the Performance Shares.8. The actual allotment of Performance Share Rights to Participants  within the limits set out above  is decided by the board of directors and may be reduced proportionally based on the respective person's performance and time of employment within the Truecaller group.9. The right to receive ordinary shares of series B under the Performance Share Rights is conditioned on continued employment within the Truecaller group. Should the employment with the Truecaller group terminate due to redundancy  illness  retirement pursuant to a succession plan approved by the Truecaller group (or similar)  the Participant may keep the Performance Share Rights not yet vested pro rata in relation to the time passed since the date the Performance Share Rights were allotted until the termination date  and the remainder of the rights will lapse. Should the Participant's employment with the Truecaller group terminate due to any other reason prior to the expiration of the Vesting Period  all Performance Share Rights held by the Participant will normally lapse. Performance Share Rights shall not constitute securities and may not be transferred  pledged or otherwise disposed of by the Participant.10. Any allotment of ordinary shares of series B pursuant at vesting of the Performance Shares Rights depends on the extent to which the performance target is met during the Performance Periods  thereby establishing what portion (if any) of the Performance Share Rights that will give the Participants right to receive ordinary shares of series B at the end of the Vesting Period. the company will provide information to the shareholders to what extent the performance target has been achieved after the end of each Performance Period. In total  not more than one (1) Performance Share per Performance Share Right may be allocated (disregarding any recalculation under the terms of the Share Program 2022).11. Provided that the performance target above has been met during the relevant Performance Period and the Participant has retained his or her employment (unless special circumstances are at hand)  allotment of all Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026 with respect to Participants in Previous Programs  and allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2025 and allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026 with respect to New Participants.12. When determining the final vesting level of Performance Share Rights  the board of directors shall examine whether the vesting level is reasonable considering Truecaller's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the board of directors  reduce the vesting level to the lower level deemed appropriate by the board of directors.13. In order to align the Participants' and shareholders' interests  Truecaller will compensate for any dividends and other value transfers to the shareholders during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of shares to which each Performance Share Right entitles and/or by adjusting the performance target. The performance target and/or the number of ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller which each Performance Share Right entitles the Participant to receive may be recalculated as a result of e.g. bonus issues  reverse splits or splits of shares  interim dividend  new share issues  reductions of the share capital  or similar actions. The transfer of shares may be accelerated as a result of any merger  change of control or similar actions.14. The board of directors shall resolve on the detailed terms and conditions for the Share Program 2022 and  in the event of company related events  market conditions  local legislation or other rules  regulatory changes  or other events  the board of directors shall be entitled to make deviations from and adjustments of the terms and conditions of the Share Program 2022 or settle all or part of the Performance Shares in cash.Costs and effects on important key ratiosThe costs of the Share Program 2022  which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been made based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Truecaller ordinary share of series B of SEK 64 based on the closing price as of April 21  2022  (ii) no dividends are paid by Truecaller during the Share Program 2022 and (iii) an assessment of total Performance Shares earned during the Vesting Period of 70 percent  (iv) an employee turnover of 10 percent per year. In total  this can lead to maximum costs for the Share Program 2022 of approximately SEK 160 million  excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are estimated to approximately SEK 160 million assuming an annual share price increase of 45 percent during the Vesting Period.The expected annual costs of the Share Program 2022  including annualized social security charges of approximately SEK 40 million  would have corresponded to approximately 23 percent of Truecaller's total annual employee costs 2021.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and that the Share Program 2022 was introduced in 2020 instead  it is estimated that the key ratio earnings per share for the full year 2021 had decreased from 0.72 SEK to approximately SEK 0.50.The board of directors deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior executives and other employees  which may be further increased through the Share Program 2022  outweighs the costs related to the Share Program 2022.DilutionUpon full allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares under the Share Program 2022 amounts to 5 100 000 ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller  corresponding to a dilution effect of approximately 1.36 percent of the share capital and approximately 0.64 percent of the votes based on the number of issued shares as per the day of this proposal.Preparation of the proposal  etc.The proposal regarding Share Program 2022 has been prepared by the board of directors in consultation with external advisors. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board of directors  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Description of ongoing variable compensation programsTruecaller's ongoing share-based incentive programs and variable compensation to senior executives are described in the annual report for 2021  in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The board of directors' accounts of the remuneration committee's evaluation of the principles for remuneration to senior executives  which are published on Truecaller's website  describes how Truecaller applies its principles for remuneration to senior executives in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.Amendments to the articles of association (Item 18 (B))In order to enable the issuance of redeemable and convertible C shares under Share Program 2022  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend ¬ß 6 in the company's articles of association in accordance with the following. The amendment to ¬ß 6 of the company's articles of association also means that the preference share classes is removed  which means that the company will only be able to issue ordinary shares of series A and B and C shares in accordance with the new articles of association.These changes mean that ¬ß 6 of the company's articles of association will have the following wording.Proposed wording¬ß 6 Classes of shares Shares may be issued in three classes  ordinary shares of series A  ordinary shares of series B and series C shares. The ordinary shares of series A shall carry 10 votes per share  the ordinary shares of series B shall carry one vote per share and series C shares shall carry one-tenth of a vote per share. Shares of either share class may be issued up to an amount corresponding to the full share capital. Series C shares do not entitle to dividends. Upon the dissolution of the company  series C shares shall carry equivalent right to the company's assets as other shares  however  not to an amount exceeding the quota value of the share. If the company resolves to issue new ordinary shares of series A  ordinary shares of series B and series C shares  against payment other than contribution in kind  owners of ordinary shares of series A  ordinary shares of series B and series C shares shall have pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares of the same class pro rata to the number of shares previously held by them (primary pre-emption right). Shares which are not subscribed for pursuant to the primary pre-emption rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (secondary pre-emption right). If the shares thus offered are not sufficient for the subscription pursuant to the secondary pre-emption rights  the shares shall be allocated between the subscribers pro rata to the number of shares previously held and  to the extent such allocation cannot be effected  by the drawing of lots. Should the company decide not to issue shares of all series in conjunction with a cash issue or a set-off issue  all shareholders  irrespective of class of share  shall have a pre-emption right to subscribe for new shares in proportion to the number of shares they already own. What is set out above with regard to pre-emption rights shall apply mutatis mutandis in the event of issues of warrants and convertible debentures and shall not limit the right to resolve upon an issue with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights. In the event of a bonus issue  new shares of each class shall be issued pro rata to the number of shares of the same class previously issued. In connection therewith  the owners of existing shares of a certain class shall entitle the holder to new shares of the same class. This shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility of issuing new shares of a new class by means of a bonus issue  following the required amendments of the articles of association. Ordinary shares of series A shall  upon request of the owner of such shares be converted to ordinary shares of series B. Conversion requests must be made in writing by the shareholder to the company's board. The notice shall state the number of shares to be converted  and  if conversion will not relate to the owner's entire holding  which shares shall be converted. The board is obliged to process the request on the board meeting immediately following the request. The conversion shall be promptly submitted for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and shall be effective when registration of the conversion has been made with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden. Reduction of share capital  which in any case shall not fall below the minimum share capital  may  at the request of a holder of a series C share and after resolution by the company's board of directors or a shareholders' meeting  take place through redemption of series C shares. A request from a shareholder must be submitted in writing. When a resolution on reduction has been passed  an amount corresponding to the reduction amount shall be transferred to the company's reserve fund  if the required funds are available. The redemption amount per series C share shall be the quota value of such share. Following receipt of the redemption resolution  holders of shares subject to redemption shall promptly receive payment for the shares  or  if authorization for the redemption from the Swedish Companies Registration Office or a court is required  following the receipt of notice that the final and effected resolution has been registered. Series C shares held by the company may  upon resolution of the board of directors be converted into ordinary shares of series B. Immediately thereafter  the board of directors shall register the conversion with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The conversion is effected when it has been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden.Hedging arrangements in respect of the Share Program 2022 (Item 18 (C))The board of directors has evaluated different methods to secure the financial exposure and transfer of shares in accordance with the Share Program 2022  such as transfer of own shares and an equity swap agreement with a third party. The board of directors considers a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares and transfer of such shares to the Participants (following conversion of the shares to ordinary shares of series B) to be the most cost-effective and flexible method for hedging the financial exposure and transfer of own shares under the Share Program 2022.The board of directors proposes that the main option to secure the financial exposure shall be transfer of own shares (item 18 (C))  since the cost associated with an equity swap agreement vastly exceeds the costs of transferring own shares.Should the majority requirement under item 18 (C) not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting approves the entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party (item 18 (D)).Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to issue redeemable and convertible C shares (Item 18 (C) (I))Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to issue redeemable and convertible C shares  on one or more occasions  until the next annual general meeting.The issue shall be effected on the following terms.¬∑ The number of C shares that may be issued may amount to no more than 5 100 000.¬∑ The new C shares shall ‚Äì with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights ‚Äì be subscribed for only by an external party who has been informed in advance.¬∑ The price to be paid for each new share shall correspond to the quotient value of the share at the time of the subscription of the shares.¬∑ The new shares will be subject to restrictions as set forth in Chapter 4  Section 6 (conversion provision) and Chapter 20  Section 31 (redemption provision) of the Swedish Companies Act (SFS 2005:551).Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares (Item 18 (C) (II))Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible C shares in the company on the following terms.¬∑ Repurchase may be effected through a public offer directed to all owners of C shares in the company.¬∑ The authorization is valid and may be exercised on one or several occasions until the annual general meeting 2023.¬∑ The number of C shares permitted to be repurchased shall amount to no more than 5 100 000.¬∑ Repurchase of shares shall be made at the quotient value  applicable at the time of the subscription of shares according to item 18 (C) (I) above.¬∑ Payment for shares repurchased shall be made in cash.¬∑ The board of directors shall be authorized to establish additional terms for the repurchase.¬∑ The authorization shall also be valid for repurchase of so-called interim shares  designated by Euroclear Sweden AB as a ""paid subscription share"" (Sw. BTA) relating to a C share.The repurchase of own shares is an integrated part of the hedging arrangements for the Share Program 2022. The reason for the proposed authorization to repurchase own shares is for the company to be able to fulfil its obligations pursuant to the Share Program 2022 in a cost effective manner.Resolution on transfer of own ordinary shares of series B to Participants in the Share Program 2022 (Item 18 (C) (III))The board of directors proposes that the shares issued and repurchased in accordance with item 18 C (I) and (II)  after being converted into ordinary shares of series B  may be transferred to the Participants of the Share Program 2022.Resolution on transfers of the company's own ordinary shares of series B to Share Program 2022 Participants shall be made on the following terms.¬∑ Transfer of shares may only be made of ordinary shares of series B in the company  whereby a maximum of 5 100 000 ordinary shares of series B in the company may be transferred free of charge to Share Program 2022 Participants.¬∑ Right to purchase ordinary shares of series B in the company free of charge shall ‚Äì with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights ‚Äì be granted to the Participants in the Share Program 2022.¬∑ Transfers of ordinary shares of series B in the company shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms that the Share Program 2022 Participants are entitled to be allotted shares.¬∑ The number of ordinary shares of series B in the company that may be transferred under the Share Program 2022 will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party (Item 18 (D))Should the majority required under item 18 (C) above not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that the expected financial exposure of the Share Program 2022 shall be hedged by the company by entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market conditions  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer ordinary shares of series B in the company to the Participants of the Share Program 2022.Other informationConditionsThe annual general meeting's resolution on the implementation of Share Program 2022 according to item 18 (A) above is conditional upon the meeting resolving either in accordance with the board of directors' proposal under item 18 (B) and item 18 (C)  or resolving in accordance with the board of directors' proposal under item 18 (D).Majority requirementsThe annual general meeting's resolution according to item 18 (A) above require a simple majority among the votes cast. A valid resolution under item 18 (B) above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the meeting approve the resolution.

Over-subscription is not possible.The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights are to stimulate shareholding in the company by virtue of an incentive program through which senior executives and other key employees can take part of and contribute to a positive value increase of the company's share during the period of the proposed program  and that the company shall be able to retain and recruit competent and dedicated staff.The warrants shall be issued at no consideration. Subscription must be completed no later than three weeks after the resolution on issue of warrants. The board of directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period.Each warrant entitles a right to subscribe for one ordinary share of series B in the company. 1/2 of the warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new shares during the period 24 May 2025 ‚Äì 24 August 2025 and 1/2 of the warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new shares during the period 24 May 2026 ‚Äì 24 August 2026.

Cancellation shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  is authorized to make such minor adjustments to the resolution which may prove necessary in order to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Approval of transfer of warrants (Item 16 (B))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting approves the Subsidiary's transfer of warrants on the following conditions.The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall vest in senior executives and other key employees in the Truecaller group who do not participate in existing incentive programs in the Truecaller group. Employees who are also board members in Truecaller AB do not have the right to acquire any warrants. The allotment per participant will depend on position within the Truecaller group and may not exceed 50 000 warrants per participant. In total  not more than 5 senior executives and other key employees in the Truecaller group may be allotted warrants of series 2022:1.1/2 of each participant's warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new shares during the period 24 May 2025 ‚Äì 24 August 2025 and 1/2 of each participant's warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new shares during the period 24 May 2026 ‚Äì 24 August 2026.As the warrants are acquired by the participants at market value and require a positive development of the share price of the company there are no performance criteria for the exercise of the warrants.A prerequisite for being entitled to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary is (i) that the participant at the time of the acquisition is an employee of the group  (ii) that acquisition of warrants can take place in accordance with applicable laws  and  according to the Board of Directors' assessment  can be executed with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts  and (iii) that the participant has entered into an agreement with the company  according to which the company  or the one the company assigns  under certain circumstances has the right to repurchase the warrants from the participant if the participant wishes to transfer the warrants before they can be exercised for subscription of shares  in some cases to an amount equal to the lower of the participant's acquisition price and the market value  in other cases to market value. The board of directors has the right to make the reasonable changes and adjustments of the terms and conditions in the agreement that are deemed suitable or appropriate as a result of local civil law or tax law or administrative conditions.Warrants may also be offered to future employees. For such acquisitions  the conditions shall be the same or equivalent to what is stated in this resolution. This means  inter alia  that acquisitions shall be made to the market value at the time of the acquisition.Application and allotmentApplication for acquisition of warrants shall be made during the period from and including 25 May 2022 up until and including 8 June 2022. The board of directors of the company shall however be entitled to extend the application period for acquisitions and to set a corresponding application period for new employees whose acquisitions are made after the expiration of the initial application period.The board of directors of the company shall determine the final allotment and the date of the transfer of the warrants. The transfer of warrants may be made up until and including the next annual general meeting.Price and payment etc.The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price (premium) established on the basis of a market value of the warrants calculated by an independent valuation institute using the Black & Scholes valuation model. A new market value shall be established in an equivalent way for acquisitions made by new employees after the expiration of the initial application period.Payment for the allocated warrants shall be made in cash no later than three weeks following the application for acquisition. The board of directors shall establish a corresponding date of payment for acquisitions made by new employees.DilutionUpon full exercise of all warrants  50 000 new ordinary shares of series B can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.01 percent of the total number of shares and approximately 0.01 percent of the total number of votes in the company  however  subject to any potential adjustment which may occur under the terms and conditions for the warrants. Accordingly  the program offers the employees the possibility to increase their shareholding in the company to the corresponding figure.Impact of financial ratio and costs for the company etc.The company's earnings per share are not affected by the issue of the warrants as the present value of the warrants' strike price exceeds the current market value of the share at the date of issue. Since the warrants are transferred to the participants at market value it is not expected that the company will incur any personnel costs. The warrant program will only incur certain limited costs in terms of external consulting fees and costs relating to the administration of the warrant program.Preparation of the matterThe principles of the warrant program have been prepared by the board of directors of the company. The board of directors has thereafter decided to submit this proposal to the annual general meeting. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board of directors  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Other share related incentive programs etc.Truecaller's ongoing share-based incentive programs and variable compensation to senior executives will be described in the annual report for 2021  in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The board of directors' accounts of the remuneration committee's evaluation of the principles for remuneration to senior executives which are published on Truecaller's website  describes how Truecaller applies its principles for remuneration to senior executives in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.Authorization for the board of directorsThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board ofdirectors to execute the resolution in accordance with the above and to ensure that the Subsidiary's board of directors carries out the transfer of the warrants in accordance with the above.Item 17: Resolution on the issue and transfer of warrants of series 2022:2The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants and to approve the transfer of the warrants in accordance with the following.Issue of warrants (Item 17 (A))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to carry out a directed issue of not more than 450 000 warrants  entailing an increase in the share capital of not more than SEK 900 at full subscription.

Cancellation shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  is authorized to make such minor adjustments to the resolution which may prove necessary in order to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Approval of transfer of warrants (Item 17 (B))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting approves the Subsidiary's transfer of warrants on the following conditions.The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall vest in senior executives and other key employees in the Truecaller group who participate in existing incentive programs in the Truecaller group. Employees who are also board members in Truecaller AB do not have the right to acquire any warrants. The allotment per participant will depend on position within the Truecaller group and may not exceed 60 000 warrants per participant. In total  not more than 25 senior executives and other key employees in the Truecaller group may be allotted warrants of series 2022:2.As the warrants are acquired by the participants at market value and require a positive development of the share price of the company there are no performance criteria for the exercise of the warrants.A prerequisite for being entitled to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary is (i) that the participant at the time of the acquisition is an employee of the group  (ii) that acquisition of warrants can take place in accordance with applicable laws  and  according to the board of directors' assessment  can be executed with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts  and (iii) that the participant has entered into an agreement with the company  according to which the company  or the one the company assigns  under certain circumstances has the right to repurchase the warrants from the participant if the participant wishes to transfer the warrants before they can be exercised for subscription of shares  in some cases to an amount equal to the lower of the participant's acquisition price and the market value  in other cases to market value. The board of directors has the right to make the reasonable changes and adjustments of the terms and conditions in the agreement that are deemed suitable or appropriate as a result of local civil law or tax law or administrative conditions.Application and allotmentApplication for acquisition of warrants shall be made during the period from and including 25 May 2022 up until and including 8 June 2022. The board of directors of the company shall however be entitled to extend the application period for acquisitions.The board of directors of the company shall determine the final allotment and the date of the transfer of the warrants.Price and payment etc.The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price (premium) established on the basis of a market value of the warrants calculated by an independent valuation institute using the Black & Scholes valuation model.Payment for the allocated warrants shall be made in cash no later than three weeks following the application for acquisition.DilutionUpon full exercise of all warrants  450 000 new ordinary shares of series B can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.12 percent of the total number of shares and approximately 0.06 percent of the total number of votes in the company  however  subject to any potential adjustment which may occur under the terms and conditions for the warrants. Accordingly  the program offers the employees the possibility to increase their shareholding in the company to the corresponding figure.Impact of financial ratio and costs for the company etc.The company's earnings per share are not affected by the issue of the warrants as the present value of the warrants' strike price exceeds the current market value of the share at the date of issue. Since the warrants are transferred to the participants at market value it is not expected that the company will incur any personnel costs. The warrant program will only incur certain limited costs in terms of external consulting fees and costs relating to the administration of the warrant program.Preparation of the matterThe principles of the warrant program have been prepared by the board of directors of the company. The board of directors has thereafter decided to submit this proposal to the annual general meeting. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board of directors  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Other share related incentive programs etc.Truecaller's ongoing share-based incentive programs and variable compensation to senior executives will be described in the annual report for 2021  in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The board of directors' accounts of the remuneration committee's evaluation of the principles for remuneration to senior executives which are published on Truecaller's website  describes how Truecaller applies its principles for remuneration to senior executives in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.Authorization for the board of directorsThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board of directors to execute the resolution in accordance with the above and to ensure that the Subsidiary's board of directors carries out the transfer of the warrants in accordance with the above.Item 18: Resolution on the implementation of a long-term share program  amendments to the articles of association and hedging arrangements in respect of the programThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on:(A) implementation of a long-term share program (the ""Share Program 2022"") for employees in the Truecaller group;(B) amendments to the articles of association whereby the possibility to issue redeemable and convertible C shares is introduced; and(C) hedging arrangements in respect of the Share Program 2022  consisting of:(I) an authorization for the board of directors to decide on a directed issue of redeemable and convertible C shares;(II) an authorization for the board of directors to decide on a repurchase of C shares; and(III) transfers of own ordinary shares of series B to Share Program 2022 participants (employees in the Truecaller group).Should the majority requirement under item 18 (C) not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting approves that the company enters into an equity swap agreement with a third party (item 18 (D)).Implementation of Share Program 2022 (Item 18 (A))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on the implementation of the Share Program 2022 in accordance with the below.Objectives and reasons for the proposalTruecaller has during a number of years resolved to implement long-term incentive programs. The board of directors has  when evaluating previous incentive programs  concluded that it would be effective to resolve on implementing a new incentive program at the annual general meeting; adapting the structure with the aim of recruiting  rewarding and retaining valuable employees in a more appropriate manner and promote and create long-term participation in the Truecaller group  thereby closely aligning the employees' interests with those of Truecaller's shareholders. Consequently  the Share Program 2022 is structured to create long-term incentives for members of the senior executives and certain other employees in order to improve Truecaller's development and create long-term values. In view of the terms proposed below  the size of the allotment and other circumstances  the board of directors assesses that the proposed Share Program 2022 is well-balanced and that it will be beneficial for the company and its shareholders.Description of Share Program 20221. The Share Program 2022 shall comprise not more than 5 100 000 ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller  corresponding to approximately 1.36 percent of the total number of issued shares and approximately 0.64 percent of the total number of votes in Truecaller.2. The Share Program 2022 is proposed to include senior executives and key employees (""Group 1"") together with certain other employees (""Group 2"") (jointly the ""Participants"").3. It is proposed that the Share Program 2022 shall grant the possibility of allotment of ordinary shares of series B free of charge (""Performance Shares"")  subject to the fulfilment of the performance target during certain measurement periods (the ""Performance Periods"").4. Under the Share Program 2022  the Participants will receive a certain number of rights free of charge  which entitle the Participants to receive a certain number of ordinary shares of series B in the company following the expiration of a vesting period of three years for certain Participants and three and four years  respectively  for certain Participants (""Performance Share Rights""). At the implementation of the Share Program 2022  each Performance Share Right entitles the holder to one (1) ordinary share of series B (subject to the achievement of the Share Program 2022's performance target). With respect to Participants who participate in existing incentive programs in the Truecaller group (""Participants in Previous Programs"")  allotment of all Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026. With respect to Participants who do not participate in any existing incentive programs in the Truecaller group (""New Participants"")  allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2025 and allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026. Any allotment of ordinary shares of series B pursuant to Performance Share Rights will be subject to the achievement of the performance target  as set out below  and will generally require that the Participant retains his or her employment until the respective allotment date (the ""Vesting Period"").5. Within Group 1  allotment per Participant will depend on performance and position within the group and may not exceed 100 000 Performance Share Rights per Participant. The number of Participants in Group 1 shall not exceed 30 persons.6. Within Group 2  allotment per Participant will depend on performance and position within the group and may not exceed 40 000 Performance Share Rights per Participant. The number of Participants in Group 2 shall not exceed 350 persons.7. For full allotment  the company must achieve a combination of revenue growth rate (%) and adjusted EBITDA (%) of at least 50 percent annually  on average during the three financial years preceding the respective allotment date. In the event that the performance target falls below 50 percent  the allotment of Performance Shares shall decrease linearly  and in the event that the performance target falls below 25 percent  no allotment of Performance Shares shall be made. Accordingly  the Performance Period for Participants in Previous Programs runs during the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025  and the Performance Periods for New Participants run during the financial years 2022  2023 and 2024 with respect to 1/2 of the Performance Shares and during the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025 with respect to 1/2 of the Performance Shares.8. The actual allotment of Performance Share Rights to Participants  within the limits set out above  is decided by the board of directors and may be reduced proportionally based on the respective person's performance and time of employment within the Truecaller group.9. The right to receive ordinary shares of series B under the Performance Share Rights is conditioned on continued employment within the Truecaller group. Should the employment with the Truecaller group terminate due to redundancy  illness  retirement pursuant to a succession plan approved by the Truecaller group (or similar)  the Participant may keep the Performance Share Rights not yet vested pro rata in relation to the time passed since the date the Performance Share Rights were allotted until the termination date  and the remainder of the rights will lapse. Should the Participant's employment with the Truecaller group terminate due to any other reason prior to the expiration of the Vesting Period  all Performance Share Rights held by the Participant will normally lapse. Performance Share Rights shall not constitute securities and may not be transferred  pledged or otherwise disposed of by the Participant.10. Any allotment of ordinary shares of series B pursuant at vesting of the Performance Shares Rights depends on the extent to which the performance target is met during the Performance Periods  thereby establishing what portion (if any) of the Performance Share Rights that will give the Participants right to receive ordinary shares of series B at the end of the Vesting Period. the company will provide information to the shareholders to what extent the performance target has been achieved after the end of each Performance Period. In total  not more than one (1) Performance Share per Performance Share Right may be allocated (disregarding any recalculation under the terms of the Share Program 2022).11. Provided that the performance target above has been met during the relevant Performance Period and the Participant has retained his or her employment (unless special circumstances are at hand)  allotment of all Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026 with respect to Participants in Previous Programs  and allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2025 and allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026 with respect to New Participants.12. When determining the final vesting level of Performance Share Rights  the board of directors shall examine whether the vesting level is reasonable considering Truecaller's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the board of directors  reduce the vesting level to the lower level deemed appropriate by the board of directors.13. In order to align the Participants' and shareholders' interests  Truecaller will compensate for any dividends and other value transfers to the shareholders during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of shares to which each Performance Share Right entitles and/or by adjusting the performance target. The performance target and/or the number of ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller which each Performance Share Right entitles the Participant to receive may be recalculated as a result of e.g. bonus issues  reverse splits or splits of shares  interim dividend  new share issues  reductions of the share capital  or similar actions. The transfer of shares may be accelerated as a result of any merger  change of control or similar actions.14. The board of directors shall resolve on the detailed terms and conditions for the Share Program 2022 and  in the event of company related events  market conditions  local legislation or other rules  regulatory changes  or other events  the board of directors shall be entitled to make deviations from and adjustments of the terms and conditions of the Share Program 2022 or settle all or part of the Performance Shares in cash.Costs and effects on important key ratiosThe costs of the Share Program 2022  which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been made based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Truecaller ordinary share of series B of SEK 64 based on the closing price as of April 21  2022  (ii) no dividends are paid by Truecaller during the Share Program 2022 and (iii) an assessment of total Performance Shares earned during the Vesting Period of 70 percent  (iv) an employee turnover of 10 percent per year. In total  this can lead to maximum costs for the Share Program 2022 of approximately SEK 160 million  excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are estimated to approximately SEK 160 million assuming an annual share price increase of 45 percent during the Vesting Period.The expected annual costs of the Share Program 2022  including annualized social security charges of approximately SEK 40 million  would have corresponded to approximately 23 percent of Truecaller's total annual employee costs 2021.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and that the Share Program 2022 was introduced in 2020 instead  it is estimated that the key ratio earnings per share for the full year 2021 had decreased from 0.72 SEK to approximately SEK 0.50.The board of directors deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior executives and other employees  which may be further increased through the Share Program 2022  outweighs the costs related to the Share Program 2022.DilutionUpon full allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares under the Share Program 2022 amounts to 5 100 000 ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller  corresponding to a dilution effect of approximately 1.36 percent of the share capital and approximately 0.64 percent of the votes based on the number of issued shares as per the day of this proposal.Preparation of the proposal  etc.The proposal regarding Share Program 2022 has been prepared by the board of directors in consultation with external advisors. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board of directors  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Description of ongoing variable compensation programsTruecaller's ongoing share-based incentive programs and variable compensation to senior executives are described in the annual report for 2021  in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The board of directors' accounts of the remuneration committee's evaluation of the principles for remuneration to senior executives  which are published on Truecaller's website  describes how Truecaller applies its principles for remuneration to senior executives in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.Amendments to the articles of association (Item 18 (B))In order to enable the issuance of redeemable and convertible C shares under Share Program 2022  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend ¬ß 6 in the company's articles of association in accordance with the following. The amendment to ¬ß 6 of the company's articles of association also means that the preference share classes is removed  which means that the company will only be able to issue ordinary shares of series A and B and C shares in accordance with the new articles of association.These changes mean that ¬ß 6 of the company's articles of association will have the following wording.Proposed wording¬ß 6 Classes of shares Shares may be issued in three classes  ordinary shares of series A  ordinary shares of series B and series C shares. The ordinary shares of series A shall carry 10 votes per share  the ordinary shares of series B shall carry one vote per share and series C shares shall carry one-tenth of a vote per share. Shares of either share class may be issued up to an amount corresponding to the full share capital. Series C shares do not entitle to dividends. Upon the dissolution of the company  series C shares shall carry equivalent right to the company's assets as other shares  however  not to an amount exceeding the quota value of the share. If the company resolves to issue new ordinary shares of series A  ordinary shares of series B and series C shares  against payment other than contribution in kind  owners of ordinary shares of series A  ordinary shares of series B and series C shares shall have pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares of the same class pro rata to the number of shares previously held by them (primary pre-emption right). Shares which are not subscribed for pursuant to the primary pre-emption rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (secondary pre-emption right). If the shares thus offered are not sufficient for the subscription pursuant to the secondary pre-emption rights  the shares shall be allocated between the subscribers pro rata to the number of shares previously held and  to the extent such allocation cannot be effected  by the drawing of lots. Should the company decide not to issue shares of all series in conjunction with a cash issue or a set-off issue  all shareholders  irrespective of class of share  shall have a pre-emption right to subscribe for new shares in proportion to the number of shares they already own. What is set out above with regard to pre-emption rights shall apply mutatis mutandis in the event of issues of warrants and convertible debentures and shall not limit the right to resolve upon an issue with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights. In the event of a bonus issue  new shares of each class shall be issued pro rata to the number of shares of the same class previously issued. In connection therewith  the owners of existing shares of a certain class shall entitle the holder to new shares of the same class. This shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility of issuing new shares of a new class by means of a bonus issue  following the required amendments of the articles of association. Ordinary shares of series A shall  upon request of the owner of such shares be converted to ordinary shares of series B. Conversion requests must be made in writing by the shareholder to the company's board. The notice shall state the number of shares to be converted  and  if conversion will not relate to the owner's entire holding  which shares shall be converted. The board is obliged to process the request on the board meeting immediately following the request. The conversion shall be promptly submitted for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and shall be effective when registration of the conversion has been made with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden. Reduction of share capital  which in any case shall not fall below the minimum share capital  may  at the request of a holder of a series C share and after resolution by the company's board of directors or a shareholders' meeting  take place through redemption of series C shares. A request from a shareholder must be submitted in writing. When a resolution on reduction has been passed  an amount corresponding to the reduction amount shall be transferred to the company's reserve fund  if the required funds are available. The redemption amount per series C share shall be the quota value of such share. Following receipt of the redemption resolution  holders of shares subject to redemption shall promptly receive payment for the shares  or  if authorization for the redemption from the Swedish Companies Registration Office or a court is required  following the receipt of notice that the final and effected resolution has been registered. Series C shares held by the company may  upon resolution of the board of directors be converted into ordinary shares of series B. Immediately thereafter  the board of directors shall register the conversion with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The conversion is effected when it has been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden.Hedging arrangements in respect of the Share Program 2022 (Item 18 (C))The board of directors has evaluated different methods to secure the financial exposure and transfer of shares in accordance with the Share Program 2022  such as transfer of own shares and an equity swap agreement with a third party. The board of directors considers a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares and transfer of such shares to the Participants (following conversion of the shares to ordinary shares of series B) to be the most cost-effective and flexible method for hedging the financial exposure and transfer of own shares under the Share Program 2022.The board of directors proposes that the main option to secure the financial exposure shall be transfer of own shares (item 18 (C))  since the cost associated with an equity swap agreement vastly exceeds the costs of transferring own shares.Should the majority requirement under item 18 (C) not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting approves the entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party (item 18 (D)).Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to issue redeemable and convertible C shares (Item 18 (C) (I))Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to issue redeemable and convertible C shares  on one or more occasions  until the next annual general meeting.The issue shall be effected on the following terms.¬∑ The number of C shares that may be issued may amount to no more than 5 100 000.¬∑ The new C shares shall ‚Äì with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights ‚Äì be subscribed for only by an external party who has been informed in advance.¬∑ The price to be paid for each new share shall correspond to the quotient value of the share at the time of the subscription of the shares.¬∑ The new shares will be subject to restrictions as set forth in Chapter 4  Section 6 (conversion provision) and Chapter 20  Section 31 (redemption provision) of the Swedish Companies Act (SFS 2005:551).Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares (Item 18 (C) (II))Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible C shares in the company on the following terms.¬∑ Repurchase may be effected through a public offer directed to all owners of C shares in the company.¬∑ The authorization is valid and may be exercised on one or several occasions until the annual general meeting 2023.¬∑ The number of C shares permitted to be repurchased shall amount to no more than 5 100 000.¬∑ Repurchase of shares shall be made at the quotient value  applicable at the time of the subscription of shares according to item 18 (C) (I) above.¬∑ Payment for shares repurchased shall be made in cash.¬∑ The board of directors shall be authorized to establish additional terms for the repurchase.¬∑ The authorization shall also be valid for repurchase of so-called interim shares  designated by Euroclear Sweden AB as a ""paid subscription share"" (Sw. BTA) relating to a C share.The repurchase of own shares is an integrated part of the hedging arrangements for the Share Program 2022. The reason for the proposed authorization to repurchase own shares is for the company to be able to fulfil its obligations pursuant to the Share Program 2022 in a cost effective manner.Resolution on transfer of own ordinary shares of series B to Participants in the Share Program 2022 (Item 18 (C) (III))The board of directors proposes that the shares issued and repurchased in accordance with item 18 C (I) and (II)  after being converted into ordinary shares of series B  may be transferred to the Participants of the Share Program 2022.Resolution on transfers of the company's own ordinary shares of series B to Share Program 2022 Participants shall be made on the following terms.¬∑ Transfer of shares may only be made of ordinary shares of series B in the company  whereby a maximum of 5 100 000 ordinary shares of series B in the company may be transferred free of charge to Share Program 2022 Participants.¬∑ Right to purchase ordinary shares of series B in the company free of charge shall ‚Äì with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights ‚Äì be granted to the Participants in the Share Program 2022.¬∑ Transfers of ordinary shares of series B in the company shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms that the Share Program 2022 Participants are entitled to be allotted shares.¬∑ The number of ordinary shares of series B in the company that may be transferred under the Share Program 2022 will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party (Item 18 (D))Should the majority required under item 18 (C) above not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that the expected financial exposure of the Share Program 2022 shall be hedged by the company by entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market conditions  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer ordinary shares of series B in the company to the Participants of the Share Program 2022.Other informationConditionsThe annual general meeting's resolution on the implementation of Share Program 2022 according to item 18 (A) above is conditional upon the meeting resolving either in accordance with the board of directors' proposal under item 18 (B) and item 18 (C)  or resolving in accordance with the board of directors' proposal under item 18 (D).Majority requirementsThe annual general meeting's resolution according to item 18 (A) above require a simple majority among the votes cast. A valid resolution under item 18 (B) above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item 18 (C) above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item 18 (D) above requires a simple majority among the votes cast.Particular majority requirementsAside from the majority requirements set out in item 18  for valid resolutions on the proposals pursuant to items 14 and 15  the proposals have to be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual general meeting  and for a valid resolution on the proposals pursuant to items 16 and 17  the proposals have to be supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual general meeting.Information at the annual general meetingThe board of directors and the chief executive officer shall at the annual general meeting  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believes that it can be done without significant harm to the company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of items on the agenda  circumstances that can affect the assessment of the company's or its subsidiaries financial position and the company's relation to other companies within the group.Financial statements and complete proposalsFinancial statements  the audit report  the board of directors' remuneration report  the statement by the auditor on the compliance of the applicable guidelines for remuneration to senior executives as well as the complete proposals for resolutions with ancillary documents pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act  will be available for the shareholders at the company's office at M√§ster Samuelsgatan 56  SE-111 12 Stockholm  Sweden  and at the company's website (corporate.truecaller.com/governance/general-meetings) as from no later than three weeks prior to the annual general meeting.

3364,Clearstream,Google API,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/russia-faces-urgency-avoid-default-230000354.html,Russia Faces New Urgency to Dodge Default  Avoid Wall Street,1 day ago,(Bloomberg) -- Russia‚Äôs race to avoid default just escalated.Most Read from BloombergThe country has been inching closer after JPMorgan Chase & Co.  under orders from the U.S. Department of the Treasury  halted interest payments the country owed on two dollar-denominated bonds in recent weeks. The move forced the Russian central bank to make the payments in rubles instead and left it scrambling for ways to sidestep JPMorgan and rival Citigroup Inc. to make good on its debt.The situation got more serious on Wednesday: The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee said the ruble payment was a potential default  fueling growing consensus that Russia may have reneged on its debt obligations. The CDDC‚Äôs ruling  which doesn‚Äôt directly impact the debt  could trigger payment of credit-default swaps if Russia doesn‚Äôt pay bondholders in dollars before the debt‚Äôs grace period ends on May 4. The nation could still avert a default if it pays bondholders in dollars before that period ends.Russia ‚Äúis not at threat of default‚Äù and ‚Äúhas enough financial resources ‚Äù central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina said on Thursday.The country is exploring ways to reroute payments through domestic institutions as well as its own clearing agent. But it remains unclear if the efforts stand any chance of success and whether the moves would even help the country avoid default.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no clarity about any of this in the language‚Äù of the bond documents  Mitu Gulati  a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law  said in an interview. ‚ÄúSome judge would presumably have to decide all of this.‚ÄùOne option being considered is replacing the foreign banks acting as correspondent banks and paying agents on foreign-debt deals with the Central Bank of Russia  according to the Russian newspaper Vedomosti. A correspondent bank performs basic treasury services and manages foreign exchange for clients  while a paying-agent bank handles housekeeping on bonds  collecting interest from issuers and helping distribute it to investors.Story continuesUnder this scenario  payments to bondholders would progress to the Central Bank of Russia instead of the foreign correspondent bank and paying agent. They would then move to Russia‚Äôs domestic clearing agent  the National Settlement Depository. From there  the money would end up with local bondholders or in specially created ‚ÄúType C‚Äù accounts for bondholders from so-called hostile nations  like the U.S.For Russia  relying on its own domestic clearing agent would also allow it to sidestep foreign rivals that have held up payments to Russian investors. Euroclear and Clearstream  which process payments as central securities depositories  have blocked accounts the national Russian depository has with them  leaving payments to local bondholders in limbo.Russia‚Äôs big-business lobby  the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs  pitched a similar proposal for corporate borrowers as part of the group‚Äôs plan to avoid a wave of cross-defaults and foreign-asset freezes. In their pitch  nonresidents would receive payments for the bonds in special foreign-currency accounts with Russian banks  along with the right to sell the notes to the finance ministry or its agent.The move seeks to help a bevy of Russian companies that have been forced into technical default as their interest payments get held up in the web of foreign banks‚Äô due-diligence processes. Even Russian entities not subject to U.S. penalties have run into delays: Citigroup  for instance  ordered Severstal PJSC to seek a special waiver from the U.S. Treasury Department before it would process the steelmaker‚Äôs interest payment.Citigroup‚Äôs action -- which came after the Treasury issued a blocked-pending-investigation order  or BPI -- meant Severstal ran out of time to pay interest on the dollar debt. Representatives for Citigroup and Severstal declined to comment while the Treasury didn‚Äôt immediately respond to requests for comment.State-controlled lender VTB gave investors a glimpse into how these scenarios could work when it paid coupons on a dollar-denominated eurobond in rubles  Vedomosti reported on Wednesday. Investors from Russia and ‚Äúfriendly‚Äù nations received funds in their ruble accounts  while Russian currency was transferred to special ‚ÄúC‚Äù accounts for residents of hostile countries  the newspaper said.Still  switching paying agents likely won‚Äôt be easy: It requires agreement from a majority of creditors and  in some cases  bond documents require borrowers to give investors months of notice before they could make such a change.‚ÄòSelective Default‚ÄôIt‚Äôs also not clear that paying out in rubles would even help Russia or large Russian corporations avoid default. The country‚Äôs move to pay its sovereign dollar bonds maturing in 2022 and 2042 in rubles  for instance  resulted in S&P Global Ratings cutting Russia‚Äôs unsolicited foreign currency issuer credit ratings to ‚Äúselective default.‚Äù‚ÄúAlthough the default could be remedied under a 30-day grace period allowed under the terms and conditions of the bonds  we don‚Äôt expect that investors will be able to convert those ruble payments into dollars equivalent to the originally due amounts  or that the government will convert those payments within that grace period ‚Äù S&P said.But Gulati  who focuses on sovereign debt restructuring  said Russia‚Äôs bond documents do include a currency indemnity provision that appears to allow Russia to discharge its debt by paying in rubles  so long as the recipient can use those rubles to buy a sufficient number of dollars.‚ÄúBoiled down  the clause seems to say that payment in a different currency can constitute a ‚Äòdischarge ‚Äô so long as the recipient can use those rubles to buy a sufficient number of dollars ‚Äù Gulati said in a post on his blog. ‚ÄúThat seems to mean that Russia can discharge its obligations by paying in rubles.‚ÄùUnder a second proposal recommended by the Russian government  borrowers would make interest payments to investors through separate channels depending on where an investor is based. Payments to foreign holders would be handled by a foreign payment agent  though that entity could run into similar restrictions. Russian holders would get their funds via domestic institutions.The Russian government subcommittee that put forward the plan also recommended using rubles to buy back eurobonds from Russian investors as an alternative  a move Russia already made with a $2 billion bond that matured on Apr. 4.The stalled coupon payments -- along with a bevy of others that are linked to debt from Russia‚Äôs biggest companies -- have thrust the normally staid back office of Wall Street into the spotlight. It also underscores the quagmire Wall Street‚Äôs biggest banks have found themselves in as de facto enforcers of U.S. President Joe Biden‚Äôs sanctions  an outcome they‚Äôd anticipated since Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine first began.‚ÄúWe are in continuous communication with the U.S. government and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime ‚Äù Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Jane Fraser told analysts on a conference call last week. ‚ÄúBut I‚Äôve run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine.‚Äù(Updates with comments from Russia‚Äôs central bank governor in fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek¬©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.02,0.53,0.45,mixed,0.04,0.15,0.81,True,English,"['New Urgency', 'Dodge Default', 'Wall Street', 'Russia', 'unsolicited foreign currency issuer credit ratings', 'The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee', 'central bank Governor Elvira Nabiullina', 'S&P Global Ratings', 'foreign banks‚Äô due-diligence processes', 'U.S. Treasury Department', 'U.S. Department', 'U.S. penalties', 'enough financial resources', 'National Settlement Depository', 'central securities depositories', 'State-controlled lender VTB', 'Type C‚Äù accounts', 'national Russian depository', 'large Russian corporations', 'foreign correspondent bank', 'special foreign-currency accounts', 'special ‚ÄúC‚Äù accounts', 'Russian central bank', 'basic treasury services', 'domestic clearing agent', 'rival Citigroup Inc.', '30-day grace period', 'two dollar-denominated bonds', 'sovereign dollar bonds', 'Russian currency', 'The CDDC', 'foreign exchange', 'foreign rivals', 'correspondent banks', 'Russian banks', 'paying-agent bank', 'domestic institutions', 'special waiver', 'dollar-denominated eurobond', 'ruble accounts', 'Russian companies', 'Russian entities', 'paying agent', 'recent weeks', 'growing consensus', 'credit-default swaps', 'bond documents', 'Mitu Gulati', 'Virginia School', 'One option', 'foreign-debt deals', 'hostile nations', 'big-business lobby', 'similar proposal', 'foreign-asset freezes', 'finance ministry', 'pending-investigation order', 'friendly‚Äù nations', 'hostile countries', 'dollar debt', 'Russian newspaper', 'ruble payment', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'Russian investors', 'corporate borrowers', 'potential default', 'debt obligations', 'technical default', 'Selective Default', 'local bondholders', 'Severstal PJSC', 'interest payment', 'agents', 'payments', 'Bloomberg', 'country', 'Co.', 'orders', 'move', 'rubles', 'ways', 'situation', 'Wednesday', 'ruling', 'dollars', 'May', 'threat', 'Thursday', 'efforts', 'chance', 'success', 'clarity', 'language', 'professor', 'University', 'Law', 'interview', 'judge', 'Vedomosti', 'clients', 'housekeeping', 'issuers', 'Story', 'scenario', 'money', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'limbo', 'Union', 'Industrialists', 'Entrepreneurs', 'plan', 'wave', 'cross-defaults', 'pitch', 'nonresidents', 'right', 'notes', 'bevy', 'web', 'delays', 'instance', 'steelmaker', 'action', 'BPI', 'time', 'Representatives', 'requests', 'comment', 'glimpse', 'coupons', 'funds', 'agreement', 'majority', 'creditors', 'cases', 'months', 'notice', 'terms', 'conditions']",2022-04-22,2022-04-22,ca.finance.yahoo.com

Agile service providers offering reliable and innovative digital solutions for the financial sector may even be considered as beneficiaries of the crisis. This holds particularly true for solutions for cashless payments or 'neo-brokering' (i.e.  online brokerage services at low or even nil execution costs).As a matter of general tendency  the fintech market in Germany has already become relatively consolidated and mature and its influence on the financial sector has been rather revolutionary in nature.2 Although a 'winner-takes-all' phenomenon has been observed (attributed to increased competition and high acquisition costs)  fintechs are still expected to benefit from new business opportunities.3 It might also be perceived as an indication of a matured market that fintech companies have increasingly been integrated by banks and financial institutions into their value chains.4These developments  however  do not mean that the German fintech market has become stagnant. The opposite is true. According to a study  in 2021 there were 639 active fintech companies in Germany  out of which 55 per cent were under five years old.5 The highest proportion of young start-ups was identified in the risk and compliance (96 per cent) and decentralised finance (DeFi) (72 per cent) segments.6 As far as financing and capital access for young fintech companies is concerned  financing activity in Germany was on the rise in 2021  with the total number of financing transactions increasing by an average of 6 per cent per quarter  with early-stage financings most frequent in the fields of asset management and investment  credit and factoring  as well as DeFi.7 In addition  the German fintech market has seen significant funding for neo-banks and neo-brokers. Other significant fintech segments include banking  application programming interface banking and personal finance management.8 Thus  even though overall start-up activity in Germany has declined in the past three years (by an average of 1 per cent per quarter) 9 new fintech companies are being established and further developments can be expected.Fintech-related topics have been frequently and intensively discussed in Germany  not only by participants in the financial sector but also by politicians and regulatory authorities. In particular  the question of whether the present legal framework gives sufficient leeway for the application of blockchain-based business models while simultaneously providing a sufficient level of protection for market participants has been the subject matter of these discussions. As a result  an EU-wide framework for cryptoassets and an EU-level sandbox model have been proposed by the European Commission as part of the Digital Finance Package.10In 2020  the German federal legislator introduced statutory provisions according to which crypto values qualify as financial instruments for financial licensing purposes and crypto custody business became subject to a licence requirement under the German Banking Act (KWG). Further  in 2021 the German securities law was fundamentally changed: the introduction of electronic securities implemented one of the key points of the German government's blockchain strategy.11 With this step  the German legislator is following the path of other European countries towards securities dematerialisation.12Further  the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has published several statements  explanations and opinions13 on topics such as big data  artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs)  as well as digitalisation and information security.14 The recent statutory rules on crypto values and the crypto custody business  as well as on blockchain-based dematerialised securities  also indicate that the legislator has realised the need to provide legal certainty for innovative business models and services.Generally  the German legislator and BaFin apply the technology-neutral principle of 'same business  same risk  same regulation'.15 This is illustrated by the fact that neither the legislator nor BaFin has promulgated rules that privilege fintech companies compared to traditional players in the financial sector. Therefore  a 'sandbox' model that establishes an innovation space where fintech companies may test business models without tight regulation as established in the United Kingdom and in Switzerland has not been introduced in Germany yet.Hence  BaFin attempts to find a balance between supervisory concerns and the start-up culture that often exists within the fintech sector. As part of its efforts in this regard  BaFin provides fintech companies with information concerning supervisory issues on its website.There is no special public funding instrument for fintech companies  but the German Ministry of Economics has set up the programme 'INVEST' to help start-ups raise venture capital. If business angels purchase shares of newly founded innovative companies and hold them for more than three years  20 per cent of their original investment will be reimbursed by the state up to a limit of ‚Ç¨100 000.16 To qualify for the programme  investors have to spend at least ‚Ç¨10 000. Invested capital must not result from a third-party loan to the investor. Furthermore  the business angel has to participate in the new company's gains and losses. Investors must be natural persons living in the European Economic Area (EEA) or must use special investment companies registered in Germany (e.g.  the limited liability company  GmbH).Generally speaking  German regulatory authorities and the government emphasise that they recognise the potential of fintech for public economic benefit  while the regulation partly still seems rather conservative when the traditional regulatory standards  which stem from the pre-digitalisation era  are applied (although the efforts of BaFin to support fintech companies by offering detailed legal information and by improving the communication channels  as well as recent legislative changes concerning the regulatory requirements for cryptoasset-related services  are evident). The current dynamics in the field of regulating digital finance  blockchain and cryptoassets  both at the EU and a national level  indicates that the legal framework relevant for fintech companies has gained material momentum and may be expected to further evolve quite fast.The potential of digitalisation has not only been recognised by the participants in the financial industry  but also by central regulators for the purposes of the monetary system. In particular  the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to work on the development of a digital euro  which would be an electronic form of a legal tender  introduced for the use by natural persons and firms alongside cash.17 In July 2021  the Governing Council of the ECB decided to launch the investigation phase of the digital euro project  which started in October 2021 and will last two years. It remains to be seen what the outcome of the investigation phase will be and whether the path towards a digital euro will be pursued.18Regulationi Licensing and marketingThe general rules apply to licensing and marketing of fintech companies in Germany. Because there is no specific fintech licence available in Germany  the regulation of fintech companies depends ultimately on the business they carry out. This again results from the technology-neutral 'same business  same risk  same rules' approach. The entire array of licences and marketing restrictions may therefore become relevant for fintech business models.In particular  the following types of licences have to be taken into account:licence pursuant to Section 32(1) of the Banking Act (KWG) for providing banking businesses within the meaning of Section 1(1)  sentence 2 of the KWG; licence pursuant to Section 15(1) of the recently introduced Securities Institutions Act (WpIG) implementing Directive (EU) 2019/2034 on the prudential supervision of investment firms or pursuant to Section 32(1) of the KWG for providing financial services within the meaning of Section 2(2) of the WpIG and Section 1(1a)  sentence 2 of the KWG (including  since 1 January 2020  the crypto custody business within the meaning of Section 1(1a)  sentence 2  No. 6 of the KWG  which is of particular relevance for fintech companies); licence pursuant to Section 10(1) of the Payment Services Supervisory Act (ZAG) for providing payment services or pursuant to Section 11 of the ZAG for the issuance of e-money; licence pursuant to Section 20(1) of the Capital Investment Code (KAGB) or  less burdensome  the mere registration pursuant to Section 44(1) of the KAGB for offering collective asset/funds management; licence pursuant to Sections 34c  34d and 34f of the Industrial Code (GewO) for the brokerage of loans  insurance contracts and certain financial products; and licence pursuant to Section 8(1) of the Insurance Supervisory Act for conducting insurance business.In addition  the EU-wide Regulation (EU) 2020/1503 on European crowdfunding service providers for business (ECSPR) has applied since November 2021; this requires crowdfunding services providers to obtain authorisation from the national supervisory authority (in Germany  BaFin).Under German law  a licence requirement is generally triggered if one intends to provide  in Germany  commercially  or on a scale that requires commercially  organised business undertaking one of the services listed in the comprehensive catalogues of regulated activities referred to above. Consequently  it needs to be carefully analysed whether a fintech business model falls within the scope of one or several of these regulated services.Depending on the type of licence  different authorities might be competent to grant the relevant licence. Placing the competent authorities in a hierarchy  the ECB is at the top with its competence for granting licences for institutions that intend to carry out banking business that includes lending and deposit-taking business and for most systemic investment firms. Beneath the ECB  BaFin is the competent authority for institutions that intend to provide banking business except for lending and deposit taking  including investment services (other than most systemic investment firms) and other financial services  payment services  collective asset or funds management and insurance business. The third level in the hierarchy would consist of the authorities that have been endowed under the German federal state laws with the competence to grant licences pursuant to the GewO.All these types of licences may become relevant for fintech business models. This can be illustrated by the observation that 'fintech banks' were established in Germany as institutions holding a banking licence granted by ECB.Both the requirements to obtain a licence under the German financial supervisory laws and subsequent ongoing legal requirements depend on the type of licence. For instance  the requirements to obtain a licence pursuant to Section 15(1) of the WpIG for providing investment brokerage or investment advice are less tight than obtaining a licence pursuant to Section 32(1) of the KWG for guarantee or for safe custody business. In this regard  it makes a significant difference for regulatory purposes whether an institution is entitled to hold funds or assets for its clients because in this case the regulatory requirements are stricter and more comprehensive.The licence requirement for the crypto custody business  introduced under the KWG in 2020  may be considered the first fintech-specific or at least fintech-focused licence requirement under German law. The corresponding changes to the KWG were made in the course of the implementation of the Fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Directive19 but without the legal necessity under EU law to make such changes to the KWG. The relevant Section 1(1a)  sentence 2  No. 6 of the KWG defines crypto custody business as custody  management and safeguarding of crypto values or private cryptographic keys used to hold  store or transfer crypto values as a service for others. Cryptographic values  which are now explicitly included in the catalogue of financial instruments under Section 1(11)  sentence 1  No. 10 of the KWG  are defined as digital representations of value that are not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority  do not possess statutory status of currency or money  but are accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of exchange or payment  or that serve investment purposes and that can be transferred  stored and traded electronically. Consequently  the term crypto value includes not only cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin  but also investment tokens. The broad definition of the terms 'crypto value' and 'crypto custody business' (including the activities relating to private cryptographic keys) results in a wide scope of the new licence requirement. The KWG  however  provides for certain relief insofar as crypto custody service providers focusing on this type of financial service (i.e.  that do not carry out any other regulated activities) do not have to meet all regulatory obligations applying to other providers of financial services. Instead  these crypto custody service providers are exempted from the general capital and liquidity requirements under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) 20 recently amended by CRR II21 and some other rules. However  the requirements on the initial capital  reputation of the board members  proper business organisation and related reporting obligations do apply. Further guidance with respect to crypto custody business has been provided by BaFin.22At the same time  the licensing regime that may apply to fintech business models is constantly evolving in the EU and so in Germany. This includes the changes of the licensing regime relevant for fintech businesses as introduced by the new EU legislation on European crowdfunding service providers for business (the ECSPR)  which also required changes to the German legal framework  the proposed EU Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation (MiCA) and the recent legislation on securities dematerialisation.23 Although it would exceed the given framework to elaborate on the licence requirements for every single fintech-relevant business model  it may be worth illustrating the licence requirement by reference to the robo-advice business model  as these have become popular in Germany in recent years.Generally speaking  a robo-adviser might be subject to a licence requirement pursuant to Section 15(1) of the WpIG  in particular to provide investment brokerage  investment advice or portfolio management services. BaFin will only grant the necessary licence if  among other requirements  the applicant has at least ‚Ç¨75 000 at its free disposal 24 if its managing directors are professionally qualified and with an impeccable reputation and if the applicant can prove that proper risk management will be in place when the regulated business will be commenced.By way of exception from this general licence requirement under the WpIG  investment brokerage and investment advice may be provided under the less restrictive licence pursuant to Section 34f of the GewO; however  only specific financial products may be brokered or recommended under this privileged licence  which is granted not by BaFin but by the competent authorities in accordance with the laws of the relevant federal state. An additional exception is available for tied agents who closely cooperate with a licensed institution.When robo-advisory models were introduced  some of the service providers offered robo-advice in the form of investment brokerage by connecting the supply of specific financial products to customers' demand for financial instruments. These models try to implement a structure where the client stays in charge of the investment process so that they make the ultimate decision to buy or sell a financial instrument. There is  however  a thin line between investment brokerage and investment advice. Although BaFin did not pursue a strict approach until 2017  it then made clear that a robo-adviser provides investment advice if clients could get the impression that the investment proposals presented by the robo-adviser are tailored to their individual circumstances.25 The distinction between both types of investment services becomes relevant for the type of licence that is required and  in practice  more important  with respect to the requirements with which the robo-adviser must comply in offering its services. In particular  the suitability report that an investment adviser must prepare and that aims to show how the recommended financial products suit the needs of the client26 is  for many robo-advisers  a bureaucratic obstacle they would like to avoid.Both the stricter position of BaFin and the preference not to prepare a suitability report for each investment have led to many robo-advisers becoming licensed as portfolio managers.27 Providing this type of investment service  however  involves the obligation to adhere to a comprehensive set of rules of conduct so that robo-advisers must thoroughly analyse which route suits them best and which type of licence they need for their individual business model.With respect to marketing regulations applicable to fintech companies in Germany  the general rule is that marketing must be fair  transparent and not misleading. These principles follow from the Act against Unfair Competition but are also included in some of the statutory provisions for financial services.28 Whether additional rules have to be taken into account depends primarily on the understanding of the term 'marketing'.As far as marketing for investment services within the meaning of Section 2(8) of the Securities Trading Act (WpHG) is concerned (including investment brokerage  investment advice  portfolio management and underwriting business)  it is rather difficult to distinguish marketing from the rules of conduct for service providers set out in  inter alia  Section 63 et seq. of the WpHG and a regulation promulgated thereunder (the Regulation specifying the rules of conduct and organisational requirements for investment services companies (WpDVerOV))  but also in various delegated regulations promulgated under the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II).29 These require that offerors of investment services provide their potential clients with mandatory information regarding  for instance  their products (e.g.  key information sheets)  potential conflicts of interest and inducements  and that they obtain certain information from their clients. Further  investment service providers must comply with detailed requirements set out in the Minimum Requirements for the Compliance Function and Additional Requirements governing Rules of Conduct  Organisation and Transparency (MaComp)  which have been promulgated by BaFin.Similar rules as for investment services apply to the marketing of funds under Section 298 et seq. of the KAGB. The information obligations for professional or semi-professional clients are less comprehensive than those for retail clients.Regarding marketing for payment services  a comprehensive set of pre-contractual information obligations is provided for in the German Civil Code (BGB) in conjunction with Article 248 of the Introductory Act to the BGB (EGBGB).Further  marketing for certain fintech-related services might entail the obligation to publish a prospectus. This obligation may be triggered once a public offer for securities or financial assets has been made in accordance with the Prospectus Act (WpPG) or the Asset Investment Act (VermAnlG)  unless an exemption under the ECSPR applies.Fintech companies in Germany should therefore check whether marketing for their business might be captured by one of the comprehensive legal regimes for marketing.ii Cross-border issuesAs a general rule  the German regulations apply to each service provider conducting its business in Germany. This means that the rules ‚Äì particularly the licensing requirement ‚Äì not only apply if the service provider has its registered office in Germany  but also if it actively targets the German market cross-border.30Pure accessibility of the relevant services via the internet in Germany may be considered sufficient to assume that a service provider is actively targeting the German market. The regulations apply if the offeror of the relevant services intends the service to be used by German customers among users of different nationalities.31 If a service provider maintains its website in German  this is considered to be a strong indication of actively targeting the German market.If  however  the provision of regulated services cross-border is concerned  the privilege to notify German regulators of existing licences from a home Member State within the EEA might offer an exception from this general rule  which may appear very strict at the first glance. The European 'passport' has been introduced for many regulated services  such as certain types of banking business  investment services as set out in Annex 1 of MiFID II  payment services and  recently  by way of the ECSPR  crowdfunding services. If a service provider has been licensed in its EEA-home Member State  it may notify its competent supervisory authority of its intent to also offer the regulated services in Germany.32 Generally speaking  the service provider may commence the regulated business without a separate licence in Germany either on a cross-border basis or through a branch once the competent supervisory authority in the home Member State has informed BaFin  which subsequently has confirmed that the service provider may commence its business in Germany. In this scenario  the supervisory authority in the home Member State is generally responsible for the supervision of the service provider's activities in Germany  subject to certain residual competences of BaFin and the German Federal Bank. Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU (and the lapse of the transition period on 31 December 2020) licensed UK companies active in the fintech business may no longer use the EU passport to offer their services in other Member States (and vice versa) and generally need to establish a subsidiary in Germany or another EU Member State to obtain a licence and comply with EU regulatory requirements  basically as any third-country licensed institution.Another possibility for fintech companies to access the German market without being subject to a licence requirement is to cooperate with a licensed service provider  typically a bank. These ventures are 'white label structures' where a regulated entity (fronting bank) effectively makes available its licence for the business activities of a third party. For this purpose  the third party must subordinate its business to the bank's management by granting instruction and control rights to the bank  which for regulatory purposes is responsible for the regulated services.Digital identity and onboardingTo date  there is no generally recognised digital identity available in Germany. However  it is possible to identify oneself electronically via the internet if the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation33 are met. Details relating to this have been provided for in the Act on Trust Services.Regarding the onboarding process as required under the statutory AML and counterterrorism rules  the Anti-Money Laundering Code (GwG)  which was revised as part of the implementation of the Fifth EU AML Directive  includes various possibilities for remote identification. However  non-face-to-face business relationships or transactions may indicate higher AML risks34 and thus may trigger enhanced customer due diligence requirements. BaFin has published the standards for video identification35 as well as its guidance on the interpretation of the GwG 36 which are generally rather strict.Possibly  solutions enabling the creation and management of a digital identity will be available in the EU and therefore also in Germany in the future. At the EU level  efforts can be observed within the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework to develop solutions that could allow EU citizens to create and use their digital identity and that would be compatible with the eIDAS electronic identification framework. A corresponding initiative is also pursued in Germany within the project IDunion.37Digital markets  payment services and fundingInnovative funding solutions and business models related to payment services are typical areas in which fintech companies conduct business in Germany. Regulators have been struggling for some years to find a position on collective investment schemes balancing regulation to protect investors  in particular retail investors  and to allow innovative solutions that may also serve retail investors' interests. Eventually  both EU and German legislators concluded that the regulatory requirements applicable to investment business models shall generally (subject to limited privileges) also apply to collective investment schemes. Similarly  with regard to digital markets in general  the German legislator and BaFin apply the technology-neutral principle of 'same business  same risk  same regulation'. Therefore  the exact scope of the applicable requirements  in particular the assessment of whether a licence requirement under the KWG or the WpIG may be triggered  generally requires an in-depth analysis on the specific business model and should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.At the same time  in light of this common 'same business  same risk  same regulation' approach  certain significant legislative developments have recently taken place. The implementation of the Fifth EU AML Directive into German law at the beginning of 2020 provided a certain level of clarity on the regulatory qualification of activities in the cryptocurrency or cryptoassets business. As part of the implementation package  the German federal legislator introduced a legal definition of 'crypto values' and explicitly included these in the catalogue of financial instruments under the KWG.38 In line with the Fifth EU AML Directive  the statutory definition of crypto values is broad in scope so that all potential uses of virtual currencies  including as a means of investment  are covered. On the international level  these various types of virtual units of value  also described as coins or tokens  are often referred to collectively as 'cryptoassets'.39In September 2020  the European Commission published the EU Digital Finance Package40 aiming to develop the digital single market  promote innovation and growth of fintech start-ups and adjust the existing regulatory regime to new technologies such as AI and blockchain. In essence  the EU Digital Finance Package consists of:a retail payments strategy to facilitate payments in shops and e-commerce; the proposal for an EU-wide directly applicable regulation on digital resilience for the financial sector addressing cybersecurity and ICT-related risks; legislative proposals for an EU markets in cryptoassets regulation (MiCA); and an EU-level pilot regime for market infrastructures based on distributed ledger technology.In the field of crowdfunding  in October 2020 the EU legislator adopted an EU-wide regulation setting out a comprehensive regulatory regime for EU crowdfunding service providers for business  the ECSPR  which has become directly applicable in all EU Member States as a unified EU standard for lending-based and equity-based crowdfunding since November 2021.In Germany  recent key developments relevant for digital markets include recent legislation providing for the optional partial dematerialisation of securities. For more details concerning the new rules and proposals referred to above  see Section V.i Peer-to-peer-lendingWhether and which regulatory rules apply for peer-to-peer-lending depends on the specific business model. Crowdfunding based on donations the investors make to support a special project (crowd-sponsoring) is generally not subject to financial regulation. If  however  the investor benefits financially from his or her investment; for example  by participating in future profits of the project (crowd investing) or by being reimbursed with or without interest (crowd-lending)  special regulations apply.41 These regulations may be distinguished as falling under supervisory law  consumer law and capital market law. Since 10 November 2021  the special regime for crowdfunding service providers under the ECSPR and the corresponding provisions of the German law have applied.Supervisory lawPeer-to-peer lending in the form of crowd investing or crowd-lending may entail consequences under financial supervisory law for the lender  the borrower and the platform.42 The key concern relates to possible licensing requirements. In particular  the licensing requirement for lending business must be considered.43 A licence requirement is triggered if the lender acts commercially or in a manner that requires a commercially established business operation. It is sufficient if the lender intends to repeatedly engage in the lending business to make profits.The taking of deposits commercially or on a scale that requires a commercially established business operation is also subject to a licensing requirement.44 These requirements may become relevant for all involved parties; for example  the platform if it keeps the funds extended by the lenders until the funds are transferred to a single or several borrowers. If the platform performs this function and transfers funds from the investors to the borrowers  the platform may also be subject to a licensing requirement under the ZAG for providing payment services. The licensing requirement under the KWG may become relevant for the investors who provide the funds extended to a single or various borrowers too. Even the borrowers may be subject to a licensing requirement for conducting the deposit-taking business when they receive the funds from the platform or the investors.Given these regulatory restrictions  peer-to-peer-lending business models in Germany typically include a fronting bank that holds a licence for the lending and deposit-taking business. In these models  the fronting bank extends the loans to the borrowers  and the bank refinances the loans by selling the repayment claims arising under them to the platform for on-selling to investors or directly to investors who ultimately receive the repayment claim against the borrower. The various business transactions between the involved parties relating to the extension of a loan are interdependent by way of conditions precedent. Therefore  the bank is only obliged to extend the loan if investors have committed to provide sufficient funds for the purchase of the repayment claims arising under the loan. The platform  which is typically a fintech company  is acting in this model as a broker that brings together investors and borrowers.This structure is usually not critical for the investors as they only acquire a repayment claim  which is not subject to a licensing requirement  provided that the acquisitions do not occur under a framework agreement. In the latter case  a licensing requirement for providing factoring business could be triggered.45 For the borrowers  this model is not problematic either. One might consider whether they engage in deposit-taking business. However  it is generally recognised under German law that borrowing funds from a licensed bank does not constitute deposit-taking. The fronting bank has in this model the necessary licences so the remaining question is whether the platform performs business activities subject to a licence requirement. The platform might conduct the factoring business if it acquires the repayment claims from the bank prior to selling them on to investors. Usually  however  the factoring business can be avoided by certain structural arrangements. In this case  the regulated activities of the platform consist of brokering loans (between the bank and the borrowers) and investments (between the platform or the bank and investors as purchasers of the repayment claims). These are activities that can be structured to avoid regulation under the KWG and the WpIG and to ensure that 'only' the licence requirements under Sections 34c and 34f of the GewO need to be met. BaFin considers the repayment claims brokered by the platform to be financial assets within the meaning of the VermAnlG and  therefore  financial instruments within the meaning of the WpIG  so that  in principle  the brokering activity could also be subject to a licensing requirement pursuant to Section 15(1) of the WpIG  which is  however  typically avoided by taking advantage of an exception.New crowdfunding regulatory regimeSince November 2021  crowdfunding service providers in the EU have been subject to a single regulatory regime set out in the ECSPR. The key notion of the ECSPR is the 'crowdfunding service' defined as the matching of business funding interests of investors and project owners through the use of a crowdfunding platform and which consists of the facilitation of granting loans or placing without a firm commitment basis  as referred to in MiFID II  of transferable securities and admitted instruments for crowdfunding purposes issued by project owners or a special purpose vehicle  and the reception and transmission of client orders in relation to those transferable securities and admitted instruments for crowdfunding purposes.The following are outside the scope of the ECSPR:crowdfunding services provided to project owners that are consumers (consumer loans are already subject to a separate regulatory regime provided for in the Consumer Credit Directive);46 services related to crowdfunding services provided in accordance with national laws; and crowdfunding offers with consideration thresholds exceeding ‚Ç¨5 million calculated over 12 months.In this regard  the EU Prospectus Regulation47 has been amended accordingly so that the obligation to publish a prospectus does not apply to an offer of securities to the public from a crowdfunding service provider authorised under the ECSPR provided that it does not exceed the above threshold. A respective clarifying provision referencing the exemption under the EU Prospectus Regulation has been included in the German WpPG.Pursuant to the ECSPR  crowdfunding services providers need to apply for authorisation from the national supervisory authority in their EU Member State and shall be registered in a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) register comprising all operating crowdfunding platforms. The ECSPR sets out unified requirements on the provision of crowdfunding services  including prudential requirements (safeguards of generally no less than ‚Ç¨25 000)  effective and prudent management  minimum due diligence requirements in respect of project owners to be offered on the crowdfunding platform and requirements on complaints handling and conflicts of interest. ESMA has published 12 draft regulatory technical standards under the ECSPR on matters such as complaints handling  conflicts of interest  application for authorisation  key investment information and information and reporting obligations  which are currently in the consultation stage.It is expected that the ECSPR will facilitate the development of crowdfunding platforms and the provision of cross-border crowdfunding services. It remains to be seen how the ECSPR will impact crowdfunding business in the future.Consumer lawIn Germany  as in the European Union generally  relatively strict consumer protection rules apply. This is also the case for consumer loans. Consequently  a direct contract between the lender and the borrower brokered by a peer-to-peer lending platform triggers far-reaching information obligations for the lender under Section 491 et seq. of the BGB  provided that the lender acts commercially and the borrower is a consumer. Given the typical structure for peer-to-peer lending platforms in Germany  the fronting bank implemented in the structure must typically comply with these obligations.Further  given that peer-to-peer lending platforms typically offer their services online  the consumer protection rules on distance selling must be considered (Section 312a et seq. of the BGB). These rules are based on EU law and should in general not differ between EU Member States.Additional statutory provisions aimed to protect consumer interests were recently promulgated and have already become applicable or will become effective shortly. These provisions include  in particular  specific rules for the sale of digital products and increased information obligations for online marketplaces.Capital market lawGenerally speaking  from the German capital market point of view  the WpPG and the VermAnlG have to be considered.The VermAnlG generally applies to profit participating loans and subordinated loans and all other investments that grant a claim to interest and repayment. If these investments are publicly offered  a prospectus or at least an information sheet concerning the investment must be published  unless certain exceptions apply. The VermAnlG does not apply to a public offer by a crowdfunding service provider authorised under the ECSPR provided that it does not exceed the above-mentioned ‚Ç¨5 million threshold. Further  under Section 2a of the VermAnlG  the obligation to publish a prospectus does not apply to investments that are only brokered via the internet and do not exceed low thresholds ranging from ‚Ç¨1 000 to ‚Ç¨10 000 per investment (however  even if this exception applies  an information sheet must be published).In the case of public offer of securities within the meaning of the WpPG  a prospectus must  subject to certain limited exceptions  also be published. However  as mentioned above  the obligation to publish a prospectus does not apply to an offer of securities to the public from a crowdfunding service provider authorised under the ECSPR  provided that it does not exceed the ‚Ç¨5 million threshold.The WpPG obligations have not yet gained material significance in the German fintech market  except for the very few fintech companies that have used securitisation to refinance. This might change in the future owing to the rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs).48ii Payment servicesThe payment services sector was one of the first in the German financial industry in which fintech companies became active and visible. This is one of the reasons for fragmentation of the payment services market  which has recently begun to consolidate. Significant changes from the fintech perspective came with the second Payment Services Directive (PSD II) 49 implemented into German law at the beginning of 2018. The revised payment services regime has offered new business opportunities  especially for nimble fintech companies. The reason behind this was that account information services and payment initiation services as new payment services were introduced under the revised ZAG. The providers of these services have been granted a legal claim for access to payment accounts against the banks that maintain these payment accounts for their customers. This has been perceived as a game changer insofar as traditional banks can no longer prevent their competitors from accessing the accounts of customers who consent to this access (open banking). However  experiences so far suggest that providing the required application programming interfaces is a time-consuming process. In addition  some market observers have criticised credit institutions for using the PSD II rules as an instrument to prevent competition by fintechs (e.g.  by no longer offering the previously established connections via the German independent online banking protocol (FinTS)).Further business opportunities have come with additional regulatory burdens. Providing payment services is generally subject to a licence requirement  unless certain exceptions apply. The scope of this licence requirement extends to providers of account information and payment initiation services even though these service providers do not acquire possession of their customers' funds at any time. On account of this consideration  the regulatory requirements for a licence to provide payment initiation or account information services are less strict than for a licence to provide traditional payment services.The revised ZAG aims to foster technological innovation and competition on the payment market.50 Under the relevant provisions (Section 58a of the ZAG) ‚Äì which have been labelled by some market observers as 'Lex Apple Pay' ‚Äì payment services providers and e-money issuers have been granted the right to obtain access to certain key technical infrastructure. 'System companies' contributing through technical infrastructure services to the provision of payment services or the conduct of e-money business in Germany are obliged  upon request of a payment services provider or e-money issuer  to make these technical infrastructure services available and provide necessary access against consideration and without undue delay. The obligation does not apply if the relevant technical infrastructure is used by no more than 10 payment services providers or e-money issuers or if the company has no more than 2 million registered users. The company may also deny access for objective reasons; for example  if the security and integrity of the technical infrastructure services would be jeopardised. The recent statutory rules are not based on EU law and are considered to be a reaction to some system providers refusing to open their systems to facilitate more competition in the area of mobile payments.Cryptocurrencies  initial coin offerings (ICO) and security tokensi CryptocurrenciesCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have undoubtedly created a challenge for the German law from regulatory  civil law and tax perspectives. Certain clarity has been achieved by the legal definition of crypto values (such as Bitcoin) in connection with the implementation of the Fifth EU AML Directive into German law in 2020. Crypto values are now included in the catalogue of financial instruments under the KWG and the WpIG so that various activities relating to crypto values are clearly within the scope of certain licence requirements. Further  the crypto custody business has been introduced as a new type of financial service  which is subject to a licence requirement under the KWG.Crypto values are defined as digital representations of a value that is not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or public authority and does not possess a statutory status of currency or money  but that is accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of exchange or payment  or that serves investment purposes and that can be transferred  stored and traded electronically. This broad definition is aimed at comprising all uses of virtual currencies  including as a means of investment. So far  the definition of crypto values includes not only tokens with exchange and payment functions (including cryptocurrencies)  which may fall under the scope of financial instruments as the 'units of account' within the meaning of Section 1(11)  sentence 1  No. 7 of the KWG and Section 2(5)  No. 7 of the WpIG  but also tokens used for investment. These security or investment tokens may also qualify as investment products  debt instruments or units in collective investment schemes under Section 1(11)  sentence 1  Nos. 2  3 or 5 of the KWG and Section 2(5)  Nos. 2  3 or 5 of the WpIG.51Not covered by the definition of crypto values are domestic and foreign legal tender  electronic money  monetary value stored on payment instruments falling under the limited network exemption within the meaning of PSD II and payment transactions of providers of electronic communications networks or services.52 Also not covered are electronic vouchers for the purchase of goods or services from the issuer or a third party that are intended to have an economic function in relation to the issuer only through redemption and that are therefore not tradable and  as a result of their design  do not reflect investor-like expectations regarding the performance of the voucher or the general business performance of the issuer or a third party in terms of value or accounting.53The amendments with respect to crypto values reflect  to a certain extent  the previous administrative practice of BaFin that took the first steps towards the regulation of cryptocurrencies in Germany by adopting a broad interpretation of the term 'financial instrument' within the meaning of the KWG. This approach was partially criticised and not shared in a ruling of a higher regional court in criminal proceedings.54The recent changes of the KWG  which subsequently have been reflected in the WpIG  have resolved the controversy on the qualification of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments and have  in doing so  contributed to more legal clarity. However  the German legislator only changed the definition of 'financial instrument' for the purpose of the licensing requirement but not with regard to the conduct rules set out in the WpHG  which effectively reflect the MiFID II provisions. Therefore  a service provider operating a marketplace for cryptocurrencies may fall within the licence requirement for an operator of multilateral trading facilities within the meaning of the KWG and WpIG but may not be obliged to adhere to the rules of conduct set out for these operators in the WpHG.Against this background  one should thoroughly analyse the legal risks related to relevant business models and assess whether and which licence requirements and conduct rules may apply. In particular  buying and purchasing cryptocurrencies in the service provider's own name for the account of others may constitute banking business in the form of principal brokering business.55 Further  brokering cryptocurrencies may constitute for licensing purposes investment brokerage 56 whereas advising on the purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies may be considered investment advice.57 Also  the operation of a platform on which cryptocurrencies can be traded may qualify as a multilateral trading platform within the meaning of Section 2(2)  No. 6 of the WpIG and may  therefore  be subject to a licence requirement.58 The activity involving custody  management and safeguarding of crypto values or private cryptographic keys may also fall within the scope of the recently regulated crypto custody business. This new type of financial service and the related licence requirement may be relevant for domestic companies as well as cross-border service providers and their agents that intend to offer  or have already been offering  these services.59However  neither the mining nor the purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies in one's own name and for one's own account is subject to a licence requirement. Therefore  cryptocurrencies may generally be used as means of payment and generated by mining without any special permission.From a civil law perspective  many questions have not yet definitively been answered. The uncertainty starts with the applicable jurisdiction and laws generally for a cryptocurrency. These questions become relevant if  for instance  cryptocurrency units are transferred or pledged. Further  it is still unclear which disclosure and information obligations apply in cryptocurrency transactions.Interestingly  the usually complex tax analysis has at least partly been clarified for cryptocurrencies through a decision by the European Court of Justice.60According to the principles of this decision that were incorporated into German tax law 61 exchanging regular currencies into Bitcoin (or comparable cryptocurrencies) and vice versa shall be tax-free with respect to value added tax according to Section 4  No. 8b of the Turnover Tax Code. In addition  using Bitcoin or comparable cryptocurrencies as payment and the process of mining are tax-free.Other transactions concerning cryptocurrencies may  however  be affected by tax law.From an accounting perspective  cryptocurrency units such as Bitcoin are transferable so that it appears necessary to account for them as assets on the balance sheet.If they qualify as assets that support the business for only a short period (current assets)  they may have to be recorded as 'other assets' according to Section 266(2)  B II  No. 4 of the Commercial Code (HGB).62 If the cryptocurrency units qualify as assets that support the business for a long period (fixed assets) they should be accounted for as acquired immaterial assets according to Section 266(2)  A I  No. 2 of the HGB.63ii Initial coin offeringsICOs are sales of virtual tokens to raise funds for general corporate purposes or a specific project typically described in more detail in a white paper. Depending on the structure of the ICO  tokens may be bought with regular or virtual currencies and may grant specific rights  such as participation rights and profit shares  or no right at all. While the discussions and structures of ICOs and tokens are still in flux  tokens that can be offered in an ICO may be categorised as follows:cryptocurrency tokens are meant to pay for goods or services external to the platform or not only exclusively between the platform and its users but also between users; utility tokens are supposed to convey some functional utility to token holders other than or in addition to payment for goods or services  in the form of access to a product or service. These tokens come with particular rights  such as a right of access to a future service  a right to redeem the token for another token or service or voting rights  which are often designed to shape the functionality of the product; and security tokens are comparable to traditional securities set out in Article 4(1)(44) of MiFID II  such as conventional debt or equity instruments.64This rough categorisation ‚Äì which corresponds to the general approach pursued by BaFin ‚Äì illustrates that tokens may differ significantly. Following the amendments to the KWG  as from 1 January 2020  tokens with exchange and payment functions and tokens used for investment (for example  security tokens and investment tokens) are likely to fall within the broad definition of cryptographic values and thus constitute financial instruments under the KWG (aside from possible classification of these tokens as other types of financial instruments  which is to be assessed on a case-by-case basis) and the WpIG.65Consequently  each ICO must be thoroughly analysed with respect to its regulatory and capital market requirements. BaFin determines the applicability of the relevant legislation  including the KWG  the WpIG  the ZAG  the WpPG  the KAGB and the VermAnlG  case by case  depending on the specific contractual arrangements. Where tokens resemble participation rights that might be classified as securities under the WpPG or capital investments under the VermAnlG  a prospectus for the marketing of the tokens may be required unless an exemption  especially for crowdfunding services under the ECSPR  applies.The issue of fully digitalised offerings of securities has been the subject matter of extensive discussions in recent years and was supported through a joint paper published by the German Federal Ministry of Finance and the German Federal Ministry of Justice concerning the future regulatory framework for blockchain-based securities and crypto-tokens.66 In light of the objectives pursued by this paper  the German legislator adopted a new law (the Act on Electronic Securities (eWpG)  in force as from June 2021)  which introduced optional and partial dematerialisation of securities. The eWpG introduces the notion of an 'electronic security' defined as a property object that is subject of a right in rem. The new law gives the issuers the choice between two types of dematerialised securities. The first type is subject to registration with a central securities depository within the meaning of the Central Securities Depository Regulation67 (Clearstream Banking AG in Germany) or with a licensed custodian. The second type are crypto securities  registered in a crypto securities registry  typically based on DLT  kept by the issuers themselves or by other entities. In this regard  keeping crypto securities registries requires a licence from BaFin and is subject to the regulatory supervision. With this step  the German legislator is following the path of other European countries towards securities dematerialisation.68In addition to a prospectus requirement  any professional service provided in connection with the trading of tokens ‚Äì including an agreement to acquire  or the sale or purchase of tokens  when qualified as units of account or crypto values ‚Äì would  as a general rule  require a licence from BaFin.69 Further  issuers of tokens should be aware that consumer protection laws might apply to the sale of tokens via the internet. So  the underlying contract may qualify as a distance contract resulting in information obligations according to Section 312(i) of the BGB. Provided that the contract is considered as a financial service  further information must be provided according to Section 312(d) of the BGB.70At the EU level  the issue of cryptoassets and  thus  also ICOs  has been recently addressed by the European Commission as part of the EU Digital Finance Package published in September 2020.71 The Commission submitted a proposal for an EU-wide directly applicable regulation on markets in cryptoassets (MiCA). The proposal generally applies a comprehensive full harmonisation approach  including a unified regime on: transparency and disclosure requirements for the issuance and admission to trading  operation  organisation and governance of issuers and in-scope service providers; consumer protection rules; preventing market abuse and ensuring integrity of cryptoassets markets. The proposal differentiates between the categories of cryptoassets  including cryptoassets (as such)  asset-referenced tokens (often referred to as 'stablecoins')  electronic money tokens and utility tokens. Generally  all cryptoassets (defined as digital representation of value or rights that may be transferred and stored electronically  using DLT or similar technology) shall be in the scope of MiCA if not already covered by the existing EU financial services regime (e.g.  as financial instruments under MiFID II). Regulated cryptoasset services shall include custody and administration on behalf of third parties  operation of a trading platform  exchange of cryptoassets for fiat currency that is legal tender and for other cryptoassets  execution of orders on behalf of third parties  placing  reception and transmission of orders on behalf of third parties and providing advice. Certain relief  including exemption from the rather detailed white paper requirement  shall apply to small and medium issuers where the total consideration of an offer to the public does not exceed ‚Ç¨1 million over 12 months. Stringent requirements shall generally apply to stablecoins.MiCA is expected to provide legal clarity and certainty  promote safe development of cryptoassets and the use of DLT in financial services  support competition and innovation while protecting consumers and investors and address potential financial stability and monetary risks. In addition  the proposal is expected to increase the funding of companies through ICOs and securities token offerings.EU-wide regulation of cryptoassets  which are the major application of DLT and blockchain technology in finance  goes hand in hand with the proposed EU-level pilot blockchain sandbox regime. As part of the EU Digital Finance Package  the European Commission proposed EU regulation for market infrastructures based on DLT. The proposed regulation  if adopted  will provide rules for a pan-European blockchain regulatory sandbox aimed at allowing fintech companies active in the field of DLT and blockchain technology to benefit from temporary derogation of regulatory requirements under regulatory supervision ensuring the keeping of appropriate safeguards and it will enable the regulators to deepen their understanding of the innovative fintech models and emerging technologies.iii Money laundering rulesTokens and cryptocurrencies in general are perceived as highly susceptible to money laundering and terrorism financing. In this respect  a certain clarity with regard to the applicability of the AML regime has been provided by the law implementing the Fifth EU AML Directive in Germany  in force since 1 January 2020. As outlined above  the law introduced a broad definition of crypto values and classified them as financial instruments under the KWG and the WpIG. In principle  the scope of the definition generally includes tokens with exchange and payment functions (e.g.  cryptocurrencies) and tokens used for investment (e.g.  security tokens and investment tokens).72 This generally means that services concerning cryptocurrencies and tokens ‚Äì for instance  buying and purchasing cryptocurrencies in the service provider's own name for the account of others  advising on the purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies or operation of a platform on which cryptocurrencies can be traded ‚Äì may fall under the scope of regulated services and require a KWG licence for  in particular  principal brokering business 73 investment brokerage 74 investment advice75 or operation of a multilateral trading platform.76 In addition  the management and safeguarding of crypto values or private cryptographic keys may require obtaining a KWG licence if other general statutory prerequisites under the KWG (in essence  commercial character or a scale that requires a commercially organised business undertaking) are fulfilled. Services providers whose activities fall within the scope of KWG or WpIG licence requirements are obliged entities within the meaning of the GwG and must  therefore  adhere to the duties set out therein. These include the obligation to conduct adequate customer due diligence  to implement adequate risk management systems aimed at preventing money laundering and terrorism financing and  as appropriate  notifying the Financial Intelligence Unit of any suspect transactions as well as fulfilling respective reporting obligations in relation to the transparency register. Nonetheless  even prior to the implementation of the Fifth EU AML Directive into German law  cryptocurrency and ICO service providers were often required to obtain a KWG licence and  as a result  comply with the German AML requirements. This was owing to the broad interpretation of the term 'financial instrument' within the meaning of the KWG according to BaFin's previous administrative practice.77Even aside from the significant developments concerning the licensing regime under which certain new entities involved in the fintech business may require a licence from BaFin and  thus  become ‚Äì as obliged entities ‚Äì subject to the AML requirements  the AML regime is also constantly evolving. Pursuant to its action plan for a comprehensive EU policy on preventing money laundering and terrorist financing of May 2020 78 in July 2021 the European Commission published an AML/countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) package 79 which includes proposals for three EU-wide regulations and a directive. In addition to establishing an EU AML/CFT authority with direct supervisory powers over some of the riskiest cross-border financial sector obliged entities  the package aims to ensure that various types of cryptoasset and crowdfunding service providers  as well as mortgage credit intermediaries and consumer credit providers  become obliged entities subject to the AML/CFT regime. The package further provides for a recast of Regulation (EU) 2015/847 on information accompanying transfers of funds (i.e.  the Wire Transfer Regulation (WTR))  which shall also apply to the transfer of cryptoassets. As far as the latter is concerned  the German Federal Ministry of Finance issued the interim German Crypto Asset Transfer Regulation (CATR) to ensure the traceability of cryptoasset transfers until the WTR revisions come into force. The CATR provides for duties of care applicable to institutions and branches seated in Germany that are engaged in conducting cryptoasset transfers. It entered into force in October 2021 and shall apply until the WTR recast is finalised.Other new business modelsGenerally speaking  one can observe various trends in the fintech sector  including accommodating the needs caused by the covid-19 pandemic as well as enhanced efforts to find specific uses for blockchain technology and for AI.These efforts can be illustrated by the cooperation of Deutsche Bundesbank  Deutsche B√∂rse and Germany's Finance Agency that developed and  in 2021  successfully tested a DLT-based securities settlement in central bank money with the use of a 'trigger' solution and a transaction coordinator in TARGET2  the Eurosystem's large-value payment system.80 Participants in the capital markets in general appear to seek increasingly successful business models exploiting the potential of fintech. The first placings of promissory notes and commercial papers (even though these papers have not been governed by German law) have been made in Germany by taking advantage of the blockchain technology and of highly digitalised platforms. Further developments are to be expected in connection with the recent introduction of securities dematerialisation under the eWpG in 2021.A relatively new and successful phenomenon on the German fintech market is the development of 'neo-brokerage apps' operating mostly on a commission-free (or almost commission-free) basis. The neo-brokerage firms offer trading in a variety of products  from very selective to a wide range  including stocks  foreign exchange  commodities  exchange traded funds and digital assets. The neo-brokers have recently become very popular because of the nil cost (or very low flat fee) for users and also as a result of the growing interest in investments and capital markets among retail investors trying to find new investment opportunities beyond bank deposits bearing no or even negative interest. Neo-brokers operate either on the basis of their own BaFin licence for the provision of financial services or they use the services of a fronting BaFin-licensed institution that ensures compliance with the regulatory requirements. Whether  however  the business model of neo-brokers will continue to thrive depends to a material extent on future regulation. Certainly  neo-brokers strive for profits. Some neo-brokers derive their income from third parties such as trading venues. The European Commission has clearly expressed its concern that this practice of 'payment for order flow' jeopardises the interests of investors and has tabled a proposal to prohibit this practice. If this proposal were to become applicable law  various neo-brokers would have to adapt their business model.A current DLT and blockchain-related trend known as DeFi is a recent phenomenon in the fintech business that could potentially become a part of digital disruption. As a digital environment of a wide range of financial applications built on blockchain  including borrowing  lending  exchange and issuance of tokens and asset-backed cryptoassets (stablecoins)  DeFi has raised significant interest and a financial boost since mid-2020  including development of software solutions for the tokenisation of securities as well as blockchain custody services.A sub-trend in the fintech world that has recently started to develop is 'wealthtech'  focused on wealth and property management as well as general personal financial management with the use of fintech tools. Further  the fintech risk and compliance segment offers solutions supporting regulatory  AML compliance and the compliance function in general  sometimes also called 'digital compliance'. This is also a segment in which AI is expected to be increasingly deployed. In this regard  however  it still seems too early to discuss fully established business models on the German market. In general  the operation of business models involving the use of AI is subject to the regulatory requirements applicable to business models in line with the technology-neutral approach of 'same business  same risk  same regulation'. This means that for each relevant fintech business model  careful analysis should judge whether it falls within the scope of one or several regulated services and which regulatory requirements apply. In essence  the licensed institutions using programs and algorithms involving AI must ensure that they maintain a proper business organisation 81 in particular  adequate and effective risk management  and that the use of these programs and algorithms is in line with the general regulatory requirements. This includes processes for determining and safeguarding the sustainability of services  internal control procedures and internal control systems  adequate contingency plans  especially for IT systems and complete documentation of business operations permitting seamless monitoring by BaFin as well as compliance with outsourcing requirements. The exact arrangement of the business organisation should be appropriate for the nature  scope  complexity and risk content of the institution's business activities. In this regard  the minimum requirements for risk management in BaFin's Circular No. 09/201782 and with the supervisory requirements for IT in BaFin's Circular No. 10/201783 have to be met. Further developments as regards the AI segment may be expected in connection with the European Commission's proposal for a regulation laying down harmonised rules on AI  published in April 2021.84With respect to the use of algorithms  BaFin has confirmed its approach in that it does not grant general a priori approvals for the use of algorithms in decision-making processes and that its administrative practice is technology-neutral.85 The legal reasoning behind this approach is generally twofold: the nature of the risk-oriented and ad hoc financial supervision on the one hand and the lack of a statutory basis for general a priori algorithm approvals on the other.86 As to the former  the supervisory requirements do not primarily concern the algorithm itself; instead  the focus of supervision is on the entire decision-making process in which the relevant algorithm is embedded; therefore  compliance with general requirements on proper business organisation and risk management plays a key role.87 With respect to the lack of a statutory legal basis for algorithm approval  two exceptions should be noted in which the regulation of the use of algorithms may be derived from the law itself (e.g.  determination of capital and solvency requirements). However  even in these cases  the supervisory authorities will not grant an a priori approval. Instead  they conduct a risk-oriented assessment of the relevant decision-making and other procedures taking into account the available data and its quality.88The approach of technological neutrality also applies generally to the regulation of KWG and WpIG licence requirements. In this respect  one might consider high-frequency trading (a special form of proprietary trading)89 as an exception. Per definition  high frequency trading includes the use of algorithms for the sale and purchase of financial instruments.90 While German supervisory rules generally do not provide for specific notification obligations in the case of the use of particular software or algorithms  high-frequency trades have to adhere to specific notification requirements.91Worth mentioning in the context of recent and successful fintech-related business models is the increasing digitalisation in the insurance sector. New service providers have evolved that primarily broker insurance via smartphones quickly and simply. Certainly  these brokers must also comply with the general information duties relating to the brokerage of insurance contracts.Also successful  but not strictly new  are product comparison websites  which have become very popular with price-conscious consumers. The influence of these offerings on the market is governed by the general competition rules. These include that price comparison tests must be performed in a competent manner  seek to be objectively accurate and be neutral.92 Also  the incorporation of 'fintech banks' is noteworthy in connection with new business models. These fintech banks hold a comprehensive licence to conduct banking business but still perceive themselves to be fintech companies. Their business model is based on digitalisation  and they partly offer white-label solutions  namely they may seek to cooperate with other fintech companies that need licensed banks for their business model. This illustrates that some fintech banks position themselves as 'platform banks'  where cooperation partners may find specific service offerings that they can use to complement their own products or services.Intellectual property and data protectioni Intellectual propertyA business model  as such  cannot be protected by copyright law. Therefore  it is not uncommon for successful fintech business models to be copied and optimised. Computer programs  however  that are characterised by a minimum of individuality and originality are subject to copyright protection according to Section 2 of the Act on Copyright and Neighbouring Rights (UrhG).93Under German law  copyright can be neither registered nor transferred  as the copyright itself emerges the moment the piece of work  such as the software  is created by its actual originator.94 The capacity of being the originator is strictly connected to a natural person and may therefore not be transferred.95 Obviously  the lack of registration leads to various practical problems that often result in lawsuits. Nonetheless  a licence may be granted enabling the holder to make use of the piece of work in every matter or in particular matters (Section 31 of the UrhG). Employees and their employers implicitly agree on a full licence by drafting the employment contract.96 Therefore  the employer is allowed to make use of the piece of work. Concerning computer programs  another rule applies (Section 69b of the UrhG)  which grants the employer even more rights. Unless agreed otherwise  the employee is owed no compensation.97ii Data protectionGenerally speaking  data protection is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  which replaced  to a material extent  the previous version of the Federal Act on Data Protection on 25 May 2018 without  however  changing the fundamental principles of German data protection law. The GDPR intends to prevent the collection and use of data related to individuals unless it is duly necessary to do so (Article 1 of the GDPR). Data are considered to be related to individuals if the responsible body has the legal means that enable it to identify the data subject.98Collection and processing of data related to individuals is only permitted if it is explicitly allowed by law or if the data subject consents (Article 6(1) of the GDPR). Additionally  the user must be informed about the nature  extent and purpose of data collection.Digital profiling has to comply with the general principles stated above. The GDPR does not regulate digital profiling  as such  but focuses on some of its typical forms: first  the automated individual decision-making  including profiling  must comply with Article 22 of the GDPR; and second  a decision that produces legal effects on the data subject or has a similarly significant influence on the data subject must not be based solely on automated processing (Article 22(1) of the GDPR). However  Article 22(1) of the GDPR shall not apply if the decision: (1) is necessary for entering into  or the performance of  a contract between the data subject and the data controller; (2) is authorised by law to which the controller is subject and that also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or (3) is based on the data subject's explicit consent (Article 22(2) of the GDPR).Year in reviewConsidering the developments in the fintech sector over recent months and years  the following trends appear worth emphasising.Overall  it seems that the fintech market in Germany has continued to demonstrate growing maturity and has reached a consolidation phase. This  and the fact that fintech companies in Germany have been able to implement commercially viable business models  is illustrated by recent financings  which resulted in market evaluations of some German fintech companies exceeding ‚Ç¨1 billion. However  scaling their operations is still difficult for many local fintechs  which may also be a result of the increasing efforts of incumbent institutions to take advantage of the lessons learned from fintechs in terms of innovation and customer experience. Traditional players in the financial sector use these insights not only by establishing cooperation and partnerships with fintech companies and including fintechs in their value chains  but also by developing their own digital offerings.Certain challenges for the regulatory sector in Germany have been identified in the aftermath of the Wirecard insolvency considered to be the result of an extensive fraud. In consequence  the German legislator adopted the Act on Strengthening the Financial Market Integrity  some of which came into effect in July 2021 and some in January 2022  which provides for a significant increase on the liability caps of auditors  mandatory rotation rules and auditors' rights and regulators' supervisory powers with regard to outsourcing service providers. Also  BaFin has been allowed to apply 'mystery shopping' in relation to licensed entities by engaging trained fieldwork customers to support the identification of infringements. This legislative activity and the recent administrative practice suggest that BaFin will adhere to its principle 'same business  same risk  same regulation' approach and pursue it even more diligently.The importance of digital technologies for financial markets and the need for legal clarity has been visibly recognised by the legislators and supervisors. At the EU level  this is particularly reflected by several proposals of legislative packages on matters such as cryptoassets  cryptocurrencies  stablecoins and ICOs  providing for a unified regulatory and licensing regime in the EU. Also  the European Commission has proposed to introduce an EU-level sandbox model to facilitate the development of DLT and blockchain-based technologies and increasing the regulators' understanding of these technologies.In Germany  the recent implementation of the Fifth EU AML Directive providing for a broad legal definition of crypto values not only resulted in enhanced AML obligations for service providers engaging in the cryptocurrency business  but also introduced a licence requirement for the crypto custody business. Also  the recently introduced eWpG outlined the legal framework for partial dematerialisation of securities with the use of DLT and blockchain technologies in Germany.Outlook and conclusionsGiven the numerous initiatives at an international  EU and national level dealing with the regulatory challenges of fintech  both those recently adopted and those still in the legislative procedure  it seems that the legal framework for the operation of fintech business models is becoming significantly more harmonised and expressly regulated. This  however  does not necessarily need to be detrimental to fintechs and their offerings. The new regulatory and licensing regime is likely to bring more clarity for the market participants as well as further increase the transparency for  and protection of  customers.A clear and harmonised licensing regime in all EU Member States  addressing certain fintech-related services such as in the field of the cryptoasset market  once adopted  would facilitate the use of the EU passport. Fintech and DLT and blockchain technology will most likely benefit from the adoption of the proposed EU sandbox model. However  because various key legislative proposals have been adopted  but are not yet applicable  and because some of these are still undergoing the legislative procedure  it remains to be seen how the harmonised regime will influence the fintech market in practice and how the regulators will deal with the application of an increasingly detailed regulatory framework to the constantly evolving fintech environment. It is not yet certain whether fintechs will continue with their ability to find innovative solutions or whether the regulatory restrictions will turn out to be an inhibiting factor for their future success.Aside from further DLT and blockchain development and the possible related challenges (including compliance with GDPR requirements and the 'right to be forgotten' fenced with a harsh sanctions regime)  new developments can be expected in the areas of big data and AI.Finally  it remains to be seen whether  and how permanently  the current pandemic will impact the fintech market.,neutral,0.04,0.94,0.01,negative,0.04,0.21,0.74,True,English,"['digital markets', 'payment services', 'review', 'funding', 'Germany', 'German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority', 'special public funding instrument', 'application programming interface banking', 'Other significant fintech segments', 'same business, same risk', 'Agile service providers', 'nil execution costs', 'high acquisition costs', 'past three years', 'other European countries', 'distributed ledger technologies', 'new business opportunities', 'Digital Finance Package', 'German federal legislator', 'blockchain-based business models', 'innovative business models', 'financial licensing purposes', 'blockchain-based dematerialised securities', 'German Banking Act', 'crypto custody business', 'German securities law', 'personal finance management', 'innovative digital solutions', 'online brokerage services', 'overall start-up activity', 'present legal framework', 'EU-level sandbox model', '72 per cent) segments', '639 active fintech companies', '9 new fintech companies', 'recent statutory rules', 'German fintech market', 'young fintech companies', 'significant funding', 'same regulation', ""sandbox' model"", 'supervisory concerns', 'supervisory issues', 'business angels', 'German government', 'German Ministry', 'decentralised finance', 'German legislator', 'financial sector', 'financial institutions', 'asset management', 'EU-wide framework', 'European Commission', 'statutory provisions', 'crypto values', 'financial instruments', 'electronic securities', 'securities dematerialisation', 'legal certainty', 'start-up culture', 'fintech sector', '55 per cent', '96 per cent', '1 per cent', 'financing activity', 'questions Overview', 'remarkable resilience', 'covid-19 pandemic', 'cashless payments', 'general tendency', 'increased competition', 'value chains', 'highest proportion', 'young start-ups', 'capital access', 'total number', 'early-stage financings', 'regulatory authorities', 'sufficient leeway', 'sufficient level', 'licence requirement', 'key points', 'blockchain strategy', 'several statements', 'big data', 'artificial intelligence', 'technology-neutral principle', 'traditional players', 'innovation space', 'tight regulation', 'United Kingdom', 'venture capital', 'financing transactions', 'market participants', 'Fintech-related topics', 'subject matter', 'information security', 'challenges', 'reliable', 'beneficiaries', 'crisis', 'neo', 'brokering', 'low', 'Germany', 'influence', 'nature', 'winner', 'phenomenon', 'fintechs', 'indication', 'banks', 'developments', 'opposite', 'study', 'five', 'compliance', 'DeFi', 'rise', 'average', 'quarter', 'fields', 'investment', 'credit', 'factoring', 'addition', 'politicians', 'protection', 'discussions', 'result', 'cryptoassets', 'KWG', 'introduction', 'step', 'path', 'BaFin', 'explanations', 'opinions13', 'DLTs', 'digitalisation', 'need', 'Switzerland', 'balance', 'efforts', 'regard', 'website', 'Economics', 'programme', 'shares']",2022-04-22,2022-04-22,lexology.com

Flow Traders is currently a market maker in more than 200 ETPs on HKEXExpansion of Flow Traders‚Äô global ETP trading footprint by becoming an official market maker on ASX and CBOE Australia in 55 tickersCorporate Venture Capital UnitDuring 2021  Flow Traders designed and implemented a strategic ecosystem approach to accelerate the execution of its strategy and as well as capturing more of the overall value chain. This is a natural evolution given Flow Traders‚Äô core capabilities as well as position within the financial markets ecosystem. The emphasis is on three key themes of platforms  data  and connectivity across the three strategic focus areas of equities  fixed income and digital assetsRecent strategic activities made in line with these key themes include ErisX  MEMX  Shape Q  LedgerEdge  D2X  Pyth and BloXrouteSignificant work has been undertaken during the first quarter to formalize this strategic ecosystem approach into a dedicated corporate venture capital unit as the pace of investments continues to accelerate. The set-up of this unit is expected to be finalized by the end of the second quarterOutlookTo maintain Flow Traders‚Äô status as an employer of choice and to remain competitive in the global employment market  it has been necessary to shift the total compensation mix of certain employee groups towards a greater fixed component. Accordingly  targeted base compensation increases have been implemented. These actions will ensure Flow Traders continues to attract the talent necessary to execute its strategic growth agendaThe first quarter did see certain one-off strategy related costs being incurred  which are expected to deliver meaningful benefits going forward. In addition  COVID business continuity plan-related expenses were reclassified into operational expenses from the start of 2022. Nonetheless  Flow Traders continues to be focused on cost discipline particularly with reference to the maximum growth in fixed operating expenses of c. 15% for this yearManagement Board CommentsDennis Dijkstra  CEO  stated:‚ÄúThe successes in Q1 once again confirmed the numerous strengths of our business. This includes our pricing and hedging excellence  a robust risk management framework and a truly global trading footprint. A stronger operational focus has been required so far in 2022 but this has not been to the detriment of progressing and driving forward our strategic growth agenda across our three key growth areas of equities  fixed income and digital assets. We continue to quote more products as well as support new introductions as the trading footprint continues to grow. Once again  we confirmed our ability to deploy into new markets by becoming an official market maker in Australia on the ASX and CBOE.‚ÄúLastly  while this has been a successful quarter for Flow Traders  we are mindful that this has been an extremely challenging and distressing time for those affected by the conflict in Ukraine. Accordingly  we have made an initial donation of ‚Ç¨500 000 to the Red Cross  UNHCR and several local initiatives nominated by colleagues and partners. We are also proud of the individual efforts from colleagues who directly raised more than ‚Ç¨40 000 through various activities and conducted a successful donation drive in the Amsterdam office. This continues our longstanding tradition of charitable giving.‚ÄùFolkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:‚ÄúWe saw a strong trading performance across the board with all desks and regions responding to a more active and volatile market environment. In particular  ETP flows and volumes were focused in the European time zone during the quarter. We continued to expand and deepen our ETP trading footprint during the quarter as evidenced by our new market making activities in Australia and expanded Lead Market Maker activities in the US. Encouragingly  our market share in corporate credit single bond market making continues to increase both in Europe and in the US as the buyside engages further with our proposition. From a trading and operational standpoint  we were successfully able to navigate the various market issues that arose upon the start of the Ukraine conflict.‚ÄùMike Kuehnel  Chief Financial Officer  added:‚ÄúWe have made substantial progress in the review of our strategic roadmap with tangible ideas now ready for the team to action. We look forward to sharing these outputs at a capital markets day to be held in June. In parallel  we completed an investment in BloXroute as we further intensify our strategic ecosystem approach to drive change and innovation in global financial markets. Our increased pace of strategic investments has created a desire to formalise these activities within a dedicated corporate venture capital unit that will help us to accelerate our ecosystem strategy even further. From a cost perspective  we have commenced the process of systematically adjusting the base compensation for certain targeted employee groups. There were also one-off expenses incurred this quarter relating to the recent corporate strategy and group legal structure review. Notwithstanding these cost dynamics  the operational leverage within the business was still very much evident with significantly improved margins quarter on quarter  indicating that our operational leverage and underlying cost efficiency remain key priorities.‚ÄùPreliminary Financial Calendar29 April 2022 AGM3 May 2022 FY21 final dividend proposed ex-dividend date4 May 2002 FY21 final dividend proposed record date6 May 2022 FY21 final dividend proposed payment dateTBD June 2022 Capital markets day30 June 2022 Start silent period ahead of H122 results22 July 2022 Release H122 results (inc. analyst conference call)16 August 2022 Proposed FY22 interim dividend ex-dividend date17 August 2022 Proposed FY22 interim dividend record date19 August 2022 Proposed FY22 interim dividend payment date30 September 2022 Start silent period ahead of Q322 trading update27 October 2022 Release Q322 trading update (no analyst conference call)Contact DetailsFlow Traders N.V.InvestorsJonathan BergerPhone: +31 20 7996799Email: investor.relations@flowtraders.comMediaLaura PeijsPhone: +31 20 7996799Email: press@flowtraders.comAbout Flow TradersFlow Traders is a leading global financial technology-enabled liquidity provider in financial products  historically specialized in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs)  now expanding into other asset classes.

Every year  more than 10 000 people are diagnosed in Europe and in the United States of America1  and the prognosis for the patients with the most advanced form is poor with a mortality rate of up to 80%2 in the first year. This new milestone for MaaT Pharma  the first Euronext-listed company developing microbiome-based therapies  builds on the success story of its founding partnership with INRAE initiated in 2014  in particular via the scientific support agreement3 between MaaT Pharma  INRAE and Dr. Jo√´l Dor√©  INRAE Research Director  Scientific Director of M√©tag√©nopolis  author of nearly 500 publications  and one of the world's most cited authors in the microbiome sphere today.At the end of 2014  following a project development period as an entrepreneur-in-residence with Seventure Partners  Herv√© Affagard  currently CEO  founded MaaT Pharma alongside Dr. Jo√´l Dor√©  now MaaT Pharma's Scientific Advisor. As early as 2015  MaaT Pharma and INRAE co-filed three patents  for which the Company now holds exclusive exploitation rights. These patents are also at the root of the development of the Company‚Äôs native products  MaaT013 and MaaT033  both currently in clinical trials.""Microbiome science has been at the heart of my research for more than 30 years. INRAE has established itself first as a pioneer  then as an international center of excellence in the field. In 2021  for example  INRAE was the 5th largest academic player in the world in terms of microbiome-related patents. In my opinion  the rapid growth of MaaT Pharma  which has entered a Phase 3 clinical trial  perfectly illustrates the efficient and successful transition from pioneering science to innovative therapeutic development for the benefit of patients. Through my research  I hope to contribute to the fast emergence of a new medicinal modality  that takes into account the symbiotic relationship between human health and the microbiome "" said Dr. Dor√©.Following the advent of metagenomics4  the research produced at INRAE on the gut microbiome has led to unprecedented results disrupting our understanding of the digestive ecosystem  and opening novel avenues for improving the health of millions of patients worldwide suffering from cancers  metabolic diseases  or inflammatory diseases to name just a few of the potential indications.MaaT Pharma has developed a portfolio of three products since its creation including two currently in clinical phases. The Company has initiated five Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials  consolidated its patent portfolio (including 13 international patent families)  and raised a total of ‚Ç¨83 million.

Post-pandemic  guests also expect more from hotels with 61% saying they want to travel more sustainably  73% are more likely to choose accommodation with sustainable policies  and 68% want to see how their money is redistributed among the local community (Booking.com  2021).
