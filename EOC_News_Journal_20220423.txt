The resolution shall otherwise be governed by the following terms and conditions.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  be vested in the company's wholly owned subsidiary True Software Scandinavia Incentive AB  reg. no. 559011-2073 (the ""Subsidiary"")  with the right and obligation for the Subsidiary to transfer the warrants to employees pursuant to the below. Over-subscription is not possible.The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights are to stimulate shareholding in the company by virtue of an incentive program through which senior executives and other key employees can take part of and contribute to a positive value increase of the company's share during the period of the proposed program  and that the company shall be able to retain and recruit competent and dedicated staff.The warrants shall be issued at no consideration. Subscription must be completed no later than three weeks after the resolution on issue of warrants. The board of directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period.Each warrant entitles a right to subscribe for one ordinary share of series B in the company. 1/2 of the warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new shares during the period 24 May 2025 – 24 August 2025 and 1/2 of the warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new shares during the period 24 May 2026 – 24 August 2026. The new ordinary shares of series B which may be issued due to exercise of warrants are not subject to any restrictive provisions.The subscription price (strike price) shall be established by the company  or by an independent appraiser or auditor firm retained by the company  and correspond to 150 percent of the volume weighted average price of the ordinary share of series B according to the official share list of Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days immediately preceding the annual general meeting 2022  however not less than the quota value of the shares. The amount of the subscription price exceeding the quota value of the shares shall be contributed to the free share premium reserve.Shares which are newly issued following subscription by virtue of the warrants shall carry an entitlement to participate in dividends for the first time on the next record date for dividends which occurs after subscription for shares by virtue of the utilization of the warrants is effected.The company may  by means of a board resolution and with the consent from the board of directors in the Subsidiary  cancel the Subsidiary's warrants that are not transferred in accordance with the below or that have been re-purchased from participants. Cancellation shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  is authorized to make such minor adjustments to the resolution which may prove necessary in order to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Approval of transfer of warrants (Item 16 (B))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting approves the Subsidiary's transfer of warrants on the following conditions.The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall vest in senior executives and other key employees in the Truecaller group who do not participate in existing incentive programs in the Truecaller group. Employees who are also board members in Truecaller AB do not have the right to acquire any warrants. The allotment per participant will depend on position within the Truecaller group and may not exceed 50 000 warrants per participant. In total  not more than 5 senior executives and other key employees in the Truecaller group may be allotted warrants of series 2022:1.1/2 of each participant's warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new shares during the period 24 May 2025 – 24 August 2025 and 1/2 of each participant's warrants may be exercised to subscribe for new shares during the period 24 May 2026 – 24 August 2026.As the warrants are acquired by the participants at market value and require a positive development of the share price of the company there are no performance criteria for the exercise of the warrants.A prerequisite for being entitled to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary is (i) that the participant at the time of the acquisition is an employee of the group  (ii) that acquisition of warrants can take place in accordance with applicable laws  and  according to the Board of Directors' assessment  can be executed with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts  and (iii) that the participant has entered into an agreement with the company  according to which the company  or the one the company assigns  under certain circumstances has the right to repurchase the warrants from the participant if the participant wishes to transfer the warrants before they can be exercised for subscription of shares  in some cases to an amount equal to the lower of the participant's acquisition price and the market value  in other cases to market value. The board of directors has the right to make the reasonable changes and adjustments of the terms and conditions in the agreement that are deemed suitable or appropriate as a result of local civil law or tax law or administrative conditions.Warrants may also be offered to future employees. For such acquisitions  the conditions shall be the same or equivalent to what is stated in this resolution. This means  inter alia  that acquisitions shall be made to the market value at the time of the acquisition.Application and allotmentApplication for acquisition of warrants shall be made during the period from and including 25 May 2022 up until and including 8 June 2022. The board of directors of the company shall however be entitled to extend the application period for acquisitions and to set a corresponding application period for new employees whose acquisitions are made after the expiration of the initial application period.The board of directors of the company shall determine the final allotment and the date of the transfer of the warrants. The transfer of warrants may be made up until and including the next annual general meeting.Price and payment etc.The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price (premium) established on the basis of a market value of the warrants calculated by an independent valuation institute using the Black & Scholes valuation model. A new market value shall be established in an equivalent way for acquisitions made by new employees after the expiration of the initial application period.Payment for the allocated warrants shall be made in cash no later than three weeks following the application for acquisition. The board of directors shall establish a corresponding date of payment for acquisitions made by new employees.DilutionUpon full exercise of all warrants  50 000 new ordinary shares of series B can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.01 percent of the total number of shares and approximately 0.01 percent of the total number of votes in the company  however  subject to any potential adjustment which may occur under the terms and conditions for the warrants. Accordingly  the program offers the employees the possibility to increase their shareholding in the company to the corresponding figure.Impact of financial ratio and costs for the company etc.The company's earnings per share are not affected by the issue of the warrants as the present value of the warrants' strike price exceeds the current market value of the share at the date of issue. Since the warrants are transferred to the participants at market value it is not expected that the company will incur any personnel costs. The warrant program will only incur certain limited costs in terms of external consulting fees and costs relating to the administration of the warrant program.Preparation of the matterThe principles of the warrant program have been prepared by the board of directors of the company. The board of directors has thereafter decided to submit this proposal to the annual general meeting. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board of directors  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Other share related incentive programs etc.Truecaller's ongoing share-based incentive programs and variable compensation to senior executives will be described in the annual report for 2021  in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The board of directors' accounts of the remuneration committee's evaluation of the principles for remuneration to senior executives which are published on Truecaller's website  describes how Truecaller applies its principles for remuneration to senior executives in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.Authorization for the board of directorsThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board ofdirectors to execute the resolution in accordance with the above and to ensure that the Subsidiary's board of directors carries out the transfer of the warrants in accordance with the above.Item 17: Resolution on the issue and transfer of warrants of series 2022:2The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants and to approve the transfer of the warrants in accordance with the following.Issue of warrants (Item 17 (A))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to carry out a directed issue of not more than 450 000 warrants  entailing an increase in the share capital of not more than SEK 900 at full subscription.

The new ordinary shares of series B which may be issued due to exercise of warrants are not subject to any restrictive provisions.The subscription price (strike price) shall be established by the company  or by an independent appraiser or auditor firm retained by the company  and correspond to 150 percent of the volume weighted average price of the ordinary share of series B according to the official share list of Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten trading days immediately preceding the annual general meeting 2022  however not less than the quota value of the shares. The amount of the subscription price exceeding the quota value of the shares shall be contributed to the free share premium reserve.Shares which are newly issued following subscription by virtue of the warrants shall carry an entitlement to participate in dividends for the first time on the next record date for dividends which occurs after subscription for shares by virtue of the utilization of the warrants is effected.The company may  by means of a board resolution and with the consent from the board of directors in the Subsidiary  cancel the Subsidiary's warrants that are not transferred in accordance with the below or that have been re-purchased from participants. Cancellation shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  is authorized to make such minor adjustments to the resolution which may prove necessary in order to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Approval of transfer of warrants (Item 17 (B))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting approves the Subsidiary's transfer of warrants on the following conditions.The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall vest in senior executives and other key employees in the Truecaller group who participate in existing incentive programs in the Truecaller group. Employees who are also board members in Truecaller AB do not have the right to acquire any warrants. The allotment per participant will depend on position within the Truecaller group and may not exceed 60 000 warrants per participant. In total  not more than 25 senior executives and other key employees in the Truecaller group may be allotted warrants of series 2022:2.As the warrants are acquired by the participants at market value and require a positive development of the share price of the company there are no performance criteria for the exercise of the warrants.A prerequisite for being entitled to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary is (i) that the participant at the time of the acquisition is an employee of the group  (ii) that acquisition of warrants can take place in accordance with applicable laws  and  according to the board of directors' assessment  can be executed with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts  and (iii) that the participant has entered into an agreement with the company  according to which the company  or the one the company assigns  under certain circumstances has the right to repurchase the warrants from the participant if the participant wishes to transfer the warrants before they can be exercised for subscription of shares  in some cases to an amount equal to the lower of the participant's acquisition price and the market value  in other cases to market value. The board of directors has the right to make the reasonable changes and adjustments of the terms and conditions in the agreement that are deemed suitable or appropriate as a result of local civil law or tax law or administrative conditions.Application and allotmentApplication for acquisition of warrants shall be made during the period from and including 25 May 2022 up until and including 8 June 2022. The board of directors of the company shall however be entitled to extend the application period for acquisitions.The board of directors of the company shall determine the final allotment and the date of the transfer of the warrants.Price and payment etc.The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price (premium) established on the basis of a market value of the warrants calculated by an independent valuation institute using the Black & Scholes valuation model.Payment for the allocated warrants shall be made in cash no later than three weeks following the application for acquisition.DilutionUpon full exercise of all warrants  450 000 new ordinary shares of series B can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.12 percent of the total number of shares and approximately 0.06 percent of the total number of votes in the company  however  subject to any potential adjustment which may occur under the terms and conditions for the warrants. Accordingly  the program offers the employees the possibility to increase their shareholding in the company to the corresponding figure.Impact of financial ratio and costs for the company etc.The company's earnings per share are not affected by the issue of the warrants as the present value of the warrants' strike price exceeds the current market value of the share at the date of issue. Since the warrants are transferred to the participants at market value it is not expected that the company will incur any personnel costs. The warrant program will only incur certain limited costs in terms of external consulting fees and costs relating to the administration of the warrant program.Preparation of the matterThe principles of the warrant program have been prepared by the board of directors of the company. The board of directors has thereafter decided to submit this proposal to the annual general meeting. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board of directors  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Other share related incentive programs etc.Truecaller's ongoing share-based incentive programs and variable compensation to senior executives will be described in the annual report for 2021  in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The board of directors' accounts of the remuneration committee's evaluation of the principles for remuneration to senior executives which are published on Truecaller's website  describes how Truecaller applies its principles for remuneration to senior executives in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.Authorization for the board of directorsThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board of directors to execute the resolution in accordance with the above and to ensure that the Subsidiary's board of directors carries out the transfer of the warrants in accordance with the above.Item 18: Resolution on the implementation of a long-term share program  amendments to the articles of association and hedging arrangements in respect of the programThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on:(A) implementation of a long-term share program (the ""Share Program 2022"") for employees in the Truecaller group;(B) amendments to the articles of association whereby the possibility to issue redeemable and convertible C shares is introduced; and(C) hedging arrangements in respect of the Share Program 2022  consisting of:(I) an authorization for the board of directors to decide on a directed issue of redeemable and convertible C shares;(II) an authorization for the board of directors to decide on a repurchase of C shares; and(III) transfers of own ordinary shares of series B to Share Program 2022 participants (employees in the Truecaller group).Should the majority requirement under item 18 (C) not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting approves that the company enters into an equity swap agreement with a third party (item 18 (D)).Implementation of Share Program 2022 (Item 18 (A))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on the implementation of the Share Program 2022 in accordance with the below.Objectives and reasons for the proposalTruecaller has during a number of years resolved to implement long-term incentive programs. The board of directors has  when evaluating previous incentive programs  concluded that it would be effective to resolve on implementing a new incentive program at the annual general meeting; adapting the structure with the aim of recruiting  rewarding and retaining valuable employees in a more appropriate manner and promote and create long-term participation in the Truecaller group  thereby closely aligning the employees' interests with those of Truecaller's shareholders. Consequently  the Share Program 2022 is structured to create long-term incentives for members of the senior executives and certain other employees in order to improve Truecaller's development and create long-term values. In view of the terms proposed below  the size of the allotment and other circumstances  the board of directors assesses that the proposed Share Program 2022 is well-balanced and that it will be beneficial for the company and its shareholders.Description of Share Program 20221. The Share Program 2022 shall comprise not more than 5 100 000 ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller  corresponding to approximately 1.36 percent of the total number of issued shares and approximately 0.64 percent of the total number of votes in Truecaller.2. The Share Program 2022 is proposed to include senior executives and key employees (""Group 1"") together with certain other employees (""Group 2"") (jointly the ""Participants"").3. It is proposed that the Share Program 2022 shall grant the possibility of allotment of ordinary shares of series B free of charge (""Performance Shares"")  subject to the fulfilment of the performance target during certain measurement periods (the ""Performance Periods"").4. Under the Share Program 2022  the Participants will receive a certain number of rights free of charge  which entitle the Participants to receive a certain number of ordinary shares of series B in the company following the expiration of a vesting period of three years for certain Participants and three and four years  respectively  for certain Participants (""Performance Share Rights""). At the implementation of the Share Program 2022  each Performance Share Right entitles the holder to one (1) ordinary share of series B (subject to the achievement of the Share Program 2022's performance target). With respect to Participants who participate in existing incentive programs in the Truecaller group (""Participants in Previous Programs"")  allotment of all Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026. With respect to Participants who do not participate in any existing incentive programs in the Truecaller group (""New Participants"")  allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2025 and allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026. Any allotment of ordinary shares of series B pursuant to Performance Share Rights will be subject to the achievement of the performance target  as set out below  and will generally require that the Participant retains his or her employment until the respective allotment date (the ""Vesting Period"").5. Within Group 1  allotment per Participant will depend on performance and position within the group and may not exceed 100 000 Performance Share Rights per Participant. The number of Participants in Group 1 shall not exceed 30 persons.6. Within Group 2  allotment per Participant will depend on performance and position within the group and may not exceed 40 000 Performance Share Rights per Participant. The number of Participants in Group 2 shall not exceed 350 persons.7. For full allotment  the company must achieve a combination of revenue growth rate (%) and adjusted EBITDA (%) of at least 50 percent annually  on average during the three financial years preceding the respective allotment date. In the event that the performance target falls below 50 percent  the allotment of Performance Shares shall decrease linearly  and in the event that the performance target falls below 25 percent  no allotment of Performance Shares shall be made. Accordingly  the Performance Period for Participants in Previous Programs runs during the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025  and the Performance Periods for New Participants run during the financial years 2022  2023 and 2024 with respect to 1/2 of the Performance Shares and during the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025 with respect to 1/2 of the Performance Shares.8. The actual allotment of Performance Share Rights to Participants  within the limits set out above  is decided by the board of directors and may be reduced proportionally based on the respective person's performance and time of employment within the Truecaller group.9. The right to receive ordinary shares of series B under the Performance Share Rights is conditioned on continued employment within the Truecaller group. Should the employment with the Truecaller group terminate due to redundancy  illness  retirement pursuant to a succession plan approved by the Truecaller group (or similar)  the Participant may keep the Performance Share Rights not yet vested pro rata in relation to the time passed since the date the Performance Share Rights were allotted until the termination date  and the remainder of the rights will lapse. Should the Participant's employment with the Truecaller group terminate due to any other reason prior to the expiration of the Vesting Period  all Performance Share Rights held by the Participant will normally lapse. Performance Share Rights shall not constitute securities and may not be transferred  pledged or otherwise disposed of by the Participant.10. Any allotment of ordinary shares of series B pursuant at vesting of the Performance Shares Rights depends on the extent to which the performance target is met during the Performance Periods  thereby establishing what portion (if any) of the Performance Share Rights that will give the Participants right to receive ordinary shares of series B at the end of the Vesting Period. the company will provide information to the shareholders to what extent the performance target has been achieved after the end of each Performance Period. In total  not more than one (1) Performance Share per Performance Share Right may be allocated (disregarding any recalculation under the terms of the Share Program 2022).11. Provided that the performance target above has been met during the relevant Performance Period and the Participant has retained his or her employment (unless special circumstances are at hand)  allotment of all Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026 with respect to Participants in Previous Programs  and allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2025 and allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026 with respect to New Participants.12. When determining the final vesting level of Performance Share Rights  the board of directors shall examine whether the vesting level is reasonable considering Truecaller's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the board of directors  reduce the vesting level to the lower level deemed appropriate by the board of directors.13. In order to align the Participants' and shareholders' interests  Truecaller will compensate for any dividends and other value transfers to the shareholders during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of shares to which each Performance Share Right entitles and/or by adjusting the performance target. The performance target and/or the number of ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller which each Performance Share Right entitles the Participant to receive may be recalculated as a result of e.g. bonus issues  reverse splits or splits of shares  interim dividend  new share issues  reductions of the share capital  or similar actions. The transfer of shares may be accelerated as a result of any merger  change of control or similar actions.14. The board of directors shall resolve on the detailed terms and conditions for the Share Program 2022 and  in the event of company related events  market conditions  local legislation or other rules  regulatory changes  or other events  the board of directors shall be entitled to make deviations from and adjustments of the terms and conditions of the Share Program 2022 or settle all or part of the Performance Shares in cash.Costs and effects on important key ratiosThe costs of the Share Program 2022  which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been made based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Truecaller ordinary share of series B of SEK 64 based on the closing price as of April 21  2022  (ii) no dividends are paid by Truecaller during the Share Program 2022 and (iii) an assessment of total Performance Shares earned during the Vesting Period of 70 percent  (iv) an employee turnover of 10 percent per year. In total  this can lead to maximum costs for the Share Program 2022 of approximately SEK 160 million  excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are estimated to approximately SEK 160 million assuming an annual share price increase of 45 percent during the Vesting Period.The expected annual costs of the Share Program 2022  including annualized social security charges of approximately SEK 40 million  would have corresponded to approximately 23 percent of Truecaller's total annual employee costs 2021.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and that the Share Program 2022 was introduced in 2020 instead  it is estimated that the key ratio earnings per share for the full year 2021 had decreased from 0.72 SEK to approximately SEK 0.50.The board of directors deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior executives and other employees  which may be further increased through the Share Program 2022  outweighs the costs related to the Share Program 2022.DilutionUpon full allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares under the Share Program 2022 amounts to 5 100 000 ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller  corresponding to a dilution effect of approximately 1.36 percent of the share capital and approximately 0.64 percent of the votes based on the number of issued shares as per the day of this proposal.Preparation of the proposal  etc.The proposal regarding Share Program 2022 has been prepared by the board of directors in consultation with external advisors. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board of directors  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Description of ongoing variable compensation programsTruecaller's ongoing share-based incentive programs and variable compensation to senior executives are described in the annual report for 2021  in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The board of directors' accounts of the remuneration committee's evaluation of the principles for remuneration to senior executives  which are published on Truecaller's website  describes how Truecaller applies its principles for remuneration to senior executives in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.Amendments to the articles of association (Item 18 (B))In order to enable the issuance of redeemable and convertible C shares under Share Program 2022  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend § 6 in the company's articles of association in accordance with the following. The amendment to § 6 of the company's articles of association also means that the preference share classes is removed  which means that the company will only be able to issue ordinary shares of series A and B and C shares in accordance with the new articles of association.These changes mean that § 6 of the company's articles of association will have the following wording.Proposed wording§ 6 Classes of shares Shares may be issued in three classes  ordinary shares of series A  ordinary shares of series B and series C shares. The ordinary shares of series A shall carry 10 votes per share  the ordinary shares of series B shall carry one vote per share and series C shares shall carry one-tenth of a vote per share. Shares of either share class may be issued up to an amount corresponding to the full share capital. Series C shares do not entitle to dividends. Upon the dissolution of the company  series C shares shall carry equivalent right to the company's assets as other shares  however  not to an amount exceeding the quota value of the share. If the company resolves to issue new ordinary shares of series A  ordinary shares of series B and series C shares  against payment other than contribution in kind  owners of ordinary shares of series A  ordinary shares of series B and series C shares shall have pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares of the same class pro rata to the number of shares previously held by them (primary pre-emption right). Shares which are not subscribed for pursuant to the primary pre-emption rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (secondary pre-emption right). If the shares thus offered are not sufficient for the subscription pursuant to the secondary pre-emption rights  the shares shall be allocated between the subscribers pro rata to the number of shares previously held and  to the extent such allocation cannot be effected  by the drawing of lots. Should the company decide not to issue shares of all series in conjunction with a cash issue or a set-off issue  all shareholders  irrespective of class of share  shall have a pre-emption right to subscribe for new shares in proportion to the number of shares they already own. What is set out above with regard to pre-emption rights shall apply mutatis mutandis in the event of issues of warrants and convertible debentures and shall not limit the right to resolve upon an issue with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights. In the event of a bonus issue  new shares of each class shall be issued pro rata to the number of shares of the same class previously issued. In connection therewith  the owners of existing shares of a certain class shall entitle the holder to new shares of the same class. This shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility of issuing new shares of a new class by means of a bonus issue  following the required amendments of the articles of association. Ordinary shares of series A shall  upon request of the owner of such shares be converted to ordinary shares of series B. Conversion requests must be made in writing by the shareholder to the company's board. The notice shall state the number of shares to be converted  and  if conversion will not relate to the owner's entire holding  which shares shall be converted. The board is obliged to process the request on the board meeting immediately following the request. The conversion shall be promptly submitted for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and shall be effective when registration of the conversion has been made with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden. Reduction of share capital  which in any case shall not fall below the minimum share capital  may  at the request of a holder of a series C share and after resolution by the company's board of directors or a shareholders' meeting  take place through redemption of series C shares. A request from a shareholder must be submitted in writing. When a resolution on reduction has been passed  an amount corresponding to the reduction amount shall be transferred to the company's reserve fund  if the required funds are available. The redemption amount per series C share shall be the quota value of such share. Following receipt of the redemption resolution  holders of shares subject to redemption shall promptly receive payment for the shares  or  if authorization for the redemption from the Swedish Companies Registration Office or a court is required  following the receipt of notice that the final and effected resolution has been registered. Series C shares held by the company may  upon resolution of the board of directors be converted into ordinary shares of series B. Immediately thereafter  the board of directors shall register the conversion with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The conversion is effected when it has been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden.Hedging arrangements in respect of the Share Program 2022 (Item 18 (C))The board of directors has evaluated different methods to secure the financial exposure and transfer of shares in accordance with the Share Program 2022  such as transfer of own shares and an equity swap agreement with a third party. The board of directors considers a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares and transfer of such shares to the Participants (following conversion of the shares to ordinary shares of series B) to be the most cost-effective and flexible method for hedging the financial exposure and transfer of own shares under the Share Program 2022.The board of directors proposes that the main option to secure the financial exposure shall be transfer of own shares (item 18 (C))  since the cost associated with an equity swap agreement vastly exceeds the costs of transferring own shares.Should the majority requirement under item 18 (C) not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting approves the entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party (item 18 (D)).Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to issue redeemable and convertible C shares (Item 18 (C) (I))Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to issue redeemable and convertible C shares  on one or more occasions  until the next annual general meeting.The issue shall be effected on the following terms.· The number of C shares that may be issued may amount to no more than 5 100 000.· The new C shares shall – with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights – be subscribed for only by an external party who has been informed in advance.· The price to be paid for each new share shall correspond to the quotient value of the share at the time of the subscription of the shares.· The new shares will be subject to restrictions as set forth in Chapter 4  Section 6 (conversion provision) and Chapter 20  Section 31 (redemption provision) of the Swedish Companies Act (SFS 2005:551).Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares (Item 18 (C) (II))Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible C shares in the company on the following terms.· Repurchase may be effected through a public offer directed to all owners of C shares in the company.· The authorization is valid and may be exercised on one or several occasions until the annual general meeting 2023.· The number of C shares permitted to be repurchased shall amount to no more than 5 100 000.· Repurchase of shares shall be made at the quotient value  applicable at the time of the subscription of shares according to item 18 (C) (I) above.· Payment for shares repurchased shall be made in cash.· The board of directors shall be authorized to establish additional terms for the repurchase.· The authorization shall also be valid for repurchase of so-called interim shares  designated by Euroclear Sweden AB as a ""paid subscription share"" (Sw. BTA) relating to a C share.The repurchase of own shares is an integrated part of the hedging arrangements for the Share Program 2022. The reason for the proposed authorization to repurchase own shares is for the company to be able to fulfil its obligations pursuant to the Share Program 2022 in a cost effective manner.Resolution on transfer of own ordinary shares of series B to Participants in the Share Program 2022 (Item 18 (C) (III))The board of directors proposes that the shares issued and repurchased in accordance with item 18 C (I) and (II)  after being converted into ordinary shares of series B  may be transferred to the Participants of the Share Program 2022.Resolution on transfers of the company's own ordinary shares of series B to Share Program 2022 Participants shall be made on the following terms.· Transfer of shares may only be made of ordinary shares of series B in the company  whereby a maximum of 5 100 000 ordinary shares of series B in the company may be transferred free of charge to Share Program 2022 Participants.· Right to purchase ordinary shares of series B in the company free of charge shall – with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights – be granted to the Participants in the Share Program 2022.· Transfers of ordinary shares of series B in the company shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms that the Share Program 2022 Participants are entitled to be allotted shares.· The number of ordinary shares of series B in the company that may be transferred under the Share Program 2022 will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party (Item 18 (D))Should the majority required under item 18 (C) above not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that the expected financial exposure of the Share Program 2022 shall be hedged by the company by entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market conditions  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer ordinary shares of series B in the company to the Participants of the Share Program 2022.Other informationConditionsThe annual general meeting's resolution on the implementation of Share Program 2022 according to item 18 (A) above is conditional upon the meeting resolving either in accordance with the board of directors' proposal under item 18 (B) and item 18 (C)  or resolving in accordance with the board of directors' proposal under item 18 (D).Majority requirementsThe annual general meeting's resolution according to item 18 (A) above require a simple majority among the votes cast. A valid resolution under item 18 (B) above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item 18 (C) above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item 18 (D) above requires a simple majority among the votes cast.Particular majority requirementsAside from the majority requirements set out in item 18  for valid resolutions on the proposals pursuant to items 14 and 15  the proposals have to be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual general meeting  and for a valid resolution on the proposals pursuant to items 16 and 17  the proposals have to be supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual general meeting.Information at the annual general meetingThe board of directors and the chief executive officer shall at the annual general meeting  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believes that it can be done without significant harm to the company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of items on the agenda  circumstances that can affect the assessment of the company's or its subsidiaries financial position and the company's relation to other companies within the group.Financial statements and complete proposalsFinancial statements  the audit report  the board of directors' remuneration report  the statement by the auditor on the compliance of the applicable guidelines for remuneration to senior executives as well as the complete proposals for resolutions with ancillary documents pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act  will be available for the shareholders at the company's office at Mäster Samuelsgatan 56  SE-111 12 Stockholm  Sweden  and at the company's website (corporate.truecaller.com/governance/general-meetings) as from no later than three weeks prior to the annual general meeting.

The board of directors has  when evaluating previous incentive programs  concluded that it would be effective to resolve on implementing a new incentive program at the annual general meeting; adapting the structure with the aim of recruiting  rewarding and retaining valuable employees in a more appropriate manner and promote and create long-term participation in the Truecaller group  thereby closely aligning the employees' interests with those of Truecaller's shareholders. Consequently  the Share Program 2022 is structured to create long-term incentives for members of the senior executives and certain other employees in order to improve Truecaller's development and create long-term values. In view of the terms proposed below  the size of the allotment and other circumstances  the board of directors assesses that the proposed Share Program 2022 is well-balanced and that it will be beneficial for the company and its shareholders.Description of Share Program 20221. The Share Program 2022 shall comprise not more than 5 100 000 ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller  corresponding to approximately 1.36 percent of the total number of issued shares and approximately 0.64 percent of the total number of votes in Truecaller.2. The Share Program 2022 is proposed to include senior executives and key employees (""Group 1"") together with certain other employees (""Group 2"") (jointly the ""Participants"").3. It is proposed that the Share Program 2022 shall grant the possibility of allotment of ordinary shares of series B free of charge (""Performance Shares"")  subject to the fulfilment of the performance target during certain measurement periods (the ""Performance Periods"").4. Under the Share Program 2022  the Participants will receive a certain number of rights free of charge  which entitle the Participants to receive a certain number of ordinary shares of series B in the company following the expiration of a vesting period of three years for certain Participants and three and four years  respectively  for certain Participants (""Performance Share Rights""). At the implementation of the Share Program 2022  each Performance Share Right entitles the holder to one (1) ordinary share of series B (subject to the achievement of the Share Program 2022's performance target). With respect to Participants who participate in existing incentive programs in the Truecaller group (""Participants in Previous Programs"")  allotment of all Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026. With respect to Participants who do not participate in any existing incentive programs in the Truecaller group (""New Participants"")  allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2025 and allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026. Any allotment of ordinary shares of series B pursuant to Performance Share Rights will be subject to the achievement of the performance target  as set out below  and will generally require that the Participant retains his or her employment until the respective allotment date (the ""Vesting Period"").5. Within Group 1  allotment per Participant will depend on performance and position within the group and may not exceed 100 000 Performance Share Rights per Participant. The number of Participants in Group 1 shall not exceed 30 persons.6. Within Group 2  allotment per Participant will depend on performance and position within the group and may not exceed 40 000 Performance Share Rights per Participant. The number of Participants in Group 2 shall not exceed 350 persons.7. For full allotment  the company must achieve a combination of revenue growth rate (%) and adjusted EBITDA (%) of at least 50 percent annually  on average during the three financial years preceding the respective allotment date. In the event that the performance target falls below 50 percent  the allotment of Performance Shares shall decrease linearly  and in the event that the performance target falls below 25 percent  no allotment of Performance Shares shall be made. Accordingly  the Performance Period for Participants in Previous Programs runs during the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025  and the Performance Periods for New Participants run during the financial years 2022  2023 and 2024 with respect to 1/2 of the Performance Shares and during the financial years 2023  2024 and 2025 with respect to 1/2 of the Performance Shares.8. The actual allotment of Performance Share Rights to Participants  within the limits set out above  is decided by the board of directors and may be reduced proportionally based on the respective person's performance and time of employment within the Truecaller group.9. The right to receive ordinary shares of series B under the Performance Share Rights is conditioned on continued employment within the Truecaller group. Should the employment with the Truecaller group terminate due to redundancy  illness  retirement pursuant to a succession plan approved by the Truecaller group (or similar)  the Participant may keep the Performance Share Rights not yet vested pro rata in relation to the time passed since the date the Performance Share Rights were allotted until the termination date  and the remainder of the rights will lapse. Should the Participant's employment with the Truecaller group terminate due to any other reason prior to the expiration of the Vesting Period  all Performance Share Rights held by the Participant will normally lapse. Performance Share Rights shall not constitute securities and may not be transferred  pledged or otherwise disposed of by the Participant.10. Any allotment of ordinary shares of series B pursuant at vesting of the Performance Shares Rights depends on the extent to which the performance target is met during the Performance Periods  thereby establishing what portion (if any) of the Performance Share Rights that will give the Participants right to receive ordinary shares of series B at the end of the Vesting Period. the company will provide information to the shareholders to what extent the performance target has been achieved after the end of each Performance Period. In total  not more than one (1) Performance Share per Performance Share Right may be allocated (disregarding any recalculation under the terms of the Share Program 2022).11. Provided that the performance target above has been met during the relevant Performance Period and the Participant has retained his or her employment (unless special circumstances are at hand)  allotment of all Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026 with respect to Participants in Previous Programs  and allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2025 and allotment of 1/2 of the Performance Shares shall take place in June 2026 with respect to New Participants.12. When determining the final vesting level of Performance Share Rights  the board of directors shall examine whether the vesting level is reasonable considering Truecaller's financial results and position  conditions on the stock market and other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the board of directors  reduce the vesting level to the lower level deemed appropriate by the board of directors.13. In order to align the Participants' and shareholders' interests  Truecaller will compensate for any dividends and other value transfers to the shareholders during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of shares to which each Performance Share Right entitles and/or by adjusting the performance target. The performance target and/or the number of ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller which each Performance Share Right entitles the Participant to receive may be recalculated as a result of e.g. bonus issues  reverse splits or splits of shares  interim dividend  new share issues  reductions of the share capital  or similar actions. The transfer of shares may be accelerated as a result of any merger  change of control or similar actions.14. The board of directors shall resolve on the detailed terms and conditions for the Share Program 2022 and  in the event of company related events  market conditions  local legislation or other rules  regulatory changes  or other events  the board of directors shall be entitled to make deviations from and adjustments of the terms and conditions of the Share Program 2022 or settle all or part of the Performance Shares in cash.Costs and effects on important key ratiosThe costs of the Share Program 2022  which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been made based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Truecaller ordinary share of series B of SEK 64 based on the closing price as of April 21  2022  (ii) no dividends are paid by Truecaller during the Share Program 2022 and (iii) an assessment of total Performance Shares earned during the Vesting Period of 70 percent  (iv) an employee turnover of 10 percent per year. In total  this can lead to maximum costs for the Share Program 2022 of approximately SEK 160 million  excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are estimated to approximately SEK 160 million assuming an annual share price increase of 45 percent during the Vesting Period.The expected annual costs of the Share Program 2022  including annualized social security charges of approximately SEK 40 million  would have corresponded to approximately 23 percent of Truecaller's total annual employee costs 2021.Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and that the Share Program 2022 was introduced in 2020 instead  it is estimated that the key ratio earnings per share for the full year 2021 had decreased from 0.72 SEK to approximately SEK 0.50.The board of directors deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior executives and other employees  which may be further increased through the Share Program 2022  outweighs the costs related to the Share Program 2022.DilutionUpon full allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares under the Share Program 2022 amounts to 5 100 000 ordinary shares of series B in Truecaller  corresponding to a dilution effect of approximately 1.36 percent of the share capital and approximately 0.64 percent of the votes based on the number of issued shares as per the day of this proposal.Preparation of the proposal  etc.The proposal regarding Share Program 2022 has been prepared by the board of directors in consultation with external advisors. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board of directors  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Description of ongoing variable compensation programsTruecaller's ongoing share-based incentive programs and variable compensation to senior executives are described in the annual report for 2021  in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The board of directors' accounts of the remuneration committee's evaluation of the principles for remuneration to senior executives  which are published on Truecaller's website  describes how Truecaller applies its principles for remuneration to senior executives in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code.Amendments to the articles of association (Item 18 (B))In order to enable the issuance of redeemable and convertible C shares under Share Program 2022  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to amend § 6 in the company's articles of association in accordance with the following. The amendment to § 6 of the company's articles of association also means that the preference share classes is removed  which means that the company will only be able to issue ordinary shares of series A and B and C shares in accordance with the new articles of association.These changes mean that § 6 of the company's articles of association will have the following wording.Proposed wording§ 6 Classes of shares Shares may be issued in three classes  ordinary shares of series A  ordinary shares of series B and series C shares. The ordinary shares of series A shall carry 10 votes per share  the ordinary shares of series B shall carry one vote per share and series C shares shall carry one-tenth of a vote per share. Shares of either share class may be issued up to an amount corresponding to the full share capital. Series C shares do not entitle to dividends. Upon the dissolution of the company  series C shares shall carry equivalent right to the company's assets as other shares  however  not to an amount exceeding the quota value of the share. If the company resolves to issue new ordinary shares of series A  ordinary shares of series B and series C shares  against payment other than contribution in kind  owners of ordinary shares of series A  ordinary shares of series B and series C shares shall have pre-emption rights to subscribe for new shares of the same class pro rata to the number of shares previously held by them (primary pre-emption right). Shares which are not subscribed for pursuant to the primary pre-emption rights shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (secondary pre-emption right). If the shares thus offered are not sufficient for the subscription pursuant to the secondary pre-emption rights  the shares shall be allocated between the subscribers pro rata to the number of shares previously held and  to the extent such allocation cannot be effected  by the drawing of lots. Should the company decide not to issue shares of all series in conjunction with a cash issue or a set-off issue  all shareholders  irrespective of class of share  shall have a pre-emption right to subscribe for new shares in proportion to the number of shares they already own. What is set out above with regard to pre-emption rights shall apply mutatis mutandis in the event of issues of warrants and convertible debentures and shall not limit the right to resolve upon an issue with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights. In the event of a bonus issue  new shares of each class shall be issued pro rata to the number of shares of the same class previously issued. In connection therewith  the owners of existing shares of a certain class shall entitle the holder to new shares of the same class. This shall not entail any restrictions on the possibility of issuing new shares of a new class by means of a bonus issue  following the required amendments of the articles of association. Ordinary shares of series A shall  upon request of the owner of such shares be converted to ordinary shares of series B. Conversion requests must be made in writing by the shareholder to the company's board. The notice shall state the number of shares to be converted  and  if conversion will not relate to the owner's entire holding  which shares shall be converted. The board is obliged to process the request on the board meeting immediately following the request. The conversion shall be promptly submitted for registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and shall be effective when registration of the conversion has been made with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden. Reduction of share capital  which in any case shall not fall below the minimum share capital  may  at the request of a holder of a series C share and after resolution by the company's board of directors or a shareholders' meeting  take place through redemption of series C shares. A request from a shareholder must be submitted in writing. When a resolution on reduction has been passed  an amount corresponding to the reduction amount shall be transferred to the company's reserve fund  if the required funds are available. The redemption amount per series C share shall be the quota value of such share. Following receipt of the redemption resolution  holders of shares subject to redemption shall promptly receive payment for the shares  or  if authorization for the redemption from the Swedish Companies Registration Office or a court is required  following the receipt of notice that the final and effected resolution has been registered. Series C shares held by the company may  upon resolution of the board of directors be converted into ordinary shares of series B. Immediately thereafter  the board of directors shall register the conversion with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The conversion is effected when it has been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden.Hedging arrangements in respect of the Share Program 2022 (Item 18 (C))The board of directors has evaluated different methods to secure the financial exposure and transfer of shares in accordance with the Share Program 2022  such as transfer of own shares and an equity swap agreement with a third party. The board of directors considers a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares and transfer of such shares to the Participants (following conversion of the shares to ordinary shares of series B) to be the most cost-effective and flexible method for hedging the financial exposure and transfer of own shares under the Share Program 2022.The board of directors proposes that the main option to secure the financial exposure shall be transfer of own shares (item 18 (C))  since the cost associated with an equity swap agreement vastly exceeds the costs of transferring own shares.Should the majority requirement under item 18 (C) not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting approves the entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party (item 18 (D)).Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to issue redeemable and convertible C shares (Item 18 (C) (I))Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to issue redeemable and convertible C shares  on one or more occasions  until the next annual general meeting.The issue shall be effected on the following terms.· The number of C shares that may be issued may amount to no more than 5 100 000.· The new C shares shall – with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights – be subscribed for only by an external party who has been informed in advance.· The price to be paid for each new share shall correspond to the quotient value of the share at the time of the subscription of the shares.· The new shares will be subject to restrictions as set forth in Chapter 4  Section 6 (conversion provision) and Chapter 20  Section 31 (redemption provision) of the Swedish Companies Act (SFS 2005:551).Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares (Item 18 (C) (II))Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase all issued redeemable and convertible C shares in the company on the following terms.· Repurchase may be effected through a public offer directed to all owners of C shares in the company.· The authorization is valid and may be exercised on one or several occasions until the annual general meeting 2023.· The number of C shares permitted to be repurchased shall amount to no more than 5 100 000.· Repurchase of shares shall be made at the quotient value  applicable at the time of the subscription of shares according to item 18 (C) (I) above.· Payment for shares repurchased shall be made in cash.· The board of directors shall be authorized to establish additional terms for the repurchase.· The authorization shall also be valid for repurchase of so-called interim shares  designated by Euroclear Sweden AB as a ""paid subscription share"" (Sw. BTA) relating to a C share.The repurchase of own shares is an integrated part of the hedging arrangements for the Share Program 2022. The reason for the proposed authorization to repurchase own shares is for the company to be able to fulfil its obligations pursuant to the Share Program 2022 in a cost effective manner.Resolution on transfer of own ordinary shares of series B to Participants in the Share Program 2022 (Item 18 (C) (III))The board of directors proposes that the shares issued and repurchased in accordance with item 18 C (I) and (II)  after being converted into ordinary shares of series B  may be transferred to the Participants of the Share Program 2022.Resolution on transfers of the company's own ordinary shares of series B to Share Program 2022 Participants shall be made on the following terms.· Transfer of shares may only be made of ordinary shares of series B in the company  whereby a maximum of 5 100 000 ordinary shares of series B in the company may be transferred free of charge to Share Program 2022 Participants.· Right to purchase ordinary shares of series B in the company free of charge shall – with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights – be granted to the Participants in the Share Program 2022.· Transfers of ordinary shares of series B in the company shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms that the Share Program 2022 Participants are entitled to be allotted shares.· The number of ordinary shares of series B in the company that may be transferred under the Share Program 2022 will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.Entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party (Item 18 (D))Should the majority required under item 18 (C) above not be reached  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that the expected financial exposure of the Share Program 2022 shall be hedged by the company by entering into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market conditions  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer ordinary shares of series B in the company to the Participants of the Share Program 2022.Other informationConditionsThe annual general meeting's resolution on the implementation of Share Program 2022 according to item 18 (A) above is conditional upon the meeting resolving either in accordance with the board of directors' proposal under item 18 (B) and item 18 (C)  or resolving in accordance with the board of directors' proposal under item 18 (D).Majority requirementsThe annual general meeting's resolution according to item 18 (A) above require a simple majority among the votes cast. A valid resolution under item 18 (B) above requires that shareholders representing not less than two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item 18 (C) above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item 18 (D) above requires a simple majority among the votes cast.Particular majority requirementsAside from the majority requirements set out in item 18  for valid resolutions on the proposals pursuant to items 14 and 15  the proposals have to be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual general meeting  and for a valid resolution on the proposals pursuant to items 16 and 17  the proposals have to be supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual general meeting.Information at the annual general meetingThe board of directors and the chief executive officer shall at the annual general meeting  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believes that it can be done without significant harm to the company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of items on the agenda  circumstances that can affect the assessment of the company's or its subsidiaries financial position and the company's relation to other companies within the group.Financial statements and complete proposalsFinancial statements  the audit report  the board of directors' remuneration report  the statement by the auditor on the compliance of the applicable guidelines for remuneration to senior executives as well as the complete proposals for resolutions with ancillary documents pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act  will be available for the shareholders at the company's office at Mäster Samuelsgatan 56  SE-111 12 Stockholm  Sweden  and at the company's website (corporate.truecaller.com/governance/general-meetings) as from no later than three weeks prior to the annual general meeting.

3356,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.law360.com/corporate-crime-uk/articles/1486352/russian-bank-offers-domestic-bonds-for-eurobonds,Russian Bank Offers Domestic Bonds For Eurobonds,1 day ago,"Law360  London (April 22  2022  2:57 PM BST) -- One of Russia's largest banks said on Friday it will offer to exchange its dollar-denominated eurobonds for Russian bonds after it suspended payments due to Western sanctions and the country's capital controls.Sovcombank PAO  the country's third largest privately owned lender  said the exchange would enable the eurobond holders to receive payments directly in Russia without using international payment systems such as SWIFT.The bank said on its website that it made the coupon payments in rubles on Thursday  but only to bondholders registered with accounts at Russia's National Settlement Depository.The lender said it was not possible to make payments through its bond issuer Sovcom Capital DAC  its Ireland-based special purpose vehicle. It added that it is not clear if it will be possible to make payments in the future due to conflicts between Russian and foreign law.""Sovcombank is registering a new issue of local subordinated bonds and will offer holders of eurobonds to exchange them for new Russian bonds "" the lender said on its website. ""This will enable bondholders to receive payments directly in Russia  bypassing the international payment infrastructure.""The bank temporarilyon $1.2 billion worth of eurobonds earlier this month after it was blocked by Western sanctions and the Kremlin's own capital controls. The bank was due to make the scheduled interest payments on four dollar-denominated eurobonds issued by Sovcom Capital.The European Commission hasfrom using the SWIFT global interbank transfer messaging system since March  restricting its ability to conduct international banking operations. The Belgium-based network allows banks to make rapid international payments across borders for financial transactions and trade financing.The U.S. Treasury hasto make dollar debt payments from American bank accounts after Russia's major financial institutions were sanctioned in February because of the country's invasion of Ukraine. The U.S. government said Russian banks process about $46 billion in foreign exchange transactions daily  with 80% of that in dollars.It was the first Russian bank to miss payments on foreign currency bonds since sanctions were slapped on Russia after its invasion of Ukraine.The bonds are listed with international depositories  including Euroclear and Clearstream. The bank said it is continuing to work with international regulators to pay coupons to bondholders  but did not specify when this would be done.--Additional reporting by Najiyya Budaly and Daniel Wilson.

It added that it is not clear if it will be possible to make payments in the future due to conflicts between Russian and foreign law.""Sovcombank is registering a new issue of local subordinated bonds and will offer holders of eurobonds to exchange them for new Russian bonds "" the lender said on its website. ""This will enable bondholders to receive payments directly in Russia  bypassing the international payment infrastructure.""The bank temporarilyon $1.2 billion worth of eurobonds earlier this month after it was blocked by Western sanctions and the Kremlin's own capital controls.

3365,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=394c6ef8-ea5e-4ce8-813a-4240e727661d,In review: digital markets  funding and payment services in Germany,1 day ago,All questionsOverviewThe fintech market in general has demonstrated a remarkable resilience against the challenges caused by the covid-19 pandemic. Agile service providers offering reliable and innovative digital solutions for the financial sector may even be considered as beneficiaries of the crisis. This holds particularly true for solutions for cashless payments or 'neo-brokering' (i.e.  online brokerage services at low or even nil execution costs).As a matter of general tendency  the fintech market in Germany has already become relatively consolidated and mature and its influence on the financial sector has been rather revolutionary in nature.2 Although a 'winner-takes-all' phenomenon has been observed (attributed to increased competition and high acquisition costs)  fintechs are still expected to benefit from new business opportunities.3 It might also be perceived as an indication of a matured market that fintech companies have increasingly been integrated by banks and financial institutions into their value chains.4These developments  however  do not mean that the German fintech market has become stagnant. The opposite is true. According to a study  in 2021 there were 639 active fintech companies in Germany  out of which 55 per cent were under five years old.5 The highest proportion of young start-ups was identified in the risk and compliance (96 per cent) and decentralised finance (DeFi) (72 per cent) segments.6 As far as financing and capital access for young fintech companies is concerned  financing activity in Germany was on the rise in 2021  with the total number of financing transactions increasing by an average of 6 per cent per quarter  with early-stage financings most frequent in the fields of asset management and investment  credit and factoring  as well as DeFi.7 In addition  the German fintech market has seen significant funding for neo-banks and neo-brokers. Other significant fintech segments include banking  application programming interface banking and personal finance management.8 Thus  even though overall start-up activity in Germany has declined in the past three years (by an average of 1 per cent per quarter) 9 new fintech companies are being established and further developments can be expected.Fintech-related topics have been frequently and intensively discussed in Germany  not only by participants in the financial sector but also by politicians and regulatory authorities. In particular  the question of whether the present legal framework gives sufficient leeway for the application of blockchain-based business models while simultaneously providing a sufficient level of protection for market participants has been the subject matter of these discussions. As a result  an EU-wide framework for cryptoassets and an EU-level sandbox model have been proposed by the European Commission as part of the Digital Finance Package.10In 2020  the German federal legislator introduced statutory provisions according to which crypto values qualify as financial instruments for financial licensing purposes and crypto custody business became subject to a licence requirement under the German Banking Act (KWG). Further  in 2021 the German securities law was fundamentally changed: the introduction of electronic securities implemented one of the key points of the German government's blockchain strategy.11 With this step  the German legislator is following the path of other European countries towards securities dematerialisation.12Further  the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) has published several statements  explanations and opinions13 on topics such as big data  artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed ledger technologies (DLTs)  as well as digitalisation and information security.14 The recent statutory rules on crypto values and the crypto custody business  as well as on blockchain-based dematerialised securities  also indicate that the legislator has realised the need to provide legal certainty for innovative business models and services.Generally  the German legislator and BaFin apply the technology-neutral principle of 'same business  same risk  same regulation'.15 This is illustrated by the fact that neither the legislator nor BaFin has promulgated rules that privilege fintech companies compared to traditional players in the financial sector. Therefore  a 'sandbox' model that establishes an innovation space where fintech companies may test business models without tight regulation as established in the United Kingdom and in Switzerland has not been introduced in Germany yet.Hence  BaFin attempts to find a balance between supervisory concerns and the start-up culture that often exists within the fintech sector. As part of its efforts in this regard  BaFin provides fintech companies with information concerning supervisory issues on its website.There is no special public funding instrument for fintech companies  but the German Ministry of Economics has set up the programme 'INVEST' to help start-ups raise venture capital. If business angels purchase shares of newly founded innovative companies and hold them for more than three years  20 per cent of their original investment will be reimbursed by the state up to a limit of €100 000.16 To qualify for the programme  investors have to spend at least €10 000. Invested capital must not result from a third-party loan to the investor. Furthermore  the business angel has to participate in the new company's gains and losses. Investors must be natural persons living in the European Economic Area (EEA) or must use special investment companies registered in Germany (e.g.  the limited liability company  GmbH).Generally speaking  German regulatory authorities and the government emphasise that they recognise the potential of fintech for public economic benefit  while the regulation partly still seems rather conservative when the traditional regulatory standards  which stem from the pre-digitalisation era  are applied (although the efforts of BaFin to support fintech companies by offering detailed legal information and by improving the communication channels  as well as recent legislative changes concerning the regulatory requirements for cryptoasset-related services  are evident). The current dynamics in the field of regulating digital finance  blockchain and cryptoassets  both at the EU and a national level  indicates that the legal framework relevant for fintech companies has gained material momentum and may be expected to further evolve quite fast.The potential of digitalisation has not only been recognised by the participants in the financial industry  but also by central regulators for the purposes of the monetary system. In particular  the Governing Council of the European Central Bank (ECB) has decided to work on the development of a digital euro  which would be an electronic form of a legal tender  introduced for the use by natural persons and firms alongside cash.17 In July 2021  the Governing Council of the ECB decided to launch the investigation phase of the digital euro project  which started in October 2021 and will last two years. It remains to be seen what the outcome of the investigation phase will be and whether the path towards a digital euro will be pursued.18Regulationi Licensing and marketingThe general rules apply to licensing and marketing of fintech companies in Germany. Because there is no specific fintech licence available in Germany  the regulation of fintech companies depends ultimately on the business they carry out. This again results from the technology-neutral 'same business  same risk  same rules' approach. The entire array of licences and marketing restrictions may therefore become relevant for fintech business models.In particular  the following types of licences have to be taken into account:licence pursuant to Section 32(1) of the Banking Act (KWG) for providing banking businesses within the meaning of Section 1(1)  sentence 2 of the KWG; licence pursuant to Section 15(1) of the recently introduced Securities Institutions Act (WpIG) implementing Directive (EU) 2019/2034 on the prudential supervision of investment firms or pursuant to Section 32(1) of the KWG for providing financial services within the meaning of Section 2(2) of the WpIG and Section 1(1a)  sentence 2 of the KWG (including  since 1 January 2020  the crypto custody business within the meaning of Section 1(1a)  sentence 2  No. 6 of the KWG  which is of particular relevance for fintech companies); licence pursuant to Section 10(1) of the Payment Services Supervisory Act (ZAG) for providing payment services or pursuant to Section 11 of the ZAG for the issuance of e-money; licence pursuant to Section 20(1) of the Capital Investment Code (KAGB) or  less burdensome  the mere registration pursuant to Section 44(1) of the KAGB for offering collective asset/funds management; licence pursuant to Sections 34c  34d and 34f of the Industrial Code (GewO) for the brokerage of loans  insurance contracts and certain financial products; and licence pursuant to Section 8(1) of the Insurance Supervisory Act for conducting insurance business.In addition  the EU-wide Regulation (EU) 2020/1503 on European crowdfunding service providers for business (ECSPR) has applied since November 2021; this requires crowdfunding services providers to obtain authorisation from the national supervisory authority (in Germany  BaFin).Under German law  a licence requirement is generally triggered if one intends to provide  in Germany  commercially  or on a scale that requires commercially  organised business undertaking one of the services listed in the comprehensive catalogues of regulated activities referred to above. Consequently  it needs to be carefully analysed whether a fintech business model falls within the scope of one or several of these regulated services.Depending on the type of licence  different authorities might be competent to grant the relevant licence. Placing the competent authorities in a hierarchy  the ECB is at the top with its competence for granting licences for institutions that intend to carry out banking business that includes lending and deposit-taking business and for most systemic investment firms. Beneath the ECB  BaFin is the competent authority for institutions that intend to provide banking business except for lending and deposit taking  including investment services (other than most systemic investment firms) and other financial services  payment services  collective asset or funds management and insurance business. The third level in the hierarchy would consist of the authorities that have been endowed under the German federal state laws with the competence to grant licences pursuant to the GewO.All these types of licences may become relevant for fintech business models. This can be illustrated by the observation that 'fintech banks' were established in Germany as institutions holding a banking licence granted by ECB.Both the requirements to obtain a licence under the German financial supervisory laws and subsequent ongoing legal requirements depend on the type of licence. For instance  the requirements to obtain a licence pursuant to Section 15(1) of the WpIG for providing investment brokerage or investment advice are less tight than obtaining a licence pursuant to Section 32(1) of the KWG for guarantee or for safe custody business. In this regard  it makes a significant difference for regulatory purposes whether an institution is entitled to hold funds or assets for its clients because in this case the regulatory requirements are stricter and more comprehensive.The licence requirement for the crypto custody business  introduced under the KWG in 2020  may be considered the first fintech-specific or at least fintech-focused licence requirement under German law. The corresponding changes to the KWG were made in the course of the implementation of the Fifth EU Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Directive19 but without the legal necessity under EU law to make such changes to the KWG. The relevant Section 1(1a)  sentence 2  No. 6 of the KWG defines crypto custody business as custody  management and safeguarding of crypto values or private cryptographic keys used to hold  store or transfer crypto values as a service for others. Cryptographic values  which are now explicitly included in the catalogue of financial instruments under Section 1(11)  sentence 1  No. 10 of the KWG  are defined as digital representations of value that are not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or a public authority  do not possess statutory status of currency or money  but are accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of exchange or payment  or that serve investment purposes and that can be transferred  stored and traded electronically. Consequently  the term crypto value includes not only cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin  but also investment tokens. The broad definition of the terms 'crypto value' and 'crypto custody business' (including the activities relating to private cryptographic keys) results in a wide scope of the new licence requirement. The KWG  however  provides for certain relief insofar as crypto custody service providers focusing on this type of financial service (i.e.  that do not carry out any other regulated activities) do not have to meet all regulatory obligations applying to other providers of financial services. Instead  these crypto custody service providers are exempted from the general capital and liquidity requirements under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) 20 recently amended by CRR II21 and some other rules. However  the requirements on the initial capital  reputation of the board members  proper business organisation and related reporting obligations do apply. Further guidance with respect to crypto custody business has been provided by BaFin.22At the same time  the licensing regime that may apply to fintech business models is constantly evolving in the EU and so in Germany. This includes the changes of the licensing regime relevant for fintech businesses as introduced by the new EU legislation on European crowdfunding service providers for business (the ECSPR)  which also required changes to the German legal framework  the proposed EU Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation (MiCA) and the recent legislation on securities dematerialisation.23 Although it would exceed the given framework to elaborate on the licence requirements for every single fintech-relevant business model  it may be worth illustrating the licence requirement by reference to the robo-advice business model  as these have become popular in Germany in recent years.Generally speaking  a robo-adviser might be subject to a licence requirement pursuant to Section 15(1) of the WpIG  in particular to provide investment brokerage  investment advice or portfolio management services. BaFin will only grant the necessary licence if  among other requirements  the applicant has at least €75 000 at its free disposal 24 if its managing directors are professionally qualified and with an impeccable reputation and if the applicant can prove that proper risk management will be in place when the regulated business will be commenced.By way of exception from this general licence requirement under the WpIG  investment brokerage and investment advice may be provided under the less restrictive licence pursuant to Section 34f of the GewO; however  only specific financial products may be brokered or recommended under this privileged licence  which is granted not by BaFin but by the competent authorities in accordance with the laws of the relevant federal state. An additional exception is available for tied agents who closely cooperate with a licensed institution.When robo-advisory models were introduced  some of the service providers offered robo-advice in the form of investment brokerage by connecting the supply of specific financial products to customers' demand for financial instruments. These models try to implement a structure where the client stays in charge of the investment process so that they make the ultimate decision to buy or sell a financial instrument. There is  however  a thin line between investment brokerage and investment advice. Although BaFin did not pursue a strict approach until 2017  it then made clear that a robo-adviser provides investment advice if clients could get the impression that the investment proposals presented by the robo-adviser are tailored to their individual circumstances.25 The distinction between both types of investment services becomes relevant for the type of licence that is required and  in practice  more important  with respect to the requirements with which the robo-adviser must comply in offering its services. In particular  the suitability report that an investment adviser must prepare and that aims to show how the recommended financial products suit the needs of the client26 is  for many robo-advisers  a bureaucratic obstacle they would like to avoid.Both the stricter position of BaFin and the preference not to prepare a suitability report for each investment have led to many robo-advisers becoming licensed as portfolio managers.27 Providing this type of investment service  however  involves the obligation to adhere to a comprehensive set of rules of conduct so that robo-advisers must thoroughly analyse which route suits them best and which type of licence they need for their individual business model.With respect to marketing regulations applicable to fintech companies in Germany  the general rule is that marketing must be fair  transparent and not misleading. These principles follow from the Act against Unfair Competition but are also included in some of the statutory provisions for financial services.28 Whether additional rules have to be taken into account depends primarily on the understanding of the term 'marketing'.As far as marketing for investment services within the meaning of Section 2(8) of the Securities Trading Act (WpHG) is concerned (including investment brokerage  investment advice  portfolio management and underwriting business)  it is rather difficult to distinguish marketing from the rules of conduct for service providers set out in  inter alia  Section 63 et seq. of the WpHG and a regulation promulgated thereunder (the Regulation specifying the rules of conduct and organisational requirements for investment services companies (WpDVerOV))  but also in various delegated regulations promulgated under the second Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II).29 These require that offerors of investment services provide their potential clients with mandatory information regarding  for instance  their products (e.g.  key information sheets)  potential conflicts of interest and inducements  and that they obtain certain information from their clients. Further  investment service providers must comply with detailed requirements set out in the Minimum Requirements for the Compliance Function and Additional Requirements governing Rules of Conduct  Organisation and Transparency (MaComp)  which have been promulgated by BaFin.Similar rules as for investment services apply to the marketing of funds under Section 298 et seq. of the KAGB. The information obligations for professional or semi-professional clients are less comprehensive than those for retail clients.Regarding marketing for payment services  a comprehensive set of pre-contractual information obligations is provided for in the German Civil Code (BGB) in conjunction with Article 248 of the Introductory Act to the BGB (EGBGB).Further  marketing for certain fintech-related services might entail the obligation to publish a prospectus. This obligation may be triggered once a public offer for securities or financial assets has been made in accordance with the Prospectus Act (WpPG) or the Asset Investment Act (VermAnlG)  unless an exemption under the ECSPR applies.Fintech companies in Germany should therefore check whether marketing for their business might be captured by one of the comprehensive legal regimes for marketing.ii Cross-border issuesAs a general rule  the German regulations apply to each service provider conducting its business in Germany. This means that the rules – particularly the licensing requirement – not only apply if the service provider has its registered office in Germany  but also if it actively targets the German market cross-border.30Pure accessibility of the relevant services via the internet in Germany may be considered sufficient to assume that a service provider is actively targeting the German market. The regulations apply if the offeror of the relevant services intends the service to be used by German customers among users of different nationalities.31 If a service provider maintains its website in German  this is considered to be a strong indication of actively targeting the German market.If  however  the provision of regulated services cross-border is concerned  the privilege to notify German regulators of existing licences from a home Member State within the EEA might offer an exception from this general rule  which may appear very strict at the first glance. The European 'passport' has been introduced for many regulated services  such as certain types of banking business  investment services as set out in Annex 1 of MiFID II  payment services and  recently  by way of the ECSPR  crowdfunding services. If a service provider has been licensed in its EEA-home Member State  it may notify its competent supervisory authority of its intent to also offer the regulated services in Germany.32 Generally speaking  the service provider may commence the regulated business without a separate licence in Germany either on a cross-border basis or through a branch once the competent supervisory authority in the home Member State has informed BaFin  which subsequently has confirmed that the service provider may commence its business in Germany. In this scenario  the supervisory authority in the home Member State is generally responsible for the supervision of the service provider's activities in Germany  subject to certain residual competences of BaFin and the German Federal Bank. Following the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU (and the lapse of the transition period on 31 December 2020) licensed UK companies active in the fintech business may no longer use the EU passport to offer their services in other Member States (and vice versa) and generally need to establish a subsidiary in Germany or another EU Member State to obtain a licence and comply with EU regulatory requirements  basically as any third-country licensed institution.Another possibility for fintech companies to access the German market without being subject to a licence requirement is to cooperate with a licensed service provider  typically a bank. These ventures are 'white label structures' where a regulated entity (fronting bank) effectively makes available its licence for the business activities of a third party. For this purpose  the third party must subordinate its business to the bank's management by granting instruction and control rights to the bank  which for regulatory purposes is responsible for the regulated services.Digital identity and onboardingTo date  there is no generally recognised digital identity available in Germany. However  it is possible to identify oneself electronically via the internet if the requirements of the eIDAS Regulation33 are met. Details relating to this have been provided for in the Act on Trust Services.Regarding the onboarding process as required under the statutory AML and counterterrorism rules  the Anti-Money Laundering Code (GwG)  which was revised as part of the implementation of the Fifth EU AML Directive  includes various possibilities for remote identification. However  non-face-to-face business relationships or transactions may indicate higher AML risks34 and thus may trigger enhanced customer due diligence requirements. BaFin has published the standards for video identification35 as well as its guidance on the interpretation of the GwG 36 which are generally rather strict.Possibly  solutions enabling the creation and management of a digital identity will be available in the EU and therefore also in Germany in the future. At the EU level  efforts can be observed within the European Self-Sovereign Identity Framework to develop solutions that could allow EU citizens to create and use their digital identity and that would be compatible with the eIDAS electronic identification framework. A corresponding initiative is also pursued in Germany within the project IDunion.37Digital markets  payment services and fundingInnovative funding solutions and business models related to payment services are typical areas in which fintech companies conduct business in Germany. Regulators have been struggling for some years to find a position on collective investment schemes balancing regulation to protect investors  in particular retail investors  and to allow innovative solutions that may also serve retail investors' interests. Eventually  both EU and German legislators concluded that the regulatory requirements applicable to investment business models shall generally (subject to limited privileges) also apply to collective investment schemes. Similarly  with regard to digital markets in general  the German legislator and BaFin apply the technology-neutral principle of 'same business  same risk  same regulation'. Therefore  the exact scope of the applicable requirements  in particular the assessment of whether a licence requirement under the KWG or the WpIG may be triggered  generally requires an in-depth analysis on the specific business model and should be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.At the same time  in light of this common 'same business  same risk  same regulation' approach  certain significant legislative developments have recently taken place. The implementation of the Fifth EU AML Directive into German law at the beginning of 2020 provided a certain level of clarity on the regulatory qualification of activities in the cryptocurrency or cryptoassets business. As part of the implementation package  the German federal legislator introduced a legal definition of 'crypto values' and explicitly included these in the catalogue of financial instruments under the KWG.38 In line with the Fifth EU AML Directive  the statutory definition of crypto values is broad in scope so that all potential uses of virtual currencies  including as a means of investment  are covered. On the international level  these various types of virtual units of value  also described as coins or tokens  are often referred to collectively as 'cryptoassets'.39In September 2020  the European Commission published the EU Digital Finance Package40 aiming to develop the digital single market  promote innovation and growth of fintech start-ups and adjust the existing regulatory regime to new technologies such as AI and blockchain. In essence  the EU Digital Finance Package consists of:a retail payments strategy to facilitate payments in shops and e-commerce; the proposal for an EU-wide directly applicable regulation on digital resilience for the financial sector addressing cybersecurity and ICT-related risks; legislative proposals for an EU markets in cryptoassets regulation (MiCA); and an EU-level pilot regime for market infrastructures based on distributed ledger technology.In the field of crowdfunding  in October 2020 the EU legislator adopted an EU-wide regulation setting out a comprehensive regulatory regime for EU crowdfunding service providers for business  the ECSPR  which has become directly applicable in all EU Member States as a unified EU standard for lending-based and equity-based crowdfunding since November 2021.In Germany  recent key developments relevant for digital markets include recent legislation providing for the optional partial dematerialisation of securities. For more details concerning the new rules and proposals referred to above  see Section V.i Peer-to-peer-lendingWhether and which regulatory rules apply for peer-to-peer-lending depends on the specific business model. Crowdfunding based on donations the investors make to support a special project (crowd-sponsoring) is generally not subject to financial regulation. If  however  the investor benefits financially from his or her investment; for example  by participating in future profits of the project (crowd investing) or by being reimbursed with or without interest (crowd-lending)  special regulations apply.41 These regulations may be distinguished as falling under supervisory law  consumer law and capital market law. Since 10 November 2021  the special regime for crowdfunding service providers under the ECSPR and the corresponding provisions of the German law have applied.Supervisory lawPeer-to-peer lending in the form of crowd investing or crowd-lending may entail consequences under financial supervisory law for the lender  the borrower and the platform.42 The key concern relates to possible licensing requirements. In particular  the licensing requirement for lending business must be considered.43 A licence requirement is triggered if the lender acts commercially or in a manner that requires a commercially established business operation. It is sufficient if the lender intends to repeatedly engage in the lending business to make profits.The taking of deposits commercially or on a scale that requires a commercially established business operation is also subject to a licensing requirement.44 These requirements may become relevant for all involved parties; for example  the platform if it keeps the funds extended by the lenders until the funds are transferred to a single or several borrowers. If the platform performs this function and transfers funds from the investors to the borrowers  the platform may also be subject to a licensing requirement under the ZAG for providing payment services. The licensing requirement under the KWG may become relevant for the investors who provide the funds extended to a single or various borrowers too. Even the borrowers may be subject to a licensing requirement for conducting the deposit-taking business when they receive the funds from the platform or the investors.Given these regulatory restrictions  peer-to-peer-lending business models in Germany typically include a fronting bank that holds a licence for the lending and deposit-taking business. In these models  the fronting bank extends the loans to the borrowers  and the bank refinances the loans by selling the repayment claims arising under them to the platform for on-selling to investors or directly to investors who ultimately receive the repayment claim against the borrower. The various business transactions between the involved parties relating to the extension of a loan are interdependent by way of conditions precedent. Therefore  the bank is only obliged to extend the loan if investors have committed to provide sufficient funds for the purchase of the repayment claims arising under the loan. The platform  which is typically a fintech company  is acting in this model as a broker that brings together investors and borrowers.This structure is usually not critical for the investors as they only acquire a repayment claim  which is not subject to a licensing requirement  provided that the acquisitions do not occur under a framework agreement. In the latter case  a licensing requirement for providing factoring business could be triggered.45 For the borrowers  this model is not problematic either. One might consider whether they engage in deposit-taking business. However  it is generally recognised under German law that borrowing funds from a licensed bank does not constitute deposit-taking. The fronting bank has in this model the necessary licences so the remaining question is whether the platform performs business activities subject to a licence requirement. The platform might conduct the factoring business if it acquires the repayment claims from the bank prior to selling them on to investors. Usually  however  the factoring business can be avoided by certain structural arrangements. In this case  the regulated activities of the platform consist of brokering loans (between the bank and the borrowers) and investments (between the platform or the bank and investors as purchasers of the repayment claims). These are activities that can be structured to avoid regulation under the KWG and the WpIG and to ensure that 'only' the licence requirements under Sections 34c and 34f of the GewO need to be met. BaFin considers the repayment claims brokered by the platform to be financial assets within the meaning of the VermAnlG and  therefore  financial instruments within the meaning of the WpIG  so that  in principle  the brokering activity could also be subject to a licensing requirement pursuant to Section 15(1) of the WpIG  which is  however  typically avoided by taking advantage of an exception.New crowdfunding regulatory regimeSince November 2021  crowdfunding service providers in the EU have been subject to a single regulatory regime set out in the ECSPR. The key notion of the ECSPR is the 'crowdfunding service' defined as the matching of business funding interests of investors and project owners through the use of a crowdfunding platform and which consists of the facilitation of granting loans or placing without a firm commitment basis  as referred to in MiFID II  of transferable securities and admitted instruments for crowdfunding purposes issued by project owners or a special purpose vehicle  and the reception and transmission of client orders in relation to those transferable securities and admitted instruments for crowdfunding purposes.The following are outside the scope of the ECSPR:crowdfunding services provided to project owners that are consumers (consumer loans are already subject to a separate regulatory regime provided for in the Consumer Credit Directive);46 services related to crowdfunding services provided in accordance with national laws; and crowdfunding offers with consideration thresholds exceeding €5 million calculated over 12 months.In this regard  the EU Prospectus Regulation47 has been amended accordingly so that the obligation to publish a prospectus does not apply to an offer of securities to the public from a crowdfunding service provider authorised under the ECSPR provided that it does not exceed the above threshold. A respective clarifying provision referencing the exemption under the EU Prospectus Regulation has been included in the German WpPG.Pursuant to the ECSPR  crowdfunding services providers need to apply for authorisation from the national supervisory authority in their EU Member State and shall be registered in a European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) register comprising all operating crowdfunding platforms. The ECSPR sets out unified requirements on the provision of crowdfunding services  including prudential requirements (safeguards of generally no less than €25 000)  effective and prudent management  minimum due diligence requirements in respect of project owners to be offered on the crowdfunding platform and requirements on complaints handling and conflicts of interest. ESMA has published 12 draft regulatory technical standards under the ECSPR on matters such as complaints handling  conflicts of interest  application for authorisation  key investment information and information and reporting obligations  which are currently in the consultation stage.It is expected that the ECSPR will facilitate the development of crowdfunding platforms and the provision of cross-border crowdfunding services. It remains to be seen how the ECSPR will impact crowdfunding business in the future.Consumer lawIn Germany  as in the European Union generally  relatively strict consumer protection rules apply. This is also the case for consumer loans. Consequently  a direct contract between the lender and the borrower brokered by a peer-to-peer lending platform triggers far-reaching information obligations for the lender under Section 491 et seq. of the BGB  provided that the lender acts commercially and the borrower is a consumer. Given the typical structure for peer-to-peer lending platforms in Germany  the fronting bank implemented in the structure must typically comply with these obligations.Further  given that peer-to-peer lending platforms typically offer their services online  the consumer protection rules on distance selling must be considered (Section 312a et seq. of the BGB). These rules are based on EU law and should in general not differ between EU Member States.Additional statutory provisions aimed to protect consumer interests were recently promulgated and have already become applicable or will become effective shortly. These provisions include  in particular  specific rules for the sale of digital products and increased information obligations for online marketplaces.Capital market lawGenerally speaking  from the German capital market point of view  the WpPG and the VermAnlG have to be considered.The VermAnlG generally applies to profit participating loans and subordinated loans and all other investments that grant a claim to interest and repayment. If these investments are publicly offered  a prospectus or at least an information sheet concerning the investment must be published  unless certain exceptions apply. The VermAnlG does not apply to a public offer by a crowdfunding service provider authorised under the ECSPR provided that it does not exceed the above-mentioned €5 million threshold. Further  under Section 2a of the VermAnlG  the obligation to publish a prospectus does not apply to investments that are only brokered via the internet and do not exceed low thresholds ranging from €1 000 to €10 000 per investment (however  even if this exception applies  an information sheet must be published).In the case of public offer of securities within the meaning of the WpPG  a prospectus must  subject to certain limited exceptions  also be published. However  as mentioned above  the obligation to publish a prospectus does not apply to an offer of securities to the public from a crowdfunding service provider authorised under the ECSPR  provided that it does not exceed the €5 million threshold.The WpPG obligations have not yet gained material significance in the German fintech market  except for the very few fintech companies that have used securitisation to refinance. This might change in the future owing to the rise of initial coin offerings (ICOs).48ii Payment servicesThe payment services sector was one of the first in the German financial industry in which fintech companies became active and visible. This is one of the reasons for fragmentation of the payment services market  which has recently begun to consolidate. Significant changes from the fintech perspective came with the second Payment Services Directive (PSD II) 49 implemented into German law at the beginning of 2018. The revised payment services regime has offered new business opportunities  especially for nimble fintech companies. The reason behind this was that account information services and payment initiation services as new payment services were introduced under the revised ZAG. The providers of these services have been granted a legal claim for access to payment accounts against the banks that maintain these payment accounts for their customers. This has been perceived as a game changer insofar as traditional banks can no longer prevent their competitors from accessing the accounts of customers who consent to this access (open banking). However  experiences so far suggest that providing the required application programming interfaces is a time-consuming process. In addition  some market observers have criticised credit institutions for using the PSD II rules as an instrument to prevent competition by fintechs (e.g.  by no longer offering the previously established connections via the German independent online banking protocol (FinTS)).Further business opportunities have come with additional regulatory burdens. Providing payment services is generally subject to a licence requirement  unless certain exceptions apply. The scope of this licence requirement extends to providers of account information and payment initiation services even though these service providers do not acquire possession of their customers' funds at any time. On account of this consideration  the regulatory requirements for a licence to provide payment initiation or account information services are less strict than for a licence to provide traditional payment services.The revised ZAG aims to foster technological innovation and competition on the payment market.50 Under the relevant provisions (Section 58a of the ZAG) – which have been labelled by some market observers as 'Lex Apple Pay' – payment services providers and e-money issuers have been granted the right to obtain access to certain key technical infrastructure. 'System companies' contributing through technical infrastructure services to the provision of payment services or the conduct of e-money business in Germany are obliged  upon request of a payment services provider or e-money issuer  to make these technical infrastructure services available and provide necessary access against consideration and without undue delay. The obligation does not apply if the relevant technical infrastructure is used by no more than 10 payment services providers or e-money issuers or if the company has no more than 2 million registered users. The company may also deny access for objective reasons; for example  if the security and integrity of the technical infrastructure services would be jeopardised. The recent statutory rules are not based on EU law and are considered to be a reaction to some system providers refusing to open their systems to facilitate more competition in the area of mobile payments.Cryptocurrencies  initial coin offerings (ICO) and security tokensi CryptocurrenciesCryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have undoubtedly created a challenge for the German law from regulatory  civil law and tax perspectives. Certain clarity has been achieved by the legal definition of crypto values (such as Bitcoin) in connection with the implementation of the Fifth EU AML Directive into German law in 2020. Crypto values are now included in the catalogue of financial instruments under the KWG and the WpIG so that various activities relating to crypto values are clearly within the scope of certain licence requirements. Further  the crypto custody business has been introduced as a new type of financial service  which is subject to a licence requirement under the KWG.Crypto values are defined as digital representations of a value that is not issued or guaranteed by a central bank or public authority and does not possess a statutory status of currency or money  but that is accepted by natural or legal persons as a means of exchange or payment  or that serves investment purposes and that can be transferred  stored and traded electronically. This broad definition is aimed at comprising all uses of virtual currencies  including as a means of investment. So far  the definition of crypto values includes not only tokens with exchange and payment functions (including cryptocurrencies)  which may fall under the scope of financial instruments as the 'units of account' within the meaning of Section 1(11)  sentence 1  No. 7 of the KWG and Section 2(5)  No. 7 of the WpIG  but also tokens used for investment. These security or investment tokens may also qualify as investment products  debt instruments or units in collective investment schemes under Section 1(11)  sentence 1  Nos. 2  3 or 5 of the KWG and Section 2(5)  Nos. 2  3 or 5 of the WpIG.51Not covered by the definition of crypto values are domestic and foreign legal tender  electronic money  monetary value stored on payment instruments falling under the limited network exemption within the meaning of PSD II and payment transactions of providers of electronic communications networks or services.52 Also not covered are electronic vouchers for the purchase of goods or services from the issuer or a third party that are intended to have an economic function in relation to the issuer only through redemption and that are therefore not tradable and  as a result of their design  do not reflect investor-like expectations regarding the performance of the voucher or the general business performance of the issuer or a third party in terms of value or accounting.53The amendments with respect to crypto values reflect  to a certain extent  the previous administrative practice of BaFin that took the first steps towards the regulation of cryptocurrencies in Germany by adopting a broad interpretation of the term 'financial instrument' within the meaning of the KWG. This approach was partially criticised and not shared in a ruling of a higher regional court in criminal proceedings.54The recent changes of the KWG  which subsequently have been reflected in the WpIG  have resolved the controversy on the qualification of cryptocurrencies as financial instruments and have  in doing so  contributed to more legal clarity. However  the German legislator only changed the definition of 'financial instrument' for the purpose of the licensing requirement but not with regard to the conduct rules set out in the WpHG  which effectively reflect the MiFID II provisions. Therefore  a service provider operating a marketplace for cryptocurrencies may fall within the licence requirement for an operator of multilateral trading facilities within the meaning of the KWG and WpIG but may not be obliged to adhere to the rules of conduct set out for these operators in the WpHG.Against this background  one should thoroughly analyse the legal risks related to relevant business models and assess whether and which licence requirements and conduct rules may apply. In particular  buying and purchasing cryptocurrencies in the service provider's own name for the account of others may constitute banking business in the form of principal brokering business.55 Further  brokering cryptocurrencies may constitute for licensing purposes investment brokerage 56 whereas advising on the purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies may be considered investment advice.57 Also  the operation of a platform on which cryptocurrencies can be traded may qualify as a multilateral trading platform within the meaning of Section 2(2)  No. 6 of the WpIG and may  therefore  be subject to a licence requirement.58 The activity involving custody  management and safeguarding of crypto values or private cryptographic keys may also fall within the scope of the recently regulated crypto custody business. This new type of financial service and the related licence requirement may be relevant for domestic companies as well as cross-border service providers and their agents that intend to offer  or have already been offering  these services.59However  neither the mining nor the purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies in one's own name and for one's own account is subject to a licence requirement. Therefore  cryptocurrencies may generally be used as means of payment and generated by mining without any special permission.From a civil law perspective  many questions have not yet definitively been answered. The uncertainty starts with the applicable jurisdiction and laws generally for a cryptocurrency. These questions become relevant if  for instance  cryptocurrency units are transferred or pledged. Further  it is still unclear which disclosure and information obligations apply in cryptocurrency transactions.Interestingly  the usually complex tax analysis has at least partly been clarified for cryptocurrencies through a decision by the European Court of Justice.60According to the principles of this decision that were incorporated into German tax law 61 exchanging regular currencies into Bitcoin (or comparable cryptocurrencies) and vice versa shall be tax-free with respect to value added tax according to Section 4  No. 8b of the Turnover Tax Code. In addition  using Bitcoin or comparable cryptocurrencies as payment and the process of mining are tax-free.Other transactions concerning cryptocurrencies may  however  be affected by tax law.From an accounting perspective  cryptocurrency units such as Bitcoin are transferable so that it appears necessary to account for them as assets on the balance sheet.If they qualify as assets that support the business for only a short period (current assets)  they may have to be recorded as 'other assets' according to Section 266(2)  B II  No. 4 of the Commercial Code (HGB).62 If the cryptocurrency units qualify as assets that support the business for a long period (fixed assets) they should be accounted for as acquired immaterial assets according to Section 266(2)  A I  No. 2 of the HGB.63ii Initial coin offeringsICOs are sales of virtual tokens to raise funds for general corporate purposes or a specific project typically described in more detail in a white paper. Depending on the structure of the ICO  tokens may be bought with regular or virtual currencies and may grant specific rights  such as participation rights and profit shares  or no right at all. While the discussions and structures of ICOs and tokens are still in flux  tokens that can be offered in an ICO may be categorised as follows:cryptocurrency tokens are meant to pay for goods or services external to the platform or not only exclusively between the platform and its users but also between users; utility tokens are supposed to convey some functional utility to token holders other than or in addition to payment for goods or services  in the form of access to a product or service. These tokens come with particular rights  such as a right of access to a future service  a right to redeem the token for another token or service or voting rights  which are often designed to shape the functionality of the product; and security tokens are comparable to traditional securities set out in Article 4(1)(44) of MiFID II  such as conventional debt or equity instruments.64This rough categorisation – which corresponds to the general approach pursued by BaFin – illustrates that tokens may differ significantly. Following the amendments to the KWG  as from 1 January 2020  tokens with exchange and payment functions and tokens used for investment (for example  security tokens and investment tokens) are likely to fall within the broad definition of cryptographic values and thus constitute financial instruments under the KWG (aside from possible classification of these tokens as other types of financial instruments  which is to be assessed on a case-by-case basis) and the WpIG.65Consequently  each ICO must be thoroughly analysed with respect to its regulatory and capital market requirements. BaFin determines the applicability of the relevant legislation  including the KWG  the WpIG  the ZAG  the WpPG  the KAGB and the VermAnlG  case by case  depending on the specific contractual arrangements. Where tokens resemble participation rights that might be classified as securities under the WpPG or capital investments under the VermAnlG  a prospectus for the marketing of the tokens may be required unless an exemption  especially for crowdfunding services under the ECSPR  applies.The issue of fully digitalised offerings of securities has been the subject matter of extensive discussions in recent years and was supported through a joint paper published by the German Federal Ministry of Finance and the German Federal Ministry of Justice concerning the future regulatory framework for blockchain-based securities and crypto-tokens.66 In light of the objectives pursued by this paper  the German legislator adopted a new law (the Act on Electronic Securities (eWpG)  in force as from June 2021)  which introduced optional and partial dematerialisation of securities. The eWpG introduces the notion of an 'electronic security' defined as a property object that is subject of a right in rem. The new law gives the issuers the choice between two types of dematerialised securities. The first type is subject to registration with a central securities depository within the meaning of the Central Securities Depository Regulation67 (Clearstream Banking AG in Germany) or with a licensed custodian. The second type are crypto securities  registered in a crypto securities registry  typically based on DLT  kept by the issuers themselves or by other entities. In this regard  keeping crypto securities registries requires a licence from BaFin and is subject to the regulatory supervision. With this step  the German legislator is following the path of other European countries towards securities dematerialisation.68In addition to a prospectus requirement  any professional service provided in connection with the trading of tokens – including an agreement to acquire  or the sale or purchase of tokens  when qualified as units of account or crypto values – would  as a general rule  require a licence from BaFin.69 Further  issuers of tokens should be aware that consumer protection laws might apply to the sale of tokens via the internet. So  the underlying contract may qualify as a distance contract resulting in information obligations according to Section 312(i) of the BGB. Provided that the contract is considered as a financial service  further information must be provided according to Section 312(d) of the BGB.70At the EU level  the issue of cryptoassets and  thus  also ICOs  has been recently addressed by the European Commission as part of the EU Digital Finance Package published in September 2020.71 The Commission submitted a proposal for an EU-wide directly applicable regulation on markets in cryptoassets (MiCA). The proposal generally applies a comprehensive full harmonisation approach  including a unified regime on: transparency and disclosure requirements for the issuance and admission to trading  operation  organisation and governance of issuers and in-scope service providers; consumer protection rules; preventing market abuse and ensuring integrity of cryptoassets markets. The proposal differentiates between the categories of cryptoassets  including cryptoassets (as such)  asset-referenced tokens (often referred to as 'stablecoins')  electronic money tokens and utility tokens. Generally  all cryptoassets (defined as digital representation of value or rights that may be transferred and stored electronically  using DLT or similar technology) shall be in the scope of MiCA if not already covered by the existing EU financial services regime (e.g.  as financial instruments under MiFID II). Regulated cryptoasset services shall include custody and administration on behalf of third parties  operation of a trading platform  exchange of cryptoassets for fiat currency that is legal tender and for other cryptoassets  execution of orders on behalf of third parties  placing  reception and transmission of orders on behalf of third parties and providing advice. Certain relief  including exemption from the rather detailed white paper requirement  shall apply to small and medium issuers where the total consideration of an offer to the public does not exceed €1 million over 12 months. Stringent requirements shall generally apply to stablecoins.MiCA is expected to provide legal clarity and certainty  promote safe development of cryptoassets and the use of DLT in financial services  support competition and innovation while protecting consumers and investors and address potential financial stability and monetary risks. In addition  the proposal is expected to increase the funding of companies through ICOs and securities token offerings.EU-wide regulation of cryptoassets  which are the major application of DLT and blockchain technology in finance  goes hand in hand with the proposed EU-level pilot blockchain sandbox regime. As part of the EU Digital Finance Package  the European Commission proposed EU regulation for market infrastructures based on DLT. The proposed regulation  if adopted  will provide rules for a pan-European blockchain regulatory sandbox aimed at allowing fintech companies active in the field of DLT and blockchain technology to benefit from temporary derogation of regulatory requirements under regulatory supervision ensuring the keeping of appropriate safeguards and it will enable the regulators to deepen their understanding of the innovative fintech models and emerging technologies.iii Money laundering rulesTokens and cryptocurrencies in general are perceived as highly susceptible to money laundering and terrorism financing. In this respect  a certain clarity with regard to the applicability of the AML regime has been provided by the law implementing the Fifth EU AML Directive in Germany  in force since 1 January 2020. As outlined above  the law introduced a broad definition of crypto values and classified them as financial instruments under the KWG and the WpIG. In principle  the scope of the definition generally includes tokens with exchange and payment functions (e.g.  cryptocurrencies) and tokens used for investment (e.g.  security tokens and investment tokens).72 This generally means that services concerning cryptocurrencies and tokens – for instance  buying and purchasing cryptocurrencies in the service provider's own name for the account of others  advising on the purchase or sale of cryptocurrencies or operation of a platform on which cryptocurrencies can be traded – may fall under the scope of regulated services and require a KWG licence for  in particular  principal brokering business 73 investment brokerage 74 investment advice75 or operation of a multilateral trading platform.76 In addition  the management and safeguarding of crypto values or private cryptographic keys may require obtaining a KWG licence if other general statutory prerequisites under the KWG (in essence  commercial character or a scale that requires a commercially organised business undertaking) are fulfilled. Services providers whose activities fall within the scope of KWG or WpIG licence requirements are obliged entities within the meaning of the GwG and must  therefore  adhere to the duties set out therein. These include the obligation to conduct adequate customer due diligence  to implement adequate risk management systems aimed at preventing money laundering and terrorism financing and  as appropriate  notifying the Financial Intelligence Unit of any suspect transactions as well as fulfilling respective reporting obligations in relation to the transparency register. Nonetheless  even prior to the implementation of the Fifth EU AML Directive into German law  cryptocurrency and ICO service providers were often required to obtain a KWG licence and  as a result  comply with the German AML requirements. This was owing to the broad interpretation of the term 'financial instrument' within the meaning of the KWG according to BaFin's previous administrative practice.77Even aside from the significant developments concerning the licensing regime under which certain new entities involved in the fintech business may require a licence from BaFin and  thus  become – as obliged entities – subject to the AML requirements  the AML regime is also constantly evolving. Pursuant to its action plan for a comprehensive EU policy on preventing money laundering and terrorist financing of May 2020 78 in July 2021 the European Commission published an AML/countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) package 79 which includes proposals for three EU-wide regulations and a directive. In addition to establishing an EU AML/CFT authority with direct supervisory powers over some of the riskiest cross-border financial sector obliged entities  the package aims to ensure that various types of cryptoasset and crowdfunding service providers  as well as mortgage credit intermediaries and consumer credit providers  become obliged entities subject to the AML/CFT regime. The package further provides for a recast of Regulation (EU) 2015/847 on information accompanying transfers of funds (i.e.  the Wire Transfer Regulation (WTR))  which shall also apply to the transfer of cryptoassets. As far as the latter is concerned  the German Federal Ministry of Finance issued the interim German Crypto Asset Transfer Regulation (CATR) to ensure the traceability of cryptoasset transfers until the WTR revisions come into force. The CATR provides for duties of care applicable to institutions and branches seated in Germany that are engaged in conducting cryptoasset transfers. It entered into force in October 2021 and shall apply until the WTR recast is finalised.Other new business modelsGenerally speaking  one can observe various trends in the fintech sector  including accommodating the needs caused by the covid-19 pandemic as well as enhanced efforts to find specific uses for blockchain technology and for AI.These efforts can be illustrated by the cooperation of Deutsche Bundesbank  Deutsche Börse and Germany's Finance Agency that developed and  in 2021  successfully tested a DLT-based securities settlement in central bank money with the use of a 'trigger' solution and a transaction coordinator in TARGET2  the Eurosystem's large-value payment system.80 Participants in the capital markets in general appear to seek increasingly successful business models exploiting the potential of fintech. The first placings of promissory notes and commercial papers (even though these papers have not been governed by German law) have been made in Germany by taking advantage of the blockchain technology and of highly digitalised platforms. Further developments are to be expected in connection with the recent introduction of securities dematerialisation under the eWpG in 2021.A relatively new and successful phenomenon on the German fintech market is the development of 'neo-brokerage apps' operating mostly on a commission-free (or almost commission-free) basis. The neo-brokerage firms offer trading in a variety of products  from very selective to a wide range  including stocks  foreign exchange  commodities  exchange traded funds and digital assets. The neo-brokers have recently become very popular because of the nil cost (or very low flat fee) for users and also as a result of the growing interest in investments and capital markets among retail investors trying to find new investment opportunities beyond bank deposits bearing no or even negative interest. Neo-brokers operate either on the basis of their own BaFin licence for the provision of financial services or they use the services of a fronting BaFin-licensed institution that ensures compliance with the regulatory requirements. Whether  however  the business model of neo-brokers will continue to thrive depends to a material extent on future regulation. Certainly  neo-brokers strive for profits. Some neo-brokers derive their income from third parties such as trading venues. The European Commission has clearly expressed its concern that this practice of 'payment for order flow' jeopardises the interests of investors and has tabled a proposal to prohibit this practice. If this proposal were to become applicable law  various neo-brokers would have to adapt their business model.A current DLT and blockchain-related trend known as DeFi is a recent phenomenon in the fintech business that could potentially become a part of digital disruption. As a digital environment of a wide range of financial applications built on blockchain  including borrowing  lending  exchange and issuance of tokens and asset-backed cryptoassets (stablecoins)  DeFi has raised significant interest and a financial boost since mid-2020  including development of software solutions for the tokenisation of securities as well as blockchain custody services.A sub-trend in the fintech world that has recently started to develop is 'wealthtech'  focused on wealth and property management as well as general personal financial management with the use of fintech tools. Further  the fintech risk and compliance segment offers solutions supporting regulatory  AML compliance and the compliance function in general  sometimes also called 'digital compliance'. This is also a segment in which AI is expected to be increasingly deployed. In this regard  however  it still seems too early to discuss fully established business models on the German market. In general  the operation of business models involving the use of AI is subject to the regulatory requirements applicable to business models in line with the technology-neutral approach of 'same business  same risk  same regulation'. This means that for each relevant fintech business model  careful analysis should judge whether it falls within the scope of one or several regulated services and which regulatory requirements apply. In essence  the licensed institutions using programs and algorithms involving AI must ensure that they maintain a proper business organisation 81 in particular  adequate and effective risk management  and that the use of these programs and algorithms is in line with the general regulatory requirements. This includes processes for determining and safeguarding the sustainability of services  internal control procedures and internal control systems  adequate contingency plans  especially for IT systems and complete documentation of business operations permitting seamless monitoring by BaFin as well as compliance with outsourcing requirements. The exact arrangement of the business organisation should be appropriate for the nature  scope  complexity and risk content of the institution's business activities. In this regard  the minimum requirements for risk management in BaFin's Circular No. 09/201782 and with the supervisory requirements for IT in BaFin's Circular No. 10/201783 have to be met. Further developments as regards the AI segment may be expected in connection with the European Commission's proposal for a regulation laying down harmonised rules on AI  published in April 2021.84With respect to the use of algorithms  BaFin has confirmed its approach in that it does not grant general a priori approvals for the use of algorithms in decision-making processes and that its administrative practice is technology-neutral.85 The legal reasoning behind this approach is generally twofold: the nature of the risk-oriented and ad hoc financial supervision on the one hand and the lack of a statutory basis for general a priori algorithm approvals on the other.86 As to the former  the supervisory requirements do not primarily concern the algorithm itself; instead  the focus of supervision is on the entire decision-making process in which the relevant algorithm is embedded; therefore  compliance with general requirements on proper business organisation and risk management plays a key role.87 With respect to the lack of a statutory legal basis for algorithm approval  two exceptions should be noted in which the regulation of the use of algorithms may be derived from the law itself (e.g.  determination of capital and solvency requirements). However  even in these cases  the supervisory authorities will not grant an a priori approval. Instead  they conduct a risk-oriented assessment of the relevant decision-making and other procedures taking into account the available data and its quality.88The approach of technological neutrality also applies generally to the regulation of KWG and WpIG licence requirements. In this respect  one might consider high-frequency trading (a special form of proprietary trading)89 as an exception. Per definition  high frequency trading includes the use of algorithms for the sale and purchase of financial instruments.90 While German supervisory rules generally do not provide for specific notification obligations in the case of the use of particular software or algorithms  high-frequency trades have to adhere to specific notification requirements.91Worth mentioning in the context of recent and successful fintech-related business models is the increasing digitalisation in the insurance sector. New service providers have evolved that primarily broker insurance via smartphones quickly and simply. Certainly  these brokers must also comply with the general information duties relating to the brokerage of insurance contracts.Also successful  but not strictly new  are product comparison websites  which have become very popular with price-conscious consumers. The influence of these offerings on the market is governed by the general competition rules. These include that price comparison tests must be performed in a competent manner  seek to be objectively accurate and be neutral.92 Also  the incorporation of 'fintech banks' is noteworthy in connection with new business models. These fintech banks hold a comprehensive licence to conduct banking business but still perceive themselves to be fintech companies. Their business model is based on digitalisation  and they partly offer white-label solutions  namely they may seek to cooperate with other fintech companies that need licensed banks for their business model. This illustrates that some fintech banks position themselves as 'platform banks'  where cooperation partners may find specific service offerings that they can use to complement their own products or services.Intellectual property and data protectioni Intellectual propertyA business model  as such  cannot be protected by copyright law. Therefore  it is not uncommon for successful fintech business models to be copied and optimised. Computer programs  however  that are characterised by a minimum of individuality and originality are subject to copyright protection according to Section 2 of the Act on Copyright and Neighbouring Rights (UrhG).93Under German law  copyright can be neither registered nor transferred  as the copyright itself emerges the moment the piece of work  such as the software  is created by its actual originator.94 The capacity of being the originator is strictly connected to a natural person and may therefore not be transferred.95 Obviously  the lack of registration leads to various practical problems that often result in lawsuits. Nonetheless  a licence may be granted enabling the holder to make use of the piece of work in every matter or in particular matters (Section 31 of the UrhG). Employees and their employers implicitly agree on a full licence by drafting the employment contract.96 Therefore  the employer is allowed to make use of the piece of work. Concerning computer programs  another rule applies (Section 69b of the UrhG)  which grants the employer even more rights. Unless agreed otherwise  the employee is owed no compensation.97ii Data protectionGenerally speaking  data protection is governed by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)  which replaced  to a material extent  the previous version of the Federal Act on Data Protection on 25 May 2018 without  however  changing the fundamental principles of German data protection law. The GDPR intends to prevent the collection and use of data related to individuals unless it is duly necessary to do so (Article 1 of the GDPR). Data are considered to be related to individuals if the responsible body has the legal means that enable it to identify the data subject.98Collection and processing of data related to individuals is only permitted if it is explicitly allowed by law or if the data subject consents (Article 6(1) of the GDPR). Additionally  the user must be informed about the nature  extent and purpose of data collection.Digital profiling has to comply with the general principles stated above. The GDPR does not regulate digital profiling  as such  but focuses on some of its typical forms: first  the automated individual decision-making  including profiling  must comply with Article 22 of the GDPR; and second  a decision that produces legal effects on the data subject or has a similarly significant influence on the data subject must not be based solely on automated processing (Article 22(1) of the GDPR). However  Article 22(1) of the GDPR shall not apply if the decision: (1) is necessary for entering into  or the performance of  a contract between the data subject and the data controller; (2) is authorised by law to which the controller is subject and that also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or (3) is based on the data subject's explicit consent (Article 22(2) of the GDPR).Year in reviewConsidering the developments in the fintech sector over recent months and years  the following trends appear worth emphasising.Overall  it seems that the fintech market in Germany has continued to demonstrate growing maturity and has reached a consolidation phase. This  and the fact that fintech companies in Germany have been able to implement commercially viable business models  is illustrated by recent financings  which resulted in market evaluations of some German fintech companies exceeding €1 billion. However  scaling their operations is still difficult for many local fintechs  which may also be a result of the increasing efforts of incumbent institutions to take advantage of the lessons learned from fintechs in terms of innovation and customer experience. Traditional players in the financial sector use these insights not only by establishing cooperation and partnerships with fintech companies and including fintechs in their value chains  but also by developing their own digital offerings.Certain challenges for the regulatory sector in Germany have been identified in the aftermath of the Wirecard insolvency considered to be the result of an extensive fraud. In consequence  the German legislator adopted the Act on Strengthening the Financial Market Integrity  some of which came into effect in July 2021 and some in January 2022  which provides for a significant increase on the liability caps of auditors  mandatory rotation rules and auditors' rights and regulators' supervisory powers with regard to outsourcing service providers. Also  BaFin has been allowed to apply 'mystery shopping' in relation to licensed entities by engaging trained fieldwork customers to support the identification of infringements. This legislative activity and the recent administrative practice suggest that BaFin will adhere to its principle 'same business  same risk  same regulation' approach and pursue it even more diligently.The importance of digital technologies for financial markets and the need for legal clarity has been visibly recognised by the legislators and supervisors. At the EU level  this is particularly reflected by several proposals of legislative packages on matters such as cryptoassets  cryptocurrencies  stablecoins and ICOs  providing for a unified regulatory and licensing regime in the EU. Also  the European Commission has proposed to introduce an EU-level sandbox model to facilitate the development of DLT and blockchain-based technologies and increasing the regulators' understanding of these technologies.In Germany  the recent implementation of the Fifth EU AML Directive providing for a broad legal definition of crypto values not only resulted in enhanced AML obligations for service providers engaging in the cryptocurrency business  but also introduced a licence requirement for the crypto custody business. Also  the recently introduced eWpG outlined the legal framework for partial dematerialisation of securities with the use of DLT and blockchain technologies in Germany.Outlook and conclusionsGiven the numerous initiatives at an international  EU and national level dealing with the regulatory challenges of fintech  both those recently adopted and those still in the legislative procedure  it seems that the legal framework for the operation of fintech business models is becoming significantly more harmonised and expressly regulated. This  however  does not necessarily need to be detrimental to fintechs and their offerings. The new regulatory and licensing regime is likely to bring more clarity for the market participants as well as further increase the transparency for  and protection of  customers.A clear and harmonised licensing regime in all EU Member States  addressing certain fintech-related services such as in the field of the cryptoasset market  once adopted  would facilitate the use of the EU passport. Fintech and DLT and blockchain technology will most likely benefit from the adoption of the proposed EU sandbox model. However  because various key legislative proposals have been adopted  but are not yet applicable  and because some of these are still undergoing the legislative procedure  it remains to be seen how the harmonised regime will influence the fintech market in practice and how the regulators will deal with the application of an increasingly detailed regulatory framework to the constantly evolving fintech environment. It is not yet certain whether fintechs will continue with their ability to find innovative solutions or whether the regulatory restrictions will turn out to be an inhibiting factor for their future success.Aside from further DLT and blockchain development and the possible related challenges (including compliance with GDPR requirements and the 'right to be forgotten' fenced with a harsh sanctions regime)  new developments can be expected in the areas of big data and AI.Finally  it remains to be seen whether  and how permanently  the current pandemic will impact the fintech market.,neutral,0.04,0.94,0.01,negative,0.04,0.21,0.74,True,English,"['digital markets', 'payment services', 'review', 'funding', 'Germany', 'German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority', 'special public funding instrument', 'application programming interface banking', 'Other significant fintech segments', 'same business, same risk', 'Agile service providers', 'nil execution costs', 'high acquisition costs', 'past three years', 'other European countries', 'distributed ledger technologies', 'new business opportunities', 'Digital Finance Package', 'German federal legislator', 'blockchain-based business models', 'innovative business models', 'financial licensing purposes', 'blockchain-based dematerialised securities', 'German Banking Act', 'crypto custody business', 'German securities law', 'personal finance management', 'innovative digital solutions', 'online brokerage services', 'overall start-up activity', 'present legal framework', 'EU-level sandbox model', '72 per cent) segments', '639 active fintech companies', '9 new fintech companies', 'recent statutory rules', 'German fintech market', 'young fintech companies', 'significant funding', 'same regulation', ""sandbox' model"", 'supervisory concerns', 'supervisory issues', 'business angels', 'German government', 'German Ministry', 'decentralised finance', 'German legislator', 'financial sector', 'financial institutions', 'asset management', 'EU-wide framework', 'European Commission', 'statutory provisions', 'crypto values', 'financial instruments', 'electronic securities', 'securities dematerialisation', 'legal certainty', 'start-up culture', 'fintech sector', '55 per cent', '96 per cent', '1 per cent', 'financing activity', 'questions Overview', 'remarkable resilience', 'covid-19 pandemic', 'cashless payments', 'general tendency', 'increased competition', 'value chains', 'highest proportion', 'young start-ups', 'capital access', 'total number', 'early-stage financings', 'regulatory authorities', 'sufficient leeway', 'sufficient level', 'licence requirement', 'key points', 'blockchain strategy', 'several statements', 'big data', 'artificial intelligence', 'technology-neutral principle', 'traditional players', 'innovation space', 'tight regulation', 'United Kingdom', 'venture capital', 'financing transactions', 'market participants', 'Fintech-related topics', 'subject matter', 'information security', 'challenges', 'reliable', 'beneficiaries', 'crisis', 'neo', 'brokering', 'low', 'Germany', 'influence', 'nature', 'winner', 'phenomenon', 'fintechs', 'indication', 'banks', 'developments', 'opposite', 'study', 'five', 'compliance', 'DeFi', 'rise', 'average', 'quarter', 'fields', 'investment', 'credit', 'factoring', 'addition', 'politicians', 'protection', 'discussions', 'result', 'cryptoassets', 'KWG', 'introduction', 'step', 'path', 'BaFin', 'explanations', 'opinions13', 'DLTs', 'digitalisation', 'need', 'Switzerland', 'balance', 'efforts', 'regard', 'website', 'Economics', 'programme', 'shares']",2022-04-23,2022-04-23,lexology.com

Flow Traders is currently a market maker in more than 200 ETPs on HKEXExpansion of Flow Traders’ global ETP trading footprint by becoming an official market maker on ASX and CBOE Australia in 55 tickersCorporate Venture Capital UnitDuring 2021  Flow Traders designed and implemented a strategic ecosystem approach to accelerate the execution of its strategy and as well as capturing more of the overall value chain. This is a natural evolution given Flow Traders’ core capabilities as well as position within the financial markets ecosystem. The emphasis is on three key themes of platforms  data  and connectivity across the three strategic focus areas of equities  fixed income and digital assetsRecent strategic activities made in line with these key themes include ErisX  MEMX  Shape Q  LedgerEdge  D2X  Pyth and BloXrouteSignificant work has been undertaken during the first quarter to formalize this strategic ecosystem approach into a dedicated corporate venture capital unit as the pace of investments continues to accelerate. The set-up of this unit is expected to be finalized by the end of the second quarterOutlookTo maintain Flow Traders’ status as an employer of choice and to remain competitive in the global employment market  it has been necessary to shift the total compensation mix of certain employee groups towards a greater fixed component. Accordingly  targeted base compensation increases have been implemented. These actions will ensure Flow Traders continues to attract the talent necessary to execute its strategic growth agendaThe first quarter did see certain one-off strategy related costs being incurred  which are expected to deliver meaningful benefits going forward. In addition  COVID business continuity plan-related expenses were reclassified into operational expenses from the start of 2022. Nonetheless  Flow Traders continues to be focused on cost discipline particularly with reference to the maximum growth in fixed operating expenses of c. 15% for this yearManagement Board CommentsDennis Dijkstra  CEO  stated:“The successes in Q1 once again confirmed the numerous strengths of our business. This includes our pricing and hedging excellence  a robust risk management framework and a truly global trading footprint. A stronger operational focus has been required so far in 2022 but this has not been to the detriment of progressing and driving forward our strategic growth agenda across our three key growth areas of equities  fixed income and digital assets. We continue to quote more products as well as support new introductions as the trading footprint continues to grow. Once again  we confirmed our ability to deploy into new markets by becoming an official market maker in Australia on the ASX and CBOE.“Lastly  while this has been a successful quarter for Flow Traders  we are mindful that this has been an extremely challenging and distressing time for those affected by the conflict in Ukraine. Accordingly  we have made an initial donation of €500 000 to the Red Cross  UNHCR and several local initiatives nominated by colleagues and partners. We are also proud of the individual efforts from colleagues who directly raised more than €40 000 through various activities and conducted a successful donation drive in the Amsterdam office. This continues our longstanding tradition of charitable giving.”Folkert Joling  Chief Trading Officer  added:“We saw a strong trading performance across the board with all desks and regions responding to a more active and volatile market environment. In particular  ETP flows and volumes were focused in the European time zone during the quarter. We continued to expand and deepen our ETP trading footprint during the quarter as evidenced by our new market making activities in Australia and expanded Lead Market Maker activities in the US. Encouragingly  our market share in corporate credit single bond market making continues to increase both in Europe and in the US as the buyside engages further with our proposition. From a trading and operational standpoint  we were successfully able to navigate the various market issues that arose upon the start of the Ukraine conflict.”Mike Kuehnel  Chief Financial Officer  added:“We have made substantial progress in the review of our strategic roadmap with tangible ideas now ready for the team to action. We look forward to sharing these outputs at a capital markets day to be held in June. In parallel  we completed an investment in BloXroute as we further intensify our strategic ecosystem approach to drive change and innovation in global financial markets. Our increased pace of strategic investments has created a desire to formalise these activities within a dedicated corporate venture capital unit that will help us to accelerate our ecosystem strategy even further. From a cost perspective  we have commenced the process of systematically adjusting the base compensation for certain targeted employee groups. There were also one-off expenses incurred this quarter relating to the recent corporate strategy and group legal structure review. Notwithstanding these cost dynamics  the operational leverage within the business was still very much evident with significantly improved margins quarter on quarter  indicating that our operational leverage and underlying cost efficiency remain key priorities.”Preliminary Financial Calendar29 April 2022 AGM3 May 2022 FY21 final dividend proposed ex-dividend date4 May 2002 FY21 final dividend proposed record date6 May 2022 FY21 final dividend proposed payment dateTBD June 2022 Capital markets day30 June 2022 Start silent period ahead of H122 results22 July 2022 Release H122 results (inc. analyst conference call)16 August 2022 Proposed FY22 interim dividend ex-dividend date17 August 2022 Proposed FY22 interim dividend record date19 August 2022 Proposed FY22 interim dividend payment date30 September 2022 Start silent period ahead of Q322 trading update27 October 2022 Release Q322 trading update (no analyst conference call)Contact DetailsFlow Traders N.V.InvestorsJonathan BergerPhone: +31 20 7996799Email: investor.relations@flowtraders.comMediaLaura PeijsPhone: +31 20 7996799Email: press@flowtraders.comAbout Flow TradersFlow Traders is a leading global financial technology-enabled liquidity provider in financial products  historically specialized in Exchange Traded Products (ETPs)  now expanding into other asset classes.

Since launching in 2012  Ripple has rapidly gained acceptance as a system for international money and security transfers by banks and financial middlemen dealing across geographies and currencies  with XRP currently ranked 6th by market cap of all cryptocurrencies.1XRP will join the company’s suite of institutional-grade crypto exchange traded products including Bitcoin  Ethereum  Solana  Cardano  Polkadot  Litecoin  Avalanche  Cosmos  Polygon and Uniswap that trade on XETRA. The new ETC will be marketed and distributed by HANetf and available in EUR and USD.Bradley Duke  Founder and co-CEO at ETC Group said: “Ripple is rapidly becoming a leader in global payment systems with hundreds of financial institutions choosing Ripple to provide a better international payments experience for their customers  in real-time. By launching this latest ETC to our expanding portfolio of high quality  physically backed digital assets  we’re continuing to grow our offering to investors  providing access to an increasingly wide range of digital currencies and assets - especially those amassing large market caps. The market leading success of our products has been driven by our partnerships with world-class liquidity providers to deliver high liquidity and tight trading spreads.”Hector McNeil  co-Founder and co-CEO at HANetf: “We are delighted to partner with ETC Group again to offer a new ETC backed by XRP. ETC Group  in partnership with HANetf  has established itself as a market leader in offering investment products focused on crypto assets. Interest in exchange traded cryptocurrencies has been booming  providing investors with a safer and more liquid way to gain exposure to digital assets. Ripple is a growing blockchain-based digital payment network that is gaining traction thanks to its rapid speed and reliability.""Crypto ETCs provide investors with significant benefits over direct investment in digital assets  including:1/ Easy way to investInvestors can buy and sell like any stock or ETF through their regular broker or bank. No need to engage with the technical challenges of setting up a cryptocurrency wallet  products have a ticker and ISIN and can be added to an investor’s conventional stock portfolio.2/ Institutional-grade asset custodyThe underlying digital asset is kept in cold-storage at a regulated custodian  and all assets are secured by an independent trustee  thus eliminating issuer default risk  a common feature for physical ETC structures.3/ 100% physically backed & option for physical redemptionInvestors are legally entitled to the underlying digital asset  and can redeem the ETC for the сryptocurrency  alternative to selling on exchange. Hence ETC products provide pure exposure to the underlying digital asset.Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile  and your capital is at risk.

To celebrate Earth Day  discover strong initiatives that we have put in place to mobilize our teams.Climate change is the greatest challenge we are facing. We know that tourism accounts for 8-11% of greenhouse gas emissions. So  it’s now more than ever crucial that we act as a collective to protect it.As a multinational company with 5 300 properties that employs more than 230 000 team members in 110 countries  we believe we can have an impact in shaping the future of travel and contribute to making it more sustainable. As well as being a necessity  fostering a responsible mindset has also become a key business driver. Post-pandemic  guests also expect more from hotels with 61% saying they want to travel more sustainably  73% are more likely to choose accommodation with sustainable policies  and 68% want to see how their money is redistributed among the local community (Booking.com  2021). At Accor  we want to make the world a better place and ensure that tourism’s benefits go beyond each guest.Every year  on Earth Day  our Group celebrates our environmental commitments around the world. This year  Brune Poirson and the sustainability department’s focus is on empowering our teams and their continued engagement  because they are our greatest strength and the backbone of our strategy. They have the capacity to turn our vision of positive hospitality into reality every day through concrete actions and by ensuring progress.A Single Use Plastic Global Challenge to Act for #NoMoreSingleUsePlasticSource: AccorThis new challenge  an awareness campaign  comes as part of Accor’s objective to eliminate all guest-related single-use plastic items in the guest experience by the end of 2022. And to reach our aim  we’re involving everyone at Accor to work together on a mutual goal  to strive towards #NoMoreSingleUsePlastic.Altogether  our eight regional teams are taking part with eight main plastic objectives that hotels have to report each month in our dedicated sustainability reporting tool.SEED (Saving the Environment Every Day) Network to Play an Active Role in our Sustainability JourneyA new employee resource group  this grassroots movement - a collective force that acts today for a better tomorrow - was created and powered by Heartists® that wanted to make a difference and act positively for the environment. SEED is a movement to raise awareness  learn and engage  with the aim of working towards a more sustainable workplace and taking our commitment to the next level.Launched in April  the group is made up of people from every department across Accor who will meet every month to brainstorm about upcoming local initiatives implemented in our teams’ day-to-day work lives. SEED is not just for sustainability experts but for anyone who wants to get involved  whether they are curious or committed  informed or just starting out on their climate change journey.We know that it’s important to onboard everyone from team members to guests  as well as external stakeholders too. That means spreading awareness among our suppliers and hotel and restaurant owners too  as for us  everyone needs to be aligned if we’re going to make a real difference. Our people  all our people  are our changemakers.About AccorAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of more than 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

3413,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=1e48e495-a1f0-4060-bc2e-c153d42989f1,In review: digital markets  funding and payment services in Belgium,1 day ago,All questionsOverviewi GeneralFintech is gaining increasing importance in the Belgian market  especially in light of the presence of EU financial and legislative bodies in Brussels  and because of Brexit. Belgium is also the home of various fintech giants  such as payments system vendor Clear2Pay  smart cash-flow forecasting firm CashForce and the global provider of secure financial messaging services  Swift.2 Further  Belgium is the home country of various large market infrastructure players  such as Euroclear  Bank of New York Mellon  Mastercard and Lloyd's of London.The majority of the rules applicable to the fintech sector stem from European initiatives such as:Directive (EU) 2015/2366 of 25 November 2015 on payment services in the internal market (PSD II); Directive (EU) 2015/849 of 20 May 2015 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering or terrorist financing (AMLD); Directive 2014/65/EU of 15 May 2014 on markets in financial instruments (MiFID II); and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).Belgium has also adopted legislation targeting alternative funding platforms  which is of particular relevance to crowdfunding platforms. On 10 November 2021  the first regulation on crowdfunding services on a European level entered into force.3While the regulatory financial services framework may prove to be quite overwhelming for new and sometimes inexperienced market participants  various initiatives have been taken to guide fintech companies through this jungle of regulations.ii Legal and regulatory climateAlthough many fintech stakeholders have made their case to set up a regulatory sandbox (as in the UK)  Belgium has not yet implemented such a sandbox.4 However  the financial regulators have identified fintech as an important focus of their supervisory activities and acknowledge that the financial regulatory framework plays a key role in accommodating both innovation and safety within the industry. Therefore  they have launched a joint FinTech Contact Point  serving as a single point of contact for the financial regulators (as further discussed in Section VI).5 Companies can raise questions regarding the provision of new and innovative financial products or services requiring a licence. Since its launch in 2016  there have been a considerable number of enquiries regarding various topics such as robo-advice  crowdfunding and cryptocurrencies.6An important platform fostering and promoting the Belgian fintech sector is FinTech Belgium  a community for financial professionals  start-up entrepreneurs and investors.7 Apart from promoting the Belgian fintech sector in Belgium and abroad  FinTech Belgium seeks to establish an ongoing dialogue with financial regulators  and regularly organises conferences and seminars on fintech-related topics.Generally speaking  Belgium can be considered a fintech-friendly jurisdiction.iii Tax incentivesGeneralBelgian tax law does not provide for specific tax incentives for fintech companies. Nonetheless  there are several general tax incentives that are beneficial to fintech companies. Some of these measures are described below.Innovation income deductionBelgian companies are subject to corporate income tax at a rate of 25 per cent. The innovation income deduction allows Belgian companies to deduct 85 per cent of the net income that they derive from qualified intellectual property  thus reducing the effective tax rate to 3.75 per cent. Software (original creations or derived works that fulfil a certain originality threshold) that did not generate any income before 1 July 2016 may qualify. In practice  it is advisable to request a binding opinion from the Belgian Federal Science Policy Office (Belspo) about whether the software qualifies. The innovation income deduction is based on a nexus approach; in other words  it will only be available to the extent that the company has itself incurred qualifying research and development (R&D) expenses that have given rise to the income derived from the software.Exemption for remittance of professional withholding taxCompanies have the obligation to withhold tax on the salaries they pay to their employees. They must remit the said tax to the Treasury as an advanced payment of the personal income tax owed by the employees. Belgium partially exempts certain companies from that obligation. This measure is aimed at granting these companies more oxygen with regard to cash flow. Micro or small companies that are less than 48 months old are exempt from remitting 10 per cent and 20 per cent  respectively  of the tax withheld. These companies must fall within the scope of the Belgian Act of 5 December 1968 regarding collective bargaining agreements.A 'micro' company does not exceed more than one of the following criteria:balance sheet: less than €350 000; yearly turnover (excluding VAT): less than €700 000; and average number of employees on a yearly basis equal to or fewer than 10.A 'small' company does not exceed more than one of the following criteria:balance sheet: less than €4.5 million; yearly turnover (excluding VAT): less than €9 million; and average number of employees on a yearly basis equal to or fewer than 50.Companies involved in R&D activities may benefit from a partial exemption of 80 per cent of the withholding tax on remunerations paid to researchers holding specific academic degrees. This exemption may be limited in the case of certain academic degrees. The R&D programme must be notified to Belspo  and in practice it is advisable to request a binding advice from Belspo relating to the qualification of the R&D programme.Tax credit for R&D activitiesCompanies investing in R&D may opt to apply a tax credit of 25 per cent. The invested amount is the purchase or investment value of newly purchased or manufactured tangible or intangible assets  which are used for R&D activities in Belgium.Tax shelter start-ups and scale-upsIndividuals who wish to invest in a young company's equity may recover 25 per cent  30 per cent or 45 per cent of the invested amounts by means of a tax reduction. This measure is aimed at supporting companies' efforts to raise capital from individual investors. This regime is subject to a series of conditions that must be met by both investors and target companies. The applicable conditions will differ depending on whether the company is between zero and four years old (start-up) or between five and 10 years old (scale-up).An individual investor cannot invest more than €100 000 per year. Start-ups may not attract more than €250 000 through this regime. Scale-ups are limited to €500 000 (in aggregate with investments gathered previously as a start-up). The investment caps at start-up and scale-up level have been increased to  respectively  €500 000 and €1 million for investments made as from 1 January 2021. Investments may be made directly or indirectly through a crowdfunding platform or a public start-up fund.Withholding tax exemption for crowd-lendingIndividuals who wish to invest in young  small companies through crowd-lending may benefit from a withholding tax exemption on the first interest income bracket of €15 630. This regime is subject to a series of conditions that must be met by the investors  target companies and crowdfunding platforms.Regulationi Licensing and marketingFinancial supervision in Belgium is based on a twin peaks model  according to which there are two autonomous supervisors: the National Bank of Belgium (NBB) and the Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA). The NBB is responsible for the prudential supervision of individual financial institutions on both macro and micro levels  while the FSMA is responsible for the monitoring of the proper functioning  transparency and integrity of the financial markets as well as the supervision of unlawful offerings of products and financial services. Furthermore  Belgian banks are fully or partially subject to the supervision of the European Central Bank.Belgian regulatory law does not provide for a special fintech licence. However  depending on their proposed business model and activities in Belgium  fintech companies may be subject to a licence under general financial regulation. A broad range of activities are regulated in Belgium  mostly stemming from EU legislation. These include the offering of banking services  investment services  money exchange services  payment services  issuance of electronic money  mortgage and consumer credits  insurance services  reinsurance activities and occupational retirement schemes  as well as the intermediation relating to most of these services. Both the NBB and the FSMA also regularly issue circulars and communications that apply to regulated entities.Fintech activities in the payment sector are usually within the scope of the regulated activities of the provision of payment initiation services or account information services under the Belgian legislation implementing PSD II.Asset management companies are subject to a licence granted by the FSMA under the Belgian legislation implementing MiFID II. To be granted a licence  the asset management company has to meet several requirements concerning legal form  capital  adequacy of the shareholder structure and professional and appropriate management. At present  there is no specific regulation concerning automated digital advisory in Belgium.Special regulatory restrictions on marketing fintech services generally do not apply as long as the activities are not regulated or the products do not constitute financial instruments or securities. Restrictions may apply if regulated activities or products are commercialised  for instance under the Information Obligations Decree (as discussed in Section V.ii). Entities are  in general  prohibited from advertising without an appropriate licence. Specific rules also apply where marketing is performed through solicitation in Belgium (see Section II.ii). It is recommended that fintech companies explore specific marketing restrictions that may apply to their specific use case.ii Cross-border issuesBelgium has implemented the European passporting procedure  which allows firms to conduct activities and services regulated under European legislation in another Member State of the European Economic Area on the basis of an authorisation in its home Member State. Duly licensed entities in Belgium may therefore offer financial services in other Member States after notification to the host Member State  and vice versa. Financial services generally require a licence if they are offered in Belgium (directly or on a cross-border basis). The extent to which the provision and the marketing of financial services trigger licensing requirements under Belgian law should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. According to the Belgian regulators  financial services are being offered 'in Belgium' if: (1) the financial services are delivered or carried on in Belgium; or (2) the financial institution actively solicits orders from customers in Belgium by means of remote sales and marketing techniques or advertising.Digital identity and onboardingi Digital identityIn Belgium  the government issues an identity card to all citizens that includes a digital identity (eID). The information contained on the eID is deemed official and certified by the government (as certificate authority). An integration with the eID is possible to read basic information regarding an individual. This digital identity can therefore be used for onboarding  and can also be used for electronic identification and authentication as well as for embedding a qualified electronic signature on electronic documents.A number of Belgium's leading banks (Belfius  BNP Paribas Fortis  KBC/CBC and ING) and mobile network operators (Orange  Proximus and Telenet Group) created a mobile application  itsme  with a view to facilitating this identification  authentication and signatures. Initially  this could only be done on the basis of a Belgian bank account  but it has since been expanded and extended to also support the eID.The eID is only available to Belgian citizens (irrespective of their nationality) and itsme is only available to holders of a Belgian bank account or a Belgian eID. Because of the eID's integration of certificates for qualified electronic signatures  it can be used for any contract or document  except specific documents provided for by law (e.g.  there are specific conditions for the assignment of certain financial instruments).ii Digitised onboarding of clientsIn the process of onboarding clients  'obliged entities' have to assess the risk of money laundering and terrorist financing based on customer due diligence as set out by the Belgian Act of 18 September 2017 on the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing and the restriction on the use of cash (the AML Act)  which implements the AMLD into national law. Before the establishment of a business relationship or before carrying out certain transactions  obliged entities are required to identify the customer and verify the customer's identity  assess and obtain information on the purpose and intended nature of the business relationship and conduct ongoing monitoring of the business relationship.Digitised onboarding of customers is possible  provided that the relevant entity complies with its know-your-customer requirements under the AML Act. In this respect  the AML Act states that when business relationships or transactions are entered into remotely without any further guarantees (such as electronic signatures)  this constitutes an indication of a potentially higher risk. Where higher risks are identified  obliged entities must apply enhanced customer due diligence measures. Further  the entity should set up a process for electronic identification (in particular in accordance with the eIDAS Regulation8).The AML Act specifically provides that  to identify and verify the customer's identity  obliged entities must use: (1) one or more pieces of evidence or reliable and independent sources of information; (2) where available  information obtained by electronic identification means (such as eID or itsme); and (3) where available  information obtained by relevant trust services as set out in the eIDAS Regulation (such as electronic signatures and electronic seals).9Digital markets  payment services and fundingi CrowdfundingVarious types of crowdfunding platforms exist on the Belgian market:platforms through which the public makes a donation for a project or enterprise; platforms through which the public deposits money to receive a non-financial compensation (reward-based crowdfunding); platforms through which the public invests in a project or enterprise through a loan (loan-based crowdfunding  also referred to as crowd-lending); and platforms through which the public invests in a project or enterprise through a contribution in capital in consideration for a participation in any profit (equity-based crowdfunding).Crowd-lending and equity-based crowdfunding are regulated in Belgium by the Belgian Act of 18 December 2016 on the recognition and definition of crowdfunding and containing various provisions on finance (the Crowdfunding Act).10The Crowdfunding Act sets out the licensing and operating requirements for alternative funding platforms as well as the conduct of business rules that apply to the providers of alternative funding services. An alternative funding service  dubbed by the FSMA as 'the financial form of crowdfunding'  is defined in Article 4(1) of the Crowdfunding Act as:[T]he service consisting of commercialising investment instruments  through a website or any other electronic means  issued by entrepreneur-issuers  starter funds or funding vehicles in the framework of an offering  public or otherwise  without the provision of an investment service regarding these investment instruments  with the exception of  as applicable  the following services: (i) provision of investment advice and (ii) receiving and transmitting orders.Each individual or legal entity that professionally provides alternative funding services within the territory of Belgium is deemed an alternative funding platform pursuant to Article 4(2) of the Crowdfunding Act (unless the individual or legal entity is a regulated undertaking).As regards peer-to-peer lending  the Belgian regulatory framework currently does not explicitly authorise direct lending by consumers to consumers (as individuals are not allowed to make a public call to borrow money).ii Payment servicesThe offering of payment services is a regulated activity in Belgium under the Belgian Act of 11 March 2018 on the legal status and the supervision of payment institutions and electronic money institutions  the access to the undertaking of payment service provider and to the activity of issuing electronic money  and the access to payment systems (the Payment Institutions Act)  which implements PSD II. The Payment Institutions Act regulates the following payment services:services enabling cash to be placed on a payment account as well as all the operations required for operating a payment account; services enabling cash withdrawals from a payment account as well as all the operations required for operating a payment account; execution of payment transactions  including transfers of funds on a payment account with the user's payment service provider or with another payment service provider (execution of direct debits  payment transactions through a payment instrument and credit transfers  including permanent payment orders); execution of payment transactions where the funds are covered by a credit line for a payment service user (execution of direct debits  payment transactions through a payment instrument and credit transfers  including permanent payment orders); issuing of payment instruments and acquiring of payment transactions; money remittance; payment initiation services; and account information services.The exemptions as outlined under PSD II also apply in Belgium. The exemptions that are regularly invoked in the fintech sphere are:the limited network exemption; the commercial agent exemption; and the technical service provider exemption.Following the implementation of PSD II  banks are required to provide third parties (such as payment initiation or account aggregation providers) with access to a customer's account data  upon the latter's request. The main reason is to facilitate these new business models that depend heavily on access to this data.Cryptocurrencies  initial coin offerings (ICO) and security tokensi Laws and regulations specifically targeting tokens and cryptocurrenciesGeneralThe Virtual Currency Exchange Services Act prohibits third-country virtual currency exchange and custodial wallet providers that are not registered with the FSMA from offering their services in Belgium (see below). The FSMA has issued a regulation  a communication and several press releases and warnings11 relating to cryptocurrencies or associated phenomena. The NBB has issued a circular. These texts  as discussed below  are the only forms of regulatory guidance in Belgium that specifically address tokens and cryptocurrencies.At a meeting held on 18 June 2021  the Council of Ministers approved a preliminary draft royal decree on the status and the supervision of providers of exchange services between virtual and fiat currencies and custodian wallet providers. The draft royal decree aims to establish the rules and conditions for the registration with the FSMA of providers of virtual currency services established on Belgian territory  as well as the conditions for exercising these activities and the supervision thereof. With regard to the conditions for registration  this draft imposes requirements in terms of expertise and professional reliability  the absence of a professional ban and a shareholder base that guarantees sound and prudent management of the company. In addition  providers of virtual currency services must comply at all times with the provisions of the AML Act. The draft royal decree was submitted to the Council of State for its opinion but has not been made public yet.12Virtual Currency Exchange Services ActOn 21 February 2022  the act amending the AML Act to introduce provisions on the status and supervision of service providers for the exchange between virtual and fiat currencies and custodian wallet providers (the Virtual Currency Exchange Services Act) entered into force.The Virtual Currency Exchange Services Act contains a prohibition on third-country (i.e.  non-European Economic Area) virtual currency exchange and custodial wallet providers that are not registered with the FSMA offering their services in Belgium  subject to imprisonment (of one month to one year) or a criminal fine (of between €400 and €80 000)  or both. The Act also brings all Belgian territory ATMs that enable the exchange of virtual currency against fiat currency within the FSMA's supervision. The parliamentary works do not define what it means for a third-country service provider to offer its services in Belgium. Generally speaking  the Belgian authorities do accept 'passive servicing' in other financial services matters  meaning that as long as no active soliciting of orders from customers in Belgium by means of remote sales and marketing techniques or advertising is pursued  a company is not presumed to offer its services in Belgium. Passive servicing is usually also accepted for existing clients. The Belgian regulator's position in relation to crypto exchange and custodial wallets is untested. Parliamentary discussions have also flagged that the extraterritorial enforcement of these sanctions will be very difficult in practice  as the inclusion of criminal penalties in a Belgian Act has no impact outside the Belgian jurisdiction if the third country does not actively cooperate in the prosecution. A similar statutory arrangement is also in place in the Netherlands  but is not yet enforced in practice either.Marketing Prohibition RegulationOn 3 April 2014  the FSMA issued the Regulation of the Financial Services and Markets Authority of 3 April 2014 on the prohibition on marketing of certain financial products to non-professional clients (the Marketing Prohibition Regulation)  which entered into force on 1 July 2014.13 This Regulation prohibits professional marketing in Belgium to one or more retail clients of financial products  the return of which is directly or indirectly dependent on virtual money. 'Virtual money' is defined for the purposes of the Regulation as 'each form of non-regulated digital money without legal tender'. This definition comprises not only Bitcoin  but also other cryptocurrencies. The prohibition only applies in respect of derivatives of virtual money  not in respect of the virtual money itself.14Circular NBB_2019_20On 13 March 2019  the Basel Committee issued a 'statement on cryptoassets'. In this statement  the Basel Committee warns of the risks related to cryptoassets. It then sets out the measures it expects banks to take if they acquire cryptoasset exposures or provide related services.As a follow-up to the Basel Committee's statement  the NBB released Circular NBB_2019_20  on expectations regarding activities related to cryptoassets  on 19 July 2019.15 This is addressed to the financial undertakings under the NBB's supervision. The NBB deemed that the substance of the Basel Committee statement was also relevant for other financial undertakings. It therefore decided to issue Circular NBB_2019_20 to reiterate the Basel Committee's statement and to extend its scope to also include non-banks under its supervision.FSMA ICO CommunicationOn 13 November 2017  the FSMA issued a communication entitled 'Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs)' (with document number FSMA_2017_20: the FSMA ICO Communication).16 In this text  which is considered soft law  the FSMA endorses the statements by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) on ICOs  in which ESMA has determined that  depending on how ICOs are structured  various financial regulations  such as the Prospectus Directive  MiFID  the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive and the Market Abuse Regulation  may apply.17The FSMA further states that the following legislation and regulations may apply to ICOs in Belgium:the Act of 16 June 2006 on public offers of investment instruments and the admission of investment instruments to trading on regulated markets (the Old Prospectus Act). Meanwhile  however  the new Prospectus Regulation (2017/1129) has been implemented in Belgium by the Act of 11 July 2018 on the public offering of investment instruments and the admission of investment instruments to trading on a regulated market (the New Prospectus Act). The New Prospectus Act has fully applied  and fully repealed the Old Prospectus Act  since 21 July 2019; the Marketing Prohibition Regulation (discussed above); and the Crowdfunding Act (discussed above).The FSMA notes in its communication that the application of the above laws depends on the way in which the ICO in question is structured  and that this must be assessed on a case-by-case basis. While the FSMA does not expressly mention the criteria it may apply when undertaking this assessment  it does point out elsewhere in the communication that:[t]he characteristics of a token may be similar to:(i) investment instruments  given that they may provide rights  offer the prospects of revenues or returns  or involve a pooling of funds with a view to investment in tokens; (ii) a means of storage  calculation and exchange  given its convertibility into other tokens  cryptocurrencies or fiat money; and/or (iii) a utility token  given the access which the token provides to the product or service.This corresponds to the classification of tokens and cryptocurrencies as either: (1) an investment token; (2) a cryptocurrency; or (3) a utility token; or any combination of these three variations  which is gaining traction among scholars and policymakers.18 Whereas thus far this trichotomy constitutes a merely descriptive classification  it can already provide a sense of the likelihood that the coin will fall within the ambit of one or another law (such as one of the laws discussed in Section V.ii).ii General laws and regulations that may apply to tokens and cryptocurrenciesGeneralWith the exception of the Marketing Prohibition Regulation  there are no Belgian (hard) laws or regulations that specifically target blockchain or cryptocurrencies. Consequently  any type of cryptocurrency  token or other asset created or transferred by means of distributed ledger technology  as well as any related service  must be analysed from the perspective of existing laws and concepts. Most Belgian financial laws do not materially deviate from the EU legislation they seek to implement and are therefore not discussed here. There are  however  some interesting deviations from or additions to the EU financial law framework  a selection of which is discussed below.Prospectus regimeThe Belgian prospectus legislation  among others:deals with the requirement of preparing a prospectus to be approved by the FSMA or an information note in the event of a public offering of investment instruments within the territory of Belgium; establishes a monopoly on intermediation for the placement of investment instruments within the territory of Belgium; and determines that advertisements used in connection with the public offering must receive prior approval from the FSMA.Unlike the old Prospectus Directive (2003/71/EC) and the new Prospectus Regulation (2017/1129)  the Old Prospectus Act and the New Prospectus Act do not use the notion of 'securities' to determine the material scope of the prospectus regime. Instead  they use the significantly broader notion of 'investment instruments'. This latter concept includes securities  but also comprises a whole range of additional instruments (such as money market instruments  futures  forward rate agreements and equity swaps)  as well as the residual category of 'all other instruments that enable a financial investment  irrespective of the underlying assets'.Consequently  depending on the structure of the token issued in an ICO  there may be a high chance that the token qualifies as an investment instrument and therefore falls within the scope of the Belgian prospectus regime.19The Belgian prospectus legislation also establishes an intermediation monopoly. Only the entities mentioned in Article 21  Section 1 of the New Prospectus Act  which are all regulated entities  are allowed to act as intermediaries for purposes of the placement of investment instruments within the territory of Belgium. Consequently  if a token qualifies as an investment instrument and is placed in Belgium  only regulated entities can act as intermediaries (with certain limited exceptions).20Consumer protectionIf a token qualifies as an investment instrument for purposes of the prospectus legislation discussed above  the token will also qualify as a financial product and will thus fall within the ambit of  in particular  the Royal Decree of 25 April 2014 on certain information obligations in respect of the marketing of financial products to non-professional clients (the Information Obligations Decree).21 As its name suggests  this Decree provides for certain information obligations that must be complied with when professionally marketing financial products to retail clients.Furthermore  when the service offered in respect of a token or cryptocurrency qualifies as a financial service  Book VI of the Belgian Code of Economic Law  containing various consumer protection provisions  applies.22 A financial service is defined in this Code as 'each banking service or service relating to lending  insurance  individual pensions  investments and payments'.iii Tax treatmentCorporate income taxThe Office for Advance Tax Rulings has recently confirmed that all gains from investments in cryptocurrencies and ICOs made by Belgian companies are taxable  and all losses are tax deductible.Personal income taxThe income tax treatment of investments in cryptocurrencies by individuals is subject to general tax rules and depends on the relevant facts and circumstances.A capital gain realised within the framework of one's professional activity will be taxed as professional income at progressive rates ranging between 25 per cent and 50 per cent plus local charges. If the cryptocurrencies are held as private assets  the capital gains will be exempt from individual income tax if the sale qualifies as a normal act of management. If not  the capital gains will be taxable as miscellaneous income at a rate of 33 per cent plus local charges.Legal certainty on the applicable tax treatment can be obtained by filing a ruling request with the Office for Advance Tax Rulings. This service has recently published a list of questions that should allow both the taxpayer and the tax authorities to determine the appropriate tax treatment.23VATAs regards VAT  the European Court of Justice has ruled that the sale of non-traditional currencies falls under the same exemption as for transactions relating to traditional currencies.24 The Belgian VAT administration has included that decision in its administrative commentary without noteworthy remark.Other new business modelsi Smart contractsSelf-executing contracts  or 'smart contracts'  are in principle permitted under Belgian law. No specific legal framework has been established for this phenomenon. Therefore  common contract law applies. In Belgium  contracts can generally be concluded without formal requirements  subject to certain statutory exceptions (e.g.  consumer credit contracts). The computer code making up a smart contract can thus in principle constitute a valid contract  provided the validity requirements under Belgian contract law are met.25 Some tentative attempts to analyse smart contracts under Belgian contract law have thus far been made  but a considerable degree of legal uncertainty remains.26ii Robo-adviceAutomated investment advice  or 'robo-advice'  is relatively popular in Belgium. Within Europe  Belgium had the third-largest national portfolio  with €386 million invested with robo-advisers  equivalent to €34 per capita  in 2018.27 Financial regulations  such as MiFID II  apply to automated investment advice as they do for non-automated investment advice. This sometimes causes slight vexation among market participants  who feel that regulatory requirements are applied too strictly to online platforms.28Third-party websites comparing products or providing information about financial products are subject to data protection and competition rules. The vast majority of these rules are of EU origin. The GDPR applies and must be taken into account when users' personal data are being processed. Also  comparison platforms are in particular subject to the regime of Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the EU regulations and case law in this respect.iii Fintech contact pointFor new business models in the fintech realm  the FSMA launched a FinTech Contact Point in June 2016.29 This contact point is designed as a portal through which fintech entrepreneurs can contact the financial supervisor. This allows entrepreneurs to familiarise themselves with financial legislation and to ask any questions they may have. It also enables the FSMA to closely monitor fintech developments in Belgium. In April 2017  the portal launched by the FSMA evolved into a joint portal of the FSMA and the NBB. Fintech players  which are not necessarily aware of the twin peaks supervision model in Belgium  thus have a single point of contact; they do not need to find out in advance to which supervisor they need to ask their questions. Questions lodged with the fintech portal are managed jointly by the FSMA and NBB teams. Since the launch of the fintech portal in 2016  a considerable number of entrepreneurs have reached out to the supervisory authorities. Their questions cover a wide range of topics  such as cryptocurrencies  robo-advice  crowdfunding and price comparison.30Intellectual property and data protectioni Intellectual propertyAnything that is not a technical solution  including schemes  rules and methods for performing mental acts  playing games or doing business  and software as such  is excluded from patent protection. This does  however  not preclude software-based inventions that are implemented in hardware from patent protection  provided that all applicable conditions are fulfilled.Software and business models may also be protected by copyright if they meet the originality requirement. For acquiring copyright protection  no formalities need to be fulfilled. Only the expression of the software or business model will be protected  and not the underlying ideas or principles.The object and source code  architecture  structure and organisation of the software are considered the 'expression of the software'. A graphic user interface does not enable the reproduction of the software and is therefore not considered an expression of the software. Consequently  a graphic user interface cannot be protected under the Software Act  but only by common copyright law.Unless otherwise specified in the employment contract  the employee that is the creator of an original work will own the copyright on that work. The same applies to contractors. With regard to software  however  there is a legal presumption that the employer is the copyright owner of the original software created by the employee.No specific compensation regime is provided for by law  allowing parties to freely agree on potential compensation for any intellectual property created.ii Data protectionFintech companies that are based in the EU  or that offer goods or services to natural persons (data subjects) in the EU or monitor their behaviour  have to comply with the principles and obligations of the GDPR and the Belgian Act of 30 July 2018 when processing personal data. If the client data consists of information relating to an identified or identifiable data subject  the data will be qualified as personal data.Profiling refers to the creation and use of profiles of data subjects based on common characteristics (e.g.  preferences  financial status). Depending on the objective of the profiling  it will be treated differently. The use of profiles to create recommendations and personalise the client experience  for instance  will not be treated the same way as the use of profiles to automatically reject credit applications or otherwise significantly impact the rights of the data subject.In the first scenario  in other words  for a mere scoring or evaluation  the general rules of the GDPR will apply  and the specific requirements to carry out a data protection impact assessment (DPIA) may apply in Belgium (as well as elsewhere)  depending on the other circumstances of the processing (e.g.  data enrichment via other sources  scale of processing). For the second scenario  a DPIA will in any event be required under the GDPR  and specific requirements apply in relation to the permitted legal grounds for the processing  the categories of personal data that may be taken into account and data subject rights.In each scenario  a risk assessment will be needed to determine whether the supervisory authority must be consulted in relation to the project.European Data Protection Board Guidelines 06/2020 on the interplay of the second Payment Services Directive and the GDPR  published on 15 December 2020  aim to clarify the relation between PSD II and the GDPR.Year in reviewIn 2021  the new European licensing regime for crowdfunding service providers was implemented and organised.The caps that apply for investment in start-ups and scale-ups to benefit from the tax shelter regime have been increased as from 1 January 2021.2021 was also the year in which a registration regime was prepared for providers of exchange services between virtual and fiat currencies  and custodian wallet providers. Legislative work resulted in the Virtual Currency Exchange Services Act and the related draft royal decree. These texts  among others  impose an obligation on certain crypto service providers to register with the FSMA before providing their services in Belgium. The FSMA has been busy preparing for this pending registration obligation.Outlook and conclusionsAlthough there is no regulatory sandbox in place  and there are  to our knowledge  no plans to introduce this sandbox  Belgium can be seen as a fintech-friendly jurisdiction.The Fintech Contact Point will continue to be helpful in guiding start-ups and established firms through the complex regulatory framework and the licensing process. Both the FSMA and the NBB tend to be approachable and supportive of new fintech business models  and we expect this to only increase in the future.For crypto companies  the entry into force of the Virtual Currency Exchange Services Act and the related draft royal decree is something to take into account when doing business in Belgium.,neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,negative,0.04,0.28,0.68,True,English,"['digital markets', 'payment services', 'review', 'funding', 'Belgium', 'Belgian Federal Science Policy Office', 'various large market infrastructure players', 'smart cash-flow forecasting firm', 'General Data Protection Regulation', 'secure financial messaging services', 'several general tax incentives', 'joint FinTech Contact Point', 'regulatory financial services framework', 'inexperienced market participants', 'qualified intellectual property', 'R&D) expenses', 'collective bargaining agreements', 'specific tax incentives', 'financial regulatory framework', 'innovative financial products', 'payments system vendor', 'alternative funding platforms', 'professional withholding tax', 'various fintech giants', 'many fintech stakeholders', 'Belgian tax law', 'Innovation income deduction', 'corporate income tax', 'personal income tax', 'New York Mellon', 'Belgian fintech sector', 'effective tax rate', 'Belgian market', 'financial system', 'internal market', 'first regulation', 'various initiatives', 'single point', 'various topics', 'regulatory climate', 'Belgian Act', 'payment services', 'financial instruments', 'financial regulators', 'financial professionals', 'Tax incentivesGeneral', 'net income', 'Belgian companies', 'crowdfunding services', 'regulatory sandbox', 'crowdfunding platforms', 'increasing importance', 'legislative bodies', 'global provider', 'European initiatives', 'PSD II', 'money laundering', 'terrorist financing', 'MiFID II', 'particular relevance', 'European level', 'important focus', 'supervisory activities', 'key role', 'Section VI', 'considerable number', 'important platform', 'start-up entrepreneurs', 'ongoing dialogue', 'fintech-related topics', 'friendly jurisdiction', '25 per cent', '85 per cent', '3.75 per cent', 'original creations', 'derived works', 'originality threshold', 'binding opinion', 'nexus approach', 'other words', 'qualifying research', 'advanced payment', 'cash flow', '10 per cent', '20 per cent', 'following criteria', 'balance sheet', 'yearly turnover', 'average number', 'yearly basis', 'EU financial', 'fintech companies', ""small' company"", 'small companies', 'questions Overview', 'home country', 'FinTech Belgium', ""micro' company"", 'light', 'presence', 'Brussels', 'Brexit', 'Clear2Pay', 'CashForce', 'Swift', 'Euroclear', 'Bank', 'Mastercard', 'Lloyd', 'London', 'majority', 'rules', 'Directive', '25 November', '20 May', 'prevention', 'use', 'purposes', 'AMLD', 'markets', 'GDPR', 'legislation', '10 November', 'jungle', 'regulations', 'Legal', 'case', 'UK', 'safety', 'industry', 'provision', 'licence', 'launch', 'enquiries', 'robo-advice', 'cryptocurrencies', 'community', 'investors', 'conferences', 'seminars', 'measures', 'Software', '1 July', 'practice', 'Belspo', 'extent', 'development', 'rise', 'Exemption', 'remittance', 'obligation', 'salaries', 'employees', 'Treasury', 'oxygen', 'regard', 'scope', '5 December', '15']",2022-04-23,2022-04-23,lexology.com

The proposal is based on the incentive scheme that was adopted by the 2019  2020 and 2021 annual general meetings. It has been initiated by Cantargia's board of directors and has been designed in collaboration with external advisors and prepared by the remuneration committee and examined at board meetings.Purpose and scope of the schemeIn order to create a long-term incentive for the company's management team and to promote investments in and ownership of Cantargia shares  all members of the company's management team  including the CEO  as well as other key personnel will be offered variable long-term remuneration in the form of a group bonus for acquisition of shares of the company (the ""Scheme""). The Scheme is a variable long-term remuneration scheme under which the participants commit to use distributed variable cash remuneration to acquire shares in the company. The participants will acquire the shares on the stock market. The Scheme applies in addition to any variable remuneration in accordance with the remuneration guidelines adopted at the 2020 annual general meeting. It is intended that the Scheme shall recur annually.The maximum pay out to each Scheme participant for 2022 is capped at 10 per cent of the participant's base cash salary. The total size of the Scheme for 2022 is capped at SEK 2 300 000  excluding social security contributions. In case of partial target achievement  a portion of the maximum amount will be distributed.Performance requirements and target achievementThe Scheme is based on the annual bonus target or targets set up by the company's board of directors and that refer to the company's activities  financial key performance indicators and internal processes. The resolution on the annual amount available under the Scheme will be integrated in the annual evaluation process for the total variable remuneration in order to link annual performances to long-term targets  to increase employee shareholding in Cantargia and to retain competent staff at competitive terms.Target achievement will be assessed by the company's board of directors in connection with the adoption of the annual report for each year. To be entitled to a portion of the group bonus for acquisition of shares under the Scheme  the employee must be a permanent employee. In addition  the employee must have been employed by the company for at least one year. A draft resolution on which employees that will be subject to the Scheme will be drawn up by the remuneration committee in consultation with the CEO. The board of directors will resolve upon which employees that will be subject to the Scheme.Distribution and acquisition of Cantargia shareWhen the target achievement has been determined by the company's board of directors  the amount will be distributed to each participant in the Scheme within four weeks of the adoption of the annual report. The acquisition of shares by the participant shall be made as soon as possible after the distribution from the company. In the event the participant is prevented from acquiring shares of the company  due to for example applicable market abuse regulations  the company's board of directors may permit that the acquisition of shares under the Scheme takes place at a later stage.Participants are required to use their entire remuneration under the Scheme  net of tax  to acquire Cantargia shares on the stock market. Shares acquired by a participant under the Scheme must be held by the participant under a three-year period after the distribution.The company will pay social-security contributions on variable remuneration distributed under the Scheme. However  the remuneration distributed under the Scheme will not entitle to pension contributions or holiday pay in addition to what is provided under mandatory legislation.Termination of employment or breach of contractA participant whose employment ceases as a result of termination by the employee or by the company or for otherreasons will be required to continue to hold shares acquired in accordance with the provisions of the Scheme.In the event a participant violates the terms of the Scheme  for example by failing to provide information on the status of its shareholding  the company may require that the participant sells all shares acquired under the Scheme  whereby the gross amount received by the participant through the sale shall be reimbursed to the company. In the event the participant sells shares in breach of the terms of the Scheme  the participant is required to pay a penalty to the company corresponding to the gross amount that the employee has received through the sale of the shares.Principles for annual variable remuneration and the SchemeWhen designing the annual variable remuneration and the Scheme  the board of directors shall consider introducing conditions which:disqualify a person from future participation in variable or long-term remuneration schemes  if that person sells shares in breach of the provisions of the Scheme;make the distribution of a certain portion of such remuneration contingent on that the performance  on which the remuneration is based  proves to be sustainable over time;give the company the right to reclaim remuneration which has been distributed based on information which subsequently has proved to be manifestly incorrect; andstipulate that distribution to a participant shall be entirely or partially delayed  reduced or cancelled if the payment  in the view of the board of directors  is considered inappropriate with regards to the company's results  position or liquidity situation.Share issue authorization (item 15)The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize to the board  up and until the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without pre-emptive rights for shareholders  to resolve on the issue of new shares  provided that such issue or issues may not comprise a total of more than 10 per cent of the number of outstanding shares in the company as per the day of the annual general meeting. It shall also be possible to make such an issue resolution stipulating in-kind payment  the right to offset debt or other conditions.The purpose of the authorization is to raise working capital for the company. If the board resolves on a share issue with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  the reason therefor shall be to raise working capital for the company  to provide new shareholders of strategic importance to the company or to acquire other companies or businesses.____________________Other informationComplete documentation is available at the company's offices  Scheelevägen 27 in Lund  Sweden  and at the company's website (www.cantargia.com) no later than three weeks prior to the meeting.

Item 14 – Resolution to adopt a long-term incentive programme for senior executives and key individuals in the Byggfakta group The Board of Directors of Byggfakta proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long term  share based  employee stock option program (“LTI 2022/2025”). The purpose of the proposed LTI 2022/2025 is to ensure that key employees  high potentials  senior management executives  and senior executives within the Byggfakta Group shall be given the opportunity to become long-term shareholders and take part in  and work for  a positive value development of the share in the Company during the period covered by the proposed LTI 2022/2025  and that the Byggfakta Group shall be able to retain and recruit competent and committed staff. The board considers the LTI 2022/2025 as advantageous to the Company and its shareholders.The LTI 2022/2025 shall in total comprise of no more than 2 200 000 shares  which corresponds to approximately one (1) per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the Company. The board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on the introduction of the LTI 2022/2025  including the right for the board to repurchase outstanding shares and the approval of the transfer of the shares in accordance with essentially the below guidelines. The intention of the board is that this is a long-term initiative why the board aim to propose long-term incentive programs also to future annual general meetings. 14 a) Implementation of LTI 2022/2025 The maximum number of employee stock options to be allotted will be 2 200 000.The employee stock options shall be offered to senior executives and executives (eight (8) persons)  senior management (seven (7) persons) and other key employees and high potentials in the Company and its subsidiaries (approx. eighty-five (85) persons) (the “Participants”)  in accordance with the following allocation: the CEO of the Company shall be allocated a maximum of 200 000 employee stock options  the CFO of the Company shall be allocated a maximum of 150 000 employee stock options  and other senior executives shall together be allocated a maximum of 575 000 employee stock options;seven (7) persons within senior management shall together be allocated a maximum of 350 000 employee stock options  andapprox. eighty-five (85) high potentials and other key employees  who shall together be allocated a maximum 925 000 employee stock options.In order to be able to recruit competent employees  employee stock options under LTI 2022/2025 may be offered also to future employees (within the categories of employees set out above) provided that the total number of employee stock options does not exceed the maximum and that the employment commence before 31 December 2022 . The board shall decide upon the allotment within the limits set above. The employee stock options shall be allotted without consideration. Each employee stock option entitles the Participant to acquire one (1) share in the Company at an exercise price corresponding to 120 per cent of volume-weighted average share price pursuant to the official share price list of Nasdaq Stockholm during the five-day trading days period preceding the annual general meeting 2022. The exercise price and the number of shares that each employee stock option entitles to may be subject to recalculation due to bonus issue  share split  preferential rights issue and similar measures. The employee stock options can be exercised to acquire shares in the Company during the time period starting 15 May 2025   up to and including 16 June 2025 . The employee stock options will be possible to exercise earlier in the event of e.g. compulsory redemption of shares  liquidation  merger or a change of control. Exercise of employee stock options presupposes  as a rule  that the Participant remains employed in the Byggfakta Group during the entirety of LTI 2022/2025. Certain exemptions to this requirement may be prescribed in specific cases  including a Participant’s death  disability  retirement or the divestiture through a sale  spin-off or otherwise of the Participant’s employing company from the Byggfakta Group . The employee stock options shall not constitute securities and are non-transferable. The board shall decide on the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2022/2025. The board shall be entitled to deviate from or adjust the terms and conditions as a result of local regulations and practice. If material changes would occur within the Byggfakta Group or on the market that  according to the board’s assessment  would lead to the conditions for allocation of employee stock options no longer being reasonable  the board will have the right to make also other adjustments of the LTI 2022/2025  including e.g. a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of employee stock options. In order to implement LTI 2022/2025 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the board has considered various methods for delivery of shares upon exercise of employee stock options. The board considers repurchase and transfer of own shares as its preferred option  and thus proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on transfer of own shares in accordance with b) below. However  should the annual general meeting not approve the proposed transfer of own shares to participants in the program  in accordance with item 14b ii) below  the Board of Directors propose (see 14b iii) below) that the board of should be allowed to enter into a hedging arrangement with a third party to hedge the obligations of the Company to deliver shares under the program. Costs and dilution etc. for the LTI 2022/2025The employee stock options are expected to incur costs for the Byggfakta Group in the form of social security charges upon exercise  as well as accounting costs according to IFRS 2 during the period the employee stock options remain outstanding. The Company does not intend to make any hedging or similar arrangements in respect of the costs relating to the social security charges. These costs are preliminary estimated to amount to approximately SEK 23.2 million . The calculation of the costs has been carried out based on  inter alia  the following: (i) the price of the Company’s shares at Nasdaq Stockholm amounting to SEK 45.72 per share at the time of the allotment and to SEK 68.58 per share at the third anniversary of the allotment  (ii) the exercise price determined in accordance with the proposed above amounting to SEK 54.86   (iii) 100 per cent of employee stock options allotted in the program are exercised  (iv) the risk-free interest rate is 1.1 per cent and volatility amounts to 28 per cent. The LTI 2022/2025 will not entail any dilution effect  as the program is proposed to be hedged by already issued shares. Information on other outstanding share incentive programmesThe Company has one ongoing incentive programme based on warrants for certain board members of the Company that was approved by the extraordinary general meeting held on 14 September 2021 . Information regarding the Company’s current incentive programme is available at the Company’s website  www.byggfaktagroup.com. Preparation of the matterThe principles for the LTI 2022/2025 have been prepared by the board. The proposal has been prepared with the support of external advisors and after consultations with major shareholders. The board has subsequently decided to present this proposal to the annual general meeting. Apart from the employees who prepared the matter in accordance with instructions from the board  no employee who may be covered by the program participated in the drafting of the terms. 14 b) Resolution on repurchase and transfer of own shares(i) The board proposes that the annual general meeting resolve to authorise the board to resolve on repurchase of shares in the Company in relation to LTI 2022/2025 according to the following:Acquisitions may be made of no more than 2 200 000 shares in order to secure the delivery obligations of shares to participants in the LTI 2022/2025.The shares may only be acquired on Nasdaq Stockholm.The authorisation may be exercised on one or more occasions  until the 2023 annual general meeting.The shares may only be acquired at a price per share within the from time to time registered trading interval. (ii) The board proposes that the annual general meeting resolve to transfer shares in the Company in relation to LTI 2022/2025 according to the following: No more than 2 200 000 shares may be transferred. The right to acquire shares shall  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  be granted to the Participants of LTI 2022/2025. Furthermore  subsidiaries within the Byggfakta Group shall have the right to acquire shares  free of consideration  and such subsidiaries shall be obligated to  in accordance with LTI 2022/2025 immediately transfer shares to Participants in the program. Transfer to the participants of LTI 2022/2025 shall be made at the time  at the price and on the other terms and conditions of LTI 2022/2025 at which participants of the program are entitled to acquire shares. Payment for the shares will be made within the time and on the terms stipulated in the terms and conditions for the LTI 2022/2025. The number of shares in the Company that may be transferred under LTI 2022/2025 will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events. The reason for the proposed transfer and for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is an integral part of the implementation of the LTI 2022/2025 and the board considers that the implementation of the LTI 2022/2025 will be to the advantage of the Company and the shareholders as it offers participants the opportunity to become shareholders in the Company. iii) Hedging agreementsShould the annual general meeting not resolve in accordance with the proposal under ii) above the board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that the board (on behalf of the Company) shall be authorized to enter into hedging agreements with third parties to secure the Company’s obligations to deliver the shares under LTI 20225/2025. Item 15 – Resolution to authorise the board of directors to resolve on new share issues The Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  to resolve on new share issues. The authorisation may be utilised for new issues of shares  which may be made with provisions regarding contribution in cash  in kind or through set-off corresponding to not more than ten (10) per cent of the registered share capital in the Company at the time of the issue resolution. The subscription price shall be determined on market terms and conditions. However  in order to enable delivery of shares in connection with a cash issue as described above  this may  if the Board of Directors deems it appropriate  be made at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares  whereby the issue is directed to an issuing agent that acts as a settlement bank for investors. Deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights shall be possible in connection with future investments in the form of acquisitions of operations  companies  shares in companies or otherwise for the Company’s future expansion. If the Board resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the rationale shall be that the Board shall be able to issue shares in the Company to be used as a means of in-kind payment or the right to offset debt or to in a flexible and cost-efficient manner raise capital to use as means of payment or to continuously adjust the Company’s capital structure. The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to make any adjustments or amendments of the above resolution which may be required in connection with the registration of such resolution and to take any other measure deemed necessary for the execution of the resolution. MISCELLANEOUS Special majority requirement The resolution of the annual general meeting to implement the program according to item 14 a) above requires that more than half of the votes cast at the annual general meeting approve the proposal.

The Annual General Meeting will commence at 9:00 a.m. (British Summer Time) on Wednesday  18 May 2022. Please be prepared to provide evidence of your shareholding and/or identity. If you are attending on behalf of a registered holder of shares you must bring photographic proof of identity and evidence of your appointment to represent that Shareholder.

We would politely remind you that the Directors will not answer questions relating to the individual rights of Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting itself  but if you wish to submit such a question by email  we will respond to the extent we are able.4. ResolutionsThe business to be conducted at the Annual General Meeting consists of consideration of the following Resolutions. All the Resolutions are proposed as ordinary resolutions. This means that for each of those Resolutions to be passed  more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the Resolution. A “vote withheld” option will be provided to enable Shareholders to abstain on any Resolution. A vote withheld is not a vote in law and will not be counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes for and against a Resolution.Resolution 1 – Annual Report and AccountsThe Directors are required by the Act to lay before the Company in general meeting copies of the directors’ reports  the independent auditor’s report and the audited financial statements of the Company in respect of each financial year. For the financial year ended 31 December 2021  these are all contained in the UK Annual Report.In accordance with best practice  the Company proposes an ordinary resolution to receive and adopt the UK Annual Report  a copy of which may be found at: https://investors.exscientia.ai/financials-and-filings/.Resolution 2 – Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration ReportIn accordance with section 439 of the Act  Shareholders are requested to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Report. This is a new requirement for the Company as it was a quoted company under the Act for the financial year ended 31 December 2021. The Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on pages 55 to 81 of the UK Annual Report.The Board considers that appropriate remuneration of Directors plays a vital part in helping to achieve the Company’s overall objectives. We encourage Shareholders to read the Directors’ Remuneration Report. The Board and the Remuneration Committee believe that the policies and procedures as articulated in the Directors’ Remuneration Report are effective and that as a result of these policies and procedures we have and will continue to have high-quality directors. Our UK statutory auditors  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP  have audited those parts of the Directors’ Remuneration Report that are required to be audited. The Board has approved and signed the report in accordance with the Act.4This vote is advisory and non-binding and the Directors’ entitlement to receive remuneration is not conditional on it. Payments made or promised to Directors will not have to be repaid  reduced or withheld in the event that the Resolution is not passed. Although non-binding  the Board and Remuneration Committee will review and consider the voting results when making future decisions regarding Directors’ remuneration.Resolution 3 – Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration PolicyIn accordance with section 439A of the Act  a resolution to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Policy section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report is required to be put to a vote by Shareholders. The vote is binding which means that payments  including for loss of office  cannot be made to current  past or future Directors unless that payment is consistent with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy or has been approved by a resolution of the Shareholders. The Directors’ Remuneration Policy must be put to Shareholders for approval at least every three years.The Directors’ Remuneration Policy is being tabled for approval at the 2022 Annual General Meeting as the Company was a quoted company under the Act for the financial year ended 31 December 2021. Resolution 3 is therefore an ordinary resolution to approve the Directors’ Remuneration Policy  which is set out in full on pages 58 to 70 of the UK Annual Report. If approved  this Directors’ Remuneration Policy will take effect immediately after the end of the Annual General Meeting  and will remain valid until replaced by a new or amended Policy (expected to occur at the 2025 annual general meeting of the Company).If Resolution 3 is not approved  we may not be able to pay the expected remuneration to our Directors  which could materially harm our ability to retain and recruit directors. In addition  the Company would need to incur expense in holding another general meeting to consider a revised policy.Resolutions 4 – Re-appointment of a DirectorIn accordance with the Articles  the Directors are divided into three classes designated as “Class I”  “Class II” and “Class III”. Only the Directors in Class I are required by article 81.2 of the Articles to retire and offer themselves for re-appointment at the 2022 Annual General Meeting of the Company. At the following two annual general meetings  the Directors in Class II and Class III  respectively  shall retire from office and be eligible for re-appointment.The current Class I Directors are Robert Ghenchev and Joanne Xu. In accordance with this requirement Robert Ghenchev will retire and offer himself for re-appointment as a Director at the Annual General Meeting. Joanne Xu has informed the Board that she will not be standing for re-appointment and will therefore retire at the Annual General Meeting.Robert Ghenchev is recommended by the Board for re-appointment.Resolution 4 is an ordinary resolution to re-appoint Robert Ghenchev as a Director.Notes to resolution 4Robert GhenchevNon-Executive DirectorRobert Ghenchev has served on the Board since May 2020. Mr. Ghenchev has been employed by Novo Holdings since January 2018 (and since August 2019  by its wholly owned subsidiary  Novo Holdings Equity US Inc.  which provides certain consulting services to Novo Holdings). He is currently employed as a Senior Partner  with responsibility over Growth Equity investments. Before joining Novo Holdings  Mr. Ghenchev was a Senior Vice President at Moelis & Company in London from April 2010 to January 2018  where he focused on mergers and acquisitions within the healthcare industry. Prior to Moelis  Mr. Ghenchev was part of the UK Mergers & Acquisitions team at Deutsche Bank in London from June 2007 to April 2010. Mr. Ghenchev also currently serves on the Boards of Tempus Labs  Inc.  Oxford Biomedica plc  Mission Bio  Inc. and MightyOwl  Inc. Mr. Ghenchev holds a J.Hons. B.A. degree in Finance and Economics from McGill University and a M.Sc. degree in Financial Economics from the University of Oxford. We believe that Mr. Ghenchev’s experience in finance and business development qualifies him to serve on the Board.Resolutions 5 and 6 – Appointment and remuneration of the auditorThe Company is required to appoint an auditor at each general meeting at which accounts are laid before the members  to hold office until the conclusion of the next such meeting. Resolution 5 is an ordinary resolution to re-appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the Company’s auditor to hold office until the conclusion of the next annual general meeting at which accounts are laid.Resolution 6 is an ordinary resolution to authorise the Directors to determine the auditors’ remuneration.The Audit Committee will continue to consider the reappointment of the external auditor each year before making a recommendation to the Board.5Resolution 7 – Approval of Share Repurchase Contracts and CounterpartiesThe Company may only repurchase its Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) in accordance with the procedures under the Act for “off-market purchases.” As such  these repurchases may only be made pursuant to a form of share repurchase contract that has been approved by Shareholders. In addition  the Company may only conduct share repurchases with counterparties approved by Shareholders. Resolution 7 seeks approval of two forms of Share Repurchase Contracts and stated counterparties as detailed below. These approvals  if granted  will be valid for five years.Approval of the forms of contract and counterparties is not an approval of the amount or timing of any repurchase activity. At the present time  the Company has no plans to repurchase its Ordinary Shares or ADSs. There can be no assurance as to whether the Company will repurchase any of its Ordinary Shares or as to the amount of any such repurchases or the prices at which such repurchases may be made.The Company is seeking authority to make off-market purchases of its Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) pursuant to this resolution. In certain circumstances  it may be advantageous for the Company to purchase its own shares. If this proposal is approved  the Board may approve the repurchase of Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs). The Directors will exercise this power only when  in light of market conditions prevailing at the time  they believe that the effect of such purchases will be in the best interests and to the corporate benefit of Shareholders generally. The Directors consider it to be desirable for this general authority to be available to provide flexibility in the management of the Company’s capital resources.Material Contract TermsThe Company is seeking the approval of Shareholders of two forms of Share Repurchase Contract:· The form of agreement attached as Appendix A to this document provides that the counterparty will purchase Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) at such prices and in such quantities as the Company may instruct from time to time  subject to the limitations set forth in Rule 10b-18 of the Exchange Act. The agreement provides that the counterparty will purchase the Ordinary Shares as principal and sell any Ordinary Shares purchased to the Company.· The form of agreement attached as Appendix B to this document is a form of repurchase plan that the Company may enter into from time to time pursuant to Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act to purchase a specified dollar amount of Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) each day if the ADSs are trading below a specified limit price. The amount to be purchased each day  the limit price  and the total amount that may be purchased under the agreement will be determined at the time the plan is executed. The agreement provides that the counterparty will purchase the Ordinary Shares as principal and sell any Ordinary Shares purchased to the Company.Counterparties for ApprovalThe Company may only enter into Share Repurchase Contracts with counterparties approved by its Shareholders. The Company  therefore  seeks approval to conduct repurchases through the following counterparties (“Counterparties”) (or their subsidiaries or affiliates from time to time):· Bank of America Corporation· Barclays Capital Inc.· Citigroup Global Markets Inc.· Cowen Inc.· Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC· Evercore ISI· Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC· Guggenheim Securities  LLC· H.C. Wainwright & Co.  LLC· Jefferies LLC· J.P. Morgan Securities  LLC· Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC· Oppenheimer & Co. Inc.· Piper Sandler & Co.· SVB Leerink LLC· Wells Fargo Securities  LLC· William Blair & Company  L.L.C6Copies of the Share Repurchase Contracts and the list of the Counterparties will be made available for Shareholders to inspect at the Company’s registered office at The Schrodinger Building  Oxford Science Park  Oxford  Oxfordshire  OX4 4GE  United Kingdom  for the period of 15 days ending on the date of the Annual General Meeting. Copies of the Share Repurchase Contracts and the list of the Counterparties will also be available for inspection at the Annual General Meeting.Resolution 8 – Off-market purchase of Deferred SharesThe Deferred Shares were created in connection with the reorganisation of Company’s share capital undertaken in connection with its initial public offering in 2021. The Board can see no reason for the Deferred Shares to remain in issue and recommends that the Deferred Shares are purchased by the Company and cancelled. The Deferred Shares have no economic value.Under the provisions of the Articles  the Company has the power to purchase all of the Deferred Shares in consideration for an amount not exceeding £1.00. In addition  the Company has the irrevocable authority to appoint any person to execute on behalf of any holder of Deferred Shares a transfer of all or any of those shares and/or an agreement to transfer the same to such person or persons as the Company may determine and to execute any other documents which such person may consider necessary or desirable to effect such transfer.Under the provisions of the Act  the Company may repurchase the Deferred Shares as part of an off-market transaction pursuant to a contract approved by Shareholders. The Company is seeking the approval of Shareholders of the Deferred Shares Repurchase Contract attached as Appendix C to this document. The authority to purchase the Deferred Shares shall expire five years after the date of the Annual General Meeting  although if Resolution 8 is passed the Board intends to affect the repurchase of all the Deferred Shares currently in issue shortly after the Annual General Meeting. Following the repurchase  the Deferred Shares will be cancelled in accordance with section 706 of the Act.In accordance with the Act  a copy of the Deferred Shares Repurchase Contract attached as Appendix C will be made available to the Shareholders to inspect at the Company’s registered office at The Schrodinger Building  Oxford Science Park  Oxford  Oxfordshire  OX4 4GE  United Kingdom  for a period of 15 days ending on the date of the Annual General Meeting  and  again  at the Annual General Meeting.5. Directors’ recommendation and voting intentionsThe Directors consider the Resolutions to be in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly  the Directors unanimously recommend that Shareholders vote in favour of the Resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting  as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings amounting  in aggregate  to 18 815 900 Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs)  representing approximately 15.49 per cent. of the Company’s total voting rights as at 19 April 2022  the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document.Yours faithfully  /s/ David Nicholson David Nicholson Chairman7NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGEXSCIENTIA PLC(incorporated and registered in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 with registered number 13483814)NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN that the Annual General Meeting of Exscientia plc (the “Company”) will be held at 9:00 a.m. (British Summer Time) on Wednesday  18 May 2022 at Magdalen College  71 High Street  Oxford OX1 4AU  United Kingdom to consider  and if thought fit  pass the following resolutions which will each be proposed as ordinary resolutions.ORDINARY RESOLUTIONS1.

3428,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4503138-clearbridge-investments-global-growth-strategy-q1-2022-commentary,ClearBridge Investments Global Growth Strategy Q1 2022 Commentary,10 hours ago,chuyu/iStock via Getty ImagesMarket OverviewGlobal equities were faced with numerous risks in the first quarter  ranging from resurging COVID-19 cases in large geographies like China to inflation and potential monetary tightening globally  before Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24 overshadowed all else. Europe was most directly impacted by the conflict as crude oil and natural gas prices spiked and already-challenged supply chains were further pressured. The benchmark MSCI All Country World Index declined 5.36% while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 6.97%. Value outperformed growth by substantial margins with the MSCI AC World. Value declining 0.95% for the period while the MSCI AC World Growth fell 9.72%.One of the key drivers of the rotation from growth to value stocks was action in the bond market. A significant rise in long- term bond yields reflected heightened inflationary pressures in the global economy and the outlook for tighter monetary policy. Higher rates are typically a short-term headwind to long- duration assets such as growth stocks. And while  in the longer run  high-quality growth stocks can typically pass on inflation  the sudden and sharp spike in bond yields puts pressure on near-term valuations.Exhibit 1: MSCI Growth vs. Value PerformanceSource: FactSet.There has been a lot of debate about whether inflation is as permanent post-COVID. A certain amount of inventory restocking was needed to cure supply chain disruptions impacted by frictional costs and labor shortages. Manufacturing finally seemed to have found its footing and ports were reopening. China  the world's largest consumer of commodity goods  has been easing economic policies for some time to tackle a broad real estate problem and navigate further COVID-19 lockdowns continuing to slow its economy. These actions should have ameliorated significant commodity pressures -- until war broke out. Coupled with the potential for Russia to now control significant parts of the food supply output and other key materials and minerals  the calculus shifted overnight.U.S. equities were most impacted by a monetary tightening cycle. The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates 25 basis points in March  ending a period of unprecedented accommodation  and projected at least six more rate increases through year end. We believe the rate cycle could last through 2023 with the neutral interest rate approaching 3%. Growth stocks have historically been pressured leading into a tightening cycle and the past three months have tracked that pattern. What's different this time is the speed of the Fed's shift from a gradual withdrawal of liquidity in the second half of 2021 to an aggressive program to attack the highest U.S. inflation in 40 years. Growth equities tend to stabilize and deliver better performance once a tightening cycle is underway and we view the ClearBridge Global Growth Strategy as well- positioned to participate in this potential leadership shift.Under these conditions  the Strategy underperformed its core MSCI ACWI benchmark. This is to be expected but doesn't mean we are satisfied with the results. Our observation is that in these types of markets  the Strategy tends to underperform until more balance is achieved in the market between growth and value.Simplistically  the index is a blend of both value and growth stocks. However  similar to the first quarter of 2021 (Exhibit 1) - when the value component outperformed so meaningfully - it remains tilted to whatever is doing the best  and this quarter it was value. In virtually every sector  the stocks we identify most as value did the best.On a sector and industry basis  energy (+21.15%) and materials (+2.75%)  given the invasion impact  did well. We evaluate and own these types of stocks within our structural bucket if we believe they will see a step change in forward returns at attractive valuations. While the structural bucket is a component of our diversified approach to growth  the portfolio also remains invested in growth companies with a significant overweight to information technology (IT); these names underperformed in a narrow  one-sided value market.Europe and the U.K.  which combined represent the Strategy's largest regional overweights  were a microcosm of these cross currents. Early in the first quarter  economies were still influenced by COVID-19  but a peak in cases was in sight and reopening was underway. Markets played the improvements  rates moved moderately  consumer spending picked up and services like travel recovered from depressed levels. War in Ukraine changed the picture dramatically. Inflation picked up even further  driven by higher natural gas  oil and agricultural commodity prices  which will be passed on to the consumer. Germany's inflation passed the 7% level last seen after the 1990 reunification. The war has caused manufacturing and consumer sentiment to plunge.While natural gas is still flowing from Russia to Europe  a serious reduction or complete shut off of Russian gas could lead to a recession in Europe  which is the growing consensus view. We don't agree  however  as we believe Europe has the support structures and spending capacity to keep the incipient post- COVID-19 recovery intact. The telltale signs of recession  such as European credit spreads widening  have not happened.Positively  the urgency of energy security has accelerated spending on renewable energy. The EU commission has proposed a new measure regarding energy security and plans to reduce European dependence on Russian natural gas. REPowerEU emphasizes two pillars in order to reduce reliance on Russian gas and drive resilience: diversifying gas supplies  mostly via higher liquified natural gas imports; and more rapidly reducing fossil fuel use by boosting energy efficiency while increasing renewables and electrification. Many wind and solar projects will accelerate with easier permitting and financing.The Strategy is well-exposed to this secular shift and to accelerated spending on alternative energy sourcing and generation. Growth in renewables should benefit EDP  an operator of wind farms for power generation  and SolarEdge (SEDG)  a company we repurchased on weakness in the first quarter that develops electronics for solar installations and should take advantage of greater incentives for solar installations in many geographies. The company has expanded its products offering to address larger markets in commercial and utility solar on top of its traditional residential solar market. The acceleration in electrification of transport should support electric vehicle-related stocks like TE Connectivity (TEL). In addition  industrial gases provider Air Liquide is developing carbon capture technology to help mitigate emissions while industrial manufacturer Atlas Copco (OTCPK:ATLCY) should benefit from demand for greater efficiency in mid-voltage applications such as energy-efficient compressors.The conflict could also boost the trend toward reshoring or near- shoring supply chains and production. Market worries about China's intentions toward Taiwan  which could alter the global balance of power in semiconductors  have hastened the near- shoring of semi production globally. Such growing risks are hastening the need to build new capacity in the U.S.  Eastern Europe  Canada and Mexico  and they should result in a positive  multiyear  capex-heavy trend for Western companies. Such a transition would most directly benefit the Strategy's structural growth companies  a bucket we have been increasing (and that now accounts for more than 40% of portfolio assets) to better manage the volatile risk/reward environment in global markets.Portfolio PositioningWe increased our financials exposure with four new additions during the quarter. Exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (OTCPK:DBOEY)  a company with higher rate sensitivity and a higher orientation toward financial data  operates a fund administration business with recurring revenues that have allowed these non-transaction divisions to do well. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM)  which should benefit from a consolidating bank market and higher rates as Canada catches up with the U.S. in terms of reopening and GDP growth recovery. In the U.S.  we added Raymond James Financial (RJF)  a regional wealth management firm that has a solid asset gathering story and interest rate sensitivity  as well as Bank of America (BAC)  which also has significant rate sensitivity and should see business improvements from increased technology spending.Also within the structural bucket  we added a position in Deere (DE)  a major global player in agricultural  construction and forestry equipment  with a particularly dominant position in U.S. agriculture. Deere's moat around its core equipment capabilities  coupled with years of substantial investments in technology and innovation  further extends its competitive advantage into precision agriculture  which allows for higher farm yields with lower use of fertilizers  pesticides and water  thereby improving farmers' bottom lines while reducing their environmental footprint.The structural bucket has the shortest investment horizon across the spectrum of growth companies we target in the Strategy. We closely monitor the macro impacts and turnaround progress of these companies and will be disciplined sellers when the thesis for a holding plays out.We added to our secular growth bucket with the purchase of U.S. medical device maker Stryker (SYK). The company has a track record of good go to market execution and successful R&D investment that has generated consistent market share gains and consistent margin expansion. Approximately 45% of revenue comes from surgery equipment  35% from orthopedics and the balance from neurotechnology and spine products. In an uncertain macro environment  we believe that medical devices will be less volatile than some other end markets and with most of Stryker's revenue generated domestically  risk from weakness outside the U.S. is relatively lower.Most of our selling over the last several quarters has occurred among emerging growth companies  where we have reduced our exposure to just over 10% to better manage risk. Exits from the emerging growth bucket in the quarter included Latin America e- commerce platform MercadoLibre (MELI)  which has experienced an unwind of COVID-19-induced demand while high inflation and high interest rates in Brazil create new headwinds for consumer purchasing power  which will likely mean slower sales of high-ticket items on the company's platform. In addition  we sold out of British grocery delivery provider Ocado Group (OTCPK:OCDGF) following its much higher than expected capital spending  and U.S. social network Pinterest (PINS) over concerns about slowing user growth and engagement.Most of our reductions in emerging growth have involved IT or related companies where innovation is a key to their business model. That said  we remain positive on the IT sector and have largely maintained holdings in our highest-conviction ideas.During the quarter  we reduced our semiconductor exposure through a trim of ASML (ASML) to manage concerns of a slowdown due to the risk of double ordering and potential softness in some consumer end markets. We increased our position in IT services as we remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential these companies provide  which is underpinned by the compressed digital transformation cycle  rising cloud adoption and growth in data-driven insights. This included initiating a position in French design software firm Dassault Systèmes (OTCPK:DASTY).Despite the market volatility and hyper focus on rising rates  chief information officer surveys continue to forecast resilience in IT budgets this year. Growth in IT spending for 2022 is expected to remain above the 10-year pre-COVID-19 average  according to Morgan Stanley (MS). We believe this is a result of the strong secular underpinnings brought on by digital transformation and businesses focusing on increasing efficiencies through technology.New addition Olympus (OTCPK:OCPNY)  a Japanese precision equipment and medical device maker  is a good example. The company is the number one player in gastrointestinal endoscopy with 70% market share with an entrenched moat. Its therapeutic solutions division should continue to scale with new product investments in high-growth areas  coupled with improvement in procedural volumes from COVID-19 recovery. We are also seeing progress in a restructuring plan that will create a streamlined global medical technology company with improving profitability and a reliable governance structure.OutlookWe continue to invest for the long term and are willing to endure volatility as long as our secular thesis for owning a company has not been impacted. The post-COVID-19 hangover for our emerging growth bucket has been very tough  but we understand the risks  have culled the portfolio of several challenged stocks and see a way back for disruptive growth names.Growth company valuations tend to anticipate changes to input variables (in this case  interest rates) well in advance  and they have largely derated following a predictive path. That said  valuations are largely in check - even in the U.S. - after a significant drawdown and are now set up much better than just six months ago. The market is challenging growth where  in some cases  there is not a fundamental issue. This creates an opportunity for us to underwrite investments where our advantage over consensus is the durability of growth.From a regional standpoint  we continue to see promise in Europe and are increasing our exposure to regions like Canada through companies well-suited for developing trends around energy security and supply chains. While headline inflation remains high across Europe  the region does not face the same wage pressures as the U.S.  which could temper the increasing hawkish stance of policymakers once the Ukraine situation becomes more settled.Without question  higher energy and agricultural commodity prices creates new challenges for emerging markets  where we greatly reduced exposure in 2021. We expect continued volatility around both economic performance and political change to remain a feature of these markets.In the U.S.  we are entering a period of policy reversal that should lead to a normalization of capital market returns and economic growth from a peak everything environment (liquidity  profit margins  global growth). This is the type of environment where GDP growth is likely to slow and liquidity becomes less abundant and our diversified approach to portfolio construction and focus on quality growth should thrive. Above-average volatility should also be an advantage  allowing us to be opportunistic given our longer-duration growth horizon.Heightened levels of uncertainty also remain across international markets. In Asia  COVID-19 has become a significant risk again  not only in mainland China but also markets where Chinese tourists drive retail spending like Japan and Europe. Currencies are also in flux  with the yen  typically a port in the storm  the worst-performing developed market currency for the quarter. We believe our risk-aware approach to growth investing  emphasizing quality companies with pricing power  can provide balance as the global economy continues to work through these myriad uncertainties. It has been well-documented how tightening cycles hurt long-duration growth assets. As the Bank of England moves ahead with further tightening similar to the U.S. Fed and the ECB contemplates its own monetary actions  it is also worth noting that growth equities tend to outperform value once a tightening cycle is underway.Portfolio HighlightsDuring the first quarter  the ClearBridge Global Growth Strategy underperformed its MSCI ACWI benchmark. The Strategy had losses across the nine sectors in which it was invested (out of 11 total)  driven by the subsector and stock-specific allocations toward growth areas versus the benchmark. The IT  health care  industrials and consumer discretionary sectors were the primary detractors.On a relative basis  overall stock selection and sector allocation detracted from performance. Stock selection in the health care  IT and materials sectors and a lack of exposure to the energy sector hurt results the most. On the positive side  stock selection in the consumer discretionary sector and an underweight to the communication services sector contributed to performance.On a regional basis  stock selection in North America  Europe Ex U.K.  Japan and the U.K. and an overweight to Europe Ex U.K. detracted the most from performance.On an individual stock basis  the largest contributors to absolute returns in the quarter included Kroger (KR)  Union Pacific (UNP)  Canadian Pacific Railway (CP)  London Stock Exchange (OTCPK:LDNXF) and United Rentals (URI). The greatest detractors from absolute returns included positions in Keyence (OTCPK:KYCCF)  Atlas Copco  Avantor (AVTR)  TE Connectivity and Sandvik (SAND).In addition to the transactions mentioned above  we initiated positions in Target (TGT) in the consumer discretionary sector and closed positions in Trex (TREX) in the industrials sector  Ulta Beauty (ULTA) in the consumer discretionary sector  Kodiak Sciences (KOD) and Guardant Health (GH) in the health care sector  Shiseido (OTCPK:SSDOY) and McCormick (MKC) in the consumer staples sector as well as Amadeus (AMS) in the IT sector.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.15,0.18,0.67,True,English,"['ClearBridge Investments Global Growth Strategy Q1 2022 Commentary', 'benchmark MSCI All Country World Index', 'core MSCI ACWI benchmark', 'broad real estate problem', 'Getty Images Market Overview', 'MSCI Emerging Markets Index', 'long- term bond yields', 'MSCI AC World Growth', 'narrow, one-sided value market', 'highest U.S. inflation', 'ClearBridge Global Growth Strategy', 'long- duration assets', 'challenged supply chains', 'heightened inflationary pressures', 'tighter monetary policy', 'supply chain disruptions', 'food supply output', 'The Federal Reserve', 'past three months', 'U.S. equities', 'agricultural commodity prices', 'largest regional overweights', 'neutral interest rate', 'natural gas prices', 'significant commodity pressures', 'potential monetary tightening', 'monetary tightening cycle', 'higher natural gas', 'other key materials', 'short-term interest rates', 'potential leadership shift', 'high-quality growth stocks', 'Value Performance Source', 'MSCI Growth', 'bond market', 'Global equities', 'U.K.', 'commodity goods', 'rate cycle', 'key drivers', 'Higher rates', 'short-term headwind', 'Russian gas', 'Growth equities', 'rate increases', 'significant rise', 'largest consumer', 'significant parts', 'significant overweight', 'global economy', 'growth companies', 'numerous risks', 'large geographies', 'substantial margins', 'longer run', 'sharp spike', 'near-term valuations', 'inventory restocking', 'frictional costs', 'labor shortages', 'economic policies', 'COVID-19 lockdowns', 'unprecedented accommodation', 'year end', 'gradual withdrawal', 'second half', 'aggressive program', 'industry basis', 'structural bucket', 'step change', 'forward returns', 'attractive valuations', 'diversified approach', 'information technology', 'cross currents', 'depressed levels', 'serious reduction', 'complete shut', 'first quarter', 'consumer spending', 'consumer sentiment', 'value stocks', 'COVID-19 cases', 'crude oil', 'invasion impact', 'value component', 'chuyu', 'iStock', 'China', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'Europe', 'conflict', 'period', 'rotation', 'action', 'outlook', 'sudden', 'Exhibit', 'FactSet', 'lot', 'debate', 'amount', 'Manufacturing', 'footing', 'ports', 'minerals', 'calculus', 'March', 'six', 'pattern', 'speed', 'liquidity', '40 years', 'conditions', 'results', 'observation', 'types', 'balance', 'blend', 'sector', 'energy', 'portfolio', 'names', 'microcosm', 'economies', 'peak', 'sight', 'reopening', 'improvements', 'services', 'travel', 'picture', 'Germany', '7% level', '1990 reunification', 'recession', 'growin']",2022-04-23,2022-04-23,seekingalpha.com

3433,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4502468-publicis-has-fully-digested-the-covid-19-impact-as-it-beats-my-expectations,Publicis Has Fully Digested The COVID-19 Impact As It Beats Expectations (OTCMKTS:PBCBF),Publicis' share price has barely moved since 2021. Should investors get back into this marketing and communications giant? Click here to know.,"neirfy/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionIn September last year  I made the bold statement Publicis (OTCQX:PUBGY) (OTCQX:PGPEF) (OTCPK:PBCBF) would generate 1.2B EUR in free cash flow in 2021. As 2022 is now well underway with the PR and marketing firm already publishing a trading update for the first quarter of the year  I thought this would be a good moment to catch up on the company’s performance.Yahoo FinancePublicis has its main listing on Euronext Paris where it's trading with PUB as its ticker symbol. With almost 1 million shares changing hands on a daily basis  Publicis’ Paris listing is for sure the most liquid listing to trade in the company’s shares.FY 2021 was business as usualThe total revenue generated by Publicis in 2021 was approximately 11.7B EUR  an increase of approximately 10% compared to the FY2020 revenue. All operating expenses increased pretty much in line with the revenue and the EBITDA came in at 2.32B EUR. The total amount of depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by in excess of 20%  leading to a sharp increase of the ""operating margin.""Publicis Investor RelationsAs the company also reduced its impairment charges as well as the amortization of intangibles  the operating income increased by almost 50% to 1.43B EUR. Publicis remained a cash cow in 2021  and as the net debt decreased while the average cost of debt decreased as well  the net interest expenses went down by quite a bit. With a net income of 1.04B EUR of which 9M EUR was attributable to non-controlling interests  the bottom line shows a net income of 1.027B EUR which works out to be 4.13 EUR per share. That’s a substantial increase compared to the 2.40 EPS reported in FY 2020 despite seeing the share count increase by more than 3%.But when I discussed Publicis last time  I was more interested in the company’s free cash flow result as that’s what will enable Publicis to continue its M&A activities. Additionally  a substantial portion of the operating expenses consist of non-cash charges  and even the amortization of intangible assets after completing an acquisition are weighing on the result.In FY2021  Publicis reported an operating cash flow of 1.8B EUR  but this includes a 216M EUR investment in the working capital position. Simultaneously  we should deduct the 9M EUR paid to the non-controlling interests and the 295M EUR lease payments. And finally  the 156M EUR in net interest payments should be deducted as well.Publicis Investor RelationsThis means the adjusted operating cash flow was 1.6B EUR (as I also added back the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid). As you can see  the capex was just 139M EUR which means Publicis generated 1.46B EUR in free cash flow. That’s more than 20% higher than I had anticipated.Divided over the 248M shares outstanding  the free cash flow per share was approximately 5.9 EUR  which means Publicis is currently trading at a free cash flow yield of around 10%. Which is not bad at all.2022 has started well for PublicisOf course one of the main questions was whether or not Publicis can remain on track in 2022  and to see if the 2021 results were boosted by the pent-up demand after a COVID-intense year.Surprisingly  Publicis noted a very strong start of 2022 despite the uncertainty generated by the war in Ukraine in the second half of the quarter. The organic revenue growth came in at double digits with Europe and the Asia-Pacific Region posting a 14%-plus revenue growth.Publicis Investor RelationsThis has now allowed Publicis to firm up its full-year guidance and the company is now expecting to reach the upper end of its 4%-5% revenue growth target. This should have an immediate positive impact on both the net income as well as the free cash flow result and Publicis is now guiding for a full-year free cash flow result of 1.4B EUR. I think it may actually be able to do better than that  but we shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves as we have not even completed one third of the entire financial year.Investment thesisAs mentioned in my September article  I had sold my entire position in Publicis. Fortunately for me  the company’s financial performance has beat my expectations while the share price has remained pretty much unchanged so there seems to be an opportunity to get back in at the current levels. As of the end of 2021  Publicis had a net cash position (excluding lease liabilities which are obviously amortized over time) and with an EBITDA of 2B EUR (excluding lease liabilities)  the current market cap (and enterprise value) of less than 15B EUR appear to be very reasonable  especially as Publicis will continue to build its net cash position this year.I currently still don’t have a position but I’m keeping an eye on the option premiums as the put options are quite attractive. I haven’t made a decision yet but Publicis is now sufficiently attractive from a FCF perspective as well as a balance sheet perspective to get back in.",positive,0.51,0.44,0.06,mixed,0.38,0.21,0.41,True,English,"['COVID-19 Impact', 'Publicis', 'Expectations', 'OTCMKTS', 'PBCBF', 'full-year free cash flow result', 'free cash flow yield', '295M EUR lease payments', 'operating cash flow', 'M&A activities', 'net interest payments', 'immediate positive impact', 'current market cap', 'balance sheet perspective', 'working capital position', 'organic revenue growth', '14%-plus revenue growth', '4%-5% revenue growth target', 'net cash position', '216M EUR investment', 'net interest expenses', 'bold statement Publicis', 'Publicis Investor Relations', 'entire financial year', 'Publicis’ Paris listing', 'full-year guidance', 'cash cow', 'cash charges', 'entire position', 'lease liabilities', 'operating expenses', 'Euronext Paris', 'net income', 'Investment thesis', 'current levels', 'FCF perspective', 'main listing', 'liquid listing', 'total revenue', 'FY2020 revenue', 'operating margin', 'operating income', '1.2B EUR', '1.43B EUR', '156M EUR', '1.46B EUR', '1.4B EUR', '15B EUR', 'Getty Images', 'OTCQX:PUBGY', 'OTCQX:PGPEF', 'OTCPK:PBCBF', 'marketing firm', 'trading update', 'good moment', 'Yahoo Finance', 'ticker symbol', 'daily basis', 'total amount', 'impairment charges', 'net debt', 'average cost', 'controlling interests', 'substantial portion', 'intangible assets', 'main questions', 'pent-up demand', 'COVID-intense year', 'strong start', 'second half', 'double digits', 'Asia-Pacific Region', 'one third', 'financial performance', 'enterprise value', '9M EUR', '1 million shares', 'sharp increase', 'substantial increase', '248M shares', 'amortization expenses', 'first quarter', 'bottom line', 'share count', 'upper end', 'September article', 'share price', 'neirfy', 'iStock', 'Introduction', 'company', 'hands', 'business', '7B', 'EBITDA', '2.32B', 'depreciation', 'excess', 'intangibles', '1.04B', '2.40 EPS', 'acquisition', 'FY2021', 'difference', 'taxes', 'capex', '139M', 'track', '2021 results', 'uncertainty', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'Europe', 'expectations', 'opportunity', 'time', 'less', 'eye', 'option', 'premiums', 'decision']",2022-04-23,2022-04-23,seekingalpha.com

The company is barely investing in growing its oil capacity  but focuses on LNG  LPG and industrial terminalling.,"André Muller/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesIntroductionIt has been ages (four years  to be precise) since I last discussed Vopak (OTCPK:VOPKF) here on Seeking Alpha  and despite posting good results in the past few years  Vopak’s share price is now trading at multi-year lows. I think this is an opportunity to pick up stock as the market may not have fully noticed this storage company is diversifying away from oil. The cash flows are strong and predictable  and thanks to the robust balance sheet  Vopak is in a position to pay a rather attractive dividend. As Vopak’s business is storage and terminalling of a variety of products  I'm looking at this company as an infrastructure play.Yahoo FinanceVopak is a Dutch company and its listing on Euronext Amsterdam is a better option than its OTC listing. The ticker symbol in Amsterdam is VPK  and with an average daily volume of in excess of 400 000 shares (representing a monetary value of in excess of 10M EUR per day)  the Amsterdam listing clearly offers the best trading options. As Vopak trades and reports in EUR  I will use the Euro as base currency throughout this article.The FY 2021 results were relatively light  but still very decentAlthough the market conditions were what Vopak describes as ""soft "" the company was able to report very decent results in 2021. The EBITDA actually increased from 780M EUR to 827M EUR despite seeing the average occupancy ratio drop from 90% to 88%  and that EBITDA increase was almost entirely driven by the expansion program which contributed approximately 50M EUR in EBITDA. If anything  that’s a testament to Vopak’s growth plans which are underpinned by the demand for its offerings which can be divided into five main categories.Vopak Investor RelationsThanks to its worldwide presence  Vopak can take advantage of changing market circumstances and provide its customers the services they need  all over the world.Vopak Investor RelationsThe total revenue of Vopak increased from 1.19B EUR to 1.23B EUR and the total operating income (which really is the revenue  not to be confused with operating profit) was 1.27B EUR thanks to ""other"" revenue sources which include management fees for services provided to other entities.The reported EBIT decreased by approximately 15%  and a large portion is caused by the combination of a higher impairment charge and depreciation expenses. The total contribution from joint ventures and associates increased and the EBIT for FY2021 was 410M EUR.Vopak Investor RelationsAs you can see on the image above  the company’s finance costs also increased to in excess of 100M EUR. The bottom line shows a net income of 243M EUR of which 214M EUR was attributable to the shareholders of Vopak  representing an EPS of 1.71 EUR per share.That’s lower than in FY 2020 (despite generating a higher EBITDA) mainly due to the higher impairment charges  higher finance charges and a variety of exceptional items. The majority of those exceptional items was related to the impairment charge  but the total impact of these exceptional items was almost 80M EUR higher than in FY 2020.Vopak Investor RelationsSo if we would exclude the exceptional items  Vopak’s total performance was roughly in line with the 2020 results. Not great  but also not as bad as a blind comparison of the EPS may lead you to think.As this is an infrastructure company  looking at the sustaining free cash flow could potentially make more sense than making an investment decision solely based on the EPS.Vopak Investor RelationsThe cash flow statement starts with a 682M EUR operating cash flow but we should still deduct the lease payments (34M EUR) and interest payments (99M EUR  including the interest payments related to leases). On top of that  I'm also deducting the 25M EUR in payments to non-controlling interests.This results in an adjusted operating cash flow of 524M EUR.Vopak is making the life of its investors easier by clearly splitting up growth investments and sustaining capex. The total sustaining capex came in at 291M EUR  resulting in an underlying free cash flow result of 233M EUR. Divided over 125.5M shares outstanding  the sustaining free cash flow per share is 1.86 EUR. This represents a free cash flow yield of just over 6.6% at the current share price of 27.90 EUR. Vopak will be paying an annual dividend of 1.25 EUR per share which represents a yield of approximately 4.5% at the current share price.Vopak Investor RelationsThe company continues to expand  but the market still sees it as an oil storage companyAn infrastructure company with a robust earnings profile should not see its share price slide. While I understand the market’s concerns about the demand for oil in the future I think Vopak is seen and (unfairly) treated as an oil storage company. Throughout the past few years  the contribution from oil terminals has consistently decreased as Vopak is expanding in other domains.Vopak Investor RelationsThat’s also clearly visible in the growth capex breakdown. On average  less than 20% of the growth capex going forward will be spent on oil terminals.Vopak Investor RelationsThis should result in an even lower contribution from the oil terminals to the total revenue and this should hopefully help with the perception Vopak is an ""oil terminal company."" And after bringing a few new projects online in 2021  Vopak will complete several more growth initiatives in 2022 and 2023.Vopak Investor RelationsA second reason why the market may be a little bit reluctant at this point is the decreasing occupancy ratio in throughout 2021. After seeing excellent levels during the pandemic  the occupancy rate fell from 90% as of the end of 2020 to just 86% as of the end of 2021. No reason to be alarmed  but it is an element to keep an eye on.Vopak Investor RelationsThe balance sheet can clearly handle the growth investments. As of the end of 2021  the net financial debt (excluding lease liabilities) was 2.2B EUR resulting in a debt ratio of less than 3 given the EBITDA (excluding lease payments) of just under 800M EUR.Investment thesisI haven’t owned a position in Vopak for years  but I'm getting ready to go long again. I have written put options with a strike price of 27 EUR expiring in both May and June and although those puts are currently out of the money  the stock will go ex-dividend before the expiration dates. I most definitely wouldn’t mind going long at 27 EUR per share as that would represent a sustaining free cash flow yield of around 7% for this year based on my expectations.Once the stock trades ex-dividend  I will likely write some more put options as the option premiums are quite attractive.",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.37,0.11,0.51,True,English,"['Vopak', 'Infrastructure', 'Storage', '4.5% Yield', 'OTCMKTS', 'VOPKF', 'underlying free cash flow result', '682M EUR operating cash flow', 'sustaining free cash flow', 'free cash flow yield', 'cash flow statement', 'robust balance sheet', 'average daily volume', 'best trading options', 'average occupancy ratio', 'five main categories', 'robust earnings profile', 'higher impairment charges', 'total operating income', 'higher finance charges', 'current share price', 'share price slide', 'Vopak Investor Relations', 'total sustaining capex', 'growth capex breakdown', 'other"" revenue sources', 'The FY 2021 results', 'oil storage company', 'cash flows', 'operating profit', 'net income', '50M EUR', '214M EUR', '25M EUR', 'Yahoo Finance', 'total revenue', 'other entities', 'finance costs', 'total impact', 'total performance', 'other domains', 'growth plans', 'higher EBITDA', 'growth investments', 'André Muller', 'iStock Editorial', 'Getty Images', 'OTCPK:VOPKF', 'good results', 'multi-year lows', 'attractive dividend', 'infrastructure play', 'ticker symbol', 'monetary value', 'base currency', 'decent results', 'expansion program', 'worldwide presence', 'management fees', 'large portion', 'depreciation expenses', 'joint ventures', 'exceptional items', 'blind comparison', 'investment decision', 'non-controlling interests', 'annual dividend', 'oil terminals', 'total contribution', 'Dutch company', 'infrastructure company', 'lease payments', 'interest payments', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'OTC listing', 'Vopak trades', 'EBITDA increase', 'bottom line', '125.5M shares', 'market conditions', 'market circumstances', 'Amsterdam listing', '2020 results', '400,000 shares', 'Introduction', 'four', 'Alpha', 'past', 'years', 'opportunity', 'position', 'business', 'terminalling', 'variety', 'products', 'VPK', 'excess', '10M', 'day', 'reports', 'article', '780M', '827M', 'testament', 'demand', 'offerings', 'advantage', 'changing', 'customers', 'services', '1.19B', '1.23B', '27B', 'combination', 'associates', 'FY2021', '100M', '243M', 'shareholders', 'EPS', 'majority', 'sense', '34M', 'leases', 'top', '524M', 'life', 'investors', '291M', '233M', 'concerns', 'future', 'less', '1.71', '90']",2022-04-23,2022-04-23,seekingalpha.com

We reported particularly strong top-line results from our GLORIA Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating our lead asset NOX-A12 in brain cancer  including high tumor response rates in this very difficult to treat patient population bringing great hope to patients. We will continue to forge ahead this year with our expansion study of NOX-A12 to explore treatment options for patients who would not benefit from standard of care chemotherapy and then on to the start of our planned pivotal glioblastoma study. We are also preparing our pancreatic program to begin its Phase 2 study in collaboration with MSD  further demonstrating NOXXON's commitment to developing our assets in order to bring substantial benefit to an overwhelming number of patients who currently have no satisfactory treatment options "" said Aram Mangasarian  CEO of NOXXON.""Supporting NOXXON’s clinical operations with consistent and reliable funding sources is of critical importance. We have made tremendous progress and are continually working to maintain an efficient capital structure and strengthen our financing program to support NOXXON’s development in oncology. As stated in our Annual Report  NOXXON has financial visibility into November 2022. While current financing markets remain challenging for many biotech companies  we believe that financing opportunities will continue to be driven by compelling clinical progress. Exciting opportunities lie ahead and we are confident in our ability to capitalize on them successfully "" said Bryan Jennings  CFO of NOXXON.Business Highlights for 2021 and 2022 Year-to-DateNOXXON’s goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical group focused on cancer therapy providing tangible benefit to patients and creating long-term value for its shareholders. The Company’s key objective is to exploit its highly innovative and proprietary technology that breaks the tumor protection barrier and blocks tumor repair by neutralizing chemokines in the tumor micro-environment (TME) in order to:Make its lead product candidate NOX-A12 a go-to combination agent for a wide range of cancer treatments by applying the NOX-A12 mechanism of action on the TME in combination with existing therapy classes  including immune checkpoint inhibitors and cell therapies as well as standard therapies such as chemo- and radiotherapy.Develop NOX-E36  NOXXON’s second product candidate  as a TME-targeting agent for solid tumors.Partner its product candidates bringing additional expertise and financial resources to develop our products.Develop its lead product candidate and find suitable routes to commercialization.NOXXON’s strategy to create long-term value for its stakeholders is based on its strong commitment to invest in clinical programs that will provide the most compelling scientific evidence in the shortest period of time and will allow to bring NOX-A12 to market as quickly as possible. NOXXON’s product candidates are supported by highly compelling scientific rationale  as well as collaborations with world-renowned academic and leading pharmaceutical partners.The interest in and support of NOXXON’s product candidates and approach was underlined by the appointments of top clinicians from the US and EU to NOXXON’s Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) and industry experts to the Supervisory Board.Supervisory BoardThree highly distinguished new members to the Supervisory Board were appointed in June 2021.Dr. Martine J. van Vugt  Senior Vice President Corporate Strategy and Development at Genmab  with 20 years of successful biotechnology industry experience  an inventor of two successfully commercialized cancer drugs (Darzalex ® and Tepezza ® ) and an expert in corporate transactional and licensing operations.and Tepezza ) and an expert in corporate transactional and licensing operations. Gregory Weaver  CFO of atai Life Sciences  with over 25 years in the life sciences industry ranging from start-ups to publicly traded commercial stage companies  has raised over US$1.5 billion in financing transactions  managed 3 IPOs  and has extensive M&A and business development experience.Susan Coles  General Counsel and Head of Finance at Vivet Therapeutics  is a specialist in corporate law with over 25 years of experience in international collaborations and corporate/commercial activities  including more than 15 years in the life sciences sector.Scientific Advisory Board: NOXXON appointed a SAB under the chairmanship of Dr. Jose Saro in February 2021. The SAB includes four leading pancreatic cancer experts: Dr. Elena Gabriela Chiorean  Dr. Eileen M. O’Reilly  Prof. Dr. Thomas T. W. Seufferlein and Dr. Daniel D. Von Hoff. The formation and composition of the SAB  who have long-standing clinical expertise  cutting-edge scientific knowledge  and a track record of successfully developing new drugs  reflects NOXXON’s clinical development strategy.Clinical Highlights for 2021 and 2022 Year-to-DateIn 2021 NOXXON continued to develop its lead product candidate  NOX-A12  in brain cancer and pancreatic cancer.Brain Cancer (Glioblastoma  GBM) – Positive top line data reported and details to be presented at ASCO 2022NOXXON advanced its GLORIA Phase 1/2 dose-escalation study of NOX-A12 in first-line brain cancer patients in combination with radiotherapy conducted at six sites in Germany. The data generated to date have been very promising with a high percentage of patients achieving partial response or stable disease  in sharp contrast to what would have been expected from such a difficult to treat patient population.Interim data were presented at the Society for Neuro-Oncology (SNO) Annual Meeting in November 2021 by the principal investigator of the clinical trial  Dr. Frank Giordano. Eight out of the 9 patients (89%) treated with NOX-A12 at the time of presentation showed tumor size reductions: 2 patients had a partial response (PR  >50% reduction in tumor size) and 6 patients achieved stable disease (SD  <50% reduction in tumor size)  while only one patient progressed as a best response. This compared very favorably with the matched imaging control cohort for which 12 out of 13 patients had progressive disease and only 1 out of 13 patients (7.7%) achieved any tumor size reduction vs. baseline  underpinning the extremely poor prognosis of this patient population.More mature and very promising data were disclosed by NOXXON in March 2022 showing that the percentage of patients in the trial with >50% tumor size reductions improved considerably from previously disclosed 22% and confirming the excellent safety profile of NOX-A12. More details about these results will be presented in a poster presentation at the 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting taking place in Chicago  Illinois  US from 3-7 June 2022.The company also expanded the glioblastoma trial to include additional patients in the highest dose cohort  including patients to be treated with a combination of radiotherapy  NOX-A12 and either bevacizumab or a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor.Pancreatic Cancer – Phase 2 in combination with Keytruda® in preparationThe final peer-reviewed data from the OPERA Phase 1/2 clinical trial of NOX-A12 combined with Merck’s immune-oncology checkpoint inhibitor antibody Keytruda (pembrolizumab) in patients with metastatic pancreas and colorectal tumors that do not usually respond to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy (microsatellite-stable) was published in 2021 in the Journal for Immuno-Therapy of Cancer (Source: Suarez-Carmona  2021).As a result of the encouraging safety  tolerability and overall survival data obtained  a Phase 2 trial in collaboration with MSD (European subsidiary of Merck & Co) is being prepared in second-line metastatic pancreatic cancer patients to determine the best combination of NOX-A12 with Keytruda and chemotherapy to further pursue in a pivotal trial.2021 Financial SummaryFor the reporting period  the Group – NOXXON Pharma N.V. and NOXXON Pharma AG – has not generated any revenues. The Group does not expect to generate any revenues from any product candidates that it develops until the Group either signs a licensing agreement or obtains regulatory approval and commercializes its products or enters into collaborative agreements with third parties.In 2021  the Group generated K€82 in other operating income mainly from the sale of raw materials and services as well as other income.Operating costs increased by 129% to €13.5 million in 2021 compared to 2020  most of this increase being driven by an intensification of research and development (R&D) expenses  accounting for 79% of operating costs compared 68% in 2020. R&D expenses were up 165% in 2021 compared to last year as NOXXON continued to make progress with its clinical stage assets  including increased manufacturing costs ahead of clinical trial expansion and new clinical trials to start. General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased by 53% to support operational activities. These operating costs led to €12.4 million in net cash outflow from operations.The Group was successful in strengthening its balance sheet by raising a total of €11.5 million in net proceeds from multiple sources  including a private placement  exercise of outstanding warrants and their subsequent conversion to shares  and the Atlas Special Opportunities (ASO) financing vehicle. The flexible convertible bond agreement with ASO  initially disclosed on 23 April 2020  and amended on 14 October 2020  has been further amended on 29 December 2021 to expand its capacity by an additional €17 million in equity-linked securities. Subsequent to 31 December 2021  the Group raised further financing of €4.75 million from the ASO financing vehicle (nominal).The capital structure of the Company is now nearly free of warrants and other derivative-like structures other than the Company’s Stock Option Plan. As a result  the Company’s capital structure has become less complex and provides the needed flexibility to engage with investors. The changes to the capital structure also afford the Group additional flexibility in terms of the types of investors it can attract in the future.Outlook 2022NOXXON believes the future of cancer treatment will rely on combination therapies  combinations of different drugs that have a synergistic benefit for the patient by fighting the cancer in multiple ways at the same time (Source: Mahoney et al.  2015). The company’s lead product candidate and other clinical stage product candidate in its pipeline target the tumor microenvironment and are designed to be combined with other cancer targeting therapies. The TME is the space in which cancer cells exist in the body  which includes  amongst others  surrounding blood vessels  immune cells  fibroblasts and signaling molecules. The TME has been shown to have a critical role in almost all aspects of cancer biology (Source: Guo et al.  2015; Joyce & Fearon  2015  Huynh  et al.  2020).To prepare for future clinical trials necessary to secure the regulatory approval of NOX-A12  NOXXON has made investment commitments for the manufacturing of drug supply for clinical trials. The company’s long-term strategic plans now include the following clinical trials  by indication  for NOX-A12:NOX-A12 + radiotherapy in Brain Cancer:The completion of the six months dosing of NOX-A12 high-dose group was reported in March 2022 with a good safety profile and very encouraging efficacy data.Based on safety data and the analysis of tissue samples of patients  recruitment of expansion cohorts of patients testing the high-dose of NOX-A12 with radiotherapy and either anti-PD-1 immunotherapy or anti-VEGF therapy is underway to determine whether these combinations are safe and to potentially deliver stronger efficacy data than when used in combination only with radiotherapy.Following discussions with regulators and experts  initiation of a Phase 2/3 pivotal trial of NOX-A12 combined with radiotherapy and potentially either anti-PD-1 or anti-VEGF in 1st line glioblastoma patients vs. standard of care is planned  assuming ongoing Phase 1/2 trial data supports further development. As the company awaits more mature data from the expansion arms  the final design and timing may evolve.NOX-A12 + immunotherapy + chemotherapy in Pancreatic Cancer:Two-arm Phase 2 “pick the winner” trial testing NOX-A12 + anti-PD1 antibody with two different standard of care chemotherapy regimens in second-line patients to determine the choice of regimen for the pivotal trial.Following the “pick the winner” trial  assuming one regimen warrants further development  NOXXON plans to initiate a pivotal trial of NOX-A12 combined with immunotherapy and standard of care in second-line pancreatic cancer vs. standard of care  which if positive would lead to the regulatory submission for marketing approval in the US and Europe in pancreatic cancer.NOX-E36 in Solid TumorsThe Group’s second clinical stage asset  NOX-E36 is a de-risked clinical stage asset ready for Phase 2 trials that has already been administered to 175 human subjects. NOX-E36 targets the tumor microenvironment (TME) by modifying the innate immune system  specifically highly immunosuppressive cells that contribute to the cancer’s ability to evade the immune system. NOXXON plans to re-start clinical studies of NOX-E36 in a solid tumor indication in collaboration with clinical researchers as part of an investigator initiated trial (IIT). Developing this asset via IIT will preserve NOXXON resources while allowing to obtain clinical data.About NOXXONNOXXON’s oncology-focused pipeline acts on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking the tumor protection barrier and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  NOXXON’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses against the immune system and enable greater therapeutic impact. NOXXON’s lead program NOX-A12 has delivered final top-line data from a Keytruda® combination trial in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients published at the ESMO conference in September 2020 and in July 2021 the company announced its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. NOXXON is also studying NOX-A12 in brain cancer in combination with radiotherapy which has been granted orphan drug status in the US and EU for the treatment of certain brain cancers. GLORIA  a trial of NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy has delivered top-line data from all three dose-escalation cohorts showing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA has been expanded to assess the benefit of NOX-A12 with other treatment combinations  radiotherapy + bevacizumab and radiotherapy + pembrolizumab. The company’s second clinical-stage asset NOX-E36 is a Phase 2 TME asset targeting the innate immune system. NOXXON plans to test NOX‑E36 in patients with solid tumors.

GLORIA further evaluates safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 three additional arms combining NOX-A12 with: A. radiotherapy in patients with complete tumor resection; B. radiotherapy and bevacizumab in patients with incomplete tumor resection; and C. radiotherapy and pembrolizumab in patients with incomplete tumor resection.About the OPTIMUS StudyOPTIMUS (NCT04901741) is NOXXON’s open-label two-arm phase 2 study of NOX-A12 combined with pembrolizumab and nanoliposomal irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in microsatellite-stable metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.DisclaimerTranslations of any press release into languages other than English are intended solely as a convenience to the non-English-reading audience.

Those interested in attending are invited to join the virtual event taking place on April 22  2022 at 12pm ET using this link.Genner joins the Collaboratory to explore the use of irreversible tokenization to establish a trusted “MetaPresence” identity that enables privacy-protected storage  access to  and exchange of digital assets  both between and within metaverse environments through payment rails. The Collaboratory brings experts from industry and academia together to discuss developments in the space and advance the dialogue around emergent regulatory and policy challenges facing crypto and FinTech.Trust Stamp continues to develop a unique position in the decentralized finance space as one of 15 blockchain industry leaders that formed the Cryptocurrency Compliance Cooperative  which looks to enhance cryptocurrency regulations while establishing consumer-centric frameworks for strengthened public protections and safety in August 2021. The Company currently supports leading Bitcoin ATMs worldwide with real-time KYC/AML-compliant facial biometric and ID document verification built on their core privacy-positive data protection technology. Trust Stamp maintains multiple patent filings for innovations centered in the digital asset space.Gareth Genner comments  “With the potential to build a robust digital environment where individuals around the world can engage and transact freely  the metaverse presents a tremendous opportunity to develop targeted solutions that support an interoperable  accessible  and secure future of the decentralized virtual world while delivering to the privacy-focused principles of Web3.The MetaPresence system provides a privacy-first method of authenticating identity in a secure environment to establish trust across metaverse platforms without exposing sensitive data in each. With a globally evolving regulatory purview around digital assets  a rise in government-backed Central Bank Digital Currencies  and major financial institutions entering the decentralized finance space  the applicability of a scalable and protected identity infrastructure that underlies secure digital transactions is immense.”The Company is currently beta testing their MetaPresence Vault solution designed to provide secure account-credential and private key storage  using Trust Stamp’s proven biometric verification and irreversible tokenization technologies to ensure that crypto wallets and digital assets are protected and accessible to only the owner  independent of metaverse platforms and service providers. The MetaPresence Vault is built on an Amazon Quantum Ledger Database  providing an immutable  cryptographically verified history to assure long-term data protection and availability to support the utility of digital assets as mainstream financial instruments across a rapidly expanding range of uses.Enquiries Trust Stamp Email: Shareholders@truststamp.ai Gareth Genner  Chief Executive Officer Nisha Naik  Executive VP of Communications Davy (Euronext Growth Advisor) Tel: +353 1 679 6363 Barry Murphy Investor Relations Tel: +1 212-671-1021 Crescendo Communications Email: idai@crescendo-ir.comAbout Trust StampTrust Stamp  the Privacy-First Identity CompanyTM  is a global provider of AI-powered identity services for use in multiple sectors including banking and finance  regulatory compliance  government  real estate  communications  and humanitarian services.
