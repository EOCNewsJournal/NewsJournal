3428,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4503138-clearbridge-investments-global-growth-strategy-q1-2022-commentary,ClearBridge Investments Global Growth Strategy Q1 2022 Commentary,1 day ago,chuyu/iStock via Getty ImagesMarket OverviewGlobal equities were faced with numerous risks in the first quarter  ranging from resurging COVID-19 cases in large geographies like China to inflation and potential monetary tightening globally  before Russia's invasion of Ukraine on February 24 overshadowed all else. Europe was most directly impacted by the conflict as crude oil and natural gas prices spiked and already-challenged supply chains were further pressured. The benchmark MSCI All Country World Index declined 5.36% while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index fell 6.97%. Value outperformed growth by substantial margins with the MSCI AC World. Value declining 0.95% for the period while the MSCI AC World Growth fell 9.72%.One of the key drivers of the rotation from growth to value stocks was action in the bond market. A significant rise in long- term bond yields reflected heightened inflationary pressures in the global economy and the outlook for tighter monetary policy. Higher rates are typically a short-term headwind to long- duration assets such as growth stocks. And while  in the longer run  high-quality growth stocks can typically pass on inflation  the sudden and sharp spike in bond yields puts pressure on near-term valuations.Exhibit 1: MSCI Growth vs. Value PerformanceSource: FactSet.There has been a lot of debate about whether inflation is as permanent post-COVID. A certain amount of inventory restocking was needed to cure supply chain disruptions impacted by frictional costs and labor shortages. Manufacturing finally seemed to have found its footing and ports were reopening. China  the world's largest consumer of commodity goods  has been easing economic policies for some time to tackle a broad real estate problem and navigate further COVID-19 lockdowns continuing to slow its economy. These actions should have ameliorated significant commodity pressures -- until war broke out. Coupled with the potential for Russia to now control significant parts of the food supply output and other key materials and minerals  the calculus shifted overnight.U.S. equities were most impacted by a monetary tightening cycle. The Federal Reserve raised short-term interest rates 25 basis points in March  ending a period of unprecedented accommodation  and projected at least six more rate increases through year end. We believe the rate cycle could last through 2023 with the neutral interest rate approaching 3%. Growth stocks have historically been pressured leading into a tightening cycle and the past three months have tracked that pattern. What's different this time is the speed of the Fed's shift from a gradual withdrawal of liquidity in the second half of 2021 to an aggressive program to attack the highest U.S. inflation in 40 years. Growth equities tend to stabilize and deliver better performance once a tightening cycle is underway and we view the ClearBridge Global Growth Strategy as well- positioned to participate in this potential leadership shift.Under these conditions  the Strategy underperformed its core MSCI ACWI benchmark. This is to be expected but doesn't mean we are satisfied with the results. Our observation is that in these types of markets  the Strategy tends to underperform until more balance is achieved in the market between growth and value.Simplistically  the index is a blend of both value and growth stocks. However  similar to the first quarter of 2021 (Exhibit 1) - when the value component outperformed so meaningfully - it remains tilted to whatever is doing the best  and this quarter it was value. In virtually every sector  the stocks we identify most as value did the best.On a sector and industry basis  energy (+21.15%) and materials (+2.75%)  given the invasion impact  did well. We evaluate and own these types of stocks within our structural bucket if we believe they will see a step change in forward returns at attractive valuations. While the structural bucket is a component of our diversified approach to growth  the portfolio also remains invested in growth companies with a significant overweight to information technology (IT); these names underperformed in a narrow  one-sided value market.Europe and the U.K.  which combined represent the Strategy's largest regional overweights  were a microcosm of these cross currents. Early in the first quarter  economies were still influenced by COVID-19  but a peak in cases was in sight and reopening was underway. Markets played the improvements  rates moved moderately  consumer spending picked up and services like travel recovered from depressed levels. War in Ukraine changed the picture dramatically. Inflation picked up even further  driven by higher natural gas  oil and agricultural commodity prices  which will be passed on to the consumer. Germany's inflation passed the 7% level last seen after the 1990 reunification. The war has caused manufacturing and consumer sentiment to plunge.While natural gas is still flowing from Russia to Europe  a serious reduction or complete shut off of Russian gas could lead to a recession in Europe  which is the growing consensus view. We don't agree  however  as we believe Europe has the support structures and spending capacity to keep the incipient post- COVID-19 recovery intact. The telltale signs of recession  such as European credit spreads widening  have not happened.Positively  the urgency of energy security has accelerated spending on renewable energy. The EU commission has proposed a new measure regarding energy security and plans to reduce European dependence on Russian natural gas. REPowerEU emphasizes two pillars in order to reduce reliance on Russian gas and drive resilience: diversifying gas supplies  mostly via higher liquified natural gas imports; and more rapidly reducing fossil fuel use by boosting energy efficiency while increasing renewables and electrification. Many wind and solar projects will accelerate with easier permitting and financing.The Strategy is well-exposed to this secular shift and to accelerated spending on alternative energy sourcing and generation. Growth in renewables should benefit EDP  an operator of wind farms for power generation  and SolarEdge (SEDG)  a company we repurchased on weakness in the first quarter that develops electronics for solar installations and should take advantage of greater incentives for solar installations in many geographies. The company has expanded its products offering to address larger markets in commercial and utility solar on top of its traditional residential solar market. The acceleration in electrification of transport should support electric vehicle-related stocks like TE Connectivity (TEL). In addition  industrial gases provider Air Liquide is developing carbon capture technology to help mitigate emissions while industrial manufacturer Atlas Copco (OTCPK:ATLCY) should benefit from demand for greater efficiency in mid-voltage applications such as energy-efficient compressors.The conflict could also boost the trend toward reshoring or near- shoring supply chains and production. Market worries about China's intentions toward Taiwan  which could alter the global balance of power in semiconductors  have hastened the near- shoring of semi production globally. Such growing risks are hastening the need to build new capacity in the U.S.  Eastern Europe  Canada and Mexico  and they should result in a positive  multiyear  capex-heavy trend for Western companies. Such a transition would most directly benefit the Strategy's structural growth companies  a bucket we have been increasing (and that now accounts for more than 40% of portfolio assets) to better manage the volatile risk/reward environment in global markets.Portfolio PositioningWe increased our financials exposure with four new additions during the quarter. Exchange operator Deutsche Boerse (OTCPK:DBOEY)  a company with higher rate sensitivity and a higher orientation toward financial data  operates a fund administration business with recurring revenues that have allowed these non-transaction divisions to do well. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM)  which should benefit from a consolidating bank market and higher rates as Canada catches up with the U.S. in terms of reopening and GDP growth recovery. In the U.S.  we added Raymond James Financial (RJF)  a regional wealth management firm that has a solid asset gathering story and interest rate sensitivity  as well as Bank of America (BAC)  which also has significant rate sensitivity and should see business improvements from increased technology spending.Also within the structural bucket  we added a position in Deere (DE)  a major global player in agricultural  construction and forestry equipment  with a particularly dominant position in U.S. agriculture. Deere's moat around its core equipment capabilities  coupled with years of substantial investments in technology and innovation  further extends its competitive advantage into precision agriculture  which allows for higher farm yields with lower use of fertilizers  pesticides and water  thereby improving farmers' bottom lines while reducing their environmental footprint.The structural bucket has the shortest investment horizon across the spectrum of growth companies we target in the Strategy. We closely monitor the macro impacts and turnaround progress of these companies and will be disciplined sellers when the thesis for a holding plays out.We added to our secular growth bucket with the purchase of U.S. medical device maker Stryker (SYK). The company has a track record of good go to market execution and successful R&D investment that has generated consistent market share gains and consistent margin expansion. Approximately 45% of revenue comes from surgery equipment  35% from orthopedics and the balance from neurotechnology and spine products. In an uncertain macro environment  we believe that medical devices will be less volatile than some other end markets and with most of Stryker's revenue generated domestically  risk from weakness outside the U.S. is relatively lower.Most of our selling over the last several quarters has occurred among emerging growth companies  where we have reduced our exposure to just over 10% to better manage risk. Exits from the emerging growth bucket in the quarter included Latin America e- commerce platform MercadoLibre (MELI)  which has experienced an unwind of COVID-19-induced demand while high inflation and high interest rates in Brazil create new headwinds for consumer purchasing power  which will likely mean slower sales of high-ticket items on the company's platform. In addition  we sold out of British grocery delivery provider Ocado Group (OTCPK:OCDGF) following its much higher than expected capital spending  and U.S. social network Pinterest (PINS) over concerns about slowing user growth and engagement.Most of our reductions in emerging growth have involved IT or related companies where innovation is a key to their business model. That said  we remain positive on the IT sector and have largely maintained holdings in our highest-conviction ideas.During the quarter  we reduced our semiconductor exposure through a trim of ASML (ASML) to manage concerns of a slowdown due to the risk of double ordering and potential softness in some consumer end markets. We increased our position in IT services as we remain optimistic about the long-term growth potential these companies provide  which is underpinned by the compressed digital transformation cycle  rising cloud adoption and growth in data-driven insights. This included initiating a position in French design software firm Dassault Systèmes (OTCPK:DASTY).Despite the market volatility and hyper focus on rising rates  chief information officer surveys continue to forecast resilience in IT budgets this year. Growth in IT spending for 2022 is expected to remain above the 10-year pre-COVID-19 average  according to Morgan Stanley (MS). We believe this is a result of the strong secular underpinnings brought on by digital transformation and businesses focusing on increasing efficiencies through technology.New addition Olympus (OTCPK:OCPNY)  a Japanese precision equipment and medical device maker  is a good example. The company is the number one player in gastrointestinal endoscopy with 70% market share with an entrenched moat. Its therapeutic solutions division should continue to scale with new product investments in high-growth areas  coupled with improvement in procedural volumes from COVID-19 recovery. We are also seeing progress in a restructuring plan that will create a streamlined global medical technology company with improving profitability and a reliable governance structure.OutlookWe continue to invest for the long term and are willing to endure volatility as long as our secular thesis for owning a company has not been impacted. The post-COVID-19 hangover for our emerging growth bucket has been very tough  but we understand the risks  have culled the portfolio of several challenged stocks and see a way back for disruptive growth names.Growth company valuations tend to anticipate changes to input variables (in this case  interest rates) well in advance  and they have largely derated following a predictive path. That said  valuations are largely in check - even in the U.S. - after a significant drawdown and are now set up much better than just six months ago. The market is challenging growth where  in some cases  there is not a fundamental issue. This creates an opportunity for us to underwrite investments where our advantage over consensus is the durability of growth.From a regional standpoint  we continue to see promise in Europe and are increasing our exposure to regions like Canada through companies well-suited for developing trends around energy security and supply chains. While headline inflation remains high across Europe  the region does not face the same wage pressures as the U.S.  which could temper the increasing hawkish stance of policymakers once the Ukraine situation becomes more settled.Without question  higher energy and agricultural commodity prices creates new challenges for emerging markets  where we greatly reduced exposure in 2021. We expect continued volatility around both economic performance and political change to remain a feature of these markets.In the U.S.  we are entering a period of policy reversal that should lead to a normalization of capital market returns and economic growth from a peak everything environment (liquidity  profit margins  global growth). This is the type of environment where GDP growth is likely to slow and liquidity becomes less abundant and our diversified approach to portfolio construction and focus on quality growth should thrive. Above-average volatility should also be an advantage  allowing us to be opportunistic given our longer-duration growth horizon.Heightened levels of uncertainty also remain across international markets. In Asia  COVID-19 has become a significant risk again  not only in mainland China but also markets where Chinese tourists drive retail spending like Japan and Europe. Currencies are also in flux  with the yen  typically a port in the storm  the worst-performing developed market currency for the quarter. We believe our risk-aware approach to growth investing  emphasizing quality companies with pricing power  can provide balance as the global economy continues to work through these myriad uncertainties. It has been well-documented how tightening cycles hurt long-duration growth assets. As the Bank of England moves ahead with further tightening similar to the U.S. Fed and the ECB contemplates its own monetary actions  it is also worth noting that growth equities tend to outperform value once a tightening cycle is underway.Portfolio HighlightsDuring the first quarter  the ClearBridge Global Growth Strategy underperformed its MSCI ACWI benchmark. The Strategy had losses across the nine sectors in which it was invested (out of 11 total)  driven by the subsector and stock-specific allocations toward growth areas versus the benchmark. The IT  health care  industrials and consumer discretionary sectors were the primary detractors.On a relative basis  overall stock selection and sector allocation detracted from performance. Stock selection in the health care  IT and materials sectors and a lack of exposure to the energy sector hurt results the most. On the positive side  stock selection in the consumer discretionary sector and an underweight to the communication services sector contributed to performance.On a regional basis  stock selection in North America  Europe Ex U.K.  Japan and the U.K. and an overweight to Europe Ex U.K. detracted the most from performance.On an individual stock basis  the largest contributors to absolute returns in the quarter included Kroger (KR)  Union Pacific (UNP)  Canadian Pacific Railway (CP)  London Stock Exchange (OTCPK:LDNXF) and United Rentals (URI). The greatest detractors from absolute returns included positions in Keyence (OTCPK:KYCCF)  Atlas Copco  Avantor (AVTR)  TE Connectivity and Sandvik (SAND).In addition to the transactions mentioned above  we initiated positions in Target (TGT) in the consumer discretionary sector and closed positions in Trex (TREX) in the industrials sector  Ulta Beauty (ULTA) in the consumer discretionary sector  Kodiak Sciences (KOD) and Guardant Health (GH) in the health care sector  Shiseido (OTCPK:SSDOY) and McCormick (MKC) in the consumer staples sector as well as Amadeus (AMS) in the IT sector.Editor's Note: The summary bullets for this article were chosen by Seeking Alpha editors.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.15,0.18,0.67,True,English,"['ClearBridge Investments Global Growth Strategy Q1 2022 Commentary', 'benchmark MSCI All Country World Index', 'core MSCI ACWI benchmark', 'broad real estate problem', 'Getty Images Market Overview', 'MSCI Emerging Markets Index', 'long- term bond yields', 'MSCI AC World Growth', 'narrow, one-sided value market', 'highest U.S. inflation', 'ClearBridge Global Growth Strategy', 'long- duration assets', 'challenged supply chains', 'heightened inflationary pressures', 'tighter monetary policy', 'supply chain disruptions', 'food supply output', 'The Federal Reserve', 'past three months', 'U.S. equities', 'agricultural commodity prices', 'largest regional overweights', 'neutral interest rate', 'natural gas prices', 'significant commodity pressures', 'potential monetary tightening', 'monetary tightening cycle', 'higher natural gas', 'other key materials', 'short-term interest rates', 'potential leadership shift', 'high-quality growth stocks', 'Value Performance Source', 'MSCI Growth', 'bond market', 'Global equities', 'U.K.', 'commodity goods', 'rate cycle', 'key drivers', 'Higher rates', 'short-term headwind', 'Russian gas', 'Growth equities', 'rate increases', 'significant rise', 'largest consumer', 'significant parts', 'significant overweight', 'global economy', 'growth companies', 'numerous risks', 'large geographies', 'substantial margins', 'longer run', 'sharp spike', 'near-term valuations', 'inventory restocking', 'frictional costs', 'labor shortages', 'economic policies', 'COVID-19 lockdowns', 'unprecedented accommodation', 'year end', 'gradual withdrawal', 'second half', 'aggressive program', 'industry basis', 'structural bucket', 'step change', 'forward returns', 'attractive valuations', 'diversified approach', 'information technology', 'cross currents', 'depressed levels', 'serious reduction', 'complete shut', 'first quarter', 'consumer spending', 'consumer sentiment', 'value stocks', 'COVID-19 cases', 'crude oil', 'invasion impact', 'value component', 'chuyu', 'iStock', 'China', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'Europe', 'conflict', 'period', 'rotation', 'action', 'outlook', 'sudden', 'Exhibit', 'FactSet', 'lot', 'debate', 'amount', 'Manufacturing', 'footing', 'ports', 'minerals', 'calculus', 'March', 'six', 'pattern', 'speed', 'liquidity', '40 years', 'conditions', 'results', 'observation', 'types', 'balance', 'blend', 'sector', 'energy', 'portfolio', 'names', 'microcosm', 'economies', 'peak', 'sight', 'reopening', 'improvements', 'services', 'travel', 'picture', 'Germany', '7% level', '1990 reunification', 'recession', 'growin']",2022-04-24,2022-04-24,seekingalpha.com

3449,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://coingeek.com/germany-commerzbank-seeks-license-for-digital-assets-custody/,Germany’s Commerzbank seeks license for digital assets custody,14 hours ago,Commerzbank (CBK) has become the first major German bank to make moves to enter the digital currency market. CBK has disclosed that it applied for a virtual assets license with Germany’s financial supervisory authority BaFin during the first quarter of 2022.The bank aims to serve as a digital currency exchange by offering custody and trading services for its clients if the license is approved. Commerzbank has over 18 million customers and around 70 000 institutional clients.Speaking in an interview with local media outlet Börsen-Zeitung  Bernd Reh  a senior spokesman for the bank  said the application is part of the banking giant’s ambition to pursue its digital assets strategy.“In addition  we are pursuing our own digital asset strategy and are also planning our own offerings for our customers in the coming years. We have applied for a license from the Bafin for the safekeeping of crypto assets ” he said.He also revealed that Commerzbank’s partnership with Deutsche Börse and Fin-Tech 330x last year was similarly in pursuit of embracing digital currencies. The bank also has a storied history with blockchain technology  going back to 2018 when it carried out one of the first transactions on Deutsche Boerse’s DLT Security Lending Platform.The banking behemoth is  however  not the first firm to apply for the license with BaFin. Since Germany passed legislation to allow financial service providers to apply for licenses to provide digital currency services in 2020  it has received over 25 applications. However  BaFin has approved only four of the applications  with the first being Coinbase (NASDAQ: COIN) Germany’s filing.Germany acting friendly with virtual assetsAt the time the legislation was passed  Germany’s central bank stated that it did not consider digital currencies to be a threat despite their growing popularity. The conviction the government has in the potential of digital assets continues to propel its policies to date.This year  Germany’s incoming government has stated that it is fully committed to digitalizing Europe’s largest economy. It aims to greatly improve digital currency regulations for the industry to create a level playing field for market participants across Europe.The previous and ongoing efforts of the German government have culminated in the country emerging as the most digital asset-friendly country in 2022  as ranked by Coincub. A recent study also found that up to $100 billion to $657 billion could flow into the digital currency market within the next three years.Watch: CoinGeek New York panel  Bitcoin & Blockchain – Can Real Value Come from Real Utility?New to Bitcoin?

Investors  activists  and regulators are now requiring proactive  community-structured commitment and accountability that is designed to step above shareholder returns.Today’s global capital markets aren’t interested in more marketing from companies in every industry. Instead  they are demanding sustainability and eco-friendly business practices as well as a reasonable return. Global retailers and their executives are now hearing this call  and the industry is being more proactive in this movement.Why are ESG standards needed?Although ESG metrics are still trying to find their proper place in today’s standardized financial reporting  that hasn’t stopped retailers and other industry institutions from making promises and illustrating the proactive nature of their ESG standards.What’s needed at this critical step is the ability for companies across all industries to truly quantify their company’s present position relative to investor objectives of integration  values  and impact in the areas of governance over environmental and social contexts. American stakeholders AND shareholders aren’t interested in window dressing and empty promises only for the benefit of a feel-good investor report. They want to know that companies are holding themselves accountable to the promises and commitments they’re making in these key areas.Proxy Advisors making unfair pressuresMany retail companies  specifically  have felt their fair share of pressure into adopting more ESG-forward practices. Whether through a reduction of plastic carrier bag usage or gender pay gap reporting  shareholders have certainly brought pressure on a large number of retail companies over their supply chain strategies  environmental and sustainability impacts  and certainly gender-diverse practices. This focus has led to a significant overhaul of many business processes alongside the appointment of a new addition to the C-Suite – the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO). Other companies inside and out of retail continuously look at leaders in this movement and have started to replicate their operational changes.However  making promises about ESG commitments and holding true to them are apparently two different stories for some. Many companies are being pushed into making ESG improvements and commitments  especially through institutional investors and oversight organizations such as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS).This has led some to wonder if these proxy advisors have become too focused on ESG issues  have conflicted  and have broadly too much power over the operation of America’s largest companies and retailers.ISS hypocrisy over ESG requirementsAs an example  ISS talks a big game on the issue of Diversity and Inclusion. ISS demanded publicly traded companies disclose the ethnicity of each and every member of their board of directors. More recently  ISS has been accused of refusing to recommend voting for board slates that they allege do not contain enough ‘diverse’ representation.However  it appears that ISS lacks representation from even a single person of color. Moreover  it does not appear that ISS's two corporate owners---Genstar Capital and Deutsche Boerse---have even a single person of color on their executive teams. This is troubling given the fact that they have claimed Diversity  Equity  and Inclusion is a priority and have asked publicly traded companies and retailers to make commitments towards those ends. Standards are not only needed  they must be adhered to at all levels.Retailers have a chance to serve as modelsDespite the hypocrisy demonstrated by organizations such as ISS  retailers have the opportunity to truly bring about change – not just in their marketing but in the way they go about doing business. In fact  as business models have had to adapt to this new landscape and changed customer behaviors  there has been evidence of the incorporation of ESG elements across the retail industry.These moves recognize it is not solely about making money and preserving the bottom line  but that retailers have been working toward having a positive societal impact. There is no doubt that these newly implemented strategies have the potential to drive increased valuations  which pushes up the appetite of investors  but that they also attract more qualified people into retail companies who are extremely committed to the corporate cause.As more retailers focus on staying committed to their ESG promises  everyone will win in the end  including customers  stakeholders  investors  the environment  and certainly employees. These companies will truly serve as models of operation in the future. But we must move beyond just promises and commitments  a new set of ESG standards must be developed to level the playing field of reporting.About The Author: Rashida Salahuddin is the President & CEO of The Corporate Citizenship Project.

London  UK - ETC Group ( Europe’s leading specialist provider of institutional-grade digital asset-backed securities  announced today the listing of the XRPetc - ETC Group physical XRP (Ticker: GXRP) on 22ndApril on Deutsche Börse Xetra  Europe’s leading exchange for digital assets.Ripple is a blockchain-based digital payment network and protocol with its own cryptocurrency  XRP. Since launching in 2012  Ripple has rapidly gained acceptance as a system for international money and security transfers by banks and financial middlemen dealing across geographies and currencies  with XRP currently ranked 6th by market cap of all cryptocurrencies.XRP will join the company’s suite of institutional-grade crypto exchange traded products including Bitcoin  Ethereum  Solana  Cardano  Polkadot  Litecoin  Avalanche  Cosmos  Polygon and Uniswap that trade on XETRA. The new ETC will be marketed and distributed by HANEtf and available in EUR and USD.Bradley Duke  Founder and co-CEO at ETC Group said: “Ripple is rapidly becoming a leader in global payment systems with hundreds of financial institutions choosing Ripple to provide a better international payments experience for their customers  in real-time. By launching this latest ETC to our expanding portfolio of high quality  physically backed digital assets  we’re continuing to grow our offering to investors  providing access to an increasingly wide range of digital currencies and assets - especially those amassing large market caps. The market leading success of our products has been driven by our partnerships with world-class liquidity providers to deliver high liquidity and tight trading spreads.”Hector McNeil  co-Founder and co-CEO at HANetf:“We are delighted to partner with ETC Group again to offer a new ETC backed by XRP.

But Jim Joyce from HealthBeacon next door is more evangelical about the power of digital …,"Across from the Luas stop in the Dublin suburb of Bluebell  a sign for the Rescue Church at a unit in the Naas Road Business Park reads ‘Jesus saves people’. But Jim Joyce from HealthBeacon next door is more evangelical about the power of digital health technology to save people.Joyce  a Bostonian who’s been living in Ireland for 16 years  is chief executive and co-founder of HealthBeacon. It has developed the world’s first FDA-cleared smart sharps bin  which help patients who have to self-inject medications in the home to treat chronic conditions such as diabetes  rheumatoid arthritis  multiple sclerosis  and Crohn’s disease.On a sunny but fresh Tuesday afternoon  Joyce is wearing black-and-white Guess trainers that he’s teamed with a pale grey suit and is demonstrating how his signature medical device works at HealthBeacon’s reception area. The startup-style space is decorated with white walls and wooden pallets painted pale green – the same colours as the device itself.The smart sharps bin lights up when it’s time for a patient to inject their medication. The device  which houses a rigid sharps disposal container and is connected to the user’s phone  tracks whether the medication has been taken at the right time  safely stores used injectors  and is posted back to HealthBeacon when it’s full.The device solves a quintessential problem for healthcare practitioners and the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture injectable medication – how to tackle the fact that as many as one in two patients fail to adhere to their medication schedule.HealthBeacon says there are 30m people in Europe and North America alone on such medications  including Joyce’s own mother  who has diabetes.“She’s in Florida and she has to take an injection ” Joyce says. “I also use the technology within my own family.“For me  the big motivation is that you have these medications that you can see  time and time again  transforming people’s lives. You have people in excruciating pain or they can’t get up. They might have debilitating Crohn’s disease  and then get put on these medications and get given their life back.""But they need help  right? It’s not intuitive to inject yourself with these medications. We live in this amazing time where we have these medications we can access – but if you don’t take them properly  they don’t do anyone any good.”In February  peer-reviewed research showed there was a 26pc improvement in medication adherence when patients used HealthBeacon’s technology.That same month  the company announced that it had added five more pharmaceutical companies and national healthcare systems to its client base  including the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) and the Health Service Executive (HSE)  on top of existing clients such as Novartis  Sanofi  Teva  and AbbVie.HealthBeacon operates in 17 countries and counts Mary Harney  a former health minister and Tánaiste  among its directors.Harney  who has a small stake in the company thanks to an employee share option plan  had a payday in mid-December when the fast-growing medtech firm floated on the Euronext Growth exchange in Dublin.The IPO raised €25m  the proceeds of which are going towards a largely US-focused expansion  investing in inventory so it can sell 100 000 units – ten times as many as it sold last year – by the end of 2023. It will also more than double the workforce to 150 people  and invest in further innovation and research and development.Read MoreDespite just generating €2.21m in revenue in 2021  Joyce was intent on floating the company to finance its ambitious growth strategy.The 52-year-old says his aim is to make HealthBeacon the world’s leading digital therapeutics platform for injectable medications  targeting a global market with the potential to generate circa $10bn (€9.2bn) in recurring revenue.“I’m trying to build a big  long-term  iconic digital healthcare company with headquarters in Dublin ” Joyce says. “The public markets are open to companies at the stage we’re at – and while it might be unusual in the Irish market for a company our size  it’s quite common in a lot of other European markets  like France  Belgium  Norway  Sweden.”Joyce’s confidence in the stock markets may also be explained in part by his history. When he was growing up in the Boston suburb of Needham  in a large Irish-American family (“there are 57 first cousins on one side alone”)  his father was a stockbroker.When he graduated from Fordham University in New York City  Joyce followed in his father’s footsteps by working in the investment business  putting in stints with Brown Brothers Harriman and Smith Barney.“I thought that it was one of the most fascinating fields  the whole idea of public markets and trading stocks  and the fast-paced nature of it ” he says. “But then I realised that was not something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.""I saw the people who were just entering the field versus the people who were there five or ten years later  and I just didn’t aspire to be like them anymore. I definitely wanted to get into building a business and going into an industry  whether it was technology or a pharmaceutical company.”With this change of heart  Joyce moved to Dublin in 1995 to pursue an MBA at UCD Smurfit School  where he met his Italian wife Emanuela. During a college milk round  Schering-Plough (now part of Merck & Co/MSD) recruited him to its management programme and sent him to New Jersey.Joyce eventually became director of the company’s US finance division and later ran its EMEA finance and planning division.“Every year I would set up the international plans for all the affiliates and I remember asking the UK affiliate  ‘Can you give me some results for the Irish market?’” he says. “They had no real information on what was happening.""I asked them if they’d heard of the Celtic Tiger and the fact that it was a growing economy. I pointed out that if we had an operation in Norway  then why didn’t we have one in Ireland? Eventually I convinced the management team to set up a dedicated Irish operation and they appointed me MD.“The best job you can have in pharmaceuticals is to be MD of a country operation. It was also a great job  in that your boss was not on the island and you’re in charge!”At Schering-Plough  Joyce became interested in transferring injectable medications out of crowded hospital settings and helped put in place programmes to treat patients at GP clinics and for nurses to train patients to self-inject at home.When he discovered a lack of companies to help provide these services  Joyce set up his own  called Point of Care Health Services  back in 2006.While running patient support services and sharps bin collections for pharma companies at Point of Care  Joyce noticed that when patients were left to their own devices  they often didn’t take their injectable medication on time.He realised a smart sharps bin which prompted patients to take their meds could be the answer.He sold a stake in Point of Care in 2009 to focus on developing this idea  and Uniphar acquired the remainder of the company in 2013. That same year he set up HealthBeacon with his co-founder Kieran Daly.He took the idea to his contacts in Ireland’s tight-knit pharma sector  and received positive feedback.“I had their backing throughout the process ” he says. “I’m too old an entrepreneur to not have clients.”The past 12 months have been pivotal for HealthBeacon. In addition to the IPO  the company signed a deal last year with Hamilton Beach Brands  an American marketer and distributor of home appliances  to sell smart sharps bins directly to consumers for around $500 a pop in North America.“Hamilton Beach introduces 100 products a year into the US and they are in 89pc of all US households ” Joyce says. “They’ve a lot of clout in the market.”The product has gone on sale on Smartsharpsbin.com and on Amazon  and will be available from chains such as CVS  Walgreens  Walmart  Target  and Costco later this year. Last week  an advertising campaign began  with commercials and patient influencers on YouTube  TikTok and Instagram.In March  the company signed what it described as a “transformational” multi-year contract to supply as many as 15 000 smart sharps bins to a leading US specialty pharmacy and insurance provider  thereby building “significant momentum” for the company.American entrepreneurs starting up businesses with global aspirations in Ireland may be few and far between – but Joyce’s links with the two countries and the connections he has forged in the pharma industry both sides of the Atlantic have proved a recipe for growth.“Even the person heading up our Boston office is president of the Boston Irish Business Association  so we’re on the circuit ” he says.“The biggest benefit I’ve seen is the success that Irish executives have at big pharmaceutical or medtech companies or even in the investment field. That means when they rise through the ranks of the organisation  we’ll have relationships with them.”Expand Close Jim Joyce and director Mary Harney / FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp Jim Joyce and director Mary HarneyCurriculum VitaeName: Jim JoyceAge: 52Position: CEO and co-founder of HealthBeaconLives: Ranelagh  Dublin 6Family: Married to Emanuela.

New issuances have similarly been tamed by market turbulence as just 78 new spacs floated on public markets  closing on $15bn in proceeds  the lowest quarter since the second quarter of 2020 at the cusp of the spac renaissance  according to data from investment analysis firm Pitchbook.UK IPO lead at accountancy firm EY Scott McCubbin said increased scrutiny by regulators in the US and UK meant the spac surge over the past two years was unlikely to be repeated.“The rules have changed and there’s been a move by the UK exchanges to make sure that they are aligned globally ” he said.“There has been a boom and a bust almost in the US and that is not going to be repeated in the UK. So the expectation that Spacs are going to be the vehicle that transforms the UK market into something much bigger than it currently is  I just don’t believe that will be the case and nor do I want it to be.”‘DeSpac-ed’ firms – those that have gone public via a merger – have also been hammered by recent routs on public markets sparked by soaring inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Pitchbook’s deSPAC Index  which tracks the post merger performance of firms  has posted a 35.6 per cent plunge since the beginning of 2022 relative to the S&P 500’s 10.6 per cent decline.But despite the slide in performance McCubbin says that spacs will remain a fixture on the markets without the frenzied fervour seen in the US in 2021.“Spacs are now there  spacs will happen  but they will be part of the portfolio of IPOs that comes into the market ” he tells City A.M.“They are a part of the toolkit alongside debt  private equity money  sovereign wealth funds  by which a firm can be acquired.”Some remain more bullish on the outlook for spacs and say the market and product have evolved with increased scrutiny.“I think where we are sort of at a maturity point in the spac boom which is which is a great thing to see ” says David Koch head of equity markets at UK investment firm GP Bullhound  which snubbed London to float a spac on Euronext this year.“We saw a flurry of issuance come out of what was a super investor friendly product developed in the US a few years ago  which created that sort of $100bn per annum of issuance and what made Europe scramble to replicate the product as quickly as possible.”But Koch says now the rules are “catching up” up with the products and regulators are clamping down on some of the loopholes.“It’s becomes much more of a mature product  and it’s good to see this in Europe  where it took a while for the market to kick off because it was lagging.”GP Bullhound raised €200m when it floated GP Bullhound Acquisition on the Euronext exchange in February with the aim of snapping up a tech firm with a focus on software  digital media  digital commerce or fintech.,negative,0.02,0.13,0.85,mixed,0.15,0.17,0.69,True,English,"['Spac boom falters', 'regulators', 'scrutiny', 'Special purpose acquisition companies', 'super investor friendly product', 'cash shell companies', 'fanciful financial forecasting', 'final three months', 'traditional IPO process', 'past two years', '35.6 per cent plunge', '10.6 per cent decline', 'City A.M.', 'sovereign wealth funds', 'private equity money', 'investment analysis firm', 'GP Bullhound Acquisition', 'SoFi swerving IPOs', 'UK IPO lead', 'EY Scott McCubbin', 'big name firms', 'UK investment firm', 'Spac boom falters', 'post merger performance', 'equity markets', 'accountancy firm', 'tech firm', 'global boom', 'record amounts', 'spac mergers', 'alternative route', 'associated fees', '66 fresh mergers', 'New issuances', 'spac renaissance', 'spac surge', 'UK exchanges', 'recent routs', 'soaring inflation', 'deSPAC Index', 'S&P 500', 'frenzied fervour', 'maturity point', 'great thing', 'mature product', 'digital media', 'digital commerce', 'blank-cheque firms', 'first quarter', 'lowest quarter', 'second quarter', 'DeSpac-ed’ firms', 'public markets', 'David Koch', 'Euronext exchange', 'market turbulence', 'UK market', '78 new spacs', 'regulators', 'scrutiny', 'investors', 'vehicles', 'acquisitions', 'data', 'CBInsights', 'WeWork', 'timelines', 'blizzard', 'deals', 'proceeds', 'cusp', 'Pitchbook', 'rules', 'move', 'bust', 'expectation', 'something', 'case', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'beginning', 'slide', 'fixture', 'part', 'portfolio', 'toolkit', 'debt', 'outlook', 'increased', 'head', 'London', 'flurry', 'sort', 'annum', 'Europe', 'products', 'loopholes', 'February', 'aim', 'focus', 'software', 'fintech']",2022-04-24,2022-04-24,cityam.com
3462,EuroNext,Google API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4502468-publicis-has-fully-digested-the-covid-19-impact-as-it-beats-my-expectations,Publicis Has Fully Digested The COVID-19 Impact As It Beats Expectations (OTCMKTS:PBCBF),1 day ago,"neirfy/iStock via Getty ImagesIntroductionIn September last year  I made the bold statement Publicis (OTCQX:PUBGY) (OTCQX:PGPEF) (OTCPK:PBCBF) would generate 1.2B EUR in free cash flow in 2021. As 2022 is now well underway with the PR and marketing firm already publishing a trading update for the first quarter of the year  I thought this would be a good moment to catch up on the company’s performance.Yahoo FinancePublicis has its main listing on Euronext Paris where it's trading with PUB as its ticker symbol. With almost 1 million shares changing hands on a daily basis  Publicis’ Paris listing is for sure the most liquid listing to trade in the company’s shares.FY 2021 was business as usualThe total revenue generated by Publicis in 2021 was approximately 11.7B EUR  an increase of approximately 10% compared to the FY2020 revenue. All operating expenses increased pretty much in line with the revenue and the EBITDA came in at 2.32B EUR. The total amount of depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by in excess of 20%  leading to a sharp increase of the ""operating margin.""Publicis Investor RelationsAs the company also reduced its impairment charges as well as the amortization of intangibles  the operating income increased by almost 50% to 1.43B EUR. Publicis remained a cash cow in 2021  and as the net debt decreased while the average cost of debt decreased as well  the net interest expenses went down by quite a bit. With a net income of 1.04B EUR of which 9M EUR was attributable to non-controlling interests  the bottom line shows a net income of 1.027B EUR which works out to be 4.13 EUR per share. That’s a substantial increase compared to the 2.40 EPS reported in FY 2020 despite seeing the share count increase by more than 3%.But when I discussed Publicis last time  I was more interested in the company’s free cash flow result as that’s what will enable Publicis to continue its M&A activities. Additionally  a substantial portion of the operating expenses consist of non-cash charges  and even the amortization of intangible assets after completing an acquisition are weighing on the result.In FY2021  Publicis reported an operating cash flow of 1.8B EUR  but this includes a 216M EUR investment in the working capital position. Simultaneously  we should deduct the 9M EUR paid to the non-controlling interests and the 295M EUR lease payments. And finally  the 156M EUR in net interest payments should be deducted as well.Publicis Investor RelationsThis means the adjusted operating cash flow was 1.6B EUR (as I also added back the difference between taxes owed and taxes paid). As you can see  the capex was just 139M EUR which means Publicis generated 1.46B EUR in free cash flow. That’s more than 20% higher than I had anticipated.Divided over the 248M shares outstanding  the free cash flow per share was approximately 5.9 EUR  which means Publicis is currently trading at a free cash flow yield of around 10%. Which is not bad at all.2022 has started well for PublicisOf course one of the main questions was whether or not Publicis can remain on track in 2022  and to see if the 2021 results were boosted by the pent-up demand after a COVID-intense year.Surprisingly  Publicis noted a very strong start of 2022 despite the uncertainty generated by the war in Ukraine in the second half of the quarter. The organic revenue growth came in at double digits with Europe and the Asia-Pacific Region posting a 14%-plus revenue growth.Publicis Investor RelationsThis has now allowed Publicis to firm up its full-year guidance and the company is now expecting to reach the upper end of its 4%-5% revenue growth target. This should have an immediate positive impact on both the net income as well as the free cash flow result and Publicis is now guiding for a full-year free cash flow result of 1.4B EUR. I think it may actually be able to do better than that  but we shouldn’t get ahead of ourselves as we have not even completed one third of the entire financial year.Investment thesisAs mentioned in my September article  I had sold my entire position in Publicis. Fortunately for me  the company’s financial performance has beat my expectations while the share price has remained pretty much unchanged so there seems to be an opportunity to get back in at the current levels. As of the end of 2021  Publicis had a net cash position (excluding lease liabilities which are obviously amortized over time) and with an EBITDA of 2B EUR (excluding lease liabilities)  the current market cap (and enterprise value) of less than 15B EUR appear to be very reasonable  especially as Publicis will continue to build its net cash position this year.I currently still don’t have a position but I’m keeping an eye on the option premiums as the put options are quite attractive. I haven’t made a decision yet but Publicis is now sufficiently attractive from a FCF perspective as well as a balance sheet perspective to get back in.",positive,0.51,0.44,0.06,mixed,0.38,0.21,0.41,True,English,"['COVID-19 Impact', 'Publicis', 'Expectations', 'OTCMKTS', 'PBCBF', 'full-year free cash flow result', 'free cash flow yield', '295M EUR lease payments', 'operating cash flow', 'M&A activities', 'net interest payments', 'immediate positive impact', 'current market cap', 'balance sheet perspective', 'working capital position', 'organic revenue growth', '14%-plus revenue growth', '4%-5% revenue growth target', 'net cash position', '216M EUR investment', 'net interest expenses', 'bold statement Publicis', 'Publicis Investor Relations', 'entire financial year', 'Publicis’ Paris listing', 'full-year guidance', 'cash cow', 'cash charges', 'entire position', 'lease liabilities', 'operating expenses', 'Euronext Paris', 'net income', 'Investment thesis', 'current levels', 'FCF perspective', 'main listing', 'liquid listing', 'total revenue', 'FY2020 revenue', 'operating margin', 'operating income', '1.2B EUR', '1.43B EUR', '156M EUR', '1.46B EUR', '1.4B EUR', '15B EUR', 'Getty Images', 'OTCQX:PUBGY', 'OTCQX:PGPEF', 'OTCPK:PBCBF', 'marketing firm', 'trading update', 'good moment', 'Yahoo Finance', 'ticker symbol', 'daily basis', 'total amount', 'impairment charges', 'net debt', 'average cost', 'controlling interests', 'substantial portion', 'intangible assets', 'main questions', 'pent-up demand', 'COVID-intense year', 'strong start', 'second half', 'double digits', 'Asia-Pacific Region', 'one third', 'financial performance', 'enterprise value', '9M EUR', '1 million shares', 'sharp increase', 'substantial increase', '248M shares', 'amortization expenses', 'first quarter', 'bottom line', 'share count', 'upper end', 'September article', 'share price', 'neirfy', 'iStock', 'Introduction', 'company', 'hands', 'business', '7B', 'EBITDA', '2.32B', 'depreciation', 'excess', 'intangibles', '1.04B', '2.40 EPS', 'acquisition', 'FY2021', 'difference', 'taxes', 'capex', '139M', 'track', '2021 results', 'uncertainty', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'Europe', 'expectations', 'opportunity', 'time', 'less', 'eye', 'option', 'premiums', 'decision']",2022-04-24,2022-04-24,seekingalpha.com

I think this is an opportunity to pick up stock as the market may not have fully noticed this storage company is diversifying away from oil. The cash flows are strong and predictable  and thanks to the robust balance sheet  Vopak is in a position to pay a rather attractive dividend. As Vopak’s business is storage and terminalling of a variety of products  I'm looking at this company as an infrastructure play.Yahoo FinanceVopak is a Dutch company and its listing on Euronext Amsterdam is a better option than its OTC listing. The ticker symbol in Amsterdam is VPK  and with an average daily volume of in excess of 400 000 shares (representing a monetary value of in excess of 10M EUR per day)  the Amsterdam listing clearly offers the best trading options. As Vopak trades and reports in EUR  I will use the Euro as base currency throughout this article.The FY 2021 results were relatively light  but still very decentAlthough the market conditions were what Vopak describes as ""soft "" the company was able to report very decent results in 2021. The EBITDA actually increased from 780M EUR to 827M EUR despite seeing the average occupancy ratio drop from 90% to 88%  and that EBITDA increase was almost entirely driven by the expansion program which contributed approximately 50M EUR in EBITDA. If anything  that’s a testament to Vopak’s growth plans which are underpinned by the demand for its offerings which can be divided into five main categories.Vopak Investor RelationsThanks to its worldwide presence  Vopak can take advantage of changing market circumstances and provide its customers the services they need  all over the world.Vopak Investor RelationsThe total revenue of Vopak increased from 1.19B EUR to 1.23B EUR and the total operating income (which really is the revenue  not to be confused with operating profit) was 1.27B EUR thanks to ""other"" revenue sources which include management fees for services provided to other entities.The reported EBIT decreased by approximately 15%  and a large portion is caused by the combination of a higher impairment charge and depreciation expenses. The total contribution from joint ventures and associates increased and the EBIT for FY2021 was 410M EUR.Vopak Investor RelationsAs you can see on the image above  the company’s finance costs also increased to in excess of 100M EUR. The bottom line shows a net income of 243M EUR of which 214M EUR was attributable to the shareholders of Vopak  representing an EPS of 1.71 EUR per share.That’s lower than in FY 2020 (despite generating a higher EBITDA) mainly due to the higher impairment charges  higher finance charges and a variety of exceptional items. The majority of those exceptional items was related to the impairment charge  but the total impact of these exceptional items was almost 80M EUR higher than in FY 2020.Vopak Investor RelationsSo if we would exclude the exceptional items  Vopak’s total performance was roughly in line with the 2020 results. Not great  but also not as bad as a blind comparison of the EPS may lead you to think.As this is an infrastructure company  looking at the sustaining free cash flow could potentially make more sense than making an investment decision solely based on the EPS.Vopak Investor RelationsThe cash flow statement starts with a 682M EUR operating cash flow but we should still deduct the lease payments (34M EUR) and interest payments (99M EUR  including the interest payments related to leases). On top of that  I'm also deducting the 25M EUR in payments to non-controlling interests.This results in an adjusted operating cash flow of 524M EUR.Vopak is making the life of its investors easier by clearly splitting up growth investments and sustaining capex. The total sustaining capex came in at 291M EUR  resulting in an underlying free cash flow result of 233M EUR. Divided over 125.5M shares outstanding  the sustaining free cash flow per share is 1.86 EUR. This represents a free cash flow yield of just over 6.6% at the current share price of 27.90 EUR. Vopak will be paying an annual dividend of 1.25 EUR per share which represents a yield of approximately 4.5% at the current share price.Vopak Investor RelationsThe company continues to expand  but the market still sees it as an oil storage companyAn infrastructure company with a robust earnings profile should not see its share price slide. While I understand the market’s concerns about the demand for oil in the future I think Vopak is seen and (unfairly) treated as an oil storage company. Throughout the past few years  the contribution from oil terminals has consistently decreased as Vopak is expanding in other domains.Vopak Investor RelationsThat’s also clearly visible in the growth capex breakdown. On average  less than 20% of the growth capex going forward will be spent on oil terminals.Vopak Investor RelationsThis should result in an even lower contribution from the oil terminals to the total revenue and this should hopefully help with the perception Vopak is an ""oil terminal company."" And after bringing a few new projects online in 2021  Vopak will complete several more growth initiatives in 2022 and 2023.Vopak Investor RelationsA second reason why the market may be a little bit reluctant at this point is the decreasing occupancy ratio in throughout 2021. After seeing excellent levels during the pandemic  the occupancy rate fell from 90% as of the end of 2020 to just 86% as of the end of 2021. No reason to be alarmed  but it is an element to keep an eye on.Vopak Investor RelationsThe balance sheet can clearly handle the growth investments. As of the end of 2021  the net financial debt (excluding lease liabilities) was 2.2B EUR resulting in a debt ratio of less than 3 given the EBITDA (excluding lease payments) of just under 800M EUR.Investment thesisI haven’t owned a position in Vopak for years  but I'm getting ready to go long again. I have written put options with a strike price of 27 EUR expiring in both May and June and although those puts are currently out of the money  the stock will go ex-dividend before the expiration dates. I most definitely wouldn’t mind going long at 27 EUR per share as that would represent a sustaining free cash flow yield of around 7% for this year based on my expectations.Once the stock trades ex-dividend  I will likely write some more put options as the option premiums are quite attractive.",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,mixed,0.37,0.11,0.51,True,English,"['Vopak', 'Infrastructure', 'Storage', '4.5% Yield', 'OTCMKTS', 'VOPKF', 'underlying free cash flow result', '682M EUR operating cash flow', 'sustaining free cash flow', 'free cash flow yield', 'cash flow statement', 'robust balance sheet', 'average daily volume', 'best trading options', 'average occupancy ratio', 'five main categories', 'robust earnings profile', 'higher impairment charges', 'total operating income', 'higher finance charges', 'current share price', 'share price slide', 'Vopak Investor Relations', 'total sustaining capex', 'growth capex breakdown', 'other"" revenue sources', 'The FY 2021 results', 'oil storage company', 'cash flows', 'operating profit', 'net income', '50M EUR', '214M EUR', '25M EUR', 'Yahoo Finance', 'total revenue', 'other entities', 'finance costs', 'total impact', 'total performance', 'other domains', 'growth plans', 'higher EBITDA', 'growth investments', 'André Muller', 'iStock Editorial', 'Getty Images', 'OTCPK:VOPKF', 'good results', 'multi-year lows', 'attractive dividend', 'infrastructure play', 'ticker symbol', 'monetary value', 'base currency', 'decent results', 'expansion program', 'worldwide presence', 'management fees', 'large portion', 'depreciation expenses', 'joint ventures', 'exceptional items', 'blind comparison', 'investment decision', 'non-controlling interests', 'annual dividend', 'oil terminals', 'total contribution', 'Dutch company', 'infrastructure company', 'lease payments', 'interest payments', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'OTC listing', 'Vopak trades', 'EBITDA increase', 'bottom line', '125.5M shares', 'market conditions', 'market circumstances', 'Amsterdam listing', '2020 results', '400,000 shares', 'Introduction', 'four', 'Alpha', 'past', 'years', 'opportunity', 'position', 'business', 'terminalling', 'variety', 'products', 'VPK', 'excess', '10M', 'day', 'reports', 'article', '780M', '827M', 'testament', 'demand', 'offerings', 'advantage', 'changing', 'customers', 'services', '1.19B', '1.23B', '27B', 'combination', 'associates', 'FY2021', '100M', '243M', 'shareholders', 'EPS', 'majority', 'sense', '34M', 'leases', 'top', '524M', 'life', 'investors', '291M', '233M', 'concerns', 'future', 'less', '1.71', '90']",2022-04-24,2022-04-24,seekingalpha.com

The 16-year-old from Chennai blew away the oldest player in the field with two game wins to take the Round 2 match 2.5 to 0.5.It followed up Pragg's impressive Round 1 match win over Jorden van Foreest and leaves him out in front as the only player with the maximum 6 tournament points.""He basically beat Shakhriyar with his own trademark attacking style... wonderful game by Pragg!"" Grandmaster Peter Leko enthused after the pair's first encounter.Having recorded his second clean victory in leg 3 of the Meltwater Champions Chess Tour  Pragg picked up another 3-point haul and prize of $7 500. The youngster is fast becoming a real force.Rameshbabu said afterwards that he ""definitely didn't expect a win like this"" while Mamedyarov said the India ""deserved it  he played better"".While Pragg was on fire  World Champion Magnus Carlsen was far from his best as he crashed to a 2.5-1.5 loss against Airthings Masters finalist Liem Quang Le.The Norwegian was late into the arena after playing in a benefit match for Ukraine and then appeared to fall to pieces against Vietnam's speed chess specialist.At one point in the first game  Carlsen even appeared to nod off - or at least rest his eyes - before rousing himself to make a move.Carlsen's weariness was apparent in his play too. A series of small mistakes in game 1 led to the champion walking into a knight-fork and with 39.Qe4 he suffered a horror mouse-slip which lost the game on the spot. It was all very uncharacteristic for the champ and he was 1-0 down.The second game started with Carlsen again late to the board. Liem was left waiting after playing 1.d4. A slower  solid game ended in a draw and Liem still in the lead.It ramped up the pressure on Carlsen who now had no margin for error in the four-game match. But Carlsen is never easily beaten and bounced back in style to take the third.Carlsen and Liem were level-pegging going into the final game of the match with tiebreaks looming if neither player could make the breakthrough.The crucial game did not disappoint. Grandmaster David Howell said it was ""chaos from start to finish"" before Liem broke through in the endgame to take the 3 points in dramatic fashion.Carlsen gave a thumbs up to say well played to his opponent. ""It's been a struggle "" he said leaving the arena.A clearly overjoyed Liem said: ""It means a lot to me. I believe this is the first time I've really beaten him in a game and also in a match and I think not too many people can manage to beat Magnus in a match.""He added: ""It gives me a lot of joy  and fun and motivation to do better in the rest of the tournament.""The Dutchman Jorden van Foreest also showed off his creativity with an impressive win over Eric Hansen that included a magical move that caught the eye in game 2.Van Foreest played a move that looked like a mouse-slip: 12.Kd2  intending to castle his king by hand with 3.Kc2 and 14.Kb1. But this was no mistake. The 22-year-old had realised he had time to pull off the manoeuvre and it eventually led to a winning position. GM Leko suggested it could be ""the novelty of the year!""But in game 3 Van Foreest took his eye off the ball and a 360 turnaround saw Hansen pull of an unlikely win to give him hope going into the final game.Still ahead  Van Foreest only need a draw though and secured it with a composed defence to take the 3 points.The last match to finish was the encounter between the Polish No.1 Jan-Krzysztof Duda and Dutch No.1 Anish Giri which became the first of the tournament to go to tiebreaks after it finished 2-2 following four close draws.Duda eventually forced the match win with victory in the both the blitz games to take a split 2-point win with Giri salvaging 1 point.Round 3 starts at 18:00 CEST on Sunday.

3466,EuroNext,Bing API,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4503218-intercontinental-exchange-ice-dividend-investors-outperformance-decent-yield,Intercontinental Exchange: Where Dividend Investors Go For Outperformance,Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is a great stock for dividend growth investors. Read more to see why I think ICE's valuation is favorable now.,"Spencer Platt/Getty Images NewsIntroductionIn light of ongoing market ""turmoil""  it's time to talk about a stock that I recommend investors to buy on weakness. As a dividend growth investor  I'm constantly on the hunt for attractive long-term opportunities for myself and my clients/followers. In this case  we're dealing with a stock that has everything I'm looking for in a dividend growth stock. Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) offers high dividend growth  a sustainable debt load  and a stellar business model that comes with long-term outperformance thanks to high and rising free cash flow. Moreover  because of market weakness  the stock has once again reached a favorable valuation.So  if you have a long-term investment horizon and the need for a stock where dividend growth is more important than a high yield  I invite you to read my thoughts on this Georgia-based financial giant.High Yield vs. Low YieldBefore I started writing this article  I took some time to update my personal files  which I hadn't done in a while. Especially because I'm once again going to spend time talking about growth and value  I wanted to share my own ""average"" yield with readers. As of April 23  2022  the average yield on my dividend growth portfolio (95% of my net worth) is 2.4%. The yield on cost is 3.4%. I started my portfolio in 2020. The table below shows my holdings ranked from highest yield on cost to lowest yield on cost.AuthorAs the table above shows  I like to buy a mix of dividend growth and high yield. In this case  I only buy high yield when it's on sale as that makes the impact of often slow dividend growth bigger. If I don't find anything on sale  I don't buy a high-yielding stock.The reason why I prefer dividend growth stocks is that - historically speaking - they tend to come with significant outperformance. As the graph below shows  dividend growers and initiators outperformed an already stellar performance of dividend payers.Hartford FundsWhile it's a lot of fun to receive high dividends every quarter  it's more important that I don't underperform the market. After all  it's always possible to put (high) potential capital gains in high yield stocks when the emphasis shifts from growing wealth to preserving wealth and living off of dividends.In the case of ICE  we're dealing with an interesting dividend scorecard. The company achieves rather high scores on dividend safety and dividend growth  which are often highly correlated. For example  high free cash flow means high dividend safety  and it often also means that management uses the opportunity to grow its dividend more aggressively.The dividend yield is graded a big fat D-. However  please bear in mind that this is RELATIVE grading. In this case  ICE  operating in the Financial Data & Stock Exchange industry  is compared to the financial sector. This sector includes a lot of regional banks and money center banks with high dividend yields.Seeking AlphaIntercontinental Exchange currently pays a $0.38 quarterly dividend per share. This is the result of a 15.2% hike announced on February 3  2022. This puts the annual payout at $1.52. This implies a 1.30% dividend yield based on the current $117 stock price. The S&P 500 is also yielding 1.30%.Now  let me explain why the company is outperforming the market - by a lot.ICE  Home Of Loads Of Shareholder ValueIn light of the chart showing the S&P 500 performance breakdown chart  let me start this segment by showing that ICE is indeed outperforming the market.Over the past 10 years  ICE has returned 407% including dividends (total return). This beats the iShares US Broker/Dealer ETF (IAI) by almost 40 points. The S&P 500 returned 274%  which isn't bad either but much lower. The outperformance becomes even more extreme when zooming out  which confirms the basic theory that (sustainable) dividend growth outperforms the market.Data by YChartsThe fact that ICE can outperform the market starts with its business model. ICE has a massive footprint in the financial industry  mainly in global exchanges  fixed income  and mortgage technology.This is what I wrote last year:Over the past 20 years  the company has become a financial powerhouse with a market cap of more than $66 billion and roughly 9 000 employees across the globe. On a full-year basis  the company generates roughly 55% of its sales through its exchanges business. 27% of its sales come from fixed income and data services  while 18% of sales are provided by mortgage technology. The company's timeline below shows how this was achieved through the acquisitions of various large institutions. For example  in 2013  the company bought NYSE Euronext  which expanded the company's footprint in equities and options. This organization operates a wide variety of securities exchanges  including the New York Stock Exchange  Euronext  and NYSE Arca.Intercontinental Exchange Inc.The company's portfolio includes agriculture futures (like coffee and orange juice)  energy  equities  forex  metals  as well as credit and other futures on an international scale. On March 31  the company announced that it will launch mortgage futures. 10 days prior to that  it announced biotech and semiconductor index futures.This business model allows the company to benefit from increasing global transactions  the need for clearing services  hedging requirements  and more automated and advanced mortgage industry.Between 2006 and 2021  the company has grown adjusted earnings per share from $0.48 to $5.15  which translates to a compounded annual growth rate of 17%.Intercontinental Exchange Inc.In this case  the company is generating a lot of free cash flow as well. Before I show you the numbers  keep in mind that free cash flow is basically net income adjusted for operating non-cash items and capital expenditures. It's cash a company can spend on dividends  buybacks  and debt reduction.The graph below shows total (expected) free cash flow and shareholder distributions consisting of direct distributions (dividends) and indirect distributions (share buybacks). Between 2011 and 2024 (expected)  free cash flow is rising by 13.6% per year. This is resulting in close to $3.5 billion in expected 2023 free cash flow.AuthorTo put these numbers into perspective. ICE has a $66 billion market cap. $3.5 billion in free cash flow implies a free cash flow yield of 5.3%. As the company's dividend yield is just 1.3%  it means there is a lot of room for dividend growth and annual buybacks to boost returns.The next graph shows annual buybacks and dividends. ICE clearly emphasizes buybacks in times when free cash flow is high.AuthorWhile buybacks are volatile (they almost always are)  dividends are more consistent. ICE initiated its dividend in 2013  which makes it one of the younger dividend growth stocks on the market. Over the past 5 years  dividend growth has averaged 19.0% per year. While I do not expect that number to last  I think longer-term dividend growth will remain close to 15%. Again  that's not a promise  but it's extremely reasonable based on the numbers.TIKRMoreover  the company will more than likely continue to engage in bigger acquisitions to shape its business model and deploy free cash flow. This will not necessarily impact dividends  but it will impact share buybacks as big acquisitions require new debt (not enough free cash flow). Last year  for example  buybacks were reduced to focus on debt reduction after the 2020 acquisition of Ellie Mae.AuthorThis acquisition gave the company a huge footprint in mortgages  which is expected to boost secular growth based on analog to digital conversion across the entire workflow. In 2021  the mortgage segment reported 17% pro format growth. The company did $1.4 billion in revenue in what management believes to be a $10 billion total addressable market.As the graph below shows  this deal pushed net debt to $16.0 billion  which was close to 4x EBITDA back then. In 2021  net debt was lowered to $13.3 billion due to lower buybacks. The net leverage ratio fell to 2.9x. Next year  net debt is expected to fall to $11.8 billion  which is barely higher than 2.3x EBITDA.TIKRSo  there's one piece of the puzzle missing: valuation.ValuationThis market is incredibly challenging - for traders. Last week was ugly as the market closed the week in correction territory (-10% from all-time high). We're in a situation where multiple economic growth indicators are rolling over  inflation remains high  and geopolitical tensions continue to pressure supply chains (and inflation). Even worse  the Federal Reserve is now expected to start a rather aggressive hiking cycle. Once again  the Fed could find itself hiking into economic weakness.Moreover  rates are high and consumer confidence is suffering. None of this will make life very hard for ICE  but it doesn't support investors' and traders' willingness to take risks. As investors are de-risking their portfolios  we see that ICE is suffering too. The stock is down 5.9% last week  which lowers the YTD performance to -14.3%.As a long-term investor  I'm not complaining. While it's never fun to see a rather steep decline in one's net worth every now and then  it does provide opportunities. And isn't it more fun to buy at a good valuation than to chase prices to new highs?FINVIZIn the case of ICE  we're dealing with a market cap of $66 billion as I already briefly mentioned in this article. Next year  the company is expected to lower its net debt to $11.8 billion. I'm going with that number instead of 2022 to price in the use of free cash flow when it comes to reducing debt. The company also has $200 million in pension-related liabilities and $40 million in minority interest  which we need to include as well.This gives us an enterprise value of $78 billion. That's 15.3x next year's expected EBITDA of $5.1 billion.It's not a deal value multiple  but it's good.TIKRMy recommendation for people without exposure who want in is to break up the first investment. The market could easily fall further as the environment has become a bit toxic. To take away some entry risk  I would buy some now and more in intervals of 2-3 weeks. That way  investors have a foot in the door if the market (and ICE) rises. If the market continues to fall  investors can average down.I think that's the way to go for long-term investors. It's how I will approach my upcoming investments as well.TakeawayThe market is weakening  which is offering investors like myself new opportunities. One stock I recommend to long-term dividend growth investors is Intercontinental Exchange Inc. The company has an ""average"" yield but high dividend growth thanks to a stellar business model  which provides strong and rapidly rising free cash flow. Management is eager and able to use free cash flow to boost both dividends and buybacks as the company's balance sheet is quickly becoming de-leveraged again after the 2020 acquisition of Ellie Mae.Dividend growth investors will more than likely benefit from long-term outperforming capital gains and dividend growth when adding ICE to their portfolio. I recommend buying in stages to lower entry risk due to ongoing market uncertainty  which is the only reason why my rating is ""neutral"" for the time being.(Dis)agree?
