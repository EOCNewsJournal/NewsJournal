But Jim Joyce from HealthBeacon next door is more evangelical about the power of digital …,"Across from the Luas stop in the Dublin suburb of Bluebell  a sign for the Rescue Church at a unit in the Naas Road Business Park reads ‘Jesus saves people’. But Jim Joyce from HealthBeacon next door is more evangelical about the power of digital health technology to save people.Joyce  a Bostonian who’s been living in Ireland for 16 years  is chief executive and co-founder of HealthBeacon. It has developed the world’s first FDA-cleared smart sharps bin  which help patients who have to self-inject medications in the home to treat chronic conditions such as diabetes  rheumatoid arthritis  multiple sclerosis  and Crohn’s disease.On a sunny but fresh Tuesday afternoon  Joyce is wearing black-and-white Guess trainers that he’s teamed with a pale grey suit and is demonstrating how his signature medical device works at HealthBeacon’s reception area. The startup-style space is decorated with white walls and wooden pallets painted pale green – the same colours as the device itself.The smart sharps bin lights up when it’s time for a patient to inject their medication. The device  which houses a rigid sharps disposal container and is connected to the user’s phone  tracks whether the medication has been taken at the right time  safely stores used injectors  and is posted back to HealthBeacon when it’s full.The device solves a quintessential problem for healthcare practitioners and the pharmaceutical companies that manufacture injectable medication – how to tackle the fact that as many as one in two patients fail to adhere to their medication schedule.HealthBeacon says there are 30m people in Europe and North America alone on such medications  including Joyce’s own mother  who has diabetes.“She’s in Florida and she has to take an injection ” Joyce says. “I also use the technology within my own family.“For me  the big motivation is that you have these medications that you can see  time and time again  transforming people’s lives. You have people in excruciating pain or they can’t get up. They might have debilitating Crohn’s disease  and then get put on these medications and get given their life back.""But they need help  right? It’s not intuitive to inject yourself with these medications. We live in this amazing time where we have these medications we can access – but if you don’t take them properly  they don’t do anyone any good.”In February  peer-reviewed research showed there was a 26pc improvement in medication adherence when patients used HealthBeacon’s technology.That same month  the company announced that it had added five more pharmaceutical companies and national healthcare systems to its client base  including the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) and the Health Service Executive (HSE)  on top of existing clients such as Novartis  Sanofi  Teva  and AbbVie.HealthBeacon operates in 17 countries and counts Mary Harney  a former health minister and Tánaiste  among its directors.Harney  who has a small stake in the company thanks to an employee share option plan  had a payday in mid-December when the fast-growing medtech firm floated on the Euronext Growth exchange in Dublin.The IPO raised €25m  the proceeds of which are going towards a largely US-focused expansion  investing in inventory so it can sell 100 000 units – ten times as many as it sold last year – by the end of 2023. It will also more than double the workforce to 150 people  and invest in further innovation and research and development.Read MoreDespite just generating €2.21m in revenue in 2021  Joyce was intent on floating the company to finance its ambitious growth strategy.The 52-year-old says his aim is to make HealthBeacon the world’s leading digital therapeutics platform for injectable medications  targeting a global market with the potential to generate circa $10bn (€9.2bn) in recurring revenue.“I’m trying to build a big  long-term  iconic digital healthcare company with headquarters in Dublin ” Joyce says. “The public markets are open to companies at the stage we’re at – and while it might be unusual in the Irish market for a company our size  it’s quite common in a lot of other European markets  like France  Belgium  Norway  Sweden.”Joyce’s confidence in the stock markets may also be explained in part by his history. When he was growing up in the Boston suburb of Needham  in a large Irish-American family (“there are 57 first cousins on one side alone”)  his father was a stockbroker.When he graduated from Fordham University in New York City  Joyce followed in his father’s footsteps by working in the investment business  putting in stints with Brown Brothers Harriman and Smith Barney.“I thought that it was one of the most fascinating fields  the whole idea of public markets and trading stocks  and the fast-paced nature of it ” he says. “But then I realised that was not something I wanted to do for the rest of my life.""I saw the people who were just entering the field versus the people who were there five or ten years later  and I just didn’t aspire to be like them anymore. I definitely wanted to get into building a business and going into an industry  whether it was technology or a pharmaceutical company.”With this change of heart  Joyce moved to Dublin in 1995 to pursue an MBA at UCD Smurfit School  where he met his Italian wife Emanuela. During a college milk round  Schering-Plough (now part of Merck & Co/MSD) recruited him to its management programme and sent him to New Jersey.Joyce eventually became director of the company’s US finance division and later ran its EMEA finance and planning division.“Every year I would set up the international plans for all the affiliates and I remember asking the UK affiliate  ‘Can you give me some results for the Irish market?’” he says. “They had no real information on what was happening.""I asked them if they’d heard of the Celtic Tiger and the fact that it was a growing economy. I pointed out that if we had an operation in Norway  then why didn’t we have one in Ireland? Eventually I convinced the management team to set up a dedicated Irish operation and they appointed me MD.“The best job you can have in pharmaceuticals is to be MD of a country operation. It was also a great job  in that your boss was not on the island and you’re in charge!”At Schering-Plough  Joyce became interested in transferring injectable medications out of crowded hospital settings and helped put in place programmes to treat patients at GP clinics and for nurses to train patients to self-inject at home.When he discovered a lack of companies to help provide these services  Joyce set up his own  called Point of Care Health Services  back in 2006.While running patient support services and sharps bin collections for pharma companies at Point of Care  Joyce noticed that when patients were left to their own devices  they often didn’t take their injectable medication on time.He realised a smart sharps bin which prompted patients to take their meds could be the answer.He sold a stake in Point of Care in 2009 to focus on developing this idea  and Uniphar acquired the remainder of the company in 2013. That same year he set up HealthBeacon with his co-founder Kieran Daly.He took the idea to his contacts in Ireland’s tight-knit pharma sector  and received positive feedback.“I had their backing throughout the process ” he says. “I’m too old an entrepreneur to not have clients.”The past 12 months have been pivotal for HealthBeacon. In addition to the IPO  the company signed a deal last year with Hamilton Beach Brands  an American marketer and distributor of home appliances  to sell smart sharps bins directly to consumers for around $500 a pop in North America.“Hamilton Beach introduces 100 products a year into the US and they are in 89pc of all US households ” Joyce says. “They’ve a lot of clout in the market.”The product has gone on sale on Smartsharpsbin.com and on Amazon  and will be available from chains such as CVS  Walgreens  Walmart  Target  and Costco later this year. Last week  an advertising campaign began  with commercials and patient influencers on YouTube  TikTok and Instagram.In March  the company signed what it described as a “transformational” multi-year contract to supply as many as 15 000 smart sharps bins to a leading US specialty pharmacy and insurance provider  thereby building “significant momentum” for the company.American entrepreneurs starting up businesses with global aspirations in Ireland may be few and far between – but Joyce’s links with the two countries and the connections he has forged in the pharma industry both sides of the Atlantic have proved a recipe for growth.“Even the person heading up our Boston office is president of the Boston Irish Business Association  so we’re on the circuit ” he says.“The biggest benefit I’ve seen is the success that Irish executives have at big pharmaceutical or medtech companies or even in the investment field. That means when they rise through the ranks of the organisation  we’ll have relationships with them.”Expand Close Jim Joyce and director Mary Harney / FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsapp Jim Joyce and director Mary HarneyCurriculum VitaeName: Jim JoyceAge: 52Position: CEO and co-founder of HealthBeaconLives: Ranelagh  Dublin 6Family: Married to Emanuela.

Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company during the period from and including the date when the warrants have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) up to and including 31 March 2026  at an exercise price equal to the shares' quota value (currently EUR 0.000262). The warrants shall be issued to the Company without consideration.In order to fulfil the commitments arising from LTI 2022 Staff  the board proposes that the general meeting authorizes that the Company may assign warrants to a third party  or in another way dispose over the warrants  in accordance with the above.The warrants will be governed by complete terms and conditions  including inter alia re-calculation provisions.CostsThe stock options are expected to incur accounting costs (accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2) as well as social security costs during the term of the stock options. According to IFRS 2  the stock option costs shall be recorded as a personnel expense in the income statement during the vesting period. The total costs for stock options  calculated in accordance with IFRS 2  are estimated to amount to approximately EUR 0.33m during the term of the program (excluding social security costs). The estimated costs have been calculated based on  inter alia  the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Company's share of EUR 0.022 at the time of grant  (ii) an estimated future volatility in respect of the Company's share during the term of the stock options of 40 per cent  (iii) that the maximum number of stock options encompassed by this resolution proposal are granted to participants and (iv) that all granted stock options will vest and be exercised. Social security costs  which are expected to arise primarily in connection to the exercise of stock options  are estimated to amount to approximately EUR 0.00m during the term of the program  based on inter alia the assumptions set out under items (i)-(iv) above as well as an average social security rate of 0.64 per cent and an annual increase in the market price of the Company's share of 20 per cent during the vesting period.Other costs related to LTI 2022 Staff  including inter alia expenses related to fees to external advisors  external appraiser and administration of the incentive program  are estimated to amount to approximately EUR 85k during the term of the program.DilutionUpon exercise of all stock options within LTI 2022 Staff  up to 88 750 000 new shares (with reservation for any re-calculation) may be issued  equivalent to a maximum dilution of approximately 11.10 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company as of the day of this proposal and a maximum dilution of approximately 7.64 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company taking into account the maximum of 361 911 829 new shares that can be issued upon full exercise of 361 911 829 warrants (TO1) that the Company issued in 2021  with exercise period July / August 2022.Motivation in respect of stock options vesting and exercise conditionsAccording to recommendations laid down by the Swedish Corporate Governance Board (Sw. Kollegiet för svensk bolagsstyrning)  the vesting period in incentive programs such as LTI 2022 Staff shall as a general rule not be shorter than three (3) years. As set out further above  vesting of stock options will start on the first anniversary of the date of grant of the stock options  and before the third anniversary of the date of grant  up to 2/3 of the stock options granted to a participant may have vested and been exercised (provided that all applicable vesting conditions have then been fulfilled  including the Performance Conditions). The reason for applying such terms  which are diverting from the recommendations set out above  is that the board deem such terms to be in line with market practice for stock option programs in most of the countries where the intended participants in LTI 2022 Staff are operative. It is therefore  in the opinion of the board  in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to apply such terms in order to fulfil the objectives of LTI 2022 Staff.Preparation of the proposalThis proposal in respect of LTI 2022 Staff has been prepared by the board in consultation with external advisers.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rightsThe reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to implement LTI 2022 Staff.Majority requirementA resolution to approve the present proposal is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting.AuthorizationIt is proposed that the board  or a person appointed by the board  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) and Euroclear Sweden AB.Item 14 - Resolution to grant the board of directors the authority to issue shares  convertible instruments and warrantsIt is proposed that the general meeting resolves to authorise the board of directors to  until the next annual general meeting  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  on one or several occasions  resolve to issue shares  convertible instruments and/or warrants. Payment may be made in cash and/or with a condition to pay in kind or by way of set-off  or other conditions. The issues are to be performed on market conditions  taking into account any discount on market terms. The reason for the authorization and the reason for the possible deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable capital raisings for the acquisition of companies or businesses  or portions thereof  funding of the operations of the Company as well as settlement of debt.A resolution to approve the present proposal is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting.Number of shares and votesThere are in total 710 802 055 shares and votes in the Company.DocumentsRelevant documents will be available with the Company (address above) and on the Company's webpage  www.cyber1.com  not less than three weeks before the general meeting.

Kollegiet för svensk bolagsstyrning)  the vesting period in incentive programs such as LTI 2022 Staff shall as a general rule not be shorter than three (3) years. As set out further above  vesting of stock options will start on the first anniversary of the date of grant of the stock options  and before the third anniversary of the date of grant  up to 2/3 of the stock options granted to a participant may have vested and been exercised (provided that all applicable vesting conditions have then been fulfilled  including the Performance Conditions). The reason for applying such terms  which are diverting from the recommendations set out above  is that the board deem such terms to be in line with market practice for stock option programs in most of the countries where the intended participants in LTI 2022 Staff are operative. It is therefore  in the opinion of the board  in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to apply such terms in order to fulfil the objectives of LTI 2022 Staff.Preparation of the proposalThis proposal in respect of LTI 2022 Staff has been prepared by the board in consultation with external advisers.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rightsThe reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to implement LTI 2022 Staff.Majority requirementA resolution to approve the present proposal is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting.AuthorizationIt is proposed that the board  or a person appointed by the board  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw.

Payment may be made in cash and/or with a condition to pay in kind or by way of set-off  or other conditions. The issues are to be performed on market conditions  taking into account any discount on market terms.

The Issuer and the Company propose to invite the Bondholders to submit Conversion Notices to convert theirholdings of the Convertible Bonds into Shares at any time between 4:30 p.m. (Hong Kong time) on 25 April 2022 and 3:00 p.m. (Hong Kong time) on 28 April 2022 (subject to early closure where the Maximum Acceptance Amount is reached prior to such time) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Convertible Bonds and the procedures set out in this announcement. The Maximum Acceptance Amount shall be US$105 000 000  representing 60% of the outstanding ConvertibleBonds  being the maximum principal amount of Convertible Bonds in respect of which the Issuer will pay the Early Cash Incentive or the Cash Incentive. The Issuer will therefore only pay an Early Cash Incentive or a Cash Incentive in respect of up to US$105 000 000 in principal amount of Convertible Bonds. By way of illustration  if an Early Cash Incentive is paid in respect of the entire Maximum Acceptance Amount  the amount payable by the Issuer in aggregate will be US$15 225 000.

Assuming full conversion of the Maximum Acceptance Amount at the Conversion Price of HK$1.93 per Share  60% of the outstanding Convertible Bonds will be convertible into 426 316 321 Shares  representing approximately 8.83% of the issued share capital as at the date of this announcement and approximately 8.12% of the issued share capital of the Company as enlarged by the issue of the Conversion Shares. Assuming full conversion of the outstanding Convertible Bonds at the Conversion Price  the outstanding Convertible Bonds will be convertible into 710 527 202 Shares  representing approximately 14.72% of the issued share capital of the Company as at the date of this announcement and approximately 12.83% of the issued share capital of the Company as enlarged by the issue of the Conversion Shares. The Conversion Shares issued upon conversion of the outstanding Convertible Bonds  will rank pari passu in all respects with the Shares then in issue on the relevant date of registration of holders of such Conversion Shares on the register of members of the Company. The Specific Mandate will be utilised to issue the Conversion Shares and therefore no additional approval fromShareholders of the Company is required for the allotment and issue of the Conversion Shares. The Proposed Conversion Offer is aimed at optimising the capital structure of the Company. The conversion bythe Bondholders will reduce net borrowings  strengthen the Company's equity capital and lower finance costs  thereby deleveraging its balance sheet.

The board of directors shall be authorised to adopt decisions on an issue of shares  warrants and/or convertible instruments with deviation from the shareholders’ pre-emption rights and/or an issue in kind or an issue by way of set-off or otherwise on such terms and conditions as referred to in Chapter 2  Section 5  second paragraph  points 1-3 and 5  of the Swedish Companies Act.An issue in accordance with this authorisation shall be on market conditions. The board of directors shall be authorised to decide on the terms and conditions regarding issues under this authorisation and what persons shall be entitled to subscribe for the shares  warrants and/or convertible instruments. The reason to propose that the board of directors shall be authorised to resolve on an issue with deviation from the shareholders’ pre-emption rights and that the board shall be authorised to decide on an issue in kind or an issue by way of set-off or otherwise on such terms and conditions as referred to above is that the Company shall be able to issue shares  warrants and/or convertible instruments in order to raise capital to the Company.It is proposed that the CEO is authorised to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.Item 14 – Resolution on (A) employee stock option program 2022/2025  (B) directed issue of warrants  and (C) approval of transferThe board proposes that the general meeting of shareholders resolves (A) on the introduction of an employee stock option program for the Company’s employees  (B) on a directed issue of warrants to the Company  in order to ensure the Company’s delivery of shares according to employee stock option program 2022/2025 and to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from employee stock option program 2022/2025  and (C) on approval of transfer of warrants or shares in the Company to the participants in the employee stock option program. Resolutions in accordance with A  B and C above are conditional on each other and are therefore proposed to be adopted jointly.The board considers that it is essential and in all shareholders’ interest that the Company’s employees  who are considered to be important for the Company's further development  has a long-term interest in a good growth in value of the shares in the Company. A personal long-term ownership commitment can be expected to contribute to an increased interest in the Company's operations and development  as well as raise the participants’ motivation to achieve or exceed the Company's strategic and operational goals  and to create a sense of community between the employees and the shareholders.The employee stock option program is proposed to comprise a maximum of 292 770 employee stock options that can be granted to current and additional employees that are not covered by any of the Company's previous incentive programs. The board may allow exceptions for participants to be part of more than one program. In addition  it is proposed that a maximum of 91 988 warrants be issued to cover any cash flow effects as a result of the employee stock option program.The maximum dilution effect of employee stock option program 2022/2025 is estimated to 1.30 percent of the share capital and the votes in the Company (calculated based on the number of existing shares in the Company at the time of the notice)  provided full exercise of all employee stock options and warrants issued to cover potential cash flow effects from social security costs. The estimation does not take into account already outstanding performance share rights in the long-term incentive program implemented in 2019 nor to outstanding options in the employee stock option program decided in 2020 and 2021.This proposal was prepared by the remuneration committee and thereafter by the board in consultation with external counsel.A. Employee employee stock option program 2022/2025The board proposes that the general meeting of shareholders resolves on the introduction of employee stock option program 2022/2025 essentially on the following terms.1. The employee stock option program 2022/2025 shall include not more than 292 770 employee stock options. 2. The employee stock options shall be assigned to program participants free of charge. 3. Each employee stock option shall entitle the holder to  at the achievement of certain goals after a three-year vesting period  acquire one (1) new common share in the Company at an exercise price corresponding to 125 percent of the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s share according to Nasdaq Stockholm’s price list during the period ten (10) trading days before 24 May 2022. The subscription price can  however  in no case be less than the quotient value. 4. Offering of employee stock options shall be decided by the Company’s board of directors and offered to persons that are employed by the Company on 15 June 2022 which are i) part of the management team or ii) are not covered by any of the two previous employee stock option programs (decided in 2020 and 2021  respectively)  the ""Previous Programs"". Each person will be offered as many employee stock options as needed in order for the person in question to hold a certain total number of options within the framework of this employee stock option programs and the Previous Programs. This total number of employee stock options that a person can be assigned  per person divided by category  follows below.i) CEO: 30 000ii) management team: 21 030ii) other employees: 3 570Example: A person in the management team has previously been granted 12 000 employee stock options within the framework of the Previous Programs. The person in question is thus offered 9 030 within the framework of the now proposed employee stock option program. 5. Employees who are available for participation in the employee stock option program 2022/2025 are proposed to be granted a maximum of the number of employee stock options as referred to in i) – iii) of the preceding item. 6. The employee stock options may be exercised for the subscription of common shares in the Company  in accordance with the terms for the employee stock options  provided that certain strategic and operational goals  set out by the board  are achieved. The goals will be set by the board in advance and will be linked to important events in the Company's development such as progress in commercialization  product development and product approvals. 7. The right to participate in employee stock option program 2022/2025 is subject to the participant entering into an option agreement with the Company. 8. Issued employee stock options do not constitute securities and may not be transferred  pledged or otherwise disposed by the holder. 9. The employee stock options are tied to the participant's employment in the Company. If the employment in the Company is terminated before the employee stock options are exercised for share subscription  all employee stock options which have not yet been exercised by the participant expire without right of exercise. 10. If a general meeting should resolve on e.g. an increase or decrease of the number of outstanding shares during the term of the employee stock options  recalculation can be performed to maintain the value of the employee stock options. Decisions on recalculation shall be made by the board of directors of the Company. 11. The board or a person designated by the board shall have the right to decide on minor deviations in the program that may be needed to fulfill the purpose of the program. 12. Participation in employee stock option program 2022/2025 requires  first  that such participation may lawfully be made  secondly  that such participation according to the Company's assessment can be made with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts.B. Directed issue of warrants to the CompanyTo enable the Company's delivery of shares under employee stock option program 2022/2025 and to cover potential social security costs arising from employee stock option program 2022/2025  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting of shareholders resolves on a directed issue of no more than 384 758 warrants  out of which 91 988 warrants are proposed to be issued to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from employee stock option program 2022/2025  according to the following terms.1. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  apply to the Company. Oversubscription cannot occur. 2. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is that the issue is a step in the introduction of employee stock option program 2022/2025  and to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from employee stock option program 2022/2025. 3. The warrants are issued free of charge. 4. Subscription of warrants shall be made within three weeks from the date of the issue decision. The board has the right to extend the subscription period. 5. The increase of the Company’s share capital may  upon full exercise of the warrants  amount to a maximum of SEK 19 237.90. 6. The warrants can be exercised through the application for subscription of new common shares during the period from registration at the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 30 September 2025. 7. The subscription price for the share on exercise of the warrants is SEK 0.05. The subscription price may  however  not be less than the quotient value of the Company's share. If the subscription price exceeds the quota value of the previous shares  the excess amount must be reported in the unrestricted share premium fund. 8.

Earnings per share before the effects of purchase price allocation came to €2.40  up 33 per cent.▪ In the first quarter  cyclical net revenue growth was stronger than expected. Therefore  we currently expect that net revenue will increase to more than €3.8 billion and EBITDA to more than €2.2 billion during the current financial year.Overview of material eventsDeutsche Börse AG successfully placed a corporate hybrid bond in the amount of €500.0 million on 16 February 2022.The bond has a term of 26.25 years with a first call date after 6 years and a coupon of 2.0 per cent annually until June 2028. The hybrid bond will be used to refinance last year's M&A activities.At the end of March 2022 Deutsche Börse AG expanded its offering in the data services space by acquiring Kneip Communication S.A. The companies have reached an agreement through which Deutsche Börse will acquire 100 per cent of the Luxembourg-based fund data manager.Deutsche Börse AG successfully placed a corporate bond in an amount of €600.0 million on 29 March2022.The bond has a term of 10 years and a coupon of 1.5 per cent annually. The proceeds from the issue of the bond will be used to refinance the corporate bond maturing in October 2022 and were received by Deutsche Börse AG by 4 April 2022.On 31 March 2022 Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Holding AG successfully closed the sale of their respective 50 per cent stake in the European trade repositories REGIS-TR S.A. and REGIS-TR UK Ltd. to its joint venture partner Iberclear  part of SIX.Comparability of figuresTo reduce the complexity of its financial reporting and emphasise the Group's growth areas more clearly  the segment reporting was adjusted in accordance with the internal corporate management as of the first quarter of 2022 (including the respective amounts for the first quarter of the prior year). The eight existing segments will from now on be condensed to four: Data & Analytics (including the Qontigo and ISS segments)  Trading & Clearing (Eurex  EEX  360T and Xetra segments)  Fund Services (IFS segment) and Securities Services (Clearstream segment).Results of operationsThe first quarter of 2022 was overshadowed by Russia's war against Ukraine. The humanitarian consequences are shocking. The global fallout and resulting effects have been difficult to grasp so far. The first economic consequences have expressed themselves in the form of higher commodity prices  more difficult trading conditions and a redistribution of investments. In addition  the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant has subdued the economy's recovery and resulted in further restrictions and shortages  including in supply chains. Against this background  there was increased uncertainty among market participants  visible in the greater market volatility. The demand for trading and hedging in almost all asset classes therefore rose  which partly led to significantly higher trading volumes  especially in derivatives and commodities.On this basis  net revenue in the first quarter of 2022 increased significantly to €1 061.6 million  which represents a year-on-year increase of 24 per cent (Q1/21: €855.1 million). The key driver of the cyclical net revenue growth of 11 per cent was the higher market activity across all asset classes in Trading & Clearing resulting from increased market volatility. In particular  index derivatives as well as power and gas products benefitted from the growing hedging demand among market participants. The secular net revenue growth of 8 per cent was particularly driven by product innovation in financial derivatives  an increase of market share in commodities  the growing demand for ESG-related products and the continued trend towards outsourcing in the fund industry. The M&A growth of 5 per cent is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)  which was closed in February 2021. The Securities Services segment also benefitted from the roughly €50 million gain from the sale of the remaining stakes in REGIS-TR.Operating costs in the first quarter of 2022 came to €406.7 million (Q1/21: €346.5 million). On the one hand  this increase is a result of the M&A-related growth  particularly the acquisition of ISS. On the other hand  we have slightly increased our investments in growth and infrastructure due to the positive revenue development we are seeing. Based on constant currency  organic operating costs grew by 5 per cent.Earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose accordingly by 32 per cent to €687.4 million (Q1/21: €521.2 million). This comprises the result from financial investments at an amount of €32.5 million (Q1/21: €12.6 million). The increase results from disposals of smaller investments as well as the higher market valuation of the Illuminate fintech funds.Depreciation  amortisation and impairment losses totalled €84.4 million (Q1/21: €61.7 million)  with the change mainly stemming from the effects of purchase price allocation for acquired companies. The winding down of the buy-in agent service also produced a one-time write-down of self-developed software of €6.5 million. The financial result of -€8.8 million (Q1/21: -€13.9 million) includes a one-off gain in the context of interest rate hedging.Net profit for the period attributable to Deutsche Börse AG shareholders came to €420.8 million (Q1/21: €317.3 million)  which is 33 per cent up on the same period of the previous year. Earnings per share were €2.29 (Q1/21: €1.73) for an average of 183.6 million shares. Earnings per share before the effects of purchase price allocation (cash EPS) were €2.40 (Q1/21: €1.81).Gregor Pottmeyer  Chief Financial Officer at Deutsche Börse AG  commented on the results  saying  ""The first quarter of 2022 was considerably above our expectations. All three growth components of our business - secular  cyclical and M&A net revenue growth - contributed equally to the extraordinarily good result. We are therefore currently expecting to exceed our guidance for the current financial year.""Risk reportDeutsche Börse Group provides a full description of its risk management framework  strategy  principles  organisational structure  processes  methods and concepts  along with measures to manage and mitigate risks  on pages 73 to 109 of its Annual Report 2021. A full description of the current status of litigation is also presented on pages 84 to 87 of the Annual Report 2021.In view of Russia's war against Ukraine and the measures taken in relation to it  the Group's overall risk position has not changed materially  except for increased holdings of collateral at the clearing houses. In terms of operational risk  the focus is on interpreting and implementing the specifications of various sanctions. There are financial risks resulting from the Ukrainian central bank's capital controls  e.g. with respect to cross-border payments  as well as from comparable countermeasures taken by the Russian government in response to the sanctions imposed by European and other governments.

The Maximum Acceptance Amount shall be US$105 000 000  representing 60% of the outstanding ConvertibleBonds  being the maximum principal amount of Convertible Bonds in respect of which the Issuer will pay the Early Cash Incentive or the Cash Incentive. The Issuer will therefore only pay an Early Cash Incentive or a Cash Incentive in respect of up to US$105 000 000 in principal amount of Convertible Bonds.

The tone on the U.S. side was one of ""positive consideration "" said Stephen Innes  managing partner at SPI Asset Management.Capital Economics' Jonas Goltermann said diverging interest rates will keep the yen weak and drive the USD/JPY to 140 by the end of this year ""before dropping back as the Fed takes its foot off the gas in 2023.""Goltermann said the yen has depreciated around 10% against the dollar since early March  mainly because the BOJ ""has stuck to its ultra-loose policy stance "" while the Fed is aggressively tightening.Japan's terms of trade ""have also worsened significantly on account of the surge in commodity prices "" Goltermann said  warning that the BOJ is under pressure to change its policy  which could support the yen.Read: Yen's Drop Raises Potential for Broader Market Trouble.---The euro could rise toward $1.15 from $1.0805 currently if the European Central Bank raises interest rates by more than market expectations to tame inflation  Unicredit Research said.The ECB could raise its deposit facility rate 100 basis points above the 1.5% peak that is priced in by markets over a two-year horizon  Unicredit forex strategist Roberto Mialich said. That could prompt the forex market to favor more pronounced EUR/USD long positioning  or bets on the pair price rising.""The intensity of the EUR rally would also depend on the extent to which high inflation also affects the U.S. economy  possibly forcing the Federal Reserve to deliver even more tightening than that already priced in.""Bonds:Treasury yields edged lower early Monday  with bonds in demand and as investors position for a tighter Fed policy.Traders continued to assess comments made by Fed policy makers  with Cleveland's Loretta Mester saying Friday that she backed a 50 basis point hike in May ""and a few more"" to get the fed funds rate target to 2.5% by year-end.Mester also the central bank wants tighter financial conditions  ""but not necessarily all at once "" and that ""we don't need to go"" to a 75 basis point hike.Piper Sandler's Roberto Perli said the [recent] rise in yields signaled that inflation expectations could get out of control and become a headache for the Fed.

China's zero-Covid policy means that oil demand will be taking a hit as authorities try to bring the outbreak under control.""The outlook for oil demand is uncertain given that on the one hand  there's a potential GDP slowdown due to rising interest rates and on the other hand  there's potential demand destruction due to high energy prices  Manish Raj  chief financial officer at Velandera Energy Partners  told MarketWatch.Developments relating to Russia's invasion of Ukraine will remain in focus  as the current situation addes pressure on the EU to sanction Russian oil  ANZ said. Meanwhile  the U.S. has recently announced fresh sanctions on Russia by banning entry of Russian ships to the U.S. ports.Oil prices settled lower Friday  contributing to a more than 4% loss for the week.Metals:Gold prices extended losses  with Fed policy and China the main factors weighing on sentiment.OANDA analyst Jeffrey Halley has put support for the precious metal at $1 940/oz and resistance at $1 980/oz.---Aluminum was lower too  with prices down more than 1% in Asia.Brokerage Marex noted that vehicle sales in China from January to March were weaker than expected amid chip shortages and Covid-related curbs  a further sign of weakening aluminum demand. However  low inventory levels and a tight supply outlook should limit the losses  Marex added.TODAY'S TOP HEADLINESHigher Oil Prices Have Yet to Lure Back Secondary BuyersImprovements in oil prices over the past year may be bolstering cash flows at some private equity-backed oil-and-gas companies but it hasn't lured secondary buyers back to bid for interests in funds focused on the sector  at least not yet.""You can't trade private-equity energy funds off of spot oil prices "" said Michael Dean  managing director in the real assets team at HarbourVest Partners  adding that higher oil prices have made companies more profitable but have yet to contribute to a significant uptick in exits by oil-and-gas funds.Japanese Yen's Drop Raises Potential for Broader Market TroubleThe Japanese yen has dropped to a 20-year low against the U.S. dollar. That risks being bad news far beyond Tokyo-in the $23 trillion market for U.S. Treasurys.Traders around the world watch the yen's rise and fall not just to follow Japanese markets but also to gauge how investors globally are feeling. Usually  when markets are rallying  the yen tends to weaken against other currencies. When markets get turbulent  the yen tends to gain ground.Covid-19 Cases Jump in Beijing as New Deaths Triple in ShanghaiHONG KONG-Beijing said it is at a critical point in its efforts to halt a Covid-19 outbreak in the city  as new cases spread from school students and a tour group  while deaths in Shanghai more than tripled from a day earlier.The Chinese capital recorded 22 new cases on Sunday  its highest daily tally this year.

This plan remains relevant  it has started since the beginning of April and will be fully implemented before the end of this year. Its impact will be visible from the 2022 accounts  even if it will produce its full effect on the 2023 financial year.The discussions also provided a better understanding of the strong valuation and monetization capacity of several assets held by the Delta Drone Group  and the attraction they enjoy with potential buyers. These assets  patiently built up over time  are consistent with the Group's vision without being at the heart of the strategy.Therefore  and in order to address shareholders' legitimate concerns about the dilutive financing methods used so far  some could be partially or totally divested during the year  so as to provide the group with substantial alternative financial resources  probably sufficient to achieve the objective of a positive structural cash flow situation. Various projects are already being studied.Story continuesFinally  the decision to consolidate Delta Drone shares (see press release of 19 April 2019) is part of the same logic to support a new stock market dynamic  in line with the Group's maturity.About Delta Drone : Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the field of civilian drones for professional use.

This union is the logical next step after Lectra’s acquisition of Gerber Technology (“Gerber”) in June 2021.Glengo was established in 1986. The Istanbul-based company has been providing sales  installation  training and after-sales services for Gerber solutions since its founding.

Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS® platform  which uses a novel technology to encapsulate drug substances inside red blood cells  ERYTECH is developing a pipeline of product candidates for patients with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH’s primary focus is on the development of product candidates that target the altered metabolism of cancer cells by depriving them of amino acids necessary for their growth and survival.The Company’s lead product candidate  eryaspase (GRASPA®)  which consists of L-asparaginase encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells  targets the cancer cells’ altered asparagine and glutamine metabolism. The proof of concept of eryaspase as a cancer metabolism agent was established in different trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and pancreatic cancer. An investigator sponsored Phase 2 trial (IST) evaluating the use of eryaspase in ALL patients who developed hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase recently reported positive results  based on which the Company intends to request approval in the United States and potentially other territories. The Company is also pursuing a Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial in first-line pancreatic cancer.Eryaspase received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who have developed hypersensitivity reactions to E. coli-derived pegylated asparaginase. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency have granted eryaspase orphan drug status for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and ALL. Eryaspase is not an approved medicine.ERYTECH produces its product candidates for treatment of patients in Europe at its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France  and for patients in the United States through its long-term supply agreement with Catalent  operating from ERYTECH’s former GMP facility in Princeton  New Jersey  USA.ERYTECH is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States (ticker: ERYP) and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0011471135  ticker: ERYP).

The studies underline once more that the strength of Idylla™ tests lies in the combination of both fast and accurate results  enabling rapid clinical decision-making. Especially in the case of sepsis  this can save lives. Finally  these studies show how Idylla™ testing can be easily integrated within the routine diagnostic process of hospitals.”The first study1 (abstract #04729) was presented in a poster session and evaluated whether SeptiCyte® RAPID could be used as a triage tool for COVID-19 patients at a hospital2 in France. Results demonstrated SeptiCyte® RAPID’s ability to distinguish between COVID-19 patients showing higher extents of lung damage as defined by lung CT scans (critical and severe) from those with a milder presentation (mild  moderate  absent). The SeptiScore®  as evaluated by SeptiCyte® RAPID  of critical and severe patients in the ICU was higher relative to the moderate and mild cases not in ICU. Also  the utility of the SeptiScore® for longitudinal monitoring of patients with severe cases was suggested by repeat testing on selected patients.Story continuesRollie Carlson  Ph.D.  Chief Executive Officer of Immunexpress  added: “During the COVID-19 pandemic  sepsis incidence increased. This study shows that the SeptiCyte® RAPID on the Idylla™ platform can distinguish COVID-19 cases with severe or critical presentation on a CT scan from those with mild or moderate presentation. This is essential to identify and triage patients in need of timely sepsis specific medical care.”The second study3 (abstract #04693) was presented in an online poster session and evaluated the performance of SeptiCyte® RAPID as an everyday tool in the management of ICU patients at two clinical sites in Portugal4. Results demonstrated a significant correlation between the diagnosis of sepsis and an elevated SeptiScore®. From eight patients diagnosed with either septic shock or sepsis  six had elevated scores and two had intermediate-elevated scores. The study concluded that the SeptiCyte® score pinpointed all cases while also suggesting the diagnosis of patients of whom sepsis was not detected by most traditional methods  found to be severely lacking in this setting5.Severe COVID-19 can be considered an example of viral sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality  making early sepsis detection of utmost importance. Today’s gold standard for detecting sepsis in the laboratory setting is microbiological culture identification. However  the prediction of positive blood culture results remains a very difficult task since positive blood culture results in approx. only 20% of the cases6 due to low sensitivity. Also  it can take days to report results. Studies such as the ones presented at ECCMID show that newer methods such as the SeptiCyte® RAPID  running on Biocartis’ Idylla™ platform  combine fast and accurate results  enabling rapid clinical decision-making.Finally  the third study7 (abstract #04963)  presented in a poster session  highlighted the performance data of the Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2 Test (CE-IVD) and the Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV Panel (CE-IVD) and concluded that both Idylla™ assays provide quick  accurate results with minimal hands-on-time  making them suitable for an NHS (National Health Service  UK) setting.--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisBiocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) is an innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) company providing next generation diagnostic solutions aimed at improving clinical practice for the benefit of patients  clinicians  payers and industry.

New issuances have similarly been tamed by market turbulence as just 78 new spacs floated on public markets  closing on $15bn in proceeds  the lowest quarter since the second quarter of 2020 at the cusp of the spac renaissance  according to data from investment analysis firm Pitchbook.UK IPO lead at accountancy firm EY Scott McCubbin said increased scrutiny by regulators in the US and UK meant the spac surge over the past two years was unlikely to be repeated.“The rules have changed and there’s been a move by the UK exchanges to make sure that they are aligned globally ” he said.“There has been a boom and a bust almost in the US and that is not going to be repeated in the UK. So the expectation that Spacs are going to be the vehicle that transforms the UK market into something much bigger than it currently is  I just don’t believe that will be the case and nor do I want it to be.”‘DeSpac-ed’ firms – those that have gone public via a merger – have also been hammered by recent routs on public markets sparked by soaring inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Pitchbook’s deSPAC Index  which tracks the post merger performance of firms  has posted a 35.6 per cent plunge since the beginning of 2022 relative to the S&P 500’s 10.6 per cent decline.But despite the slide in performance McCubbin says that spacs will remain a fixture on the markets without the frenzied fervour seen in the US in 2021.“Spacs are now there  spacs will happen  but they will be part of the portfolio of IPOs that comes into the market ” he tells City A.M.“They are a part of the toolkit alongside debt  private equity money  sovereign wealth funds  by which a firm can be acquired.”Some remain more bullish on the outlook for spacs and say the market and product have evolved with increased scrutiny.“I think where we are sort of at a maturity point in the spac boom which is which is a great thing to see ” says David Koch head of equity markets at UK investment firm GP Bullhound  which snubbed London to float a spac on Euronext this year.“We saw a flurry of issuance come out of what was a super investor friendly product developed in the US a few years ago  which created that sort of $100bn per annum of issuance and what made Europe scramble to replicate the product as quickly as possible.”But Koch says now the rules are “catching up” up with the products and regulators are clamping down on some of the loopholes.“It’s becomes much more of a mature product  and it’s good to see this in Europe  where it took a while for the market to kick off because it was lagging.”GP Bullhound raised €200m when it floated GP Bullhound Acquisition on the Euronext exchange in February with the aim of snapping up a tech firm with a focus on software  digital media  digital commerce or fintech.,negative,0.02,0.13,0.85,mixed,0.15,0.17,0.69,True,English,"['Spac boom falters', 'regulators', 'scrutiny', 'Special purpose acquisition companies', 'super investor friendly product', 'cash shell companies', 'fanciful financial forecasting', 'final three months', 'traditional IPO process', 'past two years', '35.6 per cent plunge', '10.6 per cent decline', 'City A.M.', 'sovereign wealth funds', 'private equity money', 'investment analysis firm', 'GP Bullhound Acquisition', 'SoFi swerving IPOs', 'UK IPO lead', 'EY Scott McCubbin', 'big name firms', 'UK investment firm', 'Spac boom falters', 'post merger performance', 'equity markets', 'accountancy firm', 'tech firm', 'global boom', 'record amounts', 'spac mergers', 'alternative route', 'associated fees', '66 fresh mergers', 'New issuances', 'spac renaissance', 'spac surge', 'UK exchanges', 'recent routs', 'soaring inflation', 'deSPAC Index', 'S&P 500', 'frenzied fervour', 'maturity point', 'great thing', 'mature product', 'digital media', 'digital commerce', 'blank-cheque firms', 'first quarter', 'lowest quarter', 'second quarter', 'DeSpac-ed’ firms', 'public markets', 'David Koch', 'Euronext exchange', 'market turbulence', 'UK market', '78 new spacs', 'regulators', 'scrutiny', 'investors', 'vehicles', 'acquisitions', 'data', 'CBInsights', 'WeWork', 'timelines', 'blizzard', 'deals', 'proceeds', 'cusp', 'Pitchbook', 'rules', 'move', 'bust', 'expectation', 'something', 'case', 'Russia', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'beginning', 'slide', 'fixture', 'part', 'portfolio', 'toolkit', 'debt', 'outlook', 'increased', 'head', 'London', 'flurry', 'sort', 'annum', 'Europe', 'products', 'loopholes', 'February', 'aim', 'focus', 'software', 'fintech']",2022-04-24,2022-04-25,cityam.com

(NYSE:PSB) (“PS Business Parks”)  which was announced today. Upon consummation of the transaction  Public Storage  like all holders of PS Business Parks’ common shares and units  would receive $187.50 in cash per PS Business Parks common share or unit.

Public Storage expects to distribute the $2.3 billion gain to its shareholders.Public Storage estimates annual Core Funds from Operations would be lower following the consummation of the transaction to a degree approximating its $101 million pro rata share of PS Business Park’s Core FFO in 2021  which comprised approximately 4% of Public Storage’s total Core FFO during the year.Additional Transaction DetailsThe transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2022  subject to approval by PS Business Parks’ stockholders and other customary closing conditions. Public Storage has agreed to vote its shares of PS Business Parks common stock  which represent 25.9% of the outstanding shares  in favor of the transaction  subject to the terms of a support agreement between Public Storage  PS Business Parks and an affiliate of Blackstone.The merger agreement also includes a “go-shop” period that will expire 30 days from today on May 25  2022  which permits PS Business Parks and its representatives to actively solicit and consider alternative acquisition proposals to acquire PS Business Parks. PS Business Parks has the right to terminate the definitive merger agreement with Blackstone to enter into a superior proposal  subject to the payment of a termination fee and certain other terms and conditions of the definitive merger agreement  and Public Storage’s support agreement will terminate automatically upon the termination of the merger agreement.From the date of the merger agreement through the closing of the transaction  PS Business Parks is permitted to declare and pay regular  quarterly cash distributions to holders of its common stock and to holders of its operating partnership’s units  in each case  including Public Storage  in an amount of up to $1.05 per share or unit  including a pro rata distribution in respect of any stub period.Additional information regarding the transaction may be found in documents that PS Business Parks files with the SEC  available on the SEC’s website at sec.gov.Company InformationPublic Storage  a member of the S&P 500 and FT Global 500  is a REIT that primarily acquires  develops  owns  and operates self-storage facilities.

All statements in this press release  other than statements of historical fact  are forward-looking statements which may be identified by the use of the words “outlook ” “guidance ” “expects ” “believes ” “anticipates ” “should ” “estimates ” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  which may cause our actual results and performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Factors and risks that may impact future results and performance include  but are not limited to  those described in Part 1  Item 1A  “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed with the SEC on February 22  2022 and in our other filings with the SEC including: the occurrence of any event  change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement between PS Business Parks and Blackstone’s affiliates; the failure to obtain the approval of PS Business Parks’ stockholders of the proposed transaction or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; stockholder litigation in connection with the proposed transaction  which may affect the timing or occurrence of the proposed transaction; general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate  including changes in demand  risks related to development  expansion  and acquisition of self-storage facilities  potential liability for environmental contamination  natural disasters  and adverse changes in laws and regulations governing property tax  real estate  and zoning; risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies in the markets in which we operate  including risks related to current economic conditions and the economic health of our customers; risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (the “COVID Pandemic”) or similar events  including but not limited to illness or death of our employees or customers  negative impacts to the economic environment and to self-storage customers that could reduce the demand for self-storage or reduce our ability to collect rent  and/or potential regulatory actions to (i) close our facilities if we were determined not to be an “essential business” or for other reasons  (ii) limit our ability to increase rent or otherwise limit the rent we can charge  or (iii) limit our ability to collect rent or evict delinquent tenants; the risk that there could be an out-migration of population from certain high-cost major markets  if it is determined that the ability to “work from home ” which has become more prominent during the COVID Pandemic  could allow certain workers to live in less expensive localities  which could negatively impact the occupancies and revenues of our properties in such major high-cost markets; the risk that more jurisdictions will reinstitute COVID Pandemic restrictions  which were previously eased  in response to increases in infections  including as a result of variants such as the Delta or Omicron variants  or if additional pandemics occur; the risk that we could experience a change in the move-out patterns of our long-term customers due to economic uncertainty and increases in unemployment resulting from changes in the macro environment  which could lead to lower occupancies and rent “roll down” as long-term customers are replaced with new customers at lower rates; the risk of negative impacts on the cost and availability of debt and equity capital as a result of the COVID Pandemic  which could have a material impact upon our capital and growth plans; the risk that the COVID Pandemic could adversely impact our ability to retain and hire employees  including as a result of vaccine or testing mandates; the impact of competition from new and existing self-storage and commercial facilities and other storage alternatives; the risk that our existing self-storage facilities may be at a disadvantage in competing with newly developed facilities with more visual and customer appeal; risks related to increased reliance on Google and Sparefoot as customer acquisition channels; difficulties in our ability to successfully evaluate  finance  integrate into our existing operations  and manage properties that we acquire directly or through the acquisition of entities that own and operate self-storage facilities  or to consummate announced acquisitions in the expected timeframe or at all; risks associated with international operations including  but not limited to  unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations  changes in tax laws  and local and global economic uncertainty that could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows; risks related to our participation in joint ventures; the impact of the legal and regulatory environment  as well as national  state  and local laws and regulations including  without limitation  those governing environmental issues  taxes  our tenant reinsurance business  and labor  including risks related to the impact of new laws and regulations; risks of increased tax expense associated either with a possible failure by us to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”)  or with challenges to the determination of taxable income for our taxable REIT subsidiaries; risks due to ballot initiatives or other actions that could remove the protections of Proposition 13 with respect to our real estate and result in substantial increases in our assessed values and property tax bills in California; changes in United States (“U.S.”) federal or state tax laws related to the taxation of REITs and other corporations; security breaches  including ransomware  or a failure of our networks  systems or technology  which could adversely impact our operations or our business  customer  and employee relationships or result in fraudulent payments; risks associated with the self-insurance of certain business risks  including property and casualty insurance  employee health insurance  and workers compensation liabilities; difficulties in raising capital at a reasonable cost; delays and cost overruns on our projects to develop new facilities or expand our existing facilities; difficulties in our ability to hire and retain skilled management and staff; ineffective succession planning for our CEO  executive management and our other key employees; ongoing litigation and other legal and regulatory actions that may divert management’s time and attention  require us to pay damages and expenses  or restrict the operation of our business; and economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism.The acquisition of PS Business Parks by affiliates of Blackstone is subject to approval by PS Business Parks’ stockholders and other customary closing conditions.

Arnaud Pieton  Chief Execut…,PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Technip Energies (PARIS:TE) (the “Company”)  a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  today announces its unaudited financial results for the first quarter 2022.Arnaud Pieton  Chief Executive Officer of Technip Energies  commented:“First quarter revenue growth and solid profitability demonstrate strong execution across the entirety of our portfolio from Project Delivery to Technology  Products and Services. This is consistent with our full year financial framework and we expect our activity outside of Russia to progressively ramp up through 2022.”“Regarding Russia  we are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations  which includes current and future sanctions. Our priorities are to protect our people  and the interests of our company and shareholders. In anticipation of the escalation of the European Union sanctions  we have been working with clients  partners and suppliers within the relevant contractual frameworks to take appropriate measures in connection with our activities in Russia  including Arctic LNG 2. We expect that the balance sheet position of the project and the relevant contract protections will be sufficient to fulfil our various contractual obligations in compliance with applicable sanctions.”“In the first quarter  we reconfigured the organization structure around four business lines focused on Technip Energies’ markets and supported by a global delivery structure dedicated to delivering projects and solutions. This will better align our operating model and commercial focus with the rapidly changing energy transition market.”“Our energy transition strategy is supported by our flexible capital allocation. In the quarter  we announced three investments in the markets of hydrogen  floating offshore wind  and biochemicals. These expand and diversify our technology portfolio  while enabling new business model opportunities.”“The energy landscape has become more complex in recent months with an urgent energy independence agenda  notably in Europe. Despite near-term volatility in commodity and raw material prices  the attractiveness of LNG  an inherently flexible energy source  has improved and the market opportunity is accelerating. In addition  government policy is increasingly promoting faster adoption of energy transition technologies and Technip Energies is playing a leading role in this market evolution.”Key financials – Adjusted IFRS (In € millions  except EPS) Q1 2022 Q1 2021 Revenue1 1 618.2 1 557.5 Recurring EBIT1 107.3 91.3 Recurring EBIT Margin % 6.6% 5.9% Net profit 72.5 44.2 Diluted earnings per share2 €0.41 €0.24 Order Intake 551.7 6 470.7 Backlog 15 632.4 17 805.2 Financial information is presented under Adjusted IFRS (see Appendix 8.0 for complete definition).

3537,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://seekingalpha.com/article/4503218-intercontinental-exchange-ice-dividend-investors-outperformance-decent-yield,Intercontinental Exchange: Where Dividend Investors Go For Outperformance,Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) is a great stock for dividend growth investors. Read more to see why I think ICE's valuation is favorable now.,"Spencer Platt/Getty Images NewsIntroductionIn light of ongoing market ""turmoil""  it's time to talk about a stock that I recommend investors to buy on weakness. As a dividend growth investor  I'm constantly on the hunt for attractive long-term opportunities for myself and my clients/followers. In this case  we're dealing with a stock that has everything I'm looking for in a dividend growth stock. Intercontinental Exchange Inc. (NYSE:ICE) offers high dividend growth  a sustainable debt load  and a stellar business model that comes with long-term outperformance thanks to high and rising free cash flow. Moreover  because of market weakness  the stock has once again reached a favorable valuation.So  if you have a long-term investment horizon and the need for a stock where dividend growth is more important than a high yield  I invite you to read my thoughts on this Georgia-based financial giant.High Yield vs. Low YieldBefore I started writing this article  I took some time to update my personal files  which I hadn't done in a while. Especially because I'm once again going to spend time talking about growth and value  I wanted to share my own ""average"" yield with readers. As of April 23  2022  the average yield on my dividend growth portfolio (95% of my net worth) is 2.4%. The yield on cost is 3.4%. I started my portfolio in 2020. The table below shows my holdings ranked from highest yield on cost to lowest yield on cost.AuthorAs the table above shows  I like to buy a mix of dividend growth and high yield. In this case  I only buy high yield when it's on sale as that makes the impact of often slow dividend growth bigger. If I don't find anything on sale  I don't buy a high-yielding stock.The reason why I prefer dividend growth stocks is that - historically speaking - they tend to come with significant outperformance. As the graph below shows  dividend growers and initiators outperformed an already stellar performance of dividend payers.Hartford FundsWhile it's a lot of fun to receive high dividends every quarter  it's more important that I don't underperform the market. After all  it's always possible to put (high) potential capital gains in high yield stocks when the emphasis shifts from growing wealth to preserving wealth and living off of dividends.In the case of ICE  we're dealing with an interesting dividend scorecard. The company achieves rather high scores on dividend safety and dividend growth  which are often highly correlated. For example  high free cash flow means high dividend safety  and it often also means that management uses the opportunity to grow its dividend more aggressively.The dividend yield is graded a big fat D-. However  please bear in mind that this is RELATIVE grading. In this case  ICE  operating in the Financial Data & Stock Exchange industry  is compared to the financial sector. This sector includes a lot of regional banks and money center banks with high dividend yields.Seeking AlphaIntercontinental Exchange currently pays a $0.38 quarterly dividend per share. This is the result of a 15.2% hike announced on February 3  2022. This puts the annual payout at $1.52. This implies a 1.30% dividend yield based on the current $117 stock price. The S&P 500 is also yielding 1.30%.Now  let me explain why the company is outperforming the market - by a lot.ICE  Home Of Loads Of Shareholder ValueIn light of the chart showing the S&P 500 performance breakdown chart  let me start this segment by showing that ICE is indeed outperforming the market.Over the past 10 years  ICE has returned 407% including dividends (total return). This beats the iShares US Broker/Dealer ETF (IAI) by almost 40 points. The S&P 500 returned 274%  which isn't bad either but much lower. The outperformance becomes even more extreme when zooming out  which confirms the basic theory that (sustainable) dividend growth outperforms the market.Data by YChartsThe fact that ICE can outperform the market starts with its business model. ICE has a massive footprint in the financial industry  mainly in global exchanges  fixed income  and mortgage technology.This is what I wrote last year:Over the past 20 years  the company has become a financial powerhouse with a market cap of more than $66 billion and roughly 9 000 employees across the globe. On a full-year basis  the company generates roughly 55% of its sales through its exchanges business. 27% of its sales come from fixed income and data services  while 18% of sales are provided by mortgage technology. The company's timeline below shows how this was achieved through the acquisitions of various large institutions. For example  in 2013  the company bought NYSE Euronext  which expanded the company's footprint in equities and options. This organization operates a wide variety of securities exchanges  including the New York Stock Exchange  Euronext  and NYSE Arca.Intercontinental Exchange Inc.The company's portfolio includes agriculture futures (like coffee and orange juice)  energy  equities  forex  metals  as well as credit and other futures on an international scale. On March 31  the company announced that it will launch mortgage futures. 10 days prior to that  it announced biotech and semiconductor index futures.This business model allows the company to benefit from increasing global transactions  the need for clearing services  hedging requirements  and more automated and advanced mortgage industry.Between 2006 and 2021  the company has grown adjusted earnings per share from $0.48 to $5.15  which translates to a compounded annual growth rate of 17%.Intercontinental Exchange Inc.In this case  the company is generating a lot of free cash flow as well. Before I show you the numbers  keep in mind that free cash flow is basically net income adjusted for operating non-cash items and capital expenditures. It's cash a company can spend on dividends  buybacks  and debt reduction.The graph below shows total (expected) free cash flow and shareholder distributions consisting of direct distributions (dividends) and indirect distributions (share buybacks). Between 2011 and 2024 (expected)  free cash flow is rising by 13.6% per year. This is resulting in close to $3.5 billion in expected 2023 free cash flow.AuthorTo put these numbers into perspective. ICE has a $66 billion market cap. $3.5 billion in free cash flow implies a free cash flow yield of 5.3%. As the company's dividend yield is just 1.3%  it means there is a lot of room for dividend growth and annual buybacks to boost returns.The next graph shows annual buybacks and dividends. ICE clearly emphasizes buybacks in times when free cash flow is high.AuthorWhile buybacks are volatile (they almost always are)  dividends are more consistent. ICE initiated its dividend in 2013  which makes it one of the younger dividend growth stocks on the market. Over the past 5 years  dividend growth has averaged 19.0% per year. While I do not expect that number to last  I think longer-term dividend growth will remain close to 15%. Again  that's not a promise  but it's extremely reasonable based on the numbers.TIKRMoreover  the company will more than likely continue to engage in bigger acquisitions to shape its business model and deploy free cash flow. This will not necessarily impact dividends  but it will impact share buybacks as big acquisitions require new debt (not enough free cash flow). Last year  for example  buybacks were reduced to focus on debt reduction after the 2020 acquisition of Ellie Mae.AuthorThis acquisition gave the company a huge footprint in mortgages  which is expected to boost secular growth based on analog to digital conversion across the entire workflow. In 2021  the mortgage segment reported 17% pro format growth. The company did $1.4 billion in revenue in what management believes to be a $10 billion total addressable market.As the graph below shows  this deal pushed net debt to $16.0 billion  which was close to 4x EBITDA back then. In 2021  net debt was lowered to $13.3 billion due to lower buybacks. The net leverage ratio fell to 2.9x. Next year  net debt is expected to fall to $11.8 billion  which is barely higher than 2.3x EBITDA.TIKRSo  there's one piece of the puzzle missing: valuation.ValuationThis market is incredibly challenging - for traders. Last week was ugly as the market closed the week in correction territory (-10% from all-time high). We're in a situation where multiple economic growth indicators are rolling over  inflation remains high  and geopolitical tensions continue to pressure supply chains (and inflation). Even worse  the Federal Reserve is now expected to start a rather aggressive hiking cycle. Once again  the Fed could find itself hiking into economic weakness.Moreover  rates are high and consumer confidence is suffering. None of this will make life very hard for ICE  but it doesn't support investors' and traders' willingness to take risks. As investors are de-risking their portfolios  we see that ICE is suffering too. The stock is down 5.9% last week  which lowers the YTD performance to -14.3%.As a long-term investor  I'm not complaining. While it's never fun to see a rather steep decline in one's net worth every now and then  it does provide opportunities. And isn't it more fun to buy at a good valuation than to chase prices to new highs?FINVIZIn the case of ICE  we're dealing with a market cap of $66 billion as I already briefly mentioned in this article. Next year  the company is expected to lower its net debt to $11.8 billion. I'm going with that number instead of 2022 to price in the use of free cash flow when it comes to reducing debt. The company also has $200 million in pension-related liabilities and $40 million in minority interest  which we need to include as well.This gives us an enterprise value of $78 billion. That's 15.3x next year's expected EBITDA of $5.1 billion.It's not a deal value multiple  but it's good.TIKRMy recommendation for people without exposure who want in is to break up the first investment. The market could easily fall further as the environment has become a bit toxic. To take away some entry risk  I would buy some now and more in intervals of 2-3 weeks. That way  investors have a foot in the door if the market (and ICE) rises. If the market continues to fall  investors can average down.I think that's the way to go for long-term investors. It's how I will approach my upcoming investments as well.TakeawayThe market is weakening  which is offering investors like myself new opportunities. One stock I recommend to long-term dividend growth investors is Intercontinental Exchange Inc. The company has an ""average"" yield but high dividend growth thanks to a stellar business model  which provides strong and rapidly rising free cash flow. Management is eager and able to use free cash flow to boost both dividends and buybacks as the company's balance sheet is quickly becoming de-leveraged again after the 2020 acquisition of Ellie Mae.Dividend growth investors will more than likely benefit from long-term outperforming capital gains and dividend growth when adding ICE to their portfolio. I recommend buying in stages to lower entry risk due to ongoing market uncertainty  which is the only reason why my rating is ""neutral"" for the time being.(Dis)agree?

Through this listing  we are well-placed to strengthen our leadership position  ensuring we can continue to accelerate investment in the development of our pipeline and technology.”Through the combined capabilities of its AI platform  scientific expertise and wet-lab facilities  the platform is well-positioned to deliver novel drug candidates with a higher probability of clinical success than those developed using traditional methods.

The RPIDD technology has been exclusively licensed by Aptorum from A*Star through its subsidiary  Aptorum Innovations Holding Pte Limited.The RPIDD invention employs a unique method in preparing DNA libraries from samples which contain more than one type of nucleic acids in substantially low amount comparative to non-nucleic acid molecules in the sample within a remarkably shorter turnaround time and substantially more simplified steps compared to conventional methods of preparing DNA library.Mr. Darren Lui  President and Executive Director of Aptorum Group Limited comments “Through our collaboration partner A*STAR  we are extremely delighted that the USPTO has recognised the uniqueness of our RPIDD technology and hence granted the said patent. The patented RPIDD method is going to revolutionize the traditional first line clinical diagnostics for infectious diseases such as blood culture  PCR (etc)  and we are convinced that a rapid molecular liquid biopsy based diagnostics approach for infectious diseases will disrupt the current approaches and hence in due course potentially reduce infected patient’s mortality and morbidity. We are now spearheading the efforts in the ongoing clinical validation and pre-commercialisation preparation of our patented RPIDD.”About Aptorum’s Rapid Pathogen Identification and Detection Diagnostics Technology (RPIDD)RPIDD is an innovative liquid biopsy-driven rapid pathogen molecular diagnostics technology. Proprietary technologies are being developed to enrich pathogenic DNA / RNA for analysis through harnessing the power of Next-Generation Sequencing platforms and proprietary artificial intelligence-based software analytics with the goal to rapidly identify and detect any foreign pathogens (virus  bacteria  fungus  parasites) without bias through its genome composition and to identify other unknown pathogens and novel mutated pathogens. RPIDD has been and continues to be validated in human samples and so far  such testing has been able to detect pathogens – ranging from bacteria  fungi and viruses in an unbiased manner. RPIDD is currently under validation in-human.About Aptorum Group LimitedAptorum Group Limited (Nasdaq: APM  Euronext Paris: APM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic assets to treat diseases with unmet medical needs  particularly in oncology (including orphan oncology indications) and infectious diseases.

This growth was driven both by the quality of sales momentum based on a range of services adapted to demand (a 24% increase in organic growth) and by strategic and accretive acquisitions for the Group.In France  Freelance.com's revenue rose 48% to €406.4m for the full year. Internationally  it posted strong growth of 86% to reach €96.2m  benefiting in particular from the integration of Helvetic Payroll in the financial statements since 1 November 2021. Total international activity accounted for 19% of the Group's revenue in 2021.Accounting for 12-month business volumes for all of the Group's subsidiaries  pro-forma 2021 revenue came to €671m  an increase of 107% compared to 2020 consolidated revenue  while EBITDA rose 150% and operating income 162%.Strong growth in EBITDAThe 2021 consolidated financial statements showed EBITDA of €15.2m compared to €10.1m in 2020  up 50% year-on-year. Operating income rose 55% to €13.8m compared to €8.9m a year ago  for a stable operating margin from one year to the next.This performance is all the more satisfactory as it integrates numerous strategic investments in human resources  marketing and IT  which were made in order to better support businesses and their external talent  and prepare for future growth.After taking into account financial and non-recurring income and an income tax expense of €2.1m  net income came to €10m compared to €8.8m in 2020. After deducting the share of non-controlling interests  the Group share of net income stood at €9.9m  up 19%.Strengthened equity and solid financial capacityAt the end of 2021  the Group benefited from a strengthened balance sheet structure with equity of €116.2m compared to €47.8m a year earlier. This change stems from the various acquisitions made in 2021  some of which were financed in part by issuing new shares.With a low level of net debt at €47m  the Group states that already negotiated bank credit lines could potentially be made available to finance its external growth strategy and help build the European leader in freelancing.2-digit growth target for 2022 and €1bn by 2025The favourable development of underlying activities  the quality of the current sales momentum and the twelve-month integration of offers and skills from recently acquired companies have made the Group particularly confident in its growth prospects.Freelance.com aims to enhance its value proposition through structural acquisitions of companies sharing the same vision of the ""Future of Work""  with specific know-how  whether complementary or established in new high-potential geographical areas.
