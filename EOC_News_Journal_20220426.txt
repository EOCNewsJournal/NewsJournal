The resolutions under items (a)-(b) below shall be conditional upon each other and for that reason it is proposed that all resolutions are to be passed as one resolution.Item (a) - Proposal regarding the adoption of LTI 2022 StaffLTI 2022 Staff comprises one series of stock options which will be granted to employees within the Company group.The board proposes that the general meeting resolves to issue not more than 88 750 000 warrants. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall vest in the Company in order to secure delivery of shares upon exercise of stock options in LTI 2022 Staff. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. The warrants shall be issued without consideration to the Company.Below is a description of the terms and conditions for LTI 2022 Staff.Stock options with warrants as hedging arrangementEach stock option entitles the participant to acquire one (1) share in the Company in accordance with the following terms and conditions:• The stock options will be granted without consideration.• Stock options may be granted to employees of the Company group.• There are no defined performance conditions that need to be fulfilled in order be granted stock options. However  the stock options are subject to both performance and time-based vesting requirements as set out below.• Provided that the holder's employment agreement with the Company group has not been terminated as of a vesting date  and that the applicable Performance Condition (defined below) has been satisfied as of the applicable vesting date  the stock options will vest on and become exercisable soon after each of the first three (3) anniversaries of the date of grant (each a ""Sub-Vesting Period"") where 1/3 of the total stock options granted vests at each such Sub-Vesting Period. The total vesting period  after which all granted stock options have vested  is thus three (3) years from the date of grant.• In order for the stock options to vest  the Company's consolidated adjusted EBITDA per share must  during a measurement period of in total twelve (12) calendar quarters  divided into three (3) sub-periods of four (4) calendar quarters each  have increased by an average of certain minimum percentage point where the change is measured as the relative change in consolidated adjusted EBITDA per share compared to the consolidated adjusted EBITDA during the four (4) calendar quarters immediately preceding the sub-period in question (the ""Performance Condition""). Notwithstanding the above  should the Performance Condition applicable to the last sub-period referred to above be met  full vesting of all stock options shall occur  provided that the employee's employment within the Company group has not ended before the end of the last Sub-Vesting Period (""Comeback Vesting""). The Performance Condition will be applicable from the calendar quarter ongoing at the date of grant and end on the last day of the calendar quarter immediately preceding the vesting date.• Subject to Comeback Vesting  if the applicable Performance Condition relating to the relevant sub-period is not satisfied on a vesting date  the stock options concerned will remain unvested and will immediately be deemed forfeited without consideration.• Each stock option entitles the holder to acquire one (1) share in the Company at an exercise price corresponding to a per cent as set out below of the volume-weighted average price for the Company's share on Nasdaq First North during the period from and including 11 May 2022 up to and including 25 May 2022 (""VWAP"") as set out below  where the exercise price may not be less than the share's quota value (currently EUR 0.000262) and days without price quotation shall not be included in the calculation.First Sub-Vesting Period: 100 per cent of VWAP.Second Sub-Vesting Period: 125 per cent of VWAP.Third Sub-Vesting Period: 150 per cent of VWAP.• Upon vesting  unless the employee's employment within the Company group ends sooner  stock options remain exercisable for a period of two (2) months from the vesting date for each Sub-Vesting Period and  for Comeback Vesting  two (2) months from the last vesting date.Recalculation due to split  consolidation  new share issue etc.The exercise price for stock options determined as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest EUR 0.0001 whereby EUR 0.00005 shall be rounded upwards. The exercise price and the number of shares that stock option entitles to subscription of shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue etc. in accordance with customary re-calculation terms.Allocation of stock optionsThe participants' right to be granted stock options is differentiated as below:Category A - Group ManagementCategory B - Local Management (subsidiaries)Category C - Other personnelThe following allocation principles apply to the grant of stock options within each of the categories set out above.Maximum number of stock options per participant Total number of stock options within the category Category A - Group Management (not more than 7 people) 1 700 000 11 900 000 Category B - Local Manegement(not more than 6 people) 1 500 000 9 000 000 Category C - Other personnel (not more than 220 people) 600 000 67 850 000 TOTAL 88 750 000In the event that all stock options within a category are not granted after the initial notification period  such non-granted stock options may be offered to employees in another category. The maximum number of stock options per individual within each category as set out above may however not be exceeded for any individual.Item (b) - Proposal regarding issue of warrantsThe board proposes that the Company shall issue not more than 88 750 000 warrants  whereby the Company's share capital may be increased by not more than EUR 23 252.50 at full exercise of the warrants for subscription of shares.The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  only vest in the Company  with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants as described further above. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company during the period from and including the date when the warrants have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) up to and including 31 March 2026  at an exercise price equal to the shares' quota value (currently EUR 0.000262). The warrants shall be issued to the Company without consideration.In order to fulfil the commitments arising from LTI 2022 Staff  the board proposes that the general meeting authorizes that the Company may assign warrants to a third party  or in another way dispose over the warrants  in accordance with the above.The warrants will be governed by complete terms and conditions  including inter alia re-calculation provisions.CostsThe stock options are expected to incur accounting costs (accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2) as well as social security costs during the term of the stock options. According to IFRS 2  the stock option costs shall be recorded as a personnel expense in the income statement during the vesting period. The total costs for stock options  calculated in accordance with IFRS 2  are estimated to amount to approximately EUR 0.33m during the term of the program (excluding social security costs). The estimated costs have been calculated based on  inter alia  the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Company's share of EUR 0.022 at the time of grant  (ii) an estimated future volatility in respect of the Company's share during the term of the stock options of 40 per cent  (iii) that the maximum number of stock options encompassed by this resolution proposal are granted to participants and (iv) that all granted stock options will vest and be exercised. Social security costs  which are expected to arise primarily in connection to the exercise of stock options  are estimated to amount to approximately EUR 0.00m during the term of the program  based on inter alia the assumptions set out under items (i)-(iv) above as well as an average social security rate of 0.64 per cent and an annual increase in the market price of the Company's share of 20 per cent during the vesting period.Other costs related to LTI 2022 Staff  including inter alia expenses related to fees to external advisors  external appraiser and administration of the incentive program  are estimated to amount to approximately EUR 85k during the term of the program.DilutionUpon exercise of all stock options within LTI 2022 Staff  up to 88 750 000 new shares (with reservation for any re-calculation) may be issued  equivalent to a maximum dilution of approximately 11.10 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company as of the day of this proposal and a maximum dilution of approximately 7.64 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company taking into account the maximum of 361 911 829 new shares that can be issued upon full exercise of 361 911 829 warrants (TO1) that the Company issued in 2021  with exercise period July / August 2022.Motivation in respect of stock options vesting and exercise conditionsAccording to recommendations laid down by the Swedish Corporate Governance Board (Sw. Kollegiet för svensk bolagsstyrning)  the vesting period in incentive programs such as LTI 2022 Staff shall as a general rule not be shorter than three (3) years. As set out further above  vesting of stock options will start on the first anniversary of the date of grant of the stock options  and before the third anniversary of the date of grant  up to 2/3 of the stock options granted to a participant may have vested and been exercised (provided that all applicable vesting conditions have then been fulfilled  including the Performance Conditions). The reason for applying such terms  which are diverting from the recommendations set out above  is that the board deem such terms to be in line with market practice for stock option programs in most of the countries where the intended participants in LTI 2022 Staff are operative. It is therefore  in the opinion of the board  in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to apply such terms in order to fulfil the objectives of LTI 2022 Staff.Preparation of the proposalThis proposal in respect of LTI 2022 Staff has been prepared by the board in consultation with external advisers.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rightsThe reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to implement LTI 2022 Staff.Majority requirementA resolution to approve the present proposal is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting.AuthorizationIt is proposed that the board  or a person appointed by the board  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) and Euroclear Sweden AB.Item 14 - Resolution to grant the board of directors the authority to issue shares  convertible instruments and warrantsIt is proposed that the general meeting resolves to authorise the board of directors to  until the next annual general meeting  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  on one or several occasions  resolve to issue shares  convertible instruments and/or warrants. Payment may be made in cash and/or with a condition to pay in kind or by way of set-off  or other conditions. The issues are to be performed on market conditions  taking into account any discount on market terms. The reason for the authorization and the reason for the possible deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable capital raisings for the acquisition of companies or businesses  or portions thereof  funding of the operations of the Company as well as settlement of debt.A resolution to approve the present proposal is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting.Number of shares and votesThere are in total 710 802 055 shares and votes in the Company.DocumentsRelevant documents will be available with the Company (address above) and on the Company's webpage  www.cyber1.com  not less than three weeks before the general meeting.

Kollegiet för svensk bolagsstyrning)  the vesting period in incentive programs such as LTI 2022 Staff shall as a general rule not be shorter than three (3) years. As set out further above  vesting of stock options will start on the first anniversary of the date of grant of the stock options  and before the third anniversary of the date of grant  up to 2/3 of the stock options granted to a participant may have vested and been exercised (provided that all applicable vesting conditions have then been fulfilled  including the Performance Conditions). The reason for applying such terms  which are diverting from the recommendations set out above  is that the board deem such terms to be in line with market practice for stock option programs in most of the countries where the intended participants in LTI 2022 Staff are operative. It is therefore  in the opinion of the board  in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to apply such terms in order to fulfil the objectives of LTI 2022 Staff.Preparation of the proposalThis proposal in respect of LTI 2022 Staff has been prepared by the board in consultation with external advisers.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rightsThe reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to implement LTI 2022 Staff.Majority requirementA resolution to approve the present proposal is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting.AuthorizationIt is proposed that the board  or a person appointed by the board  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw.

Payment may be made in cash and/or with a condition to pay in kind or by way of set-off  or other conditions. The issues are to be performed on market conditions  taking into account any discount on market terms. The reason for the authorization and the reason for the possible deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable capital raisings for the acquisition of companies or businesses  or portions thereof  funding of the operations of the Company as well as settlement of debt.A resolution to approve the present proposal is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the general meeting.Number of shares and votesThere are in total 710 802 055 shares and votes in the Company.DocumentsRelevant documents will be available with the Company (address above) and on the Company's webpage  www.cyber1.com  not less than three weeks before the general meeting.

Earnings per share before the effects of purchase price allocation came to €2.40  up 33 per cent.▪ In the first quarter  cyclical net revenue growth was stronger than expected. Therefore  we currently expect that net revenue will increase to more than €3.8 billion and EBITDA to more than €2.2 billion during the current financial year.Overview of material eventsDeutsche Börse AG successfully placed a corporate hybrid bond in the amount of €500.0 million on 16 February 2022.The bond has a term of 26.25 years with a first call date after 6 years and a coupon of 2.0 per cent annually until June 2028. The hybrid bond will be used to refinance last year's M&A activities.At the end of March 2022 Deutsche Börse AG expanded its offering in the data services space by acquiring Kneip Communication S.A. The companies have reached an agreement through which Deutsche Börse will acquire 100 per cent of the Luxembourg-based fund data manager.Deutsche Börse AG successfully placed a corporate bond in an amount of €600.0 million on 29 March2022.The bond has a term of 10 years and a coupon of 1.5 per cent annually. The proceeds from the issue of the bond will be used to refinance the corporate bond maturing in October 2022 and were received by Deutsche Börse AG by 4 April 2022.On 31 March 2022 Clearstream Banking S.A. and Clearstream Holding AG successfully closed the sale of their respective 50 per cent stake in the European trade repositories REGIS-TR S.A. and REGIS-TR UK Ltd. to its joint venture partner Iberclear  part of SIX.Comparability of figuresTo reduce the complexity of its financial reporting and emphasise the Group's growth areas more clearly  the segment reporting was adjusted in accordance with the internal corporate management as of the first quarter of 2022 (including the respective amounts for the first quarter of the prior year). The eight existing segments will from now on be condensed to four: Data & Analytics (including the Qontigo and ISS segments)  Trading & Clearing (Eurex  EEX  360T and Xetra segments)  Fund Services (IFS segment) and Securities Services (Clearstream segment).Results of operationsThe first quarter of 2022 was overshadowed by Russia's war against Ukraine. The humanitarian consequences are shocking. The global fallout and resulting effects have been difficult to grasp so far. The first economic consequences have expressed themselves in the form of higher commodity prices  more difficult trading conditions and a redistribution of investments. In addition  the rapid spread of the Omicron coronavirus variant has subdued the economy's recovery and resulted in further restrictions and shortages  including in supply chains. Against this background  there was increased uncertainty among market participants  visible in the greater market volatility. The demand for trading and hedging in almost all asset classes therefore rose  which partly led to significantly higher trading volumes  especially in derivatives and commodities.On this basis  net revenue in the first quarter of 2022 increased significantly to €1 061.6 million  which represents a year-on-year increase of 24 per cent (Q1/21: €855.1 million). The key driver of the cyclical net revenue growth of 11 per cent was the higher market activity across all asset classes in Trading & Clearing resulting from increased market volatility. In particular  index derivatives as well as power and gas products benefitted from the growing hedging demand among market participants. The secular net revenue growth of 8 per cent was particularly driven by product innovation in financial derivatives  an increase of market share in commodities  the growing demand for ESG-related products and the continued trend towards outsourcing in the fund industry. The M&A growth of 5 per cent is primarily attributable to the acquisition of Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)  which was closed in February 2021. The Securities Services segment also benefitted from the roughly €50 million gain from the sale of the remaining stakes in REGIS-TR.Operating costs in the first quarter of 2022 came to €406.7 million (Q1/21: €346.5 million). On the one hand  this increase is a result of the M&A-related growth  particularly the acquisition of ISS. On the other hand  we have slightly increased our investments in growth and infrastructure due to the positive revenue development we are seeing. Based on constant currency  organic operating costs grew by 5 per cent.Earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose accordingly by 32 per cent to €687.4 million (Q1/21: €521.2 million). This comprises the result from financial investments at an amount of €32.5 million (Q1/21: €12.6 million). The increase results from disposals of smaller investments as well as the higher market valuation of the Illuminate fintech funds.Depreciation  amortisation and impairment losses totalled €84.4 million (Q1/21: €61.7 million)  with the change mainly stemming from the effects of purchase price allocation for acquired companies. The winding down of the buy-in agent service also produced a one-time write-down of self-developed software of €6.5 million. The financial result of -€8.8 million (Q1/21: -€13.9 million) includes a one-off gain in the context of interest rate hedging.Net profit for the period attributable to Deutsche Börse AG shareholders came to €420.8 million (Q1/21: €317.3 million)  which is 33 per cent up on the same period of the previous year. Earnings per share were €2.29 (Q1/21: €1.73) for an average of 183.6 million shares. Earnings per share before the effects of purchase price allocation (cash EPS) were €2.40 (Q1/21: €1.81).Gregor Pottmeyer  Chief Financial Officer at Deutsche Börse AG  commented on the results  saying  ""The first quarter of 2022 was considerably above our expectations. All three growth components of our business - secular  cyclical and M&A net revenue growth - contributed equally to the extraordinarily good result. We are therefore currently expecting to exceed our guidance for the current financial year.""Risk reportDeutsche Börse Group provides a full description of its risk management framework  strategy  principles  organisational structure  processes  methods and concepts  along with measures to manage and mitigate risks  on pages 73 to 109 of its Annual Report 2021. A full description of the current status of litigation is also presented on pages 84 to 87 of the Annual Report 2021.In view of Russia's war against Ukraine and the measures taken in relation to it  the Group's overall risk position has not changed materially  except for increased holdings of collateral at the clearing houses. In terms of operational risk  the focus is on interpreting and implementing the specifications of various sanctions. There are financial risks resulting from the Ukrainian central bank's capital controls  e.g. with respect to cross-border payments  as well as from comparable countermeasures taken by the Russian government in response to the sanctions imposed by European and other governments. Relevant in this context are credit risks in combination with foreign-exchange risks from institutions in the affected countries. The Group actively manages all impacts that it is aware of and analyses potential new risks on an ongoing basis.Otherwise  the Executive Board has not identified any material change in the Group's risk position at the present time.Report on expected developmentsGiven the developments in the financial markets during the first quarter of 2022  we are now expecting significantly stronger cyclical net revenue growth for the current financial year compared to our original expectation. Thus  in comparison with the report on expected developments in the 2021 Annual Report we are currently expecting an increase in net revenue to more than €3.8 billion and an increase in earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) to more than €2.2 billion.Consolidated income statementFirst Quarter (01.01.-31.03.) 2022 2021 Change €m €m % Sales revenue 1 187.6 1 023.8 16 Treasury result from banking business and similar business 60.3 34.6 74 Other operating income 56.2 19.3 191 Total revenue 1 304.1 1 077.7 21 Volume-related costs -242.5 -222.6 9 Net revenue (total revenue less volume-related costs) 1 061.6 855.1 24 Staff costs -285.3 -228.5 25 Other operating expenses -121.4 -118.0 3 Operating costs -406.7 -346.5 17 Result from financial investments 32.5 12.6 158 Earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) 687.4 521.2 32 Depreciation  amortisation and impairment losses -84.4 -61.7 37 Earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) 603 0 459.5 31 Financial result -8.8 -13.9 -37 Earnings before tax (EBT) 594.2 445.6 33 Tax expense -154.6 -115.8 34 Net profit for the period 439.6 329.8 33 thereof attributable to Deutsche Börse AG shareholders 420.8 317.3 33 thereof attributable to non-controlling interests 18.8 12.5 50 Earnings per share (basic) (€) 2.29 1.73 32 Earnings per share before purchase price allocations (Cash EPS) (€) 2.40 1.81 33 4Key indicators Data & Analytics segment",neutral,0.01,0.97,0.03,mixed,0.07,0.14,0.79,True,English,"['Deutsche Börse Group', 'Quarterly statement', 'Deutsche Börse AG shareholders', 'Kneip Communication S.A.', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'Clearstream Banking S.A.', 'Luxembourg-based fund data manager', 'cyclical net revenue growth', 'secular net revenue growth', 'The Securities Services segment', 'respective 50 per cent stake', 'Clearstream Holding AG', 'M&A activities', 'REGIS-TR S.A.', 'M&A growth', 'purchase price allocation', 'European trade repositories', 'joint venture partner', 'higher commodity prices', 'Omicron coronavirus variant', 'M&A-related growth', 'positive revenue development', 'Institutional Shareholder Services', 'internal corporate management', 'data services space', 'REGIS-TR UK Ltd.', 'eight existing segments', 'first call date', 'organic operating costs', 'greater market volatility', 'higher market activity', 'difficult trading conditions', 'higher trading volumes', 'first economic consequences', '32 per cent rise', 'current financial year', 'corporate hybrid bond', 'growing hedging demand', '33 per cent increase', 'Clearstream segment', 'Fund Services', 'growth areas', 'respective amounts', 'Net profit', 'fund industry', '24 per cent', '2.0 per cent', '100 per cent', '1.5 per cent', '11 per cent', '8 per cent', 'segment reporting', 'IFS segment', 'humanitarian consequences', 'growing demand', 'financial reporting', 'Xetra segments', 'market participants', 'trading activity', 'first quarter', 'corporate bond', 'strong start', 'material events', 'global fallout', 'rapid spread', 'supply chains', 'asset classes', 'key driver', 'gas products', 'product innovation', 'financial derivatives', 'ESG-related products', 'continued trend', '€50 million gain', 'remaining stakes', 'one hand', 'other hand', 'constant currency', 'market share', 'ISS segments', 'index derivatives', 'prior year', 'quarterly results', 'resulting effects', 'year increase', 'Overview', 'Earnings', 'interest', 'tax', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'EBITDA', 'period', '16 February', 'term', '26.25 years', '6 years', 'coupon', 'June', 'March', 'offering', 'companies', 'agreement', '10 years', 'proceeds', 'issue', 'October', '4 April', 'sale', 'Iberclear', 'SIX', 'Comparability', 'figures', 'complexity', 'accordance', 'Analytics', 'Qontigo', 'Clearing', 'Eurex', 'EEX', '360T', 'operations', 'Russia', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'form', 'redistribution', 'investments', 'addition', 'economy', 'recovery', 'restrictions', 'shortages', 'background', 'uncertainty', 'commodities', 'basis', 'power', 'outsourcing', 'acquisition', 'infrastructure']",2022-04-26,2022-04-26,marketscreener.com

This plan remains relevant  it has started since the beginning of April and will be fully implemented before the end of this year. Its impact will be visible from the 2022 accounts  even if it will produce its full effect on the 2023 financial year.The discussions also provided a better understanding of the strong valuation and monetization capacity of several assets held by the Delta Drone Group  and the attraction they enjoy with potential buyers. These assets  patiently built up over time  are consistent with the Group's vision without being at the heart of the strategy.Therefore  and in order to address shareholders' legitimate concerns about the dilutive financing methods used so far  some could be partially or totally divested during the year  so as to provide the group with substantial alternative financial resources  probably sufficient to achieve the objective of a positive structural cash flow situation. Various projects are already being studied.Story continuesFinally  the decision to consolidate Delta Drone shares (see press release of 19 April 2019) is part of the same logic to support a new stock market dynamic  in line with the Group's maturity.About Delta Drone : Delta Drone Group is a recognized international player in the field of civilian drones for professional use.

Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS® platform  which uses a novel technology to encapsulate drug substances inside red blood cells  ERYTECH is developing a pipeline of product candidates for patients with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH’s primary focus is on the development of product candidates that target the altered metabolism of cancer cells by depriving them of amino acids necessary for their growth and survival.The Company’s lead product candidate  eryaspase (GRASPA®)  which consists of L-asparaginase encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells  targets the cancer cells’ altered asparagine and glutamine metabolism. The proof of concept of eryaspase as a cancer metabolism agent was established in different trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and pancreatic cancer. An investigator sponsored Phase 2 trial (IST) evaluating the use of eryaspase in ALL patients who developed hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase recently reported positive results  based on which the Company intends to request approval in the United States and potentially other territories. The Company is also pursuing a Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial in first-line pancreatic cancer.Eryaspase received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who have developed hypersensitivity reactions to E. coli-derived pegylated asparaginase. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency have granted eryaspase orphan drug status for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and ALL. Eryaspase is not an approved medicine.ERYTECH produces its product candidates for treatment of patients in Europe at its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France  and for patients in the United States through its long-term supply agreement with Catalent  operating from ERYTECH’s former GMP facility in Princeton  New Jersey  USA.ERYTECH is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States (ticker: ERYP) and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0011471135  ticker: ERYP).

The studies underline once more that the strength of Idylla™ tests lies in the combination of both fast and accurate results  enabling rapid clinical decision-making. Especially in the case of sepsis  this can save lives. Finally  these studies show how Idylla™ testing can be easily integrated within the routine diagnostic process of hospitals.”The first study1 (abstract #04729) was presented in a poster session and evaluated whether SeptiCyte® RAPID could be used as a triage tool for COVID-19 patients at a hospital2 in France. Results demonstrated SeptiCyte® RAPID’s ability to distinguish between COVID-19 patients showing higher extents of lung damage as defined by lung CT scans (critical and severe) from those with a milder presentation (mild  moderate  absent). The SeptiScore®  as evaluated by SeptiCyte® RAPID  of critical and severe patients in the ICU was higher relative to the moderate and mild cases not in ICU. Also  the utility of the SeptiScore® for longitudinal monitoring of patients with severe cases was suggested by repeat testing on selected patients.Story continuesRollie Carlson  Ph.D.  Chief Executive Officer of Immunexpress  added: “During the COVID-19 pandemic  sepsis incidence increased. This study shows that the SeptiCyte® RAPID on the Idylla™ platform can distinguish COVID-19 cases with severe or critical presentation on a CT scan from those with mild or moderate presentation. This is essential to identify and triage patients in need of timely sepsis specific medical care.”The second study3 (abstract #04693) was presented in an online poster session and evaluated the performance of SeptiCyte® RAPID as an everyday tool in the management of ICU patients at two clinical sites in Portugal4. Results demonstrated a significant correlation between the diagnosis of sepsis and an elevated SeptiScore®. From eight patients diagnosed with either septic shock or sepsis  six had elevated scores and two had intermediate-elevated scores. The study concluded that the SeptiCyte® score pinpointed all cases while also suggesting the diagnosis of patients of whom sepsis was not detected by most traditional methods  found to be severely lacking in this setting5.Severe COVID-19 can be considered an example of viral sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening medical emergency associated with high morbidity and mortality  making early sepsis detection of utmost importance. Today’s gold standard for detecting sepsis in the laboratory setting is microbiological culture identification. However  the prediction of positive blood culture results remains a very difficult task since positive blood culture results in approx. only 20% of the cases6 due to low sensitivity. Also  it can take days to report results. Studies such as the ones presented at ECCMID show that newer methods such as the SeptiCyte® RAPID  running on Biocartis’ Idylla™ platform  combine fast and accurate results  enabling rapid clinical decision-making.Finally  the third study7 (abstract #04963)  presented in a poster session  highlighted the performance data of the Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2 Test (CE-IVD) and the Idylla™ SARS-CoV-2/Flu/RSV Panel (CE-IVD) and concluded that both Idylla™ assays provide quick  accurate results with minimal hands-on-time  making them suitable for an NHS (National Health Service  UK) setting.--- END ---More information:Renate DegraveHead of Corporate Communications & Investor Relations Biocartise-mail rdegrave@biocartis.comtel +32 15 631 729mobile +32 471 53 60 64About BiocartisBiocartis (Euronext Brussels: BCART) is an innovative molecular diagnostics (MDx) company providing next generation diagnostic solutions aimed at improving clinical practice for the benefit of patients  clinicians  payers and industry.

(NYSE:PSB) (“PS Business Parks”)  which was announced today. Upon consummation of the transaction  Public Storage  like all holders of PS Business Parks’ common shares and units  would receive $187.50 in cash per PS Business Parks common share or unit. Public Storage holds an approximate 41% common equity interest in PS Business Parks through approximately 7.2 million common shares and 7.3 million limited partnership units.Public Storage expects to receive approximately $2.7 billion of cash proceeds and recognize a $2.3 billion tax gain on sale upon consummation of the transaction. Public Storage expects to distribute the $2.3 billion gain to its shareholders.Public Storage estimates annual Core Funds from Operations would be lower following the consummation of the transaction to a degree approximating its $101 million pro rata share of PS Business Park’s Core FFO in 2021  which comprised approximately 4% of Public Storage’s total Core FFO during the year.Additional Transaction DetailsThe transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2022  subject to approval by PS Business Parks’ stockholders and other customary closing conditions. Public Storage has agreed to vote its shares of PS Business Parks common stock  which represent 25.9% of the outstanding shares  in favor of the transaction  subject to the terms of a support agreement between Public Storage  PS Business Parks and an affiliate of Blackstone.The merger agreement also includes a “go-shop” period that will expire 30 days from today on May 25  2022  which permits PS Business Parks and its representatives to actively solicit and consider alternative acquisition proposals to acquire PS Business Parks. PS Business Parks has the right to terminate the definitive merger agreement with Blackstone to enter into a superior proposal  subject to the payment of a termination fee and certain other terms and conditions of the definitive merger agreement  and Public Storage’s support agreement will terminate automatically upon the termination of the merger agreement.From the date of the merger agreement through the closing of the transaction  PS Business Parks is permitted to declare and pay regular  quarterly cash distributions to holders of its common stock and to holders of its operating partnership’s units  in each case  including Public Storage  in an amount of up to $1.05 per share or unit  including a pro rata distribution in respect of any stub period.Additional information regarding the transaction may be found in documents that PS Business Parks files with the SEC  available on the SEC’s website at sec.gov.Company InformationPublic Storage  a member of the S&P 500 and FT Global 500  is a REIT that primarily acquires  develops  owns  and operates self-storage facilities.

Such forward-looking statements include statements relating to the consummation of Blackstone’s agreed acquisition of PS Business Parks and the impact such acquisition would have on the Company if consummated in accordance with its terms and all other statements other than statements of historical fact. Such statements are based on management’s beliefs and assumptions made based on information currently available to management. All statements in this press release  other than statements of historical fact  are forward-looking statements which may be identified by the use of the words “outlook ” “guidance ” “expects ” “believes ” “anticipates ” “should ” “estimates ” and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  which may cause our actual results and performance to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Factors and risks that may impact future results and performance include  but are not limited to  those described in Part 1  Item 1A  “Risk Factors” in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K that was filed with the SEC on February 22  2022 and in our other filings with the SEC including: the occurrence of any event  change or other circumstance that could give rise to the termination of the merger agreement between PS Business Parks and Blackstone’s affiliates; the failure to obtain the approval of PS Business Parks’ stockholders of the proposed transaction or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction; stockholder litigation in connection with the proposed transaction  which may affect the timing or occurrence of the proposed transaction; general risks associated with the ownership and operation of real estate  including changes in demand  risks related to development  expansion  and acquisition of self-storage facilities  potential liability for environmental contamination  natural disasters  and adverse changes in laws and regulations governing property tax  real estate  and zoning; risks associated with downturns in the national and local economies in the markets in which we operate  including risks related to current economic conditions and the economic health of our customers; risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic (the “COVID Pandemic”) or similar events  including but not limited to illness or death of our employees or customers  negative impacts to the economic environment and to self-storage customers that could reduce the demand for self-storage or reduce our ability to collect rent  and/or potential regulatory actions to (i) close our facilities if we were determined not to be an “essential business” or for other reasons  (ii) limit our ability to increase rent or otherwise limit the rent we can charge  or (iii) limit our ability to collect rent or evict delinquent tenants; the risk that there could be an out-migration of population from certain high-cost major markets  if it is determined that the ability to “work from home ” which has become more prominent during the COVID Pandemic  could allow certain workers to live in less expensive localities  which could negatively impact the occupancies and revenues of our properties in such major high-cost markets; the risk that more jurisdictions will reinstitute COVID Pandemic restrictions  which were previously eased  in response to increases in infections  including as a result of variants such as the Delta or Omicron variants  or if additional pandemics occur; the risk that we could experience a change in the move-out patterns of our long-term customers due to economic uncertainty and increases in unemployment resulting from changes in the macro environment  which could lead to lower occupancies and rent “roll down” as long-term customers are replaced with new customers at lower rates; the risk of negative impacts on the cost and availability of debt and equity capital as a result of the COVID Pandemic  which could have a material impact upon our capital and growth plans; the risk that the COVID Pandemic could adversely impact our ability to retain and hire employees  including as a result of vaccine or testing mandates; the impact of competition from new and existing self-storage and commercial facilities and other storage alternatives; the risk that our existing self-storage facilities may be at a disadvantage in competing with newly developed facilities with more visual and customer appeal; risks related to increased reliance on Google and Sparefoot as customer acquisition channels; difficulties in our ability to successfully evaluate  finance  integrate into our existing operations  and manage properties that we acquire directly or through the acquisition of entities that own and operate self-storage facilities  or to consummate announced acquisitions in the expected timeframe or at all; risks associated with international operations including  but not limited to  unfavorable foreign currency rate fluctuations  changes in tax laws  and local and global economic uncertainty that could adversely affect our earnings and cash flows; risks related to our participation in joint ventures; the impact of the legal and regulatory environment  as well as national  state  and local laws and regulations including  without limitation  those governing environmental issues  taxes  our tenant reinsurance business  and labor  including risks related to the impact of new laws and regulations; risks of increased tax expense associated either with a possible failure by us to qualify as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”)  or with challenges to the determination of taxable income for our taxable REIT subsidiaries; risks due to ballot initiatives or other actions that could remove the protections of Proposition 13 with respect to our real estate and result in substantial increases in our assessed values and property tax bills in California; changes in United States (“U.S.”) federal or state tax laws related to the taxation of REITs and other corporations; security breaches  including ransomware  or a failure of our networks  systems or technology  which could adversely impact our operations or our business  customer  and employee relationships or result in fraudulent payments; risks associated with the self-insurance of certain business risks  including property and casualty insurance  employee health insurance  and workers compensation liabilities; difficulties in raising capital at a reasonable cost; delays and cost overruns on our projects to develop new facilities or expand our existing facilities; difficulties in our ability to hire and retain skilled management and staff; ineffective succession planning for our CEO  executive management and our other key employees; ongoing litigation and other legal and regulatory actions that may divert management’s time and attention  require us to pay damages and expenses  or restrict the operation of our business; and economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism.The acquisition of PS Business Parks by affiliates of Blackstone is subject to approval by PS Business Parks’ stockholders and other customary closing conditions.

Arnaud Pieton  Chief Execut…,PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Technip Energies (PARIS:TE) (the “Company”)  a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  today announces its unaudited financial results for the first quarter 2022.Arnaud Pieton  Chief Executive Officer of Technip Energies  commented:“First quarter revenue growth and solid profitability demonstrate strong execution across the entirety of our portfolio from Project Delivery to Technology  Products and Services. This is consistent with our full year financial framework and we expect our activity outside of Russia to progressively ramp up through 2022.”“Regarding Russia  we are committed to complying with all applicable laws and regulations  which includes current and future sanctions. Our priorities are to protect our people  and the interests of our company and shareholders. In anticipation of the escalation of the European Union sanctions  we have been working with clients  partners and suppliers within the relevant contractual frameworks to take appropriate measures in connection with our activities in Russia  including Arctic LNG 2. We expect that the balance sheet position of the project and the relevant contract protections will be sufficient to fulfil our various contractual obligations in compliance with applicable sanctions.”“In the first quarter  we reconfigured the organization structure around four business lines focused on Technip Energies’ markets and supported by a global delivery structure dedicated to delivering projects and solutions. This will better align our operating model and commercial focus with the rapidly changing energy transition market.”“Our energy transition strategy is supported by our flexible capital allocation. In the quarter  we announced three investments in the markets of hydrogen  floating offshore wind  and biochemicals. These expand and diversify our technology portfolio  while enabling new business model opportunities.”“The energy landscape has become more complex in recent months with an urgent energy independence agenda  notably in Europe. Despite near-term volatility in commodity and raw material prices  the attractiveness of LNG  an inherently flexible energy source  has improved and the market opportunity is accelerating. In addition  government policy is increasingly promoting faster adoption of energy transition technologies and Technip Energies is playing a leading role in this market evolution.”Key financials – Adjusted IFRS (In € millions  except EPS) Q1 2022 Q1 2021 Revenue1 1 618.2 1 557.5 Recurring EBIT1 107.3 91.3 Recurring EBIT Margin % 6.6% 5.9% Net profit 72.5 44.2 Diluted earnings per share2 €0.41 €0.24 Order Intake 551.7 6 470.7 Backlog 15 632.4 17 805.2 Financial information is presented under Adjusted IFRS (see Appendix 8.0 for complete definition).

The listing follows the completion of its business combination with Amsterdam-listed Odyssey. Odyssey had bought BenevolentAI in a deal last year valuing the British-based medtech firm at up to €1.5 billion after the transaction.

The result was supported by record export coal prices  and solid operational performance across the group.”HighlightsRecord operating EBITDA of AUS$123 million for the March quarter.

The result is reflective of strong export coal prices continuing to be achieved and an ongoing focus on operational cost management.The South African operations performed well during the March quarter  despite the excessive rainfall and supply chain issues which negatively impacted the results in the December 2021 quarter.OperationsAustralia Business UnitBA – 100% equity interestCoal sales for the March quarter totalled 612 000 t  with a reported revenue of AUS$223/t.BA remains on track for coal sales in the 2022 financial year of approximately 2.3 million t.Australian financial performance – year-to-dateThe exceptional seaborne coal pricing resulted in BA delivering a strong operating EBITDA results of AUS$180 million for the 9 months to 31 March 2022  with the March quarter result contributing 47% of the year-to-date result.Management has been focused on maintaining costs to an acceptable level  but costs have been impacted by revenue linked costs  including government royalties. The royalty per tonne in the 9 months ending 31 March 2022 was AUS$18.4/t  which represents an increase of AUS$14.2/t compared to FY21.South Africa business unitTotal managed coal sales from the South African business unit increased by 264 000 t (18%) compared to the December 2021 quarter.New Clydesdale Colliery (NCC) – 49% equity interestNCC performed well throughout the March quarter. Operational plant yield continued to be a focus for the site  resulting in an overall yield of 68.2% for the March quarter  driven by the greater proportion of export sales compared to the prior corresponding period.The colliery achieved total coal sales during the March quarter 583 000 t  comprised of 354 000 t domestic sales and 229 000 t export sales. Total coal sales were consistent with the Decemeber 2021 quarter.North Block Complex (NBC) – 49% equity stakeNBC had a strong March quarter  delivering improved coal sales and ROM coal production compared to the December 2021 quarter (up 14% and 2% respectively).Export coal sales from NBC continue to increase and the colliery delivered 228 000 t during the March quarter  an increase of 48 000 t (27%) compared to export coal sales achieved in the December 2021 quarter. However  current train constraints mean the NBC is using alternate supply chain methods (trucking) as its path to the market.Ubuntu Colliery – 48.9% equity interestThe improved result achieved in the March quarter for Ubuntu was in line with expectations of increased production. Compared to the December 2021 quarter  the colliery recorded improved coal sales of 163 000 t (85%).South Africa financial performanceOperating EBITDA for the South African operations for the nine months to 31 March 2022 was AUS$84.3 million  of AUS$16.6/t.Year-to-date  contracted domestic offtake quantities have been delivered to Eskom on a combined basis.CorporateBoard and management changesThe following board and management changes occurred during the March quarter:In January 2022  the company welcomed Non-Executive Directors  Graeme Campbell and Mark Lochtenberg  to the Board.Megan Etcell was appointed Chief Financial Officer after holding the position of Interim Chief Financial Officer since October 2021.Coal sales outlookAustraliaBA coal is fully sold until end July 2022.For the June 2022 quarter  BA is forecast to deliver eight cargoes  equating to approximately 650 00 t. Of these cargoes  six are currently index linked  and two are contracted at a fixed price of US$300/t 5500 NAR basis.The main markets BA sells coal to are:Japanese and South Korean energy markets. Indian sponge iron market – being the process of direct reduction of iron ore into iron by an elemental carbon produced from thermal coal.South AfricaExport salesNotwithstanding the continued export supply chain constraints  the company continues to manage its plans to increase its South African export sales from both NBC and NCC. These plans include hauling coal by truck to the port which  given current strong seaborne pricing  are expected to favourable contribute to the overall EBITDA position.Similar to BA  the export coal produced in South Africa is sold to both energy markets and non-energy markets (e.g. sponge iron). This provides significant flexibility when marketing the product and should allow the company to capitalise on numerous opportunities as the export strategy continues to evolve.Domestic salesDemand levels for Eskom have stabilised and the company is forecasting that the South African operation should deliver cumulative contracted quantities for the remainder of the financial year ending 30 June 2022.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.49,0.16,0.35,True,English,"['quarterly activities report', 'TerraCom', 'lost time injury frequency rate', 'total recordable injury frequency rate', 'South African business unit', 'alternate supply chain methods', 'exceptional seaborne coal pricing', 'South Africa business unit', 'The South African operations', 'operating (EBITDA) cash margin', 'strong export coal prices', 'Total managed coal sales', 'record export coal prices', 'South Africa financial performance', 'combined operating EBITDA result', 'strong operating EBITDA results', 'Australia Business Unit BA', 'US$60 million prepayment facility', 'supply chain issues', 'prior corresponding period', 'North Block Complex', 'current train constraints', 'domestic offtake quantities', 'total coal sales', 'strong final quarter', 'solid operational performance', 'Export coal sales', 'emerging resources company', 'Operational plant yield', 'New Clydesdale Colliery', 'strong March quarter', 'equity coal sales', 'ROM coal production', 'Australian financial performance', 'operational cost management', '354 000 t domestic sales', '229 000 t export sales', 'revenue linked costs', 'March quarter result', 'March quarter 583 000 t', 'Highlights Record', 'initial US$', 'total principal', 'operating assets', '5.6 million tpy', 'financial perspective', 'Safety performance', '3Q financial', 'overall yield', 'operational highlights', '2.3 million t', '49% equity stake', '2022 financial year', 'December 2021 quarter', 'Decemeber 2021 quarter', 'TerraCom Ltd', 'large portfolio', 'Executive Chairman', 'Craig Ransley', 'Blair Athol', 'end July', 'Euroclear Bond', 'significant growth', 'excessive rainfall', '100% equity interest', 'acceptable level', 'government royalties', '49% equity interest', 'greater proportion', '48.9% equity interest', 'special interest', 'ongoing focus', 'quarterly report', 'nine months', 'date result', 'Ubuntu Colliery', '31 March', '264 000 t', '228 000 t', '48 000 t', '163 000 t', '3 months', '9 months', 'group', 'track', 'April', 'bondholders', 'fees', 'repayments', 'part', 'market', '28 February', 'receipt', 'COVID', 'improvement', 'royalty', 'tonne', 'increase', 'FY21', 'NCC', 'site', 'NBC', 'improved', 'trucking', 'path', 'line', 'expectations', '612 000']",2022-04-26,2022-04-26,worldcoal.com

The corresponding amendment to the Articles of Association was entered in the Commercial Register Düsseldorf on April 14  2022. The share capital of the Company now amounts to EUR 2 013 000.00 and is divided into 2 013 000 no-par value bearer shares with a pro rata amount of the share capital of EUR 1.00 per no-par value share. The share capital and the number of shares were thus doubled by the capital increase.The shareholders of the company will receive one bonus share with an unchanged securities identification number (ISIN DE000A0LA304 / WKN A0LA30) free of charge for each no-par value share they hold. The bonus shares are entitled to dividend as of October 1  2021. Shareholders will receive their bonus shares by means of a credit to their securities account and do not need to take any further action.The last trading day before the technical implementation of the capital increase is April 26  2022. Stock exchange orders that have not yet been executed will expire at the end of this day. The shares of the Company will be listed ""ex-bonus shares"" as of April 27  2022.On April 28  2022 (the ""Record Date"")  the shareholders entitled to receive bonus shares will be identified. Shareholders who are holders of shares in the Company after the close of trading on that date will have one bonus share for each existing share automatically booked into their securities accounts by the custodian institutions and Clearstream Banking AG on April 29  2022.An expected consequence of the doubled number of shares in the Company is a corresponding adjustment of the stock exchange price. The Company expects the capital increase to make its shares even more attractive and to increase liquidity in stock exchange trading.For frequently asked questions about the capital increase  we refer to our FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions) at https://tick-ts.de/en/general-meeting.html.About tick Trading Software AGWhen tick Trading Software AG was founded in 2002  Oliver Wagner ?

Welcome to the Deutsche Borse anaylst and investor conference call regarding the Q1 2022 results remote.Jan StreckerWelcome  ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for joining us today to go through our first-quarter 2022 results. With me are Theodor Weimer  Chief Executive Officer  and Gregor Pottmeyer  Chief Financial Officer. Theodor and Gregor will take you through the presentation. Afterwards  we will be happy to take your questions. The presentation materials for this call has been sent out via email and can also be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our website. As usual  the conference call will be recorded and is available for replay afterwards. With this  let me now hand over to you Theodor.Theodor WeimerThank you  Jan. Welcome ladies and gentlemen from my side  as well. Well  let's start today's call with a brief overview of the financial highlights and the key developments in the first quarter. Afterwards  Gregor  our CFO  will be presenting the financial results in greater detail. In contrast to last year  our regular secular growth achievements and a contribution from M and A have been complemented by strong cyclical tailwinds. This has contributed to our net revenue growth of 24% to a record quarterly level of more than £1 billion; 2  to the operating leverage of our business model the EBITDA even increased by 32% during the first quarter. Secular net revenue growth at 8%  both slightly above our guidance. This was particularly driven by product innovation in financial derivatives  an increase of market shares in commodities  the growing demand for ESG related products at ISS  and the continued trend towards outsourcing in the fund industry. M&A contributed another 5% net revenue growth.This was mainly driven by the contribution of the remaining 2 months of ISS  which we started to consolidate in March last year. We also continued to implement our M&A strategy and have closed the acquisition of [Indiscernible]  a leading fund data manager  in March this year. This will further strengthen our fund service business because we can now offer data management and regulatory reporting services to our existing client base. The strong cyclical tailwinds resulted from higher volatility in almost all asset losses  and accordingly  hedging needs of our clients increased significantly.This was very visible in commodities and equities  but fixed income and FX benefited as well. In total  cyclical net revenue growth amounted to 11%  which also includes the one-off effects from the REGIS-TR disposal  and some benefits from the stronger U.S. dollar. With a much more positive top-line development compared to last year  we slightly increased investments in growth and infrastructure.This is why other constant currency basis to organic operating costs increased by 5% in the quarter. But we also continued to increase productivity through our continuous improvement program. This helped offset most of the inflationary pressures. such as quite frankly  strong start to the year is very likely from today's perspective that we will exceed our full-year guidance. With that  let me now hand it over to you  GregorGregor PottmeyerThank you  Theodor. On Page 2  we showed the first quarter results of [Indiscernible] in detail. While cyclically boosted net revenue  we saw a nice improvement of the operating leverage and an organic earnings growth of 30%. The result from financial investments include around €17 million from our investment in the Illuminate fintech fund. This is driven by the market-to-market valuation of the fund and the partial disposal of our holding of the fund. In addition  the line item includes a gain of around €12 million from the sale of the [Indiscernible] stake in the U.S. derivatives exchange FairX to Coinbase. Depreciation includes a software impairment of around €6 million on the buying agent services that were developed at Eurex. This is the result of the decision by the European Commission to remove the buying application from the CFR regulation for an indefinite time. The financial result includes a one-off gain of around €4 million from an interest rate hedge. This is related to the senior bond we placed at the end of March. We secured an attractive interest rate level already in 2021 which reduces the effective yield of the bond to around 0.6%.The proceeds from the issue of the bond will be used to refinance the corporate bond maturing in October 2022. On Slide 3  we give you an overview of the quarterly results in the new segment reporting structure. We have simplified our reporting structure by reducing the number of segments from eight to four and applying a more product driven approach. The new segments are Data and Analytics  which comprises Contigo and ISS  Trading and Clearing  which is Eurex  EX  Xetra  and 360T  Fund Services  which is identical with Clearstream investment fund service business and Security Services  which consists of core equity and fixed income custody and settlement business of Clearstream. We have also simplified the net revenue line items within the segments  but you still will find most details disclosed in the appendix of this presentation.I'm now turning to the quarterly results of the segments  starting with data and analytics on Page 4. The segment performance was mainly driven by the continued out performance of ISS compared to our expectations. On an organic and constant currency basis  ISS 's net revenue increased by around 19%. The ESG business was mainly driven by higher double-digit growth in ESG analytics and corporate solutions.Governance solutions also performed well. The index business saw a mix of tailwinds from Eurex exchange licenses and some headwinds from market valuation in ETF licenses. Analytics saw some headwinds from slightly higher point in time net revenue in the same period last year. Let me turn to Slide 5 into Trading and Clearing segment. The overall segment clearly benefited from higher volatility and increased hedging needs  particularly in commodities and financial derivatives. Financial derivatives were driven by equity and equity index related derivatives with a 25% net revenue increase. Interest rate-related product also performed well.They include interest rate derivatives and the OTC clearing with an overall net revenue increase of 21%. The strongest [Indiscernible] in the segment was achieved by commodities. On the one hand  this was due to higher trading and hedging needs that we incurred. On the other hand  the margin fees continued to increase in the quarter amounted to €16 million. Since hedging was the main driver for trading activity in the quarter  net revenue in cash equities did not call quite as much as other parts of the segments  but still achieved a plus of 5%. Demand for our foreign exchange products including swaps and forwards was significantly higher compared to previous quarters  and net revenue increased by 18%. The Fund Services segments which you can find on page 6  continued its strong performance in the first quarter.Due to onboarding of new clients and portfolios  cyclical headwinds from market valuations in equities and bonds were over compensated. As a result  we exceeded our organic cost target of around 10% despite cyclical headwinds. To further complement the fund service of our we acquired Kneip at the end of March. Kneip is a leader in firm data management and reporting solutions for the asset management industry. The expectation is already closed and form the basis for creating a leading fund data up with significant cross-selling potential into our existing client base. In addition  we announced a partnership with a global wealth management platform  FNZ 2 weeks ago. Together  we will create a leading business intelligence solutions provider and help rollout fronts distribution services into FNZ  client basis in the UK. Our security services segment on slide 7 benefited from the divestiture of REGIS-TR.But also saw solid growth despite some market headwinds. The divestiture of Clearstream 50% stakes in REGIS-TR to ICBA CLIA resided in a one-off proceeds of around £49 million  and at the same time in a recurring decline of net revenue by around 5 million euro per quarter. Headwinds from lower equity market valuations and a slight decline of retail participation  they're overcompensated by solid leverage of fixed income issuance activity. The net interest income started to develop more positively and amounted to around £19 million. This is mainly because of increase in cash balances in the quarter. On [Indiscernible] we discontinued the cash handling fee on U.S. dollar balances after the first set rate hike in March.This means that the potential further hikes will directly translate in higher net interest income. The current sensitivity is an increase of short-term interest rate by a 100 basis points higher that'll expand the NII by around £90 million on an annualized basis. The last page of today's presentation shows our guidance for 2022 in the context of our midterm plan.Due to stronger-than-expected cyclical net revenue growth in the first quarter  we currently expect more than €3.8 billion of net revenue and more than €2.2 billion Europe EBITDA. Previously  we had only committed ourselves to achieving something around these values for both KPIs. Taking the first quarter into consideration and leaving our assumptions for the rest of the year unchanged  we would currently be looking at roughly €70 million of additional net revenue for the full-year.Since we are expecting the U.S. dollar to remain strong and since we continue to invest slightly more  the up side to the EBITDA guidance would be somewhat less than €70 million. But still  there are nine months to go in the year  though there could be both cyclical headwind  as well as tailwinds to the close  we [Indiscernible] expect. Headwind  could for instance arise from a recession in Europe as a result of the war in the Ukraine or [Indiscernible] line of volatility and volumes into the second half of the year  similar to the development in 2020. Tailwinds could arise if U.S. interest rate are increasing to 2% or more to go at year-end  which is current the market expectation. This concludes our presentation. We're now looking forward to your questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorLadies and gentlemen [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Andrew Coombs from Citi. Over to you.Andrew CoombsOpening. I did 3 questions [Indiscernible] I can do very short one and followed by the main question. The short factor one is  can you provide the AuA in Clearstream Fund Centre or the fund distribution AuA? That could be done in the appendix. I would appreciate figuring that. And then the main question is just on the NII sensitivity. You talked about the revised charging in March to now it should flow through  previous set between 25 basis points is $19 million. Does that still stand? And are there any offsets elsewhere? They could come Q3 to finance expense line or when anywhere out that we should be aware of. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerSure  Andrew. Thanks for your questions. AUA at Fund Center is roughly €400 billion with regard to the sensitivity of the NIR liberated that having currently roughly 9 billion customer cash balances in U.S. dollar. So a rate increased by 1% translates into €90 million. So that is a sensitivity. You can take for your model.Andrew CoombsI meant no offset to many other changes in pricing or you'd have any floating rate debt issued which is dollar sensitive  anything in those lines?Gregor PottmeyerNo. There is no compensating effect.Andrew CoombsPerfect. And just on follow-up on the first point  the 400  I think you said 400 now for the last three quarters  we've been in a negative mark-to-market impact on that fund [Indiscernible]Jan StreckerAnd -- well  that's the rough number  though  unfortunately  we don't have it readily available per month yet  we're working on that. So definitely as you can see from the revenues  there was a little bit of a headwind from equity and fixed income valuations but I think we've nicely offset this also through growth in terms of declined base and the funds that are covered.Andrew CoombsPerfect. Okay. Thank you.OperatorNext up is Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. Over to you.Haley TamAfternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about all the different components of secular growth but I guess I will pick just one  therefore  to ask about. If I can ask you about the ESG data  revenue growth  obviously it was very strong year-on-year but has been partly stable I think for the last three quarters. So I just wondered  can you help us understand how to think about this business? Is it like an annual subscription model that we should see the growth come through once a year or is there something else that's causing that stability? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes  Haley  thanks for the question. Obviously  ESG is one of the key cost driver for [Indiscernible] business today at 7% to 8% of the overall group's net revenue and it will continuously increase obviously over the next year. [Indiscernible] higher organic growth on that side. In the first quarter  it was roughly 30% on a constant portfolio basis  so that's obviously higher than in the other business areas  and we expect that this trend will continue to happen in the future. Secondly  we will continue to look for M&A in this area so that we also increase our bases here. So the singular drivers here are basically two components in ESG  it's our ISS business obviously; and secondly  it's also our EEX business what contributes a lot. So these are the two main drivers for this ESG cost.Haley TamThank you  Gregor. If I can clarify  in the ISS ESG data revenue line  I think it was about €50 million -- €51 million for the last three quarters. That's a stable number I should expect. And really  I should be looking at the EEX business for growth  is that the right interpretation?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. So as you're also focusing on the recurring elements or -- usually in that kind of business in ISS it's a returning revenue  and so that you should see sustainable and continued growth here with regard to EAX. Obviously there's also a trading component to what the conceited idea is  the [Indiscernible] with this. And then therefore we have a clear classification  and here we expect that this will also continue to grow on a secular basis. Today it's more than 40% of the increase over the next year  so there's a secular component. But definitely there's also a current -- a cyclical component as overall  there are also higher market volatility  but in principle it's more a secular trend.Haley TamThank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes from Arnaud Giblat from BnP Exane. The floor is yours.Arnaud GiblatYes. Good morning. Good afternoon. Sorry  very quick follow-up and my main question  if I may. The follow-up  the first is cash equity yields have come off a bit this quarter versus previous quarters. I'm just wondering what's going on in the mix since that's maybe a little the top participation that's making a bit. My second question is with regards to ISS mostly from distribution. Do you see a significant consolidation opportunity ahead? Could mean there's some logic transactions happening there. And more important  if there's any potential transaction into issues with the competition commission. I think we've been there before but how should we think about that in terms of market definition? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Arnaud  let me pick up the second question. The [Indiscernible] the consolidation on the ISS. I tend to be very clear and outspoken  right? There are no plans on our side to enter into any consolidation games which might arise at the fall or rise near because there's such a strong organic growth that we see no need and be. We feel comfortable with our acquisition which we have done  right? When we acquired. So let's be very clear here We feel extremely well with what we have acquired so far.Theodor WeimerAnd on cash equity and all  it's basically the product mix. What we've seen is a quite substantial decline actually in retail trading compared to the strong previous year  and retail trading typically has a higher fee margin or the product mix is changed  but nothing really structured.Arnaud GiblatThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.Benjamin GoyHi  good afternoon. Just wanted to check on your M&A higher power. Can you confirm where you're standing was  the upper target? And would that mean that we should expect more of the same  meaning this 200 million type acquisition here and day-out  or do you see there's more room to grow in organically? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerThanks  Benjamin. As we got through M&A of higher power  I think you're aware that we're a strong cash flow generating business. So on a yearly basis we roughly generate €1.5 billion in cash flow  so let's say €600 million for dividend  let's say €200 million for CapEx  so it remains roughly €700 million. So you can see that we generate very quickly on cash and therefore  on a higher power from a funding perspective  we see [Indiscernible] to do transactions we would like to do. From a rating perspective  we are also now back on track with regard to our debt levels. So obviously with this on Q1 and with this year expectation here so we will come back through the agreed on KPIs with the rating agents [Indiscernible]. So no reflections from a firepower perspective as we got to M&A. As we got through our M&A strategy  I think you are aware that roughly a €150 million are missing for our 2023 target so long favorite it's roughly €600 million what we contribute with the 5% M&A contribution over the four years  roughly €450 million was already have already delivered  so meeting a €150 million  and that's still potentially the level we definitely want to achieve  but currently there's no big pressure. So if we find an attractive target then obviously we can look at it and no pressure from that point of view.Benjamin Goy[Indiscernible]. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Mike Werner from UBS.Michael WernerThank you very much. Just a question on the -- within trading and clearing the revenues per contract or the revenues per volume within equities and interest rate derivatives. We saw volumes up quite strongly in both  and surprisingly  also we did see a bit of an uptake as well in the yields on those products year-on-year. I was just wondering -- usually  we tend to see the opposite  but I was just wondering what was going on in the next year. Thank you.Jan StreckerNo  Mike. At Eurex  typically  there are no significant volume rebates or aside from market making rebates  it's pretty much price list fees. But what we've seen and what also contributed to the secular growth in trading and clearing in Eurex  is basically new products and product innovations or MSCI derivatives  dividend derivatives  volatility derivatives  and so on  typically  are higher price  so they help to bring up the [Indiscernible] already for the last couple of quarters  at least modestly.Michael WernerThank you. And just perhaps a follow-up with regards to the interest rate derivatives. In terms of the over-the-counter business  I'm just curious to hear how that progressed in the over-the-counter clearing. How did that progress in Q1?Theodor WeimerExcept for the effect that we funded it'd now an interest rate derivative doesn't mean it has not performed well. It has indeed performed extremely well. It was the strongest quarter ever with close to €90 million of net revenue.Michael WernerThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.Bruce HamiltonHi  good afternoon  guys and congratulations on the numbers. Quick one  maybe on the M&A landscape and you've been quite clear  it sounds like on the ISS and your view that actually what you have there is growing very nicely  you no need to acquire  to further grow. So what are the nice  interesting areas as you assess the landscape today? And has that changed the total? It sounds like ESG would still be a big focus  perhaps data as well. So I'm just interested in what you're saying. And then just to confirm on the net EBITDA  what you're saying. If you are now at 1.75 times as at the end of Q1 will take so just I make sure I've answered it. Thank you.Theodor WeimerThank you  Bruce. From my side  let me firstly position our M&A strategy in the context of the current environment. First  you need to understand  right  if we are benefiting from strong tailwinds  then our operating model works perfectly  so our EBITDA margin goes up  right? Which is probably nice for you and for us both? On the other side  if you do M&A  there is a tendency that M&A has a negative effect on the EBITDA margin because it's very hard to find as profitable companies as we run our own company. And therefore  we run this smart balance of we want to keep the high margins  but also we want to grow our business smartly forward. But there is no need and no pressure from our side. We don't feel pressed in a situation like this where still the valuations are pretty high. We don't think we should let ourselves get in a position that we feel pressed by the markets whereby anybody out there that we should go eventually towards the M&A route.As a rule of thumb  until the year 2020  we have grown by M&A on average by 2% per year  2%. Our target is now in the range of 5%. What we have started in 2020 until 2023  we want to grow to 5% and we are actually exactly on the 5%  as Gregor and I pointed out during our first part of the presentation. So we feel we are pretty well underway  there have come great opportunities out there. We look at those and we have proven that we are in a position to do deals. We have done [Indiscernible] and of course  the key areas we are predominantly focused on the pre -trading and the funds areas. That's what we have done so far and definitely will continue. But again  we're in a pretty good track already and we are not pressed. We are rather focused on the good opportunities  to identify good opportunities. We are less constrained by the financial situation.Gregor PottmeyerAs we got to the financial  so what we agreed upon it's what you said  that the net-debt EBITDA is 1.75%  is our target  and the other KPI is FFO net-debt free funds from operation  that's 50%. And so these are the two KPIs we agreed upon to come back at the end of the year with the rating agencies.Bruce HamiltonGreat. Thank you very much.OperatorThe next step is Kyle Voigt from KBW.Kyle VoigtHi  thank you for taking my question. So in Clearstream  settlement activity was down 17% year-on-year  but cash balance has grown 13%. I'm wondering why you think there's such a divergence there. And does that imply that the balances may currently be slightly elevated as clients are parking cash here because they still have very few alternatives to get higher yields? And lastly  is it reasonable to assume that as rates continue to move higher  your clients may migrate some of those balances out of Clearstream for yield alternatives? Thank you.Jan StreckerYeah  Kyle. There's no direct immediate correlation. So indeed the cash balances are driven by settlement  but only by the ICSE settlements or the international settlement  not by the domestic ones. And therefore  the numbers might not quite match up. What we've seen last time around  so when interest rates went down  and when we introduced the cash handling fee  that balances actually went down. So our question remains whether this is now a sign that balances are even structurally increasing  that needs to be seen. So apparently clients borrowing a little bit more about an explicit charge and not sort of an implicit cost. So from that angle it's a little bit early to predict  but we definitely wouldn't believe they would go down substantially. So either they remain stable  driven by settlement activity  or maybe they even trend slightly upwards as we have seen in marginal.Kyle VoigtUnderstood. Thank you.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Philip Middleton from the Bank of America. Philip  your line is up now. We cannot hear you  maybe you're still on mute.Philip MiddletonYeah. You've booked some gains on your financial assets  basically on the venture portfolio. I know there was some disposals in there to which well-done but in general  this is a difficult quarter for venture investing. And how come you're like -- you sounds like you've experienced positive mark-to-market  what's going on there and how are you feeling about the next quarter or two in terms of valuation of these assets?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Thanks  Philip  for the questions. Obviously to make some prediction on a quarterly basis is a little bit difficult. So what we see is a continued increasing contribution out of our financial SSVP invested. And so since beginning of [Indiscernible] I joined here  one of this is path to professionals this year  and we have done very successful investments here over the last three years and we see the benefits now. And last year we told you that so far over the last few years  you haven't seen anything in our P&L because all of the gains are booked against our equity  and now we made for a certain investment  we changed it specifically for the new ones because if you had made the decision that -- three years ago that you're showing on an -- just into balance sheet on equity basis then you can change it. So it has to be done in the first time. And therefore  we decided now for different SFC acquired recently or what the last month that you see a fair value -- valuation in our P&L. And we have single investments  that we have to make a decision  and we have also some portfolio investments. And this was the case now in Q1. It was illuminate. So here is to invest more in the Fintech portfolio and not in a specific thing investment. And this is shown in our P&L. So it's the [Indiscernible] positive elements here. If they are disposals or even some [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] you see this in our P&L.And there are many others and now -- where you could see potential impact. And it really depends whether a transaction takes place  yes or no. So for instance  our 360X business and as the leadership of [Indiscernible]  we talked about non-financial FX building platforms  market infrastructure plays based on blockchain technology. If you would see here on transaction  here  you would also see then a P&L impact. Though the general message is  if we will continue to do successful investments here in that area  you will see continued positive contributions here in our P&L for that.Philip MiddletonOkay  thank you. But the overall environment still hasn't been [Indiscernible] helpful  so you did well in Q1 for idiosyncratic reasons?Gregor PottmeyerNo  there are obviously positive and negative elements and now as you have seen  Illuminate obviously there was a very positive element. There was another  it was participation in FairX what we hold at [Indiscernible]  what we have at [Indiscernible] made a transaction for various attractive pricing and therefore there's another $13 million U.S. positive impact here. So these were the two main drivers for Q1 but over the next quarter  it could be different elements that would contribute. It really depends on whether a transaction takes place  yes or no.Philip MiddletonOkay  thank you.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Ian White from Autonomous Research.Ian WhiteHi  afternoon. Thanks today. Thanks for the presentation. I had one follow-up and one potential question  please. The follow-up is trend; I think is the final comment you made around guidance that this year. And can I just clarify  please? I heard 17 million of additional net revenue versus the previous guidance  less than that on EBITDA. And assuming that U.S. rates go to 2% by year-end. And if I got that correct  please from which I have misunderstood on what you're saying there in terms of the assumptions on depending. There is a tweak  you've made to the guidance for FY22. And then my question really just tasks for a bit more detail on commodity trading. What do you think that in terms of the breadth of participation in counter-party growth in the first quarter? And could you say a bit about the challenges we're seeing in some energy markets around high collateral requirements for end-users and how you see that developing over the coming quarters  please. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. With regard to the questions with regard guidance  when I mentioned the €70 million  so that is the surplus we achieved in Q1 compared to our plan. And obviously  when the second comment you made  they had included a 2% Fed fund rate at the end of the year; obviously not  because I talked about €70 million in Q1. So if the Fed rate would go up to 2%  obviously  it would be additional upside potentially for what is not included so far. Your second question around the commodity business. Yes  obviously  was another 40% net revenue increase. High market activity here in power and in gas  strong increase in pricing  and yes indeed  there was a strong increase in our margins we asked for in our collateral. And the good thing is that there were no surprises for the market participants. So the model growth is designed and/or the market participants were able to deliver the collateral. But nevertheless  it's obviously a stress situation at some peak times at ECC  so our clearing house for power and for gas  we had €70 billion margin and it's now reduced to closer to €40 billion but even the €70 billion or the market participants they are able to deliver are definitely expressive duration. But we are in a good dialogue with all the market participants and so far  the [Indiscernible] and everybody is highly interested that this market solution will also continue to happen so that you have a reasonable pricing  that you have a reasonable allocation of gas and power supply  and this also was strongly supported by our German government but also from EU commission perspective. So that is in principle the target to let the markets open and to have a clear price discovery process and the market driven solution.Ian WhiteGot it. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Tobias Lukesch from Kepler Cheuvreux.Tobias LukeschAnd it's good afternoon. Three questions from my side if I may as well. I wanted some costs in one on your performance in the potential recessionary environment. On the cross I mean on the 22 development I think now you have some leeway  especially compared to last year. And I was wondering now with the segments down to 4  could give us maybe a bit of an indication how costs will develop segmentalwise. Do you see one segment with especially stronger investment needs and the other one  well  are there some products where you think that this will be extended to overall view on the cost base. And secondly. you mentioned that if we have a more troubled economy  that also Deutsche Börse  of course would suffer. And then maybe could you point out the product lines which you would see most at risk at performing at the expected underlying levels. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  to be [Indiscernible] as we've got to the cost  obviously  it's good that we were able to show cost discipline in the first quarter where there's a 5% cost growth on a constant portfolio and constant ethics basis  I think that's a very clear thing now to you and to our investors that we will continue to do prudent cost management. Obviously  a strong development in Q1 would give us some leeway  and obviously that's obviously good if it has that kind of leverage. But you will see for the next nine months a prudent cost management from digital management here again. With regards to your second question  that's a little bit of speculation  but nevertheless  you cannot rule out that a consequence of this Russia - Ukraine war crisis could be potentially a recession. And so there are some scenarios of some 2% or even a little bit more reduction of GDP in Europe this year. So it's -- but it's more or less just a scenario planning. So it's not the base case scenario so far  but the best case scenario if still at 2% to 3% GDP growth  so here we are talking about some negative scenario. And then it really depends on what really happen  what is the reason for our potential recession. It's the reason that there's a shutdown of guests’ delivery out of Russia and so that most probably more industry and companies would be impacted by that. So -- and then there wouldn't be such a big impact on our side but there could be also a different scenario. So in principle  we just wanted to say  look  after the COVID development in 2020  so we had also a very strong Q1 and then we said  look  in the second half year  it could be potentially some cyclical headwind and unfortunately  we have seen that. So we just wanted to remind all of us if there would be a stronger recession  obviously market activity would be reduced and also less volatility so that we cannot rule out even if it's not our base case.Tobias LukeschYeah  thank you. So on the cross side  I take that there is no special investment need on the specific product line or set news but it's more across the board  right?Gregor PottmeyerNo  if we see interesting opportunities  then we would have the freedom to invest here. But -- so prudent cost management is important for Deutsche Börse.Tobias Lukesch[Indiscernible] Thank you.OperatorAnd next up is Johannes Thormann from high HSBC.Johannes ThormannGood afternoon  everybody. I'm Johannes from HSBC. Two questions from me. First of all  on Kneip  could you provide a bit more details how you really want to target the synergies you're promising in the fund services business? And secondly  would it be fair to say that the annualized revenue contribution is about €30 million for the next years? And secondly  on Axioma  if we look at the year-on-year decline in revenues  is this a fixed [Indiscernible]  which would surprise or what are the reasons for [Indiscernible]? It looks like the current business performance of Axioma completely different to the picture drawn by [Indiscernible] at the time of the deal. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah. You can address trends  but fair enough. And so tonight  annualized cost is more in the range of £22 million to €25 million so that's the number of EVP expect on an annualized basis for this year. So it's not 30 million you mentioned. But obviously this wasn't very strategic direction and efficient for us. So we always told you that we have two strong legs in the investment fund service business  so there's the settlement and the custody leg. Secondly  we have now the fund distribution leg with the acquisition of specifically UPF fund center and we missed the fund data leg. So obvious now a third leg and that's exactly what we need. Now  when we talk to customers so we can offer now the full range of the value chain as regard to the fund service business. And therefore we think there are we naturally by the range that we obviously create additional services for our customers. So we can definitely do hear some cross-selling  and so there should be very positive element out of that. If I got to your second question Axioma.Yes indeed  the performance is not as good as we have targeted when we made the acquisition. Sure there is some corona impact out of that. But more specifically in Q1  if you take that comparison with Q1 last year  then in Q1 last year we had a relatively high share of point in time revenue. So -- And therefore  on these IFS numbers  as you see here  another very strong performance. If you would go like what others do  more on an onewave perspective  and we are currently working on that model that we also show you some onewave expected for the for the next 12 months basically  then you would see double-digit growth on the Axioma side. Here it's not as good as [Indiscernible] because usually in the past there was a growth rate of 15%-20%  so currently we are not there. But the onewave concept would show a better performance that now the IFRS numbers.Johannes ThormannUnderstood  thank you.OperatorAnd now we have Benjamin Bathurst from RBC Capital Markets on the line.Benjamin BathurstAfternoon  all. Thanks for taking my question. Can I ask what was the proportion of overall group revenues from recurring sources in Q1. And there's a follow-up to that. Do you have any updated view on prospects for growing that proportion in 2020 versus 2021  just in light of the strong cyclical contribution to revenue growth in Q1?Gregor PottmeyerYeah  exactly. So the number is 52% recurring revenues. It's a little bit below the share we achieved last year  we were about 55%. And the reason for that is that we have now more equit -- last year we had cyclical headwinds and now we have one cyclical tailwind  and that's the reason why the nonrecurring elements are cyclical driven higher  but in principal  over the next 2 to 3 years. So our expectation is that the recurring revenue number will increase out of stronger performance. We already talked about ESG products and then data analytics what usually has higher growth space  so it should be [Indiscernible] compared to the non-recurring business. And secondly  also from an M&A perspective  we're more interested to invest in business ' recurring revenues. And so these are the reasons for our expectation that the recurring level will increase for the next year.Benjamin BathurstThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Harlan Tender from Auto PHS.Harlan TenderYes  good afternoon. Two questions from my side. First of all  I would like to come back to the commodities business. Could you elaborate here a little bit more on the risk management? Do you need actually state guarantees to run this business and did you model for extreme shocks and what would be the outcome in these scenarios? Secondly  you mentioned in the fund service business partnership as [Indiscernible] could you maybe detail a little bit business or market opportunity you're tipping here into? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. And this regards commodities  risk management. I think a little bit  are already elaborated on that side. So  we have obviously seen a strong increase of our margin  our collateral at our clearing house of the EX. So it wasn't the peak roughly €70 billion and it's none range more to €40 billion. And two or three years ago  was when the range of €5 billion. Then obviously  you have seen here  tremendous increase year to reflect that completely different market situation. But again  the good thing is that there were no surprises for the market participants. The risk models worked as designed. And there was -- and we didn't miss any margin calls here so far. So far  no need for any state guarantees  right. So the market was able to manage that.Obviously  we are also discussing some shock scenarios. So obviously -- and that's what we're also analyzing. But the outcome and the consequences really depends on the [Indiscernible] scenarios. But in principle  as mentioned earlier. And so  when we talked with the German government in search for this next item to [Indiscernible]  then we have a clear understanding that the markets should be opened as long as possible without a government interfering. So that is the basic idea. But nevertheless  we would be also prepared for different things.Segment pressed in around [Indiscernible] I think  yes  in principle there are different opportunities to grow our business. So customer can decide to purely connect to our platform  they can outsource of the business  they can sell the business  or they can do -- partner up with us. So as in FX decided to partner up with RCM and for us  it's a big opportunity to enter in the UK market  that we are currently not present  and so that we have a broader spectrum from a regional perspective  and so that it can attract more customers. So that's the main strategically to get together with FX.Benjamin BathurstOkay  thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Martin Price  from Jefferies.Martin PriceGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry to go back to this  but I just wanted to clarify my understanding of the M&A strategy in the fund services space specifically  just wasn't [Indiscernible] to your response on this question earlier  rolling out larger M&A was in relation to IFRS or IFS strike fund services. In short  so I just clarify  if you were to do a deal in the fund services space  your current thinking is that it would probably be in the one or two million euro range rather than anything larger. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  Martin  as already mentioned by Theodor  so there's no pressure from our side to do anything here so -- and throughout specifically in the fund services business. So usually you have seen our transactions we did here in the past though it was usually a €20 million  €30 million acquisition and depending on the portfolio side of the banks and even we do not announce all the deals we do here. Sometimes also customers are shy to be mentioned publicly here. But we have a long and strong customer pipeline where customers are interested to ride together with us. And again  sometimes they decide to purely connect to our platforms  they're doing a partnership  sometimes they want to outsource business or that we take over also their people and then streamlining the processes or some partners are interested to save the business rise. For all of these three options we are very open and we have a long customer path and in all of these three areas so there's no need from our perspective to do other deals here.Martin PriceUnderstood.

The corresponding amendment to the Articles of Association was entered in the Commercial Register Düsseldorf on April 14  2022. The share capital of the Company now amounts to EUR 2 013 000.00 and is divided into 2 013 000 no-par value bearer shares with a pro rata amount of the share capital of EUR 1.00 per no-par value share. The share capital and the number of shares were thus doubled by the capital increase. The shareholders of the company will receive one bonus share with an unchanged securities identification number (ISIN DE000A0LA304 / WKN A0LA30) free of charge for each no-par value share they hold. The bonus shares are entitled to dividend as of October 1  2021. Shareholders will receive their bonus shares by means of a credit to their securities account and do not need to take any further action. The last trading day before the technical implementation of the capital increase is April 26  2022. Stock exchange orders that have not yet been executed will expire at the end of this day. The shares of the Company will be listed ""ex-bonus shares"" as of April 27  2022. On April 28  2022 (the ""Record Date"")  the shareholders entitled to receive bonus shares will be identified. Shareholders who are holders of shares in the Company after the close of trading on that date will have one bonus share for each existing share automatically booked into their securities accounts by the custodian institutions and Clearstream Banking AG on April 29  2022. An expected consequence of the doubled number of shares in the Company is a corresponding adjustment of the stock exchange price. The Company expects the capital increase to make its shares even more attractive and to increase liquidity in stock exchange trading.

Welcome to the Deutsche Borse anaylst and investor conference call regarding the Q1 2022 results remote.Jan StreckerWelcome  ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for joining us today to go through our first-quarter 2022 results. With me are Theodor Weimer  Chief Executive Officer  and Gregor Pottmeyer  Chief Financial Officer. Theodor and Gregor will take you through the presentation. Afterwards  we will be happy to take your questions. The presentation materials for this call has been sent out via email and can also be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our website. As usual  the conference call will be recorded and is available for replay afterwards. With this  let me now hand over to you Theodor.Theodor WeimerThank you  Jan. Welcome ladies and gentlemen from my side  as well. Well  let's start today's call with a brief overview of the financial highlights and the key developments in the first quarter. Afterwards  Gregor  our CFO  will be presenting the financial results in greater detail. In contrast to last year  our regular secular growth achievements and a contribution from M and A have been complemented by strong cyclical tailwinds. This has contributed to our net revenue growth of 24% to a record quarterly level of more than £1 billion; 2  to the operating leverage of our business model the EBITDA even increased by 32% during the first quarter. Secular net revenue growth at 8%  both slightly above our guidance. This was particularly driven by product innovation in financial derivatives  an increase of market shares in commodities  the growing demand for ESG related products at ISS  and the continued trend towards outsourcing in the fund industry. M&A contributed another 5% net revenue growth.This was mainly driven by the contribution of the remaining 2 months of ISS  which we started to consolidate in March last year. We also continued to implement our M&A strategy and have closed the acquisition of [Indiscernible]  a leading fund data manager  in March this year. This will further strengthen our fund service business because we can now offer data management and regulatory reporting services to our existing client base. The strong cyclical tailwinds resulted from higher volatility in almost all asset losses  and accordingly  hedging needs of our clients increased significantly.This was very visible in commodities and equities  but fixed income and FX benefited as well. In total  cyclical net revenue growth amounted to 11%  which also includes the one-off effects from the REGIS-TR disposal  and some benefits from the stronger U.S. dollar. With a much more positive top-line development compared to last year  we slightly increased investments in growth and infrastructure.This is why other constant currency basis to organic operating costs increased by 5% in the quarter. But we also continued to increase productivity through our continuous improvement program. This helped offset most of the inflationary pressures. such as quite frankly  strong start to the year is very likely from today's perspective that we will exceed our full-year guidance. With that  let me now hand it over to you  GregorGregor PottmeyerThank you  Theodor. On Page 2  we showed the first quarter results of [Indiscernible] in detail. While cyclically boosted net revenue  we saw a nice improvement of the operating leverage and an organic earnings growth of 30%. The result from financial investments include around €17 million from our investment in the Illuminate fintech fund. This is driven by the market-to-market valuation of the fund and the partial disposal of our holding of the fund. In addition  the line item includes a gain of around €12 million from the sale of the [Indiscernible] stake in the U.S. derivatives exchange FairX to Coinbase. Depreciation includes a software impairment of around €6 million on the buying agent services that were developed at Eurex. This is the result of the decision by the European Commission to remove the buying application from the CFR regulation for an indefinite time. The financial result includes a one-off gain of around €4 million from an interest rate hedge. This is related to the senior bond we placed at the end of March. We secured an attractive interest rate level already in 2021 which reduces the effective yield of the bond to around 0.6%.The proceeds from the issue of the bond will be used to refinance the corporate bond maturing in October 2022. On Slide 3  we give you an overview of the quarterly results in the new segment reporting structure. We have simplified our reporting structure by reducing the number of segments from eight to four and applying a more product driven approach. The new segments are Data and Analytics  which comprises Contigo and ISS  Trading and Clearing  which is Eurex  EX  Xetra  and 360T  Fund Services  which is identical with Clearstream investment fund service business and Security Services  which consists of core equity and fixed income custody and settlement business of Clearstream. We have also simplified the net revenue line items within the segments  but you still will find most details disclosed in the appendix of this presentation.I'm now turning to the quarterly results of the segments  starting with data and analytics on Page 4. The segment performance was mainly driven by the continued out performance of ISS compared to our expectations. On an organic and constant currency basis  ISS 's net revenue increased by around 19%. The ESG business was mainly driven by higher double-digit growth in ESG analytics and corporate solutions.Governance solutions also performed well. The index business saw a mix of tailwinds from Eurex exchange licenses and some headwinds from market valuation in ETF licenses. Analytics saw some headwinds from slightly higher point in time net revenue in the same period last year. Let me turn to Slide 5 into Trading and Clearing segment. The overall segment clearly benefited from higher volatility and increased hedging needs  particularly in commodities and financial derivatives. Financial derivatives were driven by equity and equity index related derivatives with a 25% net revenue increase. Interest rate-related product also performed well.They include interest rate derivatives and the OTC clearing with an overall net revenue increase of 21%. The strongest [Indiscernible] in the segment was achieved by commodities. On the one hand  this was due to higher trading and hedging needs that we incurred. On the other hand  the margin fees continued to increase in the quarter amounted to €16 million. Since hedging was the main driver for trading activity in the quarter  net revenue in cash equities did not call quite as much as other parts of the segments  but still achieved a plus of 5%. Demand for our foreign exchange products including swaps and forwards was significantly higher compared to previous quarters  and net revenue increased by 18%. The Fund Services segments which you can find on page 6  continued its strong performance in the first quarter.Due to onboarding of new clients and portfolios  cyclical headwinds from market valuations in equities and bonds were over compensated. As a result  we exceeded our organic cost target of around 10% despite cyclical headwinds. To further complement the fund service of our we acquired Kneip at the end of March. Kneip is a leader in firm data management and reporting solutions for the asset management industry. The expectation is already closed and form the basis for creating a leading fund data up with significant cross-selling potential into our existing client base. In addition  we announced a partnership with a global wealth management platform  FNZ 2 weeks ago. Together  we will create a leading business intelligence solutions provider and help rollout fronts distribution services into FNZ  client basis in the UK. Our security services segment on slide 7 benefited from the divestiture of REGIS-TR.But also saw solid growth despite some market headwinds. The divestiture of Clearstream 50% stakes in REGIS-TR to ICBA CLIA resided in a one-off proceeds of around £49 million  and at the same time in a recurring decline of net revenue by around 5 million euro per quarter. Headwinds from lower equity market valuations and a slight decline of retail participation  they're overcompensated by solid leverage of fixed income issuance activity. The net interest income started to develop more positively and amounted to around £19 million. This is mainly because of increase in cash balances in the quarter. On [Indiscernible] we discontinued the cash handling fee on U.S. dollar balances after the first set rate hike in March.This means that the potential further hikes will directly translate in higher net interest income. The current sensitivity is an increase of short-term interest rate by a 100 basis points higher that'll expand the NII by around £90 million on an annualized basis. The last page of today's presentation shows our guidance for 2022 in the context of our midterm plan.Due to stronger-than-expected cyclical net revenue growth in the first quarter  we currently expect more than €3.8 billion of net revenue and more than €2.2 billion Europe EBITDA. Previously  we had only committed ourselves to achieving something around these values for both KPIs. Taking the first quarter into consideration and leaving our assumptions for the rest of the year unchanged  we would currently be looking at roughly €70 million of additional net revenue for the full-year.Since we are expecting the U.S. dollar to remain strong and since we continue to invest slightly more  the up side to the EBITDA guidance would be somewhat less than €70 million. But still  there are nine months to go in the year  though there could be both cyclical headwind  as well as tailwinds to the close  we [Indiscernible] expect. Headwind  could for instance arise from a recession in Europe as a result of the war in the Ukraine or [Indiscernible] line of volatility and volumes into the second half of the year  similar to the development in 2020. Tailwinds could arise if U.S. interest rate are increasing to 2% or more to go at year-end  which is current the market expectation. This concludes our presentation. We're now looking forward to your questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorLadies and gentlemen [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Andrew Coombs from Citi. Over to you.Andrew CoombsOpening. I did 3 questions [Indiscernible] I can do very short one and followed by the main question. The short factor one is  can you provide the AuA in Clearstream Fund Centre or the fund distribution AuA? That could be done in the appendix. I would appreciate figuring that. And then the main question is just on the NII sensitivity. You talked about the revised charging in March to now it should flow through  previous set between 25 basis points is $19 million. Does that still stand? And are there any offsets elsewhere? They could come Q3 to finance expense line or when anywhere out that we should be aware of. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerSure  Andrew. Thanks for your questions. AUA at Fund Center is roughly €400 billion with regard to the sensitivity of the NIR liberated that having currently roughly 9 billion customer cash balances in U.S. dollar. So a rate increased by 1% translates into €90 million. So that is a sensitivity. You can take for your model.Andrew CoombsI meant no offset to many other changes in pricing or you'd have any floating rate debt issued which is dollar sensitive  anything in those lines?Gregor PottmeyerNo. There is no compensating effect.Andrew CoombsPerfect. And just on follow-up on the first point  the 400  I think you said 400 now for the last three quarters  we've been in a negative mark-to-market impact on that fund [Indiscernible]Jan StreckerAnd -- well  that's the rough number  though  unfortunately  we don't have it readily available per month yet  we're working on that. So definitely as you can see from the revenues  there was a little bit of a headwind from equity and fixed income valuations but I think we've nicely offset this also through growth in terms of declined base and the funds that are covered.Andrew CoombsPerfect. Okay. Thank you.OperatorNext up is Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. Over to you.Haley TamAfternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about all the different components of secular growth but I guess I will pick just one  therefore  to ask about. If I can ask you about the ESG data  revenue growth  obviously it was very strong year-on-year but has been partly stable I think for the last three quarters. So I just wondered  can you help us understand how to think about this business? Is it like an annual subscription model that we should see the growth come through once a year or is there something else that's causing that stability? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes  Haley  thanks for the question. Obviously  ESG is one of the key cost driver for [Indiscernible] business today at 7% to 8% of the overall group's net revenue and it will continuously increase obviously over the next year. [Indiscernible] higher organic growth on that side. In the first quarter  it was roughly 30% on a constant portfolio basis  so that's obviously higher than in the other business areas  and we expect that this trend will continue to happen in the future. Secondly  we will continue to look for M&A in this area so that we also increase our bases here. So the singular drivers here are basically two components in ESG  it's our ISS business obviously; and secondly  it's also our EEX business what contributes a lot. So these are the two main drivers for this ESG cost.Haley TamThank you  Gregor. If I can clarify  in the ISS ESG data revenue line  I think it was about €50 million -- €51 million for the last three quarters. That's a stable number I should expect. And really  I should be looking at the EEX business for growth  is that the right interpretation?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. So as you're also focusing on the recurring elements or -- usually in that kind of business in ISS it's a returning revenue  and so that you should see sustainable and continued growth here with regard to EAX. Obviously there's also a trading component to what the conceited idea is  the [Indiscernible] with this. And then therefore we have a clear classification  and here we expect that this will also continue to grow on a secular basis. Today it's more than 40% of the increase over the next year  so there's a secular component. But definitely there's also a current -- a cyclical component as overall  there are also higher market volatility  but in principle it's more a secular trend.Haley TamThank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes from Arnaud Giblat from BnP Exane. The floor is yours.Arnaud GiblatYes. Good morning. Good afternoon. Sorry  very quick follow-up and my main question  if I may. The follow-up  the first is cash equity yields have come off a bit this quarter versus previous quarters. I'm just wondering what's going on in the mix since that's maybe a little the top participation that's making a bit. My second question is with regards to ISS mostly from distribution. Do you see a significant consolidation opportunity ahead? Could mean there's some logic transactions happening there. And more important  if there's any potential transaction into issues with the competition commission. I think we've been there before but how should we think about that in terms of market definition? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Arnaud  let me pick up the second question. The [Indiscernible] the consolidation on the ISS. I tend to be very clear and outspoken  right? There are no plans on our side to enter into any consolidation games which might arise at the fall or rise near because there's such a strong organic growth that we see no need and be. We feel comfortable with our acquisition which we have done  right? When we acquired. So let's be very clear here We feel extremely well with what we have acquired so far.Theodor WeimerAnd on cash equity and all  it's basically the product mix. What we've seen is a quite substantial decline actually in retail trading compared to the strong previous year  and retail trading typically has a higher fee margin or the product mix is changed  but nothing really structured.Arnaud GiblatThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.Benjamin GoyHi  good afternoon. Just wanted to check on your M&A higher power. Can you confirm where you're standing was  the upper target? And would that mean that we should expect more of the same  meaning this 200 million type acquisition here and day-out  or do you see there's more room to grow in organically? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerThanks  Benjamin. As we got through M&A of higher power  I think you're aware that we're a strong cash flow generating business. So on a yearly basis we roughly generate €1.5 billion in cash flow  so let's say €600 million for dividend  let's say €200 million for CapEx  so it remains roughly €700 million. So you can see that we generate very quickly on cash and therefore  on a higher power from a funding perspective  we see [Indiscernible] to do transactions we would like to do. From a rating perspective  we are also now back on track with regard to our debt levels. So obviously with this on Q1 and with this year expectation here so we will come back through the agreed on KPIs with the rating agents [Indiscernible]. So no reflections from a firepower perspective as we got to M&A. As we got through our M&A strategy  I think you are aware that roughly a €150 million are missing for our 2023 target so long favorite it's roughly €600 million what we contribute with the 5% M&A contribution over the four years  roughly €450 million was already have already delivered  so meeting a €150 million  and that's still potentially the level we definitely want to achieve  but currently there's no big pressure. So if we find an attractive target then obviously we can look at it and no pressure from that point of view.Benjamin Goy[Indiscernible]. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Mike Werner from UBS.Michael WernerThank you very much. Just a question on the -- within trading and clearing the revenues per contract or the revenues per volume within equities and interest rate derivatives. We saw volumes up quite strongly in both  and surprisingly  also we did see a bit of an uptake as well in the yields on those products year-on-year. I was just wondering -- usually  we tend to see the opposite  but I was just wondering what was going on in the next year. Thank you.Jan StreckerNo  Mike. At Eurex  typically  there are no significant volume rebates or aside from market making rebates  it's pretty much price list fees. But what we've seen and what also contributed to the secular growth in trading and clearing in Eurex  is basically new products and product innovations or MSCI derivatives  dividend derivatives  volatility derivatives  and so on  typically  are higher price  so they help to bring up the [Indiscernible] already for the last couple of quarters  at least modestly.Michael WernerThank you. And just perhaps a follow-up with regards to the interest rate derivatives. In terms of the over-the-counter business  I'm just curious to hear how that progressed in the over-the-counter clearing. How did that progress in Q1?Theodor WeimerExcept for the effect that we funded it'd now an interest rate derivative doesn't mean it has not performed well. It has indeed performed extremely well. It was the strongest quarter ever with close to €90 million of net revenue.Michael WernerThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.Bruce HamiltonHi  good afternoon  guys and congratulations on the numbers. Quick one  maybe on the M&A landscape and you've been quite clear  it sounds like on the ISS and your view that actually what you have there is growing very nicely  you no need to acquire  to further grow. So what are the nice  interesting areas as you assess the landscape today? And has that changed the total? It sounds like ESG would still be a big focus  perhaps data as well. So I'm just interested in what you're saying. And then just to confirm on the net EBITDA  what you're saying. If you are now at 1.75 times as at the end of Q1 will take so just I make sure I've answered it. Thank you.Theodor WeimerThank you  Bruce. From my side  let me firstly position our M&A strategy in the context of the current environment. First  you need to understand  right  if we are benefiting from strong tailwinds  then our operating model works perfectly  so our EBITDA margin goes up  right? Which is probably nice for you and for us both? On the other side  if you do M&A  there is a tendency that M&A has a negative effect on the EBITDA margin because it's very hard to find as profitable companies as we run our own company. And therefore  we run this smart balance of we want to keep the high margins  but also we want to grow our business smartly forward. But there is no need and no pressure from our side. We don't feel pressed in a situation like this where still the valuations are pretty high. We don't think we should let ourselves get in a position that we feel pressed by the markets whereby anybody out there that we should go eventually towards the M&A route.As a rule of thumb  until the year 2020  we have grown by M&A on average by 2% per year  2%. Our target is now in the range of 5%. What we have started in 2020 until 2023  we want to grow to 5% and we are actually exactly on the 5%  as Gregor and I pointed out during our first part of the presentation. So we feel we are pretty well underway  there have come great opportunities out there. We look at those and we have proven that we are in a position to do deals. We have done [Indiscernible] and of course  the key areas we are predominantly focused on the pre -trading and the funds areas. That's what we have done so far and definitely will continue. But again  we're in a pretty good track already and we are not pressed. We are rather focused on the good opportunities  to identify good opportunities. We are less constrained by the financial situation.Gregor PottmeyerAs we got to the financial  so what we agreed upon it's what you said  that the net-debt EBITDA is 1.75%  is our target  and the other KPI is FFO net-debt free funds from operation  that's 50%. And so these are the two KPIs we agreed upon to come back at the end of the year with the rating agencies.Bruce HamiltonGreat. Thank you very much.OperatorThe next step is Kyle Voigt from KBW.Kyle VoigtHi  thank you for taking my question. So in Clearstream  settlement activity was down 17% year-on-year  but cash balance has grown 13%. I'm wondering why you think there's such a divergence there. And does that imply that the balances may currently be slightly elevated as clients are parking cash here because they still have very few alternatives to get higher yields? And lastly  is it reasonable to assume that as rates continue to move higher  your clients may migrate some of those balances out of Clearstream for yield alternatives? Thank you.Jan StreckerYeah  Kyle. There's no direct immediate correlation. So indeed the cash balances are driven by settlement  but only by the ICSE settlements or the international settlement  not by the domestic ones. And therefore  the numbers might not quite match up. What we've seen last time around  so when interest rates went down  and when we introduced the cash handling fee  that balances actually went down. So our question remains whether this is now a sign that balances are even structurally increasing  that needs to be seen. So apparently clients borrowing a little bit more about an explicit charge and not sort of an implicit cost. So from that angle it's a little bit early to predict  but we definitely wouldn't believe they would go down substantially. So either they remain stable  driven by settlement activity  or maybe they even trend slightly upwards as we have seen in marginal.Kyle VoigtUnderstood. Thank you.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Philip Middleton from the Bank of America. Philip  your line is up now. We cannot hear you  maybe you're still on mute.Philip MiddletonYeah. You've booked some gains on your financial assets  basically on the venture portfolio. I know there was some disposals in there to which well-done but in general  this is a difficult quarter for venture investing. And how come you're like -- you sounds like you've experienced positive mark-to-market  what's going on there and how are you feeling about the next quarter or two in terms of valuation of these assets?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Thanks  Philip  for the questions. Obviously to make some prediction on a quarterly basis is a little bit difficult. So what we see is a continued increasing contribution out of our financial SSVP invested. And so since beginning of [Indiscernible] I joined here  one of this is path to professionals this year  and we have done very successful investments here over the last three years and we see the benefits now. And last year we told you that so far over the last few years  you haven't seen anything in our P&L because all of the gains are booked against our equity  and now we made for a certain investment  we changed it specifically for the new ones because if you had made the decision that -- three years ago that you're showing on an -- just into balance sheet on equity basis then you can change it. So it has to be done in the first time. And therefore  we decided now for different SFC acquired recently or what the last month that you see a fair value -- valuation in our P&L. And we have single investments  that we have to make a decision  and we have also some portfolio investments. And this was the case now in Q1. It was illuminate. So here is to invest more in the Fintech portfolio and not in a specific thing investment. And this is shown in our P&L. So it's the [Indiscernible] positive elements here. If they are disposals or even some [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] you see this in our P&L.And there are many others and now -- where you could see potential impact. And it really depends whether a transaction takes place  yes or no. So for instance  our 360X business and as the leadership of [Indiscernible]  we talked about non-financial FX building platforms  market infrastructure plays based on blockchain technology. If you would see here on transaction  here  you would also see then a P&L impact. Though the general message is  if we will continue to do successful investments here in that area  you will see continued positive contributions here in our P&L for that.Philip MiddletonOkay  thank you. But the overall environment still hasn't been [Indiscernible] helpful  so you did well in Q1 for idiosyncratic reasons?Gregor PottmeyerNo  there are obviously positive and negative elements and now as you have seen  Illuminate obviously there was a very positive element. There was another  it was participation in FairX what we hold at [Indiscernible]  what we have at [Indiscernible] made a transaction for various attractive pricing and therefore there's another $13 million U.S. positive impact here. So these were the two main drivers for Q1 but over the next quarter  it could be different elements that would contribute. It really depends on whether a transaction takes place  yes or no.Philip MiddletonOkay  thank you.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Ian White from Autonomous Research.Ian WhiteHi  afternoon. Thanks today. Thanks for the presentation. I had one follow-up and one potential question  please. The follow-up is trend; I think is the final comment you made around guidance that this year. And can I just clarify  please? I heard 17 million of additional net revenue versus the previous guidance  less than that on EBITDA. And assuming that U.S. rates go to 2% by year-end. And if I got that correct  please from which I have misunderstood on what you're saying there in terms of the assumptions on depending. There is a tweak  you've made to the guidance for FY22. And then my question really just tasks for a bit more detail on commodity trading. What do you think that in terms of the breadth of participation in counter-party growth in the first quarter? And could you say a bit about the challenges we're seeing in some energy markets around high collateral requirements for end-users and how you see that developing over the coming quarters  please. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. With regard to the questions with regard guidance  when I mentioned the €70 million  so that is the surplus we achieved in Q1 compared to our plan. And obviously  when the second comment you made  they had included a 2% Fed fund rate at the end of the year; obviously not  because I talked about €70 million in Q1. So if the Fed rate would go up to 2%  obviously  it would be additional upside potentially for what is not included so far. Your second question around the commodity business. Yes  obviously  was another 40% net revenue increase. High market activity here in power and in gas  strong increase in pricing  and yes indeed  there was a strong increase in our margins we asked for in our collateral. And the good thing is that there were no surprises for the market participants. So the model growth is designed and/or the market participants were able to deliver the collateral. But nevertheless  it's obviously a stress situation at some peak times at ECC  so our clearing house for power and for gas  we had €70 billion margin and it's now reduced to closer to €40 billion but even the €70 billion or the market participants they are able to deliver are definitely expressive duration. But we are in a good dialogue with all the market participants and so far  the [Indiscernible] and everybody is highly interested that this market solution will also continue to happen so that you have a reasonable pricing  that you have a reasonable allocation of gas and power supply  and this also was strongly supported by our German government but also from EU commission perspective. So that is in principle the target to let the markets open and to have a clear price discovery process and the market driven solution.Ian WhiteGot it. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Tobias Lukesch from Kepler Cheuvreux.Tobias LukeschAnd it's good afternoon. Three questions from my side if I may as well. I wanted some costs in one on your performance in the potential recessionary environment. On the cross I mean on the 22 development I think now you have some leeway  especially compared to last year. And I was wondering now with the segments down to 4  could give us maybe a bit of an indication how costs will develop segmentalwise. Do you see one segment with especially stronger investment needs and the other one  well  are there some products where you think that this will be extended to overall view on the cost base. And secondly. you mentioned that if we have a more troubled economy  that also Deutsche Börse  of course would suffer. And then maybe could you point out the product lines which you would see most at risk at performing at the expected underlying levels. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  to be [Indiscernible] as we've got to the cost  obviously  it's good that we were able to show cost discipline in the first quarter where there's a 5% cost growth on a constant portfolio and constant ethics basis  I think that's a very clear thing now to you and to our investors that we will continue to do prudent cost management. Obviously  a strong development in Q1 would give us some leeway  and obviously that's obviously good if it has that kind of leverage. But you will see for the next nine months a prudent cost management from digital management here again. With regards to your second question  that's a little bit of speculation  but nevertheless  you cannot rule out that a consequence of this Russia - Ukraine war crisis could be potentially a recession. And so there are some scenarios of some 2% or even a little bit more reduction of GDP in Europe this year. So it's -- but it's more or less just a scenario planning. So it's not the base case scenario so far  but the best case scenario if still at 2% to 3% GDP growth  so here we are talking about some negative scenario. And then it really depends on what really happen  what is the reason for our potential recession. It's the reason that there's a shutdown of guests’ delivery out of Russia and so that most probably more industry and companies would be impacted by that. So -- and then there wouldn't be such a big impact on our side but there could be also a different scenario. So in principle  we just wanted to say  look  after the COVID development in 2020  so we had also a very strong Q1 and then we said  look  in the second half year  it could be potentially some cyclical headwind and unfortunately  we have seen that. So we just wanted to remind all of us if there would be a stronger recession  obviously market activity would be reduced and also less volatility so that we cannot rule out even if it's not our base case.Tobias LukeschYeah  thank you. So on the cross side  I take that there is no special investment need on the specific product line or set news but it's more across the board  right?Gregor PottmeyerNo  if we see interesting opportunities  then we would have the freedom to invest here. But -- so prudent cost management is important for Deutsche Börse.Tobias Lukesch[Indiscernible] Thank you.OperatorAnd next up is Johannes Thormann from high HSBC.Johannes ThormannGood afternoon  everybody. I'm Johannes from HSBC. Two questions from me. First of all  on Kneip  could you provide a bit more details how you really want to target the synergies you're promising in the fund services business? And secondly  would it be fair to say that the annualized revenue contribution is about €30 million for the next years? And secondly  on Axioma  if we look at the year-on-year decline in revenues  is this a fixed [Indiscernible]  which would surprise or what are the reasons for [Indiscernible]? It looks like the current business performance of Axioma completely different to the picture drawn by [Indiscernible] at the time of the deal. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah. You can address trends  but fair enough. And so tonight  annualized cost is more in the range of £22 million to €25 million so that's the number of EVP expect on an annualized basis for this year. So it's not 30 million you mentioned. But obviously this wasn't very strategic direction and efficient for us. So we always told you that we have two strong legs in the investment fund service business  so there's the settlement and the custody leg. Secondly  we have now the fund distribution leg with the acquisition of specifically UPF fund center and we missed the fund data leg. So obvious now a third leg and that's exactly what we need. Now  when we talk to customers so we can offer now the full range of the value chain as regard to the fund service business. And therefore we think there are we naturally by the range that we obviously create additional services for our customers. So we can definitely do hear some cross-selling  and so there should be very positive element out of that. If I got to your second question Axioma.Yes indeed  the performance is not as good as we have targeted when we made the acquisition. Sure there is some corona impact out of that. But more specifically in Q1  if you take that comparison with Q1 last year  then in Q1 last year we had a relatively high share of point in time revenue. So -- And therefore  on these IFS numbers  as you see here  another very strong performance. If you would go like what others do  more on an onewave perspective  and we are currently working on that model that we also show you some onewave expected for the for the next 12 months basically  then you would see double-digit growth on the Axioma side. Here it's not as good as [Indiscernible] because usually in the past there was a growth rate of 15%-20%  so currently we are not there. But the onewave concept would show a better performance that now the IFRS numbers.Johannes ThormannUnderstood  thank you.OperatorAnd now we have Benjamin Bathurst from RBC Capital Markets on the line.Benjamin BathurstAfternoon  all. Thanks for taking my question. Can I ask what was the proportion of overall group revenues from recurring sources in Q1. And there's a follow-up to that. Do you have any updated view on prospects for growing that proportion in 2020 versus 2021  just in light of the strong cyclical contribution to revenue growth in Q1?Gregor PottmeyerYeah  exactly. So the number is 52% recurring revenues. It's a little bit below the share we achieved last year  we were about 55%. And the reason for that is that we have now more equit -- last year we had cyclical headwinds and now we have one cyclical tailwind  and that's the reason why the nonrecurring elements are cyclical driven higher  but in principal  over the next 2 to 3 years. So our expectation is that the recurring revenue number will increase out of stronger performance. We already talked about ESG products and then data analytics what usually has higher growth space  so it should be [Indiscernible] compared to the non-recurring business. And secondly  also from an M&A perspective  we're more interested to invest in business ' recurring revenues. And so these are the reasons for our expectation that the recurring level will increase for the next year.Benjamin BathurstThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Harlan Tender from Auto PHS.Harlan TenderYes  good afternoon. Two questions from my side. First of all  I would like to come back to the commodities business. Could you elaborate here a little bit more on the risk management? Do you need actually state guarantees to run this business and did you model for extreme shocks and what would be the outcome in these scenarios? Secondly  you mentioned in the fund service business partnership as [Indiscernible] could you maybe detail a little bit business or market opportunity you're tipping here into? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. And this regards commodities  risk management. I think a little bit  are already elaborated on that side. So  we have obviously seen a strong increase of our margin  our collateral at our clearing house of the EX. So it wasn't the peak roughly €70 billion and it's none range more to €40 billion. And two or three years ago  was when the range of €5 billion. Then obviously  you have seen here  tremendous increase year to reflect that completely different market situation. But again  the good thing is that there were no surprises for the market participants. The risk models worked as designed. And there was -- and we didn't miss any margin calls here so far. So far  no need for any state guarantees  right. So the market was able to manage that.Obviously  we are also discussing some shock scenarios. So obviously -- and that's what we're also analyzing. But the outcome and the consequences really depends on the [Indiscernible] scenarios. But in principle  as mentioned earlier. And so  when we talked with the German government in search for this next item to [Indiscernible]  then we have a clear understanding that the markets should be opened as long as possible without a government interfering. So that is the basic idea. But nevertheless  we would be also prepared for different things.Segment pressed in around [Indiscernible] I think  yes  in principle there are different opportunities to grow our business. So customer can decide to purely connect to our platform  they can outsource of the business  they can sell the business  or they can do -- partner up with us. So as in FX decided to partner up with RCM and for us  it's a big opportunity to enter in the UK market  that we are currently not present  and so that we have a broader spectrum from a regional perspective  and so that it can attract more customers. So that's the main strategically to get together with FX.Benjamin BathurstOkay  thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Martin Price  from Jefferies.Martin PriceGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry to go back to this  but I just wanted to clarify my understanding of the M&A strategy in the fund services space specifically  just wasn't [Indiscernible] to your response on this question earlier  rolling out larger M&A was in relation to IFRS or IFS strike fund services. In short  so I just clarify  if you were to do a deal in the fund services space  your current thinking is that it would probably be in the one or two million euro range rather than anything larger. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  Martin  as already mentioned by Theodor  so there's no pressure from our side to do anything here so -- and throughout specifically in the fund services business. So usually you have seen our transactions we did here in the past though it was usually a €20 million  €30 million acquisition and depending on the portfolio side of the banks and even we do not announce all the deals we do here. Sometimes also customers are shy to be mentioned publicly here. But we have a long and strong customer pipeline where customers are interested to ride together with us. And again  sometimes they decide to purely connect to our platforms  they're doing a partnership  sometimes they want to outsource business or that we take over also their people and then streamlining the processes or some partners are interested to save the business rise. For all of these three options we are very open and we have a long customer path and in all of these three areas so there's no need from our perspective to do other deals here.Martin PriceUnderstood. Thanks [Indiscernible] and thanks Gregor.Jan StreckerAll right. There are no further questions on the call. Thank you very much for your participation today.

(""Pharming"" or the ""Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has received a positive decision from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on a Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) submission for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) in patients from 1 year of age to less than 18 years of age. The Company also announces that the MHRA has granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation to leniolisib for the treatment of APDS.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.)A PIP is a development plan aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained to support the marketing authorization of a medicine in the pediatric population. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines in children require the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP  unless the medicine is exempt due to a deferral or waiver. The leniolisib PIP includes two planned global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS  the first in children ages 4-11 years and the second in children ages 1-6 years. The Company expects to initiate recruitment for this pediatric program for leniolisib during the second half of 2022.A PIM designation indicates that a medicinal product is a promising candidate for the MHRA's Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS)  which provides pre-market access to products that are intended for the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition and have the potential to address an unmet medical need.Story continuesAnurag Relan MD  Pharming's Chief Medical Officer  commented:""We are pleased to have received agreement of this PIP and the PIM designation from the MHRA  these represent important regulatory milestones as we continue to advance leniolisib for the treatment of APDS  a rare  often debilitating  and sometimes fatal condition. The agreed PIP and the PIM designation further support our confidence in the potential of leniolisib to address APDS  as they provide us with a pathway toward marketing authorization in the United Kingdom. Pharming looks forward to continuing to work with regulatory authorities globally to bring leniolisib to patients with this significant unmet medical need as expeditiously as possible.""Leniolisib  which has received Orphan Drug Designation in Europe  received the same designation from the US Food and Drug Administration on January 30  2018.As previously announced  Pharming plans to begin submitting global registration filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the US in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both a Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and a Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(NYSE: PFE) today reported positive Phase 2 pediatric data for their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15. Based …,"SAINT-HERBLAIN  France & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported positive Phase 2 pediatric data for their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15. Based on these new results  Valneva and Pfizer plan to proceed with inclusion of pediatric participants in their planned Phase 3 trial. The trial will evaluate VLA15 in adults and pediatric subjects 5 years of age and above and is expected to be initiated in the third quarter of 2022  subject to regulatory approval.The Phase 2 trial  VLA15-221  is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old). It compared the immunogenicity and safety of VLA15 after administration of two (at months 0 and 6) or three (at months 0  2 and 6) primary series doses in groups aged 5-11  12-17 and 18-65 years. In pediatric participants (5-17 years old) who received VLA15 in either the two-dose schedule (N=93) or three-dose schedule (N=97)  VLA15 was found to be more immunogenic than in adults with both vaccination schedules tested. These data build on the strong immunogenicity profile already reported for adult participants (18-65 years old) in February 20221. Like in adults  the immunogenicity and safety data support a three-dose primary vaccination schedule in pediatric participants in the Phase 3 study.The safety and tolerability profile observed in the 5- to 17-year age group was similar to the previously reported profile in adult participants. No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed.Valneva and Pfizer plan to submit these data for publication and presentation at a future scientific congress.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “Lyme disease affects all age groups  but with their affinity for being active outdoors  the pediatric population is at the greatest risk of Lyme disease. These first pediatric results are therefore extremely important and support the inclusion of pediatric participants in our planned Phase 3 trial. In partnership with Pfizer  we are excited to further investigate our VLA15 vaccine candidate  which will hopefully help protect both adults and children against Lyme disease.”Kathrin U. Jansen  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer  said: “The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens. These positive pediatric data mark an important step forward in the ongoing development of VLA15  and we are excited to continue working with Valneva to potentially help protect both adults and children from Lyme disease.”About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immunogenicity and safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 20172. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA153.About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 is a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old).585 healthy participants received VLA15 at two different immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=187]) or three doses of placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=208]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 µg  which was selected based on data generated in the two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout was performed one month after the primary vaccination series. A subset of participants will receive a booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 18 (booster phase) and will be followed for three additional years to monitor antibody persistence.VLA15 is tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study is being conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and has enrolled both volunteers with a cleared past infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks4. It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere. While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States5 and 130 000 people in Europe6. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more unspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system. The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens7.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

Qui…,--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wolters Kluwer:What: The tax world is a strange place. Did you know swimming pools  ransom payments  and candy bars could be tax deductible?Tax provisions can be very complex  and that complexity can lead to very unusual distinctions. Quite often a decision in a tax case in court creates a precedent that can survive for many years after. Questions such as “Can that expense be treated as an ordinary and necessary business expense?” and “Is that expense based on a prescription from a physician for a recognized medical condition?” can lead to unexpected outcomes.Why: When in doubt about the tax treatment of an item of income or expense  always check with your tax return preparer. The answers may often surprise you:Cosmetic surgery  while generally not deductible  may be deductible if a taxpayer can demonstrate the procedure increases their incomeWhile a general work uniform like a business suit is not deductible as a business expense  very specialized uniforms and tools  such as leather clothes  whips  or handcuffs belonging to a person who makes their living as a dominatrix may be deductibleA swimming pool would not normally be deductible  but a swimming pool prescribed by a doctor for a particular medical condition may be deductibleClarinet lessons for a child with an overbite may be deductible as a medical expenseFood for stray cats in a junk yard may be a deductible business expense for pest controlPaying ransom to a hacker may be a deductible business expense if a police report is filed and the incident is reported to the SECIn a few states  candy bars are taxable or not depending on whether they contain flourA petting zoo to entertain children of visiting clients may be a deductible business expenseAt least one state taxes blocks of ice but not ice cubesIn another state  an unsliced bagel is not taxed but when sliced  toasted  or smeared then it is taxedIn a third state  pumpkins for decorations are taxed but pumpkins for food are notFostering animals in conjunction with an IRS recognized charity may lead to a qualified charitable contribution for related expensesWho: Tax expert Mark Luscombe  JD  LL.M  CPA  Principal Federal Tax Analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting  is available to discuss unusual provisions in the tax law and the logic behind them.PLEASE NOTE: These materials are designed to provide accurate and authoritative information in regard to the subject matter covered.

It will also allow Quantum Genomics to reinforce and broaden their shareholding structure.Otium Capital  the family office of Pierre-Edouard Stérin  founder of SmartBox Group  committed to subscribe a minimum of €10 million to the Deal  with a maximum price of 2.8€ per share. This follows SmartBox Groups’ subscription of €4 million to the Company’s last capital increase in December 2020. Vatel Capital also agreed to subscribe between €2 and 2.5 million to the Deal.In parallel with the preparation in December 2021 of an exclusive licensing and production agreement with Quantum Genomics  the company Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries Julphar will subscribed simultaneously to a reserved capital increase of $2 million (in accordance with the 15th resolution of June 24  2021 Annual General Meeting)  independent from the Deal  at the same subscription price as the price set for the Deal. The shares issued have a mandatory lock-up period of one year. This represents an increased focus by Quantum Genomics and Julphar’s on their cooperation to market firibastat in the Middle East  Africa  some member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and Turkey.Story continuesJean-Philippe Milon  CEO of Quantum Genomics  commented:""By committing to subscribe to this deal  Otium Capital and Vatel Capital are demonstrating  alongside our partner Julphar  their trust in our corporate objectives and execution. We are delighted to be able to count on their support. Our ambition is to develop a portfolio of innovative products that bring hope to millions of patients worldwide suffering from diseases with unmet needs"".A Decisive Deal for a Value-Creating Project and the Market Launch of firibastat at the end of 2023The Company plans to use the proceeds from the Deal to finance: (i) the continued development of firibastat through to the first registration at the end of 2023 and (ii) the exploration of new therapeutic indications based on the BAPAI platform.The firibastat development program  which is currently in Phase III in difficult-to-treat and resistant hypertension  is running its course with the aim of a first registration at the end of 2023. With this objective  Quantum Genomics have focused their research activities on this first indication and set up a first-rate team to carry out this key step in their development  as illustrated by the recent appointment of Stéphane Cohen as Head of Global Operations.Therefore  despite the health restrictions and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic  the last patient for the FRESH randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study should be enrolled in the next few days  for results which will now be published by the end of October 2022. The study is taking place under the supervision of an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) and no serious adverse event liable to result in a change to the protocol has been reported.The Phase III REFRESH study kicked off in the first half of 2021 with the aim of demonstrating the three-month efficacy of firibastat after a single daily dose  as well as the long-term safety (six to twelve months). Based on the intermediate results of this study  expected for mid-2023  the application for marketing authorization of firibastat will be filed in the third quarter 2023  as planned.In the heart failure indication  following the results of QUORUM announced in August 2021  the search for a partner to support the next development activities is still ongoing  while the development plan is being finalized with the Regulatory Authorities.Quantum Genomics are therefore on their way to validating a new drug class based on an innovative mechanism  directly targeting the brain  to treat patients with cardiovascular disease who are poorly controlled or whose treatment has failed. To go even further and supplement its historical activities  Quantum Genomics now intends to explore new therapeutic fields based on the patented technology platform built around BAPAIs. Through this strategy  the company intends to leverage its development expertise to become a benchmark player in the formulation of innovative treatments addressing needs that are currently unmet.Based on its cash position of M€ 5.1 as of March 31  2021  subscription commitments received from institutional investors for minimum of M€ 12 and Julphar’s investment of M$ 2  Quantum Genomics has cash visibility until the end of the first quarter 2023.Main Terms of the DealThe Deal will take place with cancellation of the Company's existing shareholders' pre-emptive subscription right  with French and international institutional investors  as part of an offering of new shares (the ""New Shares"") to a category of persons within the meaning of Article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code  in accordance with the 16th resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders of Quantum Genomics held on June 24  2021 (the ""General Meeting"") and the decision made today by the CEO following authorization from the Board of Directors on April 25  2022.Subscription for the New Shares will include cancellation of the shareholders' pre-emptive subscription right and will be exclusively reserved for the following category of persons  as defined by the Board of Directors' decisions of April 25  2022 in accordance with the delegation from the General Meeting:""French and foreign investments firms and funds (including  but not limited to  any Innovation Fund  Venture Capital Fund or Local Investment Fund) (i) habitually investing or (ii) having invested over the last 60 months more than 1 million Euros in ""small caps"" (i.e. whose capitalization  when they are listed  does not exceed one billion Euros (€1 000 000 000)) linked to the biotechnologies or health sector  investing a unit amount of more than €100 000 (issue premium included).""The number of New Shares issued in the context of the Deal will be defined by decision of the CEO in accordance with the authorization given by the Board of Directors on April 25  2022.

However  the ongoing war  on top of the Covid-19 pandemic which continues to spread  is creating uncertainty.In this complex and changing environment  HighCo remains watchful of the potential impact on its brand and retailer clients  in particular the consequences of the sharp rise in commodities prices and in inflation.Given the performance reported in Q1 and the business growth outlook expected for Q2 (comparable to Q1 reported growth)  the Group has confirmed its guidance for 2022:Slight growth in gross profit (2021 gross profit: €76.52 M);A rise in adjusted operating margin (adjusted headline PBIT/gross profit) of 50 basis points (2021 adjusted operating margin: 20.3%).HIGHCO VENTURI STARTUP STUDIO: FIRST EQUITY INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECTS UNDER WAYHaving radically changed the way we do things  the Covid-19 crisis has accelerated the retail transformation. Brands and retailers face huge new challenges: the transformation of physical points of sale  strong growth in e-commerce  development of m-commerce and social media  and the emergence of Web3.Through its startup studio HighCo Venturi  HighCo continues to invest in innovation to support its clients in accelerating the retail transformation in two key areas: the shift towards digital promotions and the emergence of Web3 retail.Shifting towards digital promotionsIn an inflationary environment in which purchasing power is a key concern for consumers  promotions are central to the strategy of brands and retailers.Through its growth stage startups and a first equity investment  HighCo invests in creating solutions to:develop digital coupons  andprovide retailers with a technological platform for managing promotions.1) DEVELOPING DIGITAL COUPONSUniversal mobile discount coupons: HighCo Nifty continues its development with the aim of simplifying access to brand generosity. Developed in a first phase in pharmacy chains (6 000 pharmacies will be covered by the end of 2022)  this solution will next be rolled out to food retailers.Smart discount coupons: HighCo Coupon[AI] lets brands optimise their generosity strategy using the artificial intelligence of its decision-making and recommendation engines. Big-name brands such as Danone and Blédina use this solution to optimise the ROI of their relational programmes by industrialising campaign personalisation based on their first-party data.2) PROVIDING RETAILERS WITH TOOLS FOR MANAGING PROMOTIONSHighCo announces its equity investment in the launch of the very first SaaS centralised promotion management platform.In the context of the increasing use of promotions  retailers are faced with a growing need for automated management  campaign planning  regulatory compliance  and so forth. This situation is what led the startup RetailTech founded by Martin Rennert to develop its technological platform Unipromo for retailers. HighCo has invested €0.5 M in the first funding round  acquiring one-third of the share capital.Supporting the emergence of Web3 retailVirtual commerce may still be nascent  but HighCo is already guiding brands and retailers in their first steps towards Web3 through a comprehensive offering: creating a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)  buying lands in the metaverse  developing interfaces with e-commerce  and more.For example  HighCo has recently worked with the French department store chain Printemps to create its very first virtual and immersive shopping experience.

3637,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/buyout-firm-ripplewood-launches-amsterdam-spac-listing-979964,Buyout firm Ripplewood launches Amsterdam SPAC listing,By Lucy Raitano (Reuters) -   U.S. private equity firm Ripplewood said on Tuesday it was planning to list a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in Amsterdam in what will be this year&#039;s second listing of a blank cheque vehicle on the Dutch stock ex…,Ripplewood’s SPAC  named RA Special Acquisition Corporation  will seek to raise up to $225 million ahead of its market debut on April. 28.RA will focus on financial services targets in Europe and will have 24 months to clinch a deal. That window can be extended by six months if approved by a shareholder vote.Goldman Sachs is handling a two-day bookbuilding process which will conclude on Wednesday.SPACs are investment vehicles that raise money on stock markets to buy private businesses  providing an easy route for the target to go public without going through the more complex process of a traditional initial public offering (IPO).RA’s listing ranks as the second SPAC deal on Euronext Amsterdam this year after Luxembourg-based GP Bullhound Acquisition I SE went public in February raising 200 million euros from investors.The Euronext Amsterdam stock market is Europe’s biggest SPAC hub  with blank cheque firms including Dutch Star Companies TWO and Odyssey SPAC also recently finalising their deals.Meanwhile London has failed to attract as many SPAC deals in recent years despite adopting new listing rules to step up its SPAC pipeline  with only one listing finalised in November.Along with co-investors  Ripplewood owns 75% of Latvia’s Citadele Bank and is also the second largest shareholder in Egypt-based investment bank EFG Hermes  with an 11.7% stake according to Refinitiv data.In 1999 Ripplewood partnered with U.S private equity firm JC Flowers to acquire the predecessor bank of Shinsei after it went bankrupt in Japan’s late 1990s banking crisis.

The fall in sales in the second quarter was limited to €4.5 million compared to 2021. In this uncertain climate  the Group expects business to recover only slowly in the short term.In Russia  the Group is mainly focused on agricultural equipment. Given the need to minimize future impacts on food supply  EXEL Industries is maintaining as much of its activity as possible  in compliance with European rules and applying special vigilance.As a reminder  the Group’s sales in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine made up 4% of 2020–2021 sales.Second quarter 2021–2022 salesSales for the second quarter of the 2021-2022 fiscal year amounted to €247.5 million  up 2.0% compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year. At constant exchange rates and same scope  (+€3.7 million  mainly due to the rises of the US dollar and the GBP)  Group sales were down 3.3%. Two factors explain the fall: first  the introduction of a new ERP software in the gardening business led to delays in dispatching orders; second  the ongoing supply chain difficulties particularly in components again disrupted production this quarter  postponing some deliveries  notably in agricultural spraying.Story continuesThe scope effect is the result of two recently acquired businesses by the Group: the nautical activity was consolidated from September 30  2021 and contributed €3 million this quarter and €5.1 million in the half-year; GF Garden (Italy) has been consolidated into the garden division since February 15  2022 and generated €6 million this quarter.AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING  sales of €122.1 million  up €2.4 million (up 1.9%)The conflict in Ukraine boosted the prices not only of agricultural commodities (wheat  corn  rape  etc.) but also spare parts and components. Sales from agricultural spraying grew slightly in volumes with different trends seen in different markets. Europe has remained stable and in Australia the healthy tendency glimpsed in the first quarter continued. In contrast  North America was held back by a lack of spare parts and components. Again this quarter  production at all the Group’s plants was affected by shortages in supply chains for mechanical  hydraulic and electronic components resulting in severely late deliveries.SUGAR BEET HARVESTERS  sales of €21.5 million  a €4.7 million increase (up 28.2%)This quarter confirmed the healthy start made in the first quarter by this business  following on from a year of strong growth in 2020-2021. Sales of second-hand machines and spare parts are up  and price increases  as a consequence of the inflation of the prices of steel and components  were passed in all product families.LEISURE  sales of €38.2 million  down 17%The acquisitions of the nautical division on September 30  2021 (Wauquiez  Rhéa Marine  Tofinou) and of GF Garden on February 15  2022  resulted in a scope effect increasing sales for this activity by €9 million. At constant exchange rates and same scope  the garden business had a difficult quarter in a downward European market and was affected by significant delays caused by migrating the IT systems to SAP. At the same time  the pricing offer was adapted to compensate for the sharp rises in costs (logistics  commodities).INDUSTRY  sales of €65.7 million  a €5.5 million increase (up 9.3%)North America and China continue to drive growth in industrial spraying  in both volume and value terms (automotive and wood industry). The position is more difficult in Europe and the economic environment remains uncertain. In technical hoses  rising costs of commodity led to regular sales price rises  resulting in increased revenue for this business.OutlookAGRICULTURAL SPRAYINGAgricultural commodity prices are expected to remain at high levels  encouraging farmers to renew their machines.Commercial brands are adjusting their sales prices  to offset the steel and components costs increases and to try to limit the impact on margins.The order book is rising ahead of its 2020-2021 levels  but supply chain disruptions (components) persist and will continue to affect productivity and the pace of deliveries.Some orders are likely to be canceled as a result of the conflict in Ukraine.SUGAR BEET HARVESTERSStabilization of new machine sales expected in the fiscal year  despite canceled/delayed orders in Ukraine and Russia.Confirmation that the diversification into the Terra Variant range can act as a driver of growth into new regions.Sales of spare parts and used machines remain strong.LEISUREThe change of ERP software implemented in the second quarter (migration to SAP) should disturb less the dispatching of orders in the third quarter  with a gradual recovery in volumes over the third and fourth quarters. However  in this seasonal business  a portion of these delays will be difficult to recover.The new Easy-Mix composter  which has won a string of awards from different organizations  looks set to grow sales.After briefly stabilizing  commodity prices are rising-up again.The commercial and industrial restructuring of the nautical activity continues.INDUSTRYThe automotive market is difficult in all regions  with carmakers showing signs of a wait-and-see attitude.Asia and America should continue to support growth in other markets.Yves Belegaud  Chief Executive Officer of the EXEL Industries Group  said:“By being able to rely on its diversified businesses  the Group showed  in the second quarter  its resilience in an uncertain geopolitical context. Sales were slightly up on the second quarter 2020-2021  despite an unfavorable basis of comparison and the disruptions we are currently facing. The order book nonetheless remains strong  in an uncertain global environment but with very favorable agricultural commodity prices. EXEL Industries again showed its pricing power to cope with an even more inflationary environment.”Upcoming eventsMay 31  2022: 2021-2022 half-year resultsJuly 26  2022 after market closing: third quarter 2021-2022 salesAbout EXEL IndustriesEXEL Industries is a French family-owned group that designs  manufactures and markets capital equipment and provides associated services that enable its customers to improve efficiency and productivity or enhance their well-being while achieving their CSR objectives.Driven by an innovation strategy for 70 years  EXEL Industries has based its development on innovative ideas designed to offer customers unique  efficient  competitive and user-friendly products.Since its inception  the Group has recorded significant growth in each of its markets through both organic growth and corporate acquisitions  underpinned by a stable shareholder base guided by a long-term development strategy.EXEL Industries employs approximately 3 546 permanent employees spread across 27 countries and five continents.

(NYSE: PFE) today reported positive Phase 2 pediatric data for their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15. Based on these new results  Valneva and Pfizer plan to proceed with inclusion of pediatric participants in their planned Phase 3 trial. The trial will evaluate VLA15 in adults and pediatric subjects 5 years of age and above and is expected to be initiated in the third quarter of 2022  subject to regulatory approval.The Phase 2 trial  VLA15-221  is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old). It compared the immunogenicity and safety of VLA15 after administration of two (at months 0 and 6) or three (at months 0  2 and 6) primary series doses in groups aged 5-11  12-17 and 18-65 years. In pediatric participants (5-17 years old) who received VLA15 in either the two-dose schedule (N=93) or three-dose schedule (N=97)  VLA15 was found to be more immunogenic than in adults with both vaccination schedules tested. These data build on the strong immunogenicity profile already reported for adult participants (18-65 years old) in February 20221. Like in adults  the immunogenicity and safety data support a three-dose primary vaccination schedule in pediatric participants in the Phase 3 study.The safety and tolerability profile observed in the 5- to 17-year age group was similar to the previously reported profile in adult participants. No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed.Story continuesValneva and Pfizer plan to submit these data for publication and presentation at a future scientific congress.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “Lyme disease affects all age groups  but with their affinity for being active outdoors  the pediatric population is at the greatest risk of Lyme disease. These first pediatric results are therefore extremely important and support the inclusion of pediatric participants in our planned Phase 3 trial. In partnership with Pfizer  we are excited to further investigate our VLA15 vaccine candidate  which will hopefully help protect both adults and children against Lyme disease.”Kathrin U. Jansen  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer  said: “The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens. These positive pediatric data mark an important step forward in the ongoing development of VLA15  and we are excited to continue working with Valneva to potentially help protect both adults and children from Lyme disease.”About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immunogenicity and safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 20172. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA153.About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 is a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old).585 healthy participants received VLA15 at two different immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=187]) or three doses of placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=208]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 µg  which was selected based on data generated in the two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout was performed one month after the primary vaccination series. A subset of participants will receive a booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 18 (booster phase) and will be followed for three additional years to monitor antibody persistence.VLA15 is tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study is being conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and has enrolled both volunteers with a cleared past infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks4. It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere. While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States5 and 130 000 people in Europe6. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more unspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.

In France  we have finalized our store optimization plan in order to benefit from a world-class network that will enable us to offer our customers the best possible in-store experience. Despite a strong start to the quarter in APAC  the resurgence of Covid and the restrictions imposed have had a significant impact on our performance. Globally  we continued to successfully follow our One Journey strategic plan  implementing initiatives to further increase the desirability of our brands  planning tailored openings in Europe and Asia  and achieving continuous significant progress in our full price strategy. Looking ahead to the rest of the year  we are closely monitoring the health situation in APAC  and we restate our financial targets provided that the situation improves relatively quickly.”Story continues€m except %Unaudited figures Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Organicchange1 Reportedchange Sales by region France 78.6 93.7 +22.7% +19.1% EMEA 47.5 83.1 +72.9% +74.9% Americas 24.9 38.6 +44.5% +55.0% APAC 72.8 67.6 -13.9% -7.2% Sales by Brand Sandro 103.6 134.1 +25.9% +29.4% Maje 89.3 112.2 +22.1% +25.6% Other brands2 31.0 36.8 +21.0% +18.6% TOTAL 223.9 283.0 +23.7% +26.4%2022 FIRST QUARTER SALESConsolidated sales reached €283.0m in Q1 2022  up +26.4% compared to Q1 2021  including an organic increase of +23.7%5 (driven by like-for-like growth of +23.6% owing to strong local demand) and a positive currency impact of +2.7%. This performance  driven by our biggest brands Sandro and Maje  reflects an outstanding momentum in the Americas and EMEA  a progressive improvement over the quarter in France  and a good start in APAC then significantly impacted by very high Covid restrictions  notably in Hong-Kong and in Mainland China.Over the first three months of the year  the Group generated strong digital sales penetration of 25%; reaching +10 pp vs. the 2019 level (15%).In line with our One Journey strategic plan  we continued to make strong progress on our full price strategy  notably through our deliberate reduction of the promotional sales share  and managing to decrease the discount rate  both in B&M and digital  with -6.1 pp vs. Q1 2021.As planned  during this quarter  SMCP finalized its brick-and-mortar network optimization plan  with 17 net closures of points of sales (POS)  of which 13 in France (mainly small points of sales  in small cities) including the end of the Suite 341 format (7 closures over the quarter). In EMEA  SMCP recorded 3 POS net closures from consolidation (such as Sandro women and Sandro men becoming a unisex store) or relocation opportunities  partly offset by openings in Belgium or Estonia (new country for the Group). SMCP operated a stable network in the Americas and APAC.Sales breakdown by region and by brandIn France  sales are up +22.7% on an organic basis  reflecting a strong acceleration over the quarter. SMCP outperformed the market owing to a good start to our spring-summer collections; an outperformance mainly driven by like-for-like growth (+22.0%)  including a sharp reduction in the discount rate down -10 pp vs. 2021 and a finalization of our network optimization plan (-13 POS of which -7 Suite 341).In EMEA  Group sales grew +72.9% on an organic basis vs. 2021 and exceeding 2019 level for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic  owing to a significant acceleration over the quarter driven by local demand. This strong sales momentum  supported by an historical like-for-like growth of +100.0%  includes a -7pp decrease in the discount rate and a rather stable network base.Despite a good start to the quarter in APAC (successful Chinese New Year)  the recent Covid restrictions had a significant impact on sales  notably in Hong-Kong and in Mainland China (lockdowns and impact on mobility and traffic)  leading to a -13.9% decrease on an organic basis vs. 2021. This performance takes into account a high comparison base  especially in Mainland China. Compared to 2019  Mainland China sales were up +3.7% on an organic basis  improving growth compared to Q4 2021. The desirability of our brands remains strong in Asia  and especially in China. Over the quarter  digital penetration grew by +3 pp vs. last year  and the network base was stable.The Americas recorded a strong growth of +44.5% on an organic basis vs. 2021  outstanding momentum mainly driven by like-for-like growth (+41.7%)  including a new sharp reduction in discount rate down -14 pp vs. 2021 and a stable network base. The United States and Canada outperformed  driven by high demand across all our distribution channels. The region’s growth is also very strong vs. 2019 (+20% on an organic basis  of which +25% in the U.S).FINANCIAL OUTLOOKSMCP is closely monitoring the health context in APAC and the impact of the restrictions on the in-store traffic as well as on supply chain capabilities. The Group remains cautious as the situation in Mainland China can evolve rapidly and new cities could be impacted.SMCP confirms its financial guidance for 2022 provided that the health context in APAC improves fairly rapidly.As a reminder  for Full Year 2022  SMCP anticipates solid double-digit sales growth vs. 2021 and mid-single-digit sales growth vs. 2019. Regarding profitability  the Group expects an adjusted EBIT margin (as a % of sales) in line with 2021 in a context of significant inflation. SMCP thus anticipates a net debt leverage ratio of <2x at the end of 2022 (instead of end of 2023).A conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 9:00 a.m. (Paris time).Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSThe Group uses certain key financial and non-financial measures to analyze the performance of its business.

As part of our agile management of the crisis  we have decided to proactively negotiate with banks a temporary waiver on our debt covenant in order to increase our financial flexibility. In addition  we have also revised upward our planned asset divestment program to be achieved by the end of 2023.Further to these measures  the Board of Directors has also decided to propose to our next Shareholders’ meeting to exceptionally suspend dividend payment in 2022.Our full-year 2022 guidance for FORVIA (Faurecia + 11 months of consolidation of HELLA)  that we release today for the first time  is based on a cautious assumption for worldwide automotive production of 74.2 million vehicles  reflecting the current low visibility  and nevertheless demonstrates the strong resilience of FORVIA.We are more than ever convinced about the huge potential of profitable growth and value creation of FORVIA  accelerated by the acquisition of HELLA that enhances our advanced technology portfolio and generates significant synergies. We also strongly reaffirm our commitment to reduce indebtedness post-HELLA acquisition  taking all necessary measures to accelerate return to the planned deleveraging trajectory  even if the current context imposes some delay in 2022.”The Board of Directors  under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN  met on April 25 and  on this occasion  reviewed the present press release.“Operating income” presented as Faurecia’s main performance indicator is Operating income before amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.“Adjusted EBITDA” is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation  this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).“Debt covenant” is the ratio “Net financial debt at the end of the period” vs. “Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months”; it is tested twice every year  at June 30 and at December 31.All other definitions are explained at the end of this Press Release  under the section “Definitions of terms used in this document”.All figures related to worldwide or regional automotive production refer to the S&P Global Mobility (ex-IHS Markit) forecast dated April 2022 (vehicles segment in line with CAAM for China  i.e. excluding vehicles > 3.5t).GROUP SALESin €m Q1 2021 Currency effect Organic growth Scope effect (HELLA 2 months) Q1 2022 Reported change Group sales 4 005 129 46 1 143 5 322 +32.9% % last year’s sales +3.2% +1.1% +28.5% Worldwide auto. prod.* (m units) 19 721 -4.2% 18 885 Outperformance (bps) 530* Source: S&P Global Mobility (ex-IHS Markit) dated April 2022 (vehicles segment in line with CAAM for China)Sales in the quarter amounted to €5 322 million  up 32.9% on a reported basis.They included:A positive currency effect of €129 million representing 3.2% of last year’s sales  mainly due to the USD and CNY vs. the euroA scope effect of €1 143 million representing 28.5% of last year’s sales  due to the first two months of consolidation of HELLA (starting February 1  2022)On an organic basis  sales grew by 1.1% in the quarter. While January and February posted solid organic growth  March mainly reflected the disruptions in supply chain for European automakers  due to the war in Ukraine  but also initial effects from Covid-19 restrictions in some Chinese areas.On an organic basis  sales in March were down 6% at Group level: this included a drop of c. 20% in European sales  not fully offset by growth in all other regions (in China  organic growth in March remained in positive territory at +6%  well below that recorded in January and February).The 1.1% organic sales growth in the quarter is to be compared with a 4.2% drop in worldwide automotive production  i.e. an outperformance of 530bps.SALES BY BUSINESS GROUPin €m Seating Interiors Clean Mobility Clarion Electr.

The guidance released on February 21  2022 was a guidance for Faurecia standalone and didn’t include any effect from the consolidation of HELLA and any impact from the war in Ukraine or Covid-related restrictions in China that had not started yet at that time.INCREASED FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO GET THROUGH THE CURRENT UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT THANKS TO COVENANT RENEGOTIATION  EXCEPTIONAL SUSPENSION OF DIVIDEND PAYMENT IN 2022 AND UPGRADE OF ASSET DIVESTMENT PROGRAMOn January 31  2022  in line with the expected timeline  Faurecia closed the strategic and transformative acquisition of HELLA  creating the 7th largest automotive supplier in the world.Faurecia now holds 81.5% of HELLA  for which it paid a total price of €5.4 billion: €0.5 billion was paid in shares through a Faurecia’s capital increase reserved to the Hueck/Roepke Family pool (now holding 8.95% of Faurecia’s share capital) and €4.9 billion was paid in cash to other HELLA shareholders and to the Family pool for the part not paid in Faurecia shares.Unexpectedly  on February 24  2022  the war in Ukraine started  creating significant uncertainty on market conditions  mainly for the European automotive industry. Visibility on the duration and magnitude of this war’s impacts is currently low  both in terms of volumes and cost inflation.On top of this low visibility  the pandemic in China represents an additional risk on volumes in 2022.In this uncertain environment and to increase its financial flexibility  Faurecia has proactively renegotiated its debt covenant with banks. Banks were fully supportive of Faurecia’s strategy and deleveraging strategy and agreed that debt covenant will not be tested at June 30  2022 and will be of 3.75x at December 31  2022 (instead of 3.0x) before returning to 3.0x as from June 30  2023. This new temporary covenant limit of 3.75x at year-end has been tailored to offer enough headroom  even in the current uncertain environment.Further increasing financial flexibility is the decision taken by Faurecia to increase its asset divestment program from a target of €500 million of proceeds to be closed by end 2023 (as indicated in August 2021 when the HELLA acquisition was announced) to a target of €1 billion of proceeds to be closed by end 2023.Lastly  the Board of Directors  at its meeting held yesterday (April 25  2022)  decided to propose to the next Shareholders’ meeting to exceptionally suspend dividend payment in 2022 to further contribute to the increase in financial flexibility (instead of €1 per share as previously announced on February 21  2022).NEXT STEPS REGARDING THE REFINANCING OF THE ACQUISITION OF HELLA AND CONFIRMED DELEVERAGING STRATEGYAs regards the refinancing of the HELLA acquisition  given recent market conditions  Faurecia has decided not to launch a capital increase yet  waiting for more favorable conditions.As a reminder  the bridge-to-equity offers time headroom until mid-February 2023  while the bridge-to-bond offers even more headroom until mid-August 2023.This time headroom and the increase in financial flexibility gained through covenant renegotiation  suspended dividend and upgraded asset divestment program give comfort to Faurecia in order to wait for adequate market conditions and launch the next steps in the refinancing process of the acquisition of HELLA.Faurecia is strongly committed to deleverage its financial structure  post the acquisition of HELLA. Even if the unexpected current market conditions impose some delay on the short term vs. the initial plan  Faurecia confirms that it will take all necessary actions to return as soon as possible to its deleveraging trajectory.SAVE THE DATESThe annual Shareholders’ meeting will be held at Faurecia’s headquarters  in Nanterre  on June 1  2022 (instead of June 8  2022  as previously announced on February 21  2022). A press release will be issued shortly to give all relevant details about this meeting.Medium-term 2025 perspectives for FORVIA will be presented at a Capital Markets Day to be held early November 2022.Faurecia's Q1 2022 sales presentation is also available on the Faurecia website: www.faurecia.comA webcast will be held today at 08:00am (Paris time).

Cat Rock described Just Eat’s share price performance as ‘terrible’.Captain said: ‘Just Eat shareholders suffered this massive destruction of equity value despite the company growing by 97 per cent organically and maintaining clear market leadership across many of the world’s largest economies.’Just Eat said a boardroom shake-up would be ‘value destructive and destabilising’.,negative,0.04,0.45,0.51,negative,0.01,0.06,0.94,True,English,"['Activist investor Cat Rock capital', 'Eat', 'board', 'Dutch rival Takeaway.com', 'finance chief Brent Wissink', 'near-7 per cent stake', 'new finance boss', 'US-based fund manager', 'disappointing trading update', 'two profit warnings', 'clear market leadership', 'misleading profit forecasts', 'food delivery investment', 'second largest shareholder', 'share price performance', 'food delivery company', 'Cat Rock Capital', 'Just Eat Takeaway', 'Just Eat shares', 'founder Jitse Groen', '1 per cent', 'chief executive', 'takeaway business', 'full-year forecasts', 'second quarter', 'largest economies', 'delivery business', 'boardroom shake-up', 'complete loss', 'long-term critic', 'supervisory board', 'general meeting', 'apparent bow', 'potential sale', 'first quarter', 'lockdown-boosted numbers', 'last 12 months', 'managing partner', 'long-term success', '£9billion merger', 'Euronext exchange', 'massive destruction', 'US business', 'European business', 'activist investors', 'year drop', 'Alex Captain', 'equity value', 'fellow shareholders', 'Grubhub takeover', 'Eat shareholders', '97 per', 'attack', 'Bosses', '£13.5billion', 'trust', 'election', 'letter', 'vote', 'credibility', 'demands', 'announcement', 'growth', 'orders', 'firm', 'London', 'Amsterdam', 'world']",2022-04-25,2022-04-26,thisismoney.co.uk

We nonetheless expect FY 2022 adjusted EBIT to grow year-on-year in absolute terms  driven by higher volumes and positive price impact. We maintain our target of over 200 million euros Free Cash Flow.Q1 2022 KEY GROUP FINANCIAL FIGURESin million euros Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Group Net Sales 411.0 515.7 Change as reported +15.1% +25.5% Change on a comparative basis +20.9% +18.8% Change on a constant currency basis +25.6% +20.4% EBIT Margin 55.3% 19.0% Adjusted EBIT Margin 14.7% 19.8% EPS (in euros) 3.59 1.53 Adjusted EPS (in euros) 0.96 1.60 Free Cash Flow before acquisitions and disposals 36.0 (1.9) Net Cash Position 393.6 340.1Q1 2022 KEY HIGHLIGHTSTop-Line GrowthFirst Quarter 2022 Net Sales increased 20.4% at constant currencies and 18.8% on a comparative basis.Flame For Life was the main contributor to organic growth  with US Lighters contributing to 37% of the Group Net Sales growth on a comparative basis. The outstanding performance of Lighters’ Sell-in in the US (+29% growth) was fueled by the shipment of orders that could not be completed in Q4 2021 (approximately 17 pts of the growth)  and by significant distribution gains driven by strong commercial execution  the continued success of BIC EZ Reach Utility Pocket Lighter  and price impact (approximately 13 pts of the growth in total).Human Expression organic growth was notably driven by a solid Back-to-school Season in Brazil  where the Stationery market increased 72%3  driven by the coloring segment. We gained 0.5 pts of market share in value thanks to robust Point of Sales execution. The Core Stationery business performance in Europe and North America was notably driven by early Back-to-school orders (approximately 5 million euros impact on Q1 Net Sales).

Adjusted EBIT grew 68.3%  and adjusted EBIT margin was 19.8%  driven by strong Net Sales operating leverage (+6.3 pts)  which more than offset the increase in Freight and Distribution (-0.6 pts) and Brand Support (-1.0 pts). For the Full Year  and based on current market assumptions  total input cost inflation should weigh approximately 100 million euros on adjusted EBIT. This negative impact is expected to be more than offset by volume increase and and price adjustments.Cash FlowOperating Cash Flow reached 122.8 million euros  fueled by strong business performance. The -107.1 million euros change in Working Capital and others was driven by Trade and other Receivables (-49.3M€)  as a result of strong Net Sales growth  an increase in Inventory levels (- 84.9M€) due primarily to 2022 Back-to-school sell-in stock building to ensure supply to customers  and to a lesser extent  input cost inflation (Raw Material  Freight and Electricity).

BIC Soleil Escape  our new female razor offering a sensorial experience  and the disposable version of Us  our gender-neutral shaver  were among the key drivers of year-to-date Blade Excellence's performance in the US.E-commerceTotal e-commerce sales were driven by double digit growth from Omniretailers  offsetting the slowdown of Pure Players  on the back of a strong Q1 2021  which was driven by post-pandemic inventory replenishment. Sales in developing markets grew more than 50%  driven by a triple-digit growth in India  and a strong performance from retail customers in Brazil. Our shaver business saw a strong start to the year with over 50% of Net Sales growth  driven by North America.Revenue Growth ManagementAs we continued our focus to drive complexity reduction across our portfolio  we achieved a 10% SKU reduction in Q1 2022.

(""Pharming"" or the ""Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has received a positive decision from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on a Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) submission for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) in patients from 1 year of age to less than 18 years of age. The Company also announces that the MHRA has granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation to leniolisib for the treatment of APDS.A PIP is a development plan aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained to support the marketing authorization of a medicine in the pediatric population. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines in children require the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP  unless the medicine is exempt due to a deferral or waiver. The leniolisib PIP includes two planned global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS  the first in children ages 4-11 years and the second in children ages 1-6 years. The Company expects to initiate recruitment for this pediatric program for leniolisib during the second half of 2022.A PIM designation indicates that a medicinal product is a promising candidate for the MHRA's Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS)  which provides pre-market access to products that are intended for the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition and have the potential to address an unmet medical need.Anurag Relan MD  Pharming's Chief Medical Officer  commented:""We are pleased to have received agreement of this PIP and the PIM designation from the MHRA  these represent important regulatory milestones as we continue to advance leniolisib for the treatment of APDS  a rare  often debilitating  and sometimes fatal condition. The agreed PIP and the PIM designation further support our confidence in the potential of leniolisib to address APDS  as they provide us with a pathway toward marketing authorization in the United Kingdom. Pharming looks forward to continuing to work with regulatory authorities globally to bring leniolisib to patients with this significant unmet medical need as expeditiously as possible.""Leniolisib  which has received Orphan Drug Designation in Europe  received the same designation from the US Food and Drug Administration on January 30  2018.As previously announced  Pharming plans to begin submitting global registration filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the US in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both a Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and a Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

The company is finalizing its seed round of funding and plans to do a Series A round later this year.Both Mazzarese and Mulvihill formerly worked at FXCM  and Mazzarese was previously Citi’s head of foreign exchange margin sales in the Americas.Rysin co-founded FastMatch FX  an electronic trading venue in the spot foreign exchange market  in 2012.Euronext acquired 90% of the company in 2017 for $153 million  and Rysin became the chief technology officer of the combined company. Prior to launching FastMatch  Rysin was the CTO of Credit Suisse’s fixed income clearing corporation division and head of core electronic trading.“I share the notion that institutional clients entering crypto will require low-latency infrastructure  advanced order logic and deep liquidity in addition to a robust list of coins on offer ” he said in a statement. “While it is still very early for institutional clients joining crypto  we are building our exchange for the future and are excited to become a primary venue for digital assets.”Institutional clients are not used to trading on cloud-based or locally hosted technology with limited support  Mazzarese said. They require response times measured in microseconds and reliable trade confirmations.Rysin’s experience in building ultra-low latency exchanges for large financial institutions will allow Crossover Markets Group to come to the market with one of the fastest and most robust matching engines in crypto  he said.“Our decision to build our product from scratch allows us to use the most cutting-edge technology  rather than rely on legacy tech that could be 10 or 15 years old already ” Mazzarese said. “We believe this is truly our differentiator.”Get the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your inbox every evening.

Lastly  we successfully completed two important financings  including a large IPO that attracted a high-quality group of investors from the US  Europe  and across the world.

The increase was driven primarily by a EUR 8.2 million increase in employee costs  with full-time equivalent (FTE) employees increasing from 55 in 2020 to 76.9 in 2021. EUR 2.4 million of the employee cost increase can be attributed to additional FTEs while EUR 5.8 million can be attributed to share-based payment expense due to accelerated vesting of the Company’s Employee Investment Plan on the date of the Company’s IPO.Consulting services and other costs associated with research and development of the Company’s therapies increased by EUR 0.4 million vs. 2020. Activities to drive enrollment in the Company’s Up-LIFT pivotal trial and other clinical study related costs contributed to an increase of EUR 1.4 million vs. 2020. The Company also incurred an incremental EUR 0.4 million for marketing and market access activities in the US and Europe. The Company’s 2021 IPO and the incremental costs of operating as a public company added EUR 2.4 million not incurred in 2020. These costs include uncapitalized consulting and legal expenses relating to the IPO and assuring compliance with financial regulatory requirements.Operating Loss for the PeriodThe Company’s Operating Loss for the period increased by EUR 13 million  driven by the increase in Operating Expenses.Net Loss for the PeriodThe Company realized a Net Loss for the period of EUR 34.3 million vs. EUR 20 million in 2020. EUR 13.0 million of this increase can be attributed to the Operating Loss for the period. An additional EUR 1.2 million is due to an increase in the Company’s Net Finance Expense  driven primarily by an increase in Interest Expense.Cash PositionCash and cash equivalents increased by EUR 83 million vs. 2020. The year-end balance was EUR 89.4 million on December 31  2021 vs. EUR 6.4 million on December 31  2020.Net cash used in operating activities was EUR 19.9 million vs. EUR 12.9 million in 2020. The increase was driven by the increase in the Operating Loss for the period.The company invested EUR 2.3 million in assets in 2021  a EUR 2.2 million increase vs. 2020. The increase was driven primarily by IPO-related license fees paid and capitalized as intangible assets.The Company successfully raised EUR 110 million through investing activities in 2021. EUR 80 million was raised via the IPO on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Amsterdam  preceded by a pre-IPO convertible note financing of EUR 30 million. The cash generated was offset by capitalized IPO fees paid in the amount of EUR 4.6 million. Net cash generated from financing activities was EUR 105.3 million in 2021 vs. EUR 4.4 in 2020.Interest Bearing LoansThe decrease in Interest Bearing Loans from EUR 41.8 million in 2020 to EUR 11.5 million in 2021 was mainly attributable to the conversion of the Company’s preference A shares into ordinary shares immediately preceding the IPO.EquityThe positive Equity position of the Company as of December 31  2021 was EUR 82.7 million  an increase of EUR 114.8 million vs. December 31  2020. This increase resulted from the proceeds from the IPO (EUR 80 million)  the conversion of the convertible note into ordinary shares (EUR 31 million)  the conversion of preference A shares into ordinary shares (EUR 34 million) and the accelerated vesting of the Employee Investment Plan (EUR 8.5 million).

That window can be extended by six months if approved by a shareholder vote.Goldman Sachs is handling a two-day bookbuilding process which will conclude on Wednesday.SPACs are investment vehicles that raise money on stock markets to buy private businesses  providing an easy route for the target to go public without going through the more complex process of a traditional initial public offering (IPO).RA’s listing ranks as the second SPAC deal on Euronext Amsterdam this year after Luxembourg-based GP Bullhound Acquisition I SE went public in February raising 200 million euros from investors.The Euronext Amsterdam stock market is Europe’s biggest SPAC hub  with blank cheque firms including Dutch Star Companies TWO and Odyssey SPAC also recently finalising their deals.Meanwhile London has failed to attract as many SPAC deals in recent years despite adopting new listing rules to step up its SPAC pipeline  with only one listing finalised in November.Along with co-investors  Ripplewood owns 75% of Latvia’s Citadele Bank and is also the second largest shareholder in Egypt-based investment bank EFG Hermes  with an 11.7% stake according to Refinitiv data.In 1999 Ripplewood partnered with U.S private equity firm JC Flowers to acquire the predecessor bank of Shinsei after it went bankrupt in Japan’s late 1990s banking crisis. Shinsei went public in 2004.(Reporting by Lucy Raitano  editing by Pamela Barbaglia and David Evans),neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,negative,0.01,0.02,0.97,True,English,"['Amsterdam SPAC listing', 'Buyout firm', 'Ripplewood', 'Luxembourg-based GP Bullhound Acquisition I SE', 'U.S. private equity firm', 'U.S private equity firm', 'The Euronext Amsterdam stock market', 'traditional initial public offering', 'late 1990s banking crisis', 'special purpose acquisition company', 'Dutch stock exchange', 'blank cheque vehicle', 'financial services targets', 'blank cheque firms', 'Dutch Star Companies', 'two-day bookbuilding process', 'second largest shareholder', 'biggest SPAC hub', 'new listing rules', 'Egypt-based investment bank', 'many SPAC deals', 'second SPAC deal', 'private businesses', 'market debut', 'stock markets', 'second listing', 'shareholder vote', 'investment vehicles', 'complex process', 'Citadele Bank', 'predecessor bank', 'Odyssey SPAC', 'SPAC pipeline', 'Lucy Raitano', 'Goldman Sachs', 'easy route', '200 million euros', 'recent years', 'one listing', 'EFG Hermes', 'Refinitiv data', 'JC Flowers', 'Pamela Barbaglia', 'David Evans', 'six months', '24 months', 'Reuters', 'Ripplewood', 'Tuesday', 'April', 'Europe', 'window', 'Wednesday', 'SPACs', 'money', 'IPO', 'February', 'investors', 'London', 'November', 'Latvia', '11.7% stake', 'Shinsei', 'Japan']",2022-04-26,2022-04-26,kfgo.com

(""Pharming"" or the ""Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has received a positive decision from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on a Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) submission for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) in patients from 1 year of age to less than 18 years of age. The Company also announces that the MHRA has granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation to leniolisib for the treatment of APDS.A PIP is a development plan aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained to support the marketing authorization of a medicine in the pediatric population. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines in children require the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP  unless the medicine is exempt due to a deferral or waiver. The leniolisib PIP includes two planned global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS  the first in children ages 4-11 years and the second in children ages 1-6 years. The Company expects to initiate recruitment for this pediatric program for leniolisib during the second half of 2022.A PIM designation indicates that a medicinal product is a promising candidate for the MHRA's Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS)  which provides pre-market access to products that are intended for the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition and have the potential to address an unmet medical need.Anurag Relan MD  Pharming's Chief Medical Officer  commented:""We are pleased to have received agreement of this PIP and the PIM designation from the MHRA  these represent important regulatory milestones as we continue to advance leniolisib for the treatment of APDS  a rare  often debilitating  and sometimes fatal condition. The agreed PIP and the PIM designation further support our confidence in the potential of leniolisib to address APDS  as they provide us with a pathway toward marketing authorization in the United Kingdom. Pharming looks forward to continuing to work with regulatory authorities globally to bring leniolisib to patients with this significant unmet medical need as expeditiously as possible.""Leniolisib  which has received Orphan Drug Designation in Europe  received the same designation from the US Food and Drug Administration on January 30  2018.As previously announced  Pharming plans to begin submitting global registration filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the US in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both a Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and a Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

It will also allow Quantum Genomics to reinforce and broaden their shareholding structure.Otium Capital  the family office of Pierre-Edouard Stérin  founder of SmartBox Group  committed to subscribe a minimum of €10 million to the Deal  with a maximum price of 2.8€ per share. This follows SmartBox Groups' subscription of €4 million to the Company's last capital increase in December 2020. Vatel Capital also agreed to subscribe between €2 and 2.5 million to the Deal.In parallel with the preparation in December 2021 of an exclusive licensing and production agreement with Quantum Genomics  the company Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries Julphar will subscribed simultaneously to a reserved capital increase of $2 million (in accordance with the 15th resolution of June 24  2021 Annual General Meeting)  independent from the Deal  at the same subscription price as the price set for the Deal. The shares issued have a mandatory lock-up period of one year. This represents an increased focus by Quantum Genomics and Julphar's on their cooperation to market firibastat in the Middle East  Africa  some member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and Turkey.Jean-Philippe Milon  CEO of Quantum Genomics  commented:'By committing to subscribe to this deal  Otium Capital and Vatel Capital are demonstrating  alongside our partner Julphar  their trust in our corporate objectives and execution. We are delighted to be able to count on their support. Our ambition is to develop a portfolio of innovative products that bring hope to millions of patients worldwide suffering from diseases with unmet needs'.A Decisive Deal for a Value-Creating Project and the Market Launch of firibastat at the end of 2023The Company plans to use the proceeds from the Deal to finance: (i) the continued development of firibastat through to the first registration at the end of 2023 and (ii) the exploration of new therapeutic indications based on the BAPAI platform.The firibastat development program  which is currently in Phase III in difficult-to-treat and resistant hypertension  is running its course with the aim of a first registration at the end of 2023. With this objective  Quantum Genomics have focused their research activities on this first indication and set up a first-rate team to carry out this key step in their development  as illustrated by the recent appointment of Stéphane Cohen as Head of Global Operations.Therefore  despite the health restrictions and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic  the last patient for the FRESH randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study should be enrolled in the next few days  for results which will now be published by the end of October 2022. The study is taking place under the supervision of an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) and no serious adverse event liable to result in a change to the protocol has been reported.The Phase III REFRESH study kicked off in the first half of 2021 with the aim of demonstrating the three-month efficacy of firibastat after a single daily dose  as well as the long-term safety (six to twelve months).
