However  current train constraints mean the NBC is using alternate supply chain methods (trucking) as its path to the market.Ubuntu Colliery – 48.9% equity interestThe improved result achieved in the March quarter for Ubuntu was in line with expectations of increased production. Compared to the December 2021 quarter  the colliery recorded improved coal sales of 163 000 t (85%).South Africa financial performanceOperating EBITDA for the South African operations for the nine months to 31 March 2022 was AUS$84.3 million  of AUS$16.6/t.Year-to-date  contracted domestic offtake quantities have been delivered to Eskom on a combined basis.CorporateBoard and management changesThe following board and management changes occurred during the March quarter:In January 2022  the company welcomed Non-Executive Directors  Graeme Campbell and Mark Lochtenberg  to the Board.Megan Etcell was appointed Chief Financial Officer after holding the position of Interim Chief Financial Officer since October 2021.Coal sales outlookAustraliaBA coal is fully sold until end July 2022.For the June 2022 quarter  BA is forecast to deliver eight cargoes  equating to approximately 650 00 t. Of these cargoes  six are currently index linked  and two are contracted at a fixed price of US$300/t 5500 NAR basis.The main markets BA sells coal to are:Japanese and South Korean energy markets. Indian sponge iron market – being the process of direct reduction of iron ore into iron by an elemental carbon produced from thermal coal.South AfricaExport salesNotwithstanding the continued export supply chain constraints  the company continues to manage its plans to increase its South African export sales from both NBC and NCC. These plans include hauling coal by truck to the port which  given current strong seaborne pricing  are expected to favourable contribute to the overall EBITDA position.Similar to BA  the export coal produced in South Africa is sold to both energy markets and non-energy markets (e.g. sponge iron). This provides significant flexibility when marketing the product and should allow the company to capitalise on numerous opportunities as the export strategy continues to evolve.Domestic salesDemand levels for Eskom have stabilised and the company is forecasting that the South African operation should deliver cumulative contracted quantities for the remainder of the financial year ending 30 June 2022.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.49,0.16,0.35,True,English,"['quarterly activities report', 'TerraCom', 'lost time injury frequency rate', 'total recordable injury frequency rate', 'South African business unit', 'alternate supply chain methods', 'exceptional seaborne coal pricing', 'South Africa business unit', 'The South African operations', 'operating (EBITDA) cash margin', 'strong export coal prices', 'Total managed coal sales', 'record export coal prices', 'South Africa financial performance', 'combined operating EBITDA result', 'strong operating EBITDA results', 'Australia Business Unit BA', 'US$60 million prepayment facility', 'supply chain issues', 'prior corresponding period', 'North Block Complex', 'current train constraints', 'domestic offtake quantities', 'total coal sales', 'strong final quarter', 'solid operational performance', 'Export coal sales', 'emerging resources company', 'Operational plant yield', 'New Clydesdale Colliery', 'strong March quarter', 'equity coal sales', 'ROM coal production', 'Australian financial performance', 'operational cost management', '354 000 t domestic sales', '229 000 t export sales', 'revenue linked costs', 'March quarter result', 'March quarter 583 000 t', 'Highlights Record', 'initial US$', 'total principal', 'operating assets', '5.6 million tpy', 'financial perspective', 'Safety performance', '3Q financial', 'overall yield', 'operational highlights', '2.3 million t', '49% equity stake', '2022 financial year', 'December 2021 quarter', 'Decemeber 2021 quarter', 'TerraCom Ltd', 'large portfolio', 'Executive Chairman', 'Craig Ransley', 'Blair Athol', 'end July', 'Euroclear Bond', 'significant growth', 'excessive rainfall', '100% equity interest', 'acceptable level', 'government royalties', '49% equity interest', 'greater proportion', '48.9% equity interest', 'special interest', 'ongoing focus', 'quarterly report', 'nine months', 'date result', 'Ubuntu Colliery', '31 March', '264 000 t', '228 000 t', '48 000 t', '163 000 t', '3 months', '9 months', 'group', 'track', 'April', 'bondholders', 'fees', 'repayments', 'part', 'market', '28 February', 'receipt', 'COVID', 'improvement', 'royalty', 'tonne', 'increase', 'FY21', 'NCC', 'site', 'NBC', 'improved', 'trucking', 'path', 'line', 'expectations', '612 000']",2022-04-26,2022-04-27,worldcoal.com

Welcome to the Deutsche Borse anaylst and investor conference call regarding the Q1 2022 results remote.Jan StreckerWelcome  ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for joining us today to go through our first-quarter 2022 results. With me are Theodor Weimer  Chief Executive Officer  and Gregor Pottmeyer  Chief Financial Officer. Theodor and Gregor will take you through the presentation. Afterwards  we will be happy to take your questions. The presentation materials for this call has been sent out via email and can also be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our website. As usual  the conference call will be recorded and is available for replay afterwards. With this  let me now hand over to you Theodor.Theodor WeimerThank you  Jan. Welcome ladies and gentlemen from my side  as well. Well  let's start today's call with a brief overview of the financial highlights and the key developments in the first quarter. Afterwards  Gregor  our CFO  will be presenting the financial results in greater detail. In contrast to last year  our regular secular growth achievements and a contribution from M and A have been complemented by strong cyclical tailwinds. This has contributed to our net revenue growth of 24% to a record quarterly level of more than £1 billion; 2  to the operating leverage of our business model the EBITDA even increased by 32% during the first quarter. Secular net revenue growth at 8%  both slightly above our guidance. This was particularly driven by product innovation in financial derivatives  an increase of market shares in commodities  the growing demand for ESG related products at ISS  and the continued trend towards outsourcing in the fund industry. M&A contributed another 5% net revenue growth.This was mainly driven by the contribution of the remaining 2 months of ISS  which we started to consolidate in March last year. We also continued to implement our M&A strategy and have closed the acquisition of [Indiscernible]  a leading fund data manager  in March this year. This will further strengthen our fund service business because we can now offer data management and regulatory reporting services to our existing client base. The strong cyclical tailwinds resulted from higher volatility in almost all asset losses  and accordingly  hedging needs of our clients increased significantly.This was very visible in commodities and equities  but fixed income and FX benefited as well. In total  cyclical net revenue growth amounted to 11%  which also includes the one-off effects from the REGIS-TR disposal  and some benefits from the stronger U.S. dollar. With a much more positive top-line development compared to last year  we slightly increased investments in growth and infrastructure.This is why other constant currency basis to organic operating costs increased by 5% in the quarter. But we also continued to increase productivity through our continuous improvement program. This helped offset most of the inflationary pressures. such as quite frankly  strong start to the year is very likely from today's perspective that we will exceed our full-year guidance. With that  let me now hand it over to you  GregorGregor PottmeyerThank you  Theodor. On Page 2  we showed the first quarter results of [Indiscernible] in detail. While cyclically boosted net revenue  we saw a nice improvement of the operating leverage and an organic earnings growth of 30%. The result from financial investments include around €17 million from our investment in the Illuminate fintech fund. This is driven by the market-to-market valuation of the fund and the partial disposal of our holding of the fund. In addition  the line item includes a gain of around €12 million from the sale of the [Indiscernible] stake in the U.S. derivatives exchange FairX to Coinbase. Depreciation includes a software impairment of around €6 million on the buying agent services that were developed at Eurex. This is the result of the decision by the European Commission to remove the buying application from the CFR regulation for an indefinite time. The financial result includes a one-off gain of around €4 million from an interest rate hedge. This is related to the senior bond we placed at the end of March. We secured an attractive interest rate level already in 2021 which reduces the effective yield of the bond to around 0.6%.The proceeds from the issue of the bond will be used to refinance the corporate bond maturing in October 2022. On Slide 3  we give you an overview of the quarterly results in the new segment reporting structure. We have simplified our reporting structure by reducing the number of segments from eight to four and applying a more product driven approach. The new segments are Data and Analytics  which comprises Contigo and ISS  Trading and Clearing  which is Eurex  EX  Xetra  and 360T  Fund Services  which is identical with Clearstream investment fund service business and Security Services  which consists of core equity and fixed income custody and settlement business of Clearstream. We have also simplified the net revenue line items within the segments  but you still will find most details disclosed in the appendix of this presentation.I'm now turning to the quarterly results of the segments  starting with data and analytics on Page 4. The segment performance was mainly driven by the continued out performance of ISS compared to our expectations. On an organic and constant currency basis  ISS 's net revenue increased by around 19%. The ESG business was mainly driven by higher double-digit growth in ESG analytics and corporate solutions.Governance solutions also performed well. The index business saw a mix of tailwinds from Eurex exchange licenses and some headwinds from market valuation in ETF licenses. Analytics saw some headwinds from slightly higher point in time net revenue in the same period last year. Let me turn to Slide 5 into Trading and Clearing segment. The overall segment clearly benefited from higher volatility and increased hedging needs  particularly in commodities and financial derivatives. Financial derivatives were driven by equity and equity index related derivatives with a 25% net revenue increase. Interest rate-related product also performed well.They include interest rate derivatives and the OTC clearing with an overall net revenue increase of 21%. The strongest [Indiscernible] in the segment was achieved by commodities. On the one hand  this was due to higher trading and hedging needs that we incurred. On the other hand  the margin fees continued to increase in the quarter amounted to €16 million. Since hedging was the main driver for trading activity in the quarter  net revenue in cash equities did not call quite as much as other parts of the segments  but still achieved a plus of 5%. Demand for our foreign exchange products including swaps and forwards was significantly higher compared to previous quarters  and net revenue increased by 18%. The Fund Services segments which you can find on page 6  continued its strong performance in the first quarter.Due to onboarding of new clients and portfolios  cyclical headwinds from market valuations in equities and bonds were over compensated. As a result  we exceeded our organic cost target of around 10% despite cyclical headwinds. To further complement the fund service of our we acquired Kneip at the end of March. Kneip is a leader in firm data management and reporting solutions for the asset management industry. The expectation is already closed and form the basis for creating a leading fund data up with significant cross-selling potential into our existing client base. In addition  we announced a partnership with a global wealth management platform  FNZ 2 weeks ago. Together  we will create a leading business intelligence solutions provider and help rollout fronts distribution services into FNZ  client basis in the UK. Our security services segment on slide 7 benefited from the divestiture of REGIS-TR.But also saw solid growth despite some market headwinds. The divestiture of Clearstream 50% stakes in REGIS-TR to ICBA CLIA resided in a one-off proceeds of around £49 million  and at the same time in a recurring decline of net revenue by around 5 million euro per quarter. Headwinds from lower equity market valuations and a slight decline of retail participation  they're overcompensated by solid leverage of fixed income issuance activity. The net interest income started to develop more positively and amounted to around £19 million. This is mainly because of increase in cash balances in the quarter. On [Indiscernible] we discontinued the cash handling fee on U.S. dollar balances after the first set rate hike in March.This means that the potential further hikes will directly translate in higher net interest income. The current sensitivity is an increase of short-term interest rate by a 100 basis points higher that'll expand the NII by around £90 million on an annualized basis. The last page of today's presentation shows our guidance for 2022 in the context of our midterm plan.Due to stronger-than-expected cyclical net revenue growth in the first quarter  we currently expect more than €3.8 billion of net revenue and more than €2.2 billion Europe EBITDA. Previously  we had only committed ourselves to achieving something around these values for both KPIs. Taking the first quarter into consideration and leaving our assumptions for the rest of the year unchanged  we would currently be looking at roughly €70 million of additional net revenue for the full-year.Since we are expecting the U.S. dollar to remain strong and since we continue to invest slightly more  the up side to the EBITDA guidance would be somewhat less than €70 million. But still  there are nine months to go in the year  though there could be both cyclical headwind  as well as tailwinds to the close  we [Indiscernible] expect. Headwind  could for instance arise from a recession in Europe as a result of the war in the Ukraine or [Indiscernible] line of volatility and volumes into the second half of the year  similar to the development in 2020. Tailwinds could arise if U.S. interest rate are increasing to 2% or more to go at year-end  which is current the market expectation. This concludes our presentation. We're now looking forward to your questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorLadies and gentlemen [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Andrew Coombs from Citi. Over to you.Andrew CoombsOpening. I did 3 questions [Indiscernible] I can do very short one and followed by the main question. The short factor one is  can you provide the AuA in Clearstream Fund Centre or the fund distribution AuA? That could be done in the appendix. I would appreciate figuring that. And then the main question is just on the NII sensitivity. You talked about the revised charging in March to now it should flow through  previous set between 25 basis points is $19 million. Does that still stand? And are there any offsets elsewhere? They could come Q3 to finance expense line or when anywhere out that we should be aware of. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerSure  Andrew. Thanks for your questions. AUA at Fund Center is roughly €400 billion with regard to the sensitivity of the NIR liberated that having currently roughly 9 billion customer cash balances in U.S. dollar. So a rate increased by 1% translates into €90 million. So that is a sensitivity. You can take for your model.Andrew CoombsI meant no offset to many other changes in pricing or you'd have any floating rate debt issued which is dollar sensitive  anything in those lines?Gregor PottmeyerNo. There is no compensating effect.Andrew CoombsPerfect. And just on follow-up on the first point  the 400  I think you said 400 now for the last three quarters  we've been in a negative mark-to-market impact on that fund [Indiscernible]Jan StreckerAnd -- well  that's the rough number  though  unfortunately  we don't have it readily available per month yet  we're working on that. So definitely as you can see from the revenues  there was a little bit of a headwind from equity and fixed income valuations but I think we've nicely offset this also through growth in terms of declined base and the funds that are covered.Andrew CoombsPerfect. Okay. Thank you.OperatorNext up is Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. Over to you.Haley TamAfternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about all the different components of secular growth but I guess I will pick just one  therefore  to ask about. If I can ask you about the ESG data  revenue growth  obviously it was very strong year-on-year but has been partly stable I think for the last three quarters. So I just wondered  can you help us understand how to think about this business? Is it like an annual subscription model that we should see the growth come through once a year or is there something else that's causing that stability? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes  Haley  thanks for the question. Obviously  ESG is one of the key cost driver for [Indiscernible] business today at 7% to 8% of the overall group's net revenue and it will continuously increase obviously over the next year. [Indiscernible] higher organic growth on that side. In the first quarter  it was roughly 30% on a constant portfolio basis  so that's obviously higher than in the other business areas  and we expect that this trend will continue to happen in the future. Secondly  we will continue to look for M&A in this area so that we also increase our bases here. So the singular drivers here are basically two components in ESG  it's our ISS business obviously; and secondly  it's also our EEX business what contributes a lot. So these are the two main drivers for this ESG cost.Haley TamThank you  Gregor. If I can clarify  in the ISS ESG data revenue line  I think it was about €50 million -- €51 million for the last three quarters. That's a stable number I should expect. And really  I should be looking at the EEX business for growth  is that the right interpretation?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. So as you're also focusing on the recurring elements or -- usually in that kind of business in ISS it's a returning revenue  and so that you should see sustainable and continued growth here with regard to EAX. Obviously there's also a trading component to what the conceited idea is  the [Indiscernible] with this. And then therefore we have a clear classification  and here we expect that this will also continue to grow on a secular basis. Today it's more than 40% of the increase over the next year  so there's a secular component. But definitely there's also a current -- a cyclical component as overall  there are also higher market volatility  but in principle it's more a secular trend.Haley TamThank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes from Arnaud Giblat from BnP Exane. The floor is yours.Arnaud GiblatYes. Good morning. Good afternoon. Sorry  very quick follow-up and my main question  if I may. The follow-up  the first is cash equity yields have come off a bit this quarter versus previous quarters. I'm just wondering what's going on in the mix since that's maybe a little the top participation that's making a bit. My second question is with regards to ISS mostly from distribution. Do you see a significant consolidation opportunity ahead? Could mean there's some logic transactions happening there. And more important  if there's any potential transaction into issues with the competition commission. I think we've been there before but how should we think about that in terms of market definition? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Arnaud  let me pick up the second question. The [Indiscernible] the consolidation on the ISS. I tend to be very clear and outspoken  right? There are no plans on our side to enter into any consolidation games which might arise at the fall or rise near because there's such a strong organic growth that we see no need and be. We feel comfortable with our acquisition which we have done  right? When we acquired. So let's be very clear here We feel extremely well with what we have acquired so far.Theodor WeimerAnd on cash equity and all  it's basically the product mix. What we've seen is a quite substantial decline actually in retail trading compared to the strong previous year  and retail trading typically has a higher fee margin or the product mix is changed  but nothing really structured.Arnaud GiblatThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.Benjamin GoyHi  good afternoon. Just wanted to check on your M&A higher power. Can you confirm where you're standing was  the upper target? And would that mean that we should expect more of the same  meaning this 200 million type acquisition here and day-out  or do you see there's more room to grow in organically? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerThanks  Benjamin. As we got through M&A of higher power  I think you're aware that we're a strong cash flow generating business. So on a yearly basis we roughly generate €1.5 billion in cash flow  so let's say €600 million for dividend  let's say €200 million for CapEx  so it remains roughly €700 million. So you can see that we generate very quickly on cash and therefore  on a higher power from a funding perspective  we see [Indiscernible] to do transactions we would like to do. From a rating perspective  we are also now back on track with regard to our debt levels. So obviously with this on Q1 and with this year expectation here so we will come back through the agreed on KPIs with the rating agents [Indiscernible]. So no reflections from a firepower perspective as we got to M&A. As we got through our M&A strategy  I think you are aware that roughly a €150 million are missing for our 2023 target so long favorite it's roughly €600 million what we contribute with the 5% M&A contribution over the four years  roughly €450 million was already have already delivered  so meeting a €150 million  and that's still potentially the level we definitely want to achieve  but currently there's no big pressure. So if we find an attractive target then obviously we can look at it and no pressure from that point of view.Benjamin Goy[Indiscernible]. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Mike Werner from UBS.Michael WernerThank you very much. Just a question on the -- within trading and clearing the revenues per contract or the revenues per volume within equities and interest rate derivatives. We saw volumes up quite strongly in both  and surprisingly  also we did see a bit of an uptake as well in the yields on those products year-on-year. I was just wondering -- usually  we tend to see the opposite  but I was just wondering what was going on in the next year. Thank you.Jan StreckerNo  Mike. At Eurex  typically  there are no significant volume rebates or aside from market making rebates  it's pretty much price list fees. But what we've seen and what also contributed to the secular growth in trading and clearing in Eurex  is basically new products and product innovations or MSCI derivatives  dividend derivatives  volatility derivatives  and so on  typically  are higher price  so they help to bring up the [Indiscernible] already for the last couple of quarters  at least modestly.Michael WernerThank you. And just perhaps a follow-up with regards to the interest rate derivatives. In terms of the over-the-counter business  I'm just curious to hear how that progressed in the over-the-counter clearing. How did that progress in Q1?Theodor WeimerExcept for the effect that we funded it'd now an interest rate derivative doesn't mean it has not performed well. It has indeed performed extremely well. It was the strongest quarter ever with close to €90 million of net revenue.Michael WernerThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.Bruce HamiltonHi  good afternoon  guys and congratulations on the numbers. Quick one  maybe on the M&A landscape and you've been quite clear  it sounds like on the ISS and your view that actually what you have there is growing very nicely  you no need to acquire  to further grow. So what are the nice  interesting areas as you assess the landscape today? And has that changed the total? It sounds like ESG would still be a big focus  perhaps data as well. So I'm just interested in what you're saying. And then just to confirm on the net EBITDA  what you're saying. If you are now at 1.75 times as at the end of Q1 will take so just I make sure I've answered it. Thank you.Theodor WeimerThank you  Bruce. From my side  let me firstly position our M&A strategy in the context of the current environment. First  you need to understand  right  if we are benefiting from strong tailwinds  then our operating model works perfectly  so our EBITDA margin goes up  right? Which is probably nice for you and for us both? On the other side  if you do M&A  there is a tendency that M&A has a negative effect on the EBITDA margin because it's very hard to find as profitable companies as we run our own company. And therefore  we run this smart balance of we want to keep the high margins  but also we want to grow our business smartly forward. But there is no need and no pressure from our side. We don't feel pressed in a situation like this where still the valuations are pretty high. We don't think we should let ourselves get in a position that we feel pressed by the markets whereby anybody out there that we should go eventually towards the M&A route.As a rule of thumb  until the year 2020  we have grown by M&A on average by 2% per year  2%. Our target is now in the range of 5%. What we have started in 2020 until 2023  we want to grow to 5% and we are actually exactly on the 5%  as Gregor and I pointed out during our first part of the presentation. So we feel we are pretty well underway  there have come great opportunities out there. We look at those and we have proven that we are in a position to do deals. We have done [Indiscernible] and of course  the key areas we are predominantly focused on the pre -trading and the funds areas. That's what we have done so far and definitely will continue. But again  we're in a pretty good track already and we are not pressed. We are rather focused on the good opportunities  to identify good opportunities. We are less constrained by the financial situation.Gregor PottmeyerAs we got to the financial  so what we agreed upon it's what you said  that the net-debt EBITDA is 1.75%  is our target  and the other KPI is FFO net-debt free funds from operation  that's 50%. And so these are the two KPIs we agreed upon to come back at the end of the year with the rating agencies.Bruce HamiltonGreat. Thank you very much.OperatorThe next step is Kyle Voigt from KBW.Kyle VoigtHi  thank you for taking my question. So in Clearstream  settlement activity was down 17% year-on-year  but cash balance has grown 13%. I'm wondering why you think there's such a divergence there. And does that imply that the balances may currently be slightly elevated as clients are parking cash here because they still have very few alternatives to get higher yields? And lastly  is it reasonable to assume that as rates continue to move higher  your clients may migrate some of those balances out of Clearstream for yield alternatives? Thank you.Jan StreckerYeah  Kyle. There's no direct immediate correlation. So indeed the cash balances are driven by settlement  but only by the ICSE settlements or the international settlement  not by the domestic ones. And therefore  the numbers might not quite match up. What we've seen last time around  so when interest rates went down  and when we introduced the cash handling fee  that balances actually went down. So our question remains whether this is now a sign that balances are even structurally increasing  that needs to be seen. So apparently clients borrowing a little bit more about an explicit charge and not sort of an implicit cost. So from that angle it's a little bit early to predict  but we definitely wouldn't believe they would go down substantially. So either they remain stable  driven by settlement activity  or maybe they even trend slightly upwards as we have seen in marginal.Kyle VoigtUnderstood. Thank you.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Philip Middleton from the Bank of America. Philip  your line is up now. We cannot hear you  maybe you're still on mute.Philip MiddletonYeah. You've booked some gains on your financial assets  basically on the venture portfolio. I know there was some disposals in there to which well-done but in general  this is a difficult quarter for venture investing. And how come you're like -- you sounds like you've experienced positive mark-to-market  what's going on there and how are you feeling about the next quarter or two in terms of valuation of these assets?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Thanks  Philip  for the questions. Obviously to make some prediction on a quarterly basis is a little bit difficult. So what we see is a continued increasing contribution out of our financial SSVP invested. And so since beginning of [Indiscernible] I joined here  one of this is path to professionals this year  and we have done very successful investments here over the last three years and we see the benefits now. And last year we told you that so far over the last few years  you haven't seen anything in our P&L because all of the gains are booked against our equity  and now we made for a certain investment  we changed it specifically for the new ones because if you had made the decision that -- three years ago that you're showing on an -- just into balance sheet on equity basis then you can change it. So it has to be done in the first time. And therefore  we decided now for different SFC acquired recently or what the last month that you see a fair value -- valuation in our P&L. And we have single investments  that we have to make a decision  and we have also some portfolio investments. And this was the case now in Q1. It was illuminate. So here is to invest more in the Fintech portfolio and not in a specific thing investment. And this is shown in our P&L. So it's the [Indiscernible] positive elements here. If they are disposals or even some [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] you see this in our P&L.And there are many others and now -- where you could see potential impact. And it really depends whether a transaction takes place  yes or no. So for instance  our 360X business and as the leadership of [Indiscernible]  we talked about non-financial FX building platforms  market infrastructure plays based on blockchain technology. If you would see here on transaction  here  you would also see then a P&L impact. Though the general message is  if we will continue to do successful investments here in that area  you will see continued positive contributions here in our P&L for that.Philip MiddletonOkay  thank you. But the overall environment still hasn't been [Indiscernible] helpful  so you did well in Q1 for idiosyncratic reasons?Gregor PottmeyerNo  there are obviously positive and negative elements and now as you have seen  Illuminate obviously there was a very positive element. There was another  it was participation in FairX what we hold at [Indiscernible]  what we have at [Indiscernible] made a transaction for various attractive pricing and therefore there's another $13 million U.S. positive impact here. So these were the two main drivers for Q1 but over the next quarter  it could be different elements that would contribute. It really depends on whether a transaction takes place  yes or no.Philip MiddletonOkay  thank you.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Ian White from Autonomous Research.Ian WhiteHi  afternoon. Thanks today. Thanks for the presentation. I had one follow-up and one potential question  please. The follow-up is trend; I think is the final comment you made around guidance that this year. And can I just clarify  please? I heard 17 million of additional net revenue versus the previous guidance  less than that on EBITDA. And assuming that U.S. rates go to 2% by year-end. And if I got that correct  please from which I have misunderstood on what you're saying there in terms of the assumptions on depending. There is a tweak  you've made to the guidance for FY22. And then my question really just tasks for a bit more detail on commodity trading. What do you think that in terms of the breadth of participation in counter-party growth in the first quarter? And could you say a bit about the challenges we're seeing in some energy markets around high collateral requirements for end-users and how you see that developing over the coming quarters  please. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. With regard to the questions with regard guidance  when I mentioned the €70 million  so that is the surplus we achieved in Q1 compared to our plan. And obviously  when the second comment you made  they had included a 2% Fed fund rate at the end of the year; obviously not  because I talked about €70 million in Q1. So if the Fed rate would go up to 2%  obviously  it would be additional upside potentially for what is not included so far. Your second question around the commodity business. Yes  obviously  was another 40% net revenue increase. High market activity here in power and in gas  strong increase in pricing  and yes indeed  there was a strong increase in our margins we asked for in our collateral. And the good thing is that there were no surprises for the market participants. So the model growth is designed and/or the market participants were able to deliver the collateral. But nevertheless  it's obviously a stress situation at some peak times at ECC  so our clearing house for power and for gas  we had €70 billion margin and it's now reduced to closer to €40 billion but even the €70 billion or the market participants they are able to deliver are definitely expressive duration. But we are in a good dialogue with all the market participants and so far  the [Indiscernible] and everybody is highly interested that this market solution will also continue to happen so that you have a reasonable pricing  that you have a reasonable allocation of gas and power supply  and this also was strongly supported by our German government but also from EU commission perspective. So that is in principle the target to let the markets open and to have a clear price discovery process and the market driven solution.Ian WhiteGot it. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Tobias Lukesch from Kepler Cheuvreux.Tobias LukeschAnd it's good afternoon. Three questions from my side if I may as well. I wanted some costs in one on your performance in the potential recessionary environment. On the cross I mean on the 22 development I think now you have some leeway  especially compared to last year. And I was wondering now with the segments down to 4  could give us maybe a bit of an indication how costs will develop segmentalwise. Do you see one segment with especially stronger investment needs and the other one  well  are there some products where you think that this will be extended to overall view on the cost base. And secondly. you mentioned that if we have a more troubled economy  that also Deutsche Börse  of course would suffer. And then maybe could you point out the product lines which you would see most at risk at performing at the expected underlying levels. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  to be [Indiscernible] as we've got to the cost  obviously  it's good that we were able to show cost discipline in the first quarter where there's a 5% cost growth on a constant portfolio and constant ethics basis  I think that's a very clear thing now to you and to our investors that we will continue to do prudent cost management. Obviously  a strong development in Q1 would give us some leeway  and obviously that's obviously good if it has that kind of leverage. But you will see for the next nine months a prudent cost management from digital management here again. With regards to your second question  that's a little bit of speculation  but nevertheless  you cannot rule out that a consequence of this Russia - Ukraine war crisis could be potentially a recession. And so there are some scenarios of some 2% or even a little bit more reduction of GDP in Europe this year. So it's -- but it's more or less just a scenario planning. So it's not the base case scenario so far  but the best case scenario if still at 2% to 3% GDP growth  so here we are talking about some negative scenario. And then it really depends on what really happen  what is the reason for our potential recession. It's the reason that there's a shutdown of guests’ delivery out of Russia and so that most probably more industry and companies would be impacted by that. So -- and then there wouldn't be such a big impact on our side but there could be also a different scenario. So in principle  we just wanted to say  look  after the COVID development in 2020  so we had also a very strong Q1 and then we said  look  in the second half year  it could be potentially some cyclical headwind and unfortunately  we have seen that. So we just wanted to remind all of us if there would be a stronger recession  obviously market activity would be reduced and also less volatility so that we cannot rule out even if it's not our base case.Tobias LukeschYeah  thank you. So on the cross side  I take that there is no special investment need on the specific product line or set news but it's more across the board  right?Gregor PottmeyerNo  if we see interesting opportunities  then we would have the freedom to invest here. But -- so prudent cost management is important for Deutsche Börse.Tobias Lukesch[Indiscernible] Thank you.OperatorAnd next up is Johannes Thormann from high HSBC.Johannes ThormannGood afternoon  everybody. I'm Johannes from HSBC. Two questions from me. First of all  on Kneip  could you provide a bit more details how you really want to target the synergies you're promising in the fund services business? And secondly  would it be fair to say that the annualized revenue contribution is about €30 million for the next years? And secondly  on Axioma  if we look at the year-on-year decline in revenues  is this a fixed [Indiscernible]  which would surprise or what are the reasons for [Indiscernible]? It looks like the current business performance of Axioma completely different to the picture drawn by [Indiscernible] at the time of the deal. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah. You can address trends  but fair enough. And so tonight  annualized cost is more in the range of £22 million to €25 million so that's the number of EVP expect on an annualized basis for this year. So it's not 30 million you mentioned. But obviously this wasn't very strategic direction and efficient for us. So we always told you that we have two strong legs in the investment fund service business  so there's the settlement and the custody leg. Secondly  we have now the fund distribution leg with the acquisition of specifically UPF fund center and we missed the fund data leg. So obvious now a third leg and that's exactly what we need. Now  when we talk to customers so we can offer now the full range of the value chain as regard to the fund service business. And therefore we think there are we naturally by the range that we obviously create additional services for our customers. So we can definitely do hear some cross-selling  and so there should be very positive element out of that. If I got to your second question Axioma.Yes indeed  the performance is not as good as we have targeted when we made the acquisition. Sure there is some corona impact out of that. But more specifically in Q1  if you take that comparison with Q1 last year  then in Q1 last year we had a relatively high share of point in time revenue. So -- And therefore  on these IFS numbers  as you see here  another very strong performance. If you would go like what others do  more on an onewave perspective  and we are currently working on that model that we also show you some onewave expected for the for the next 12 months basically  then you would see double-digit growth on the Axioma side. Here it's not as good as [Indiscernible] because usually in the past there was a growth rate of 15%-20%  so currently we are not there. But the onewave concept would show a better performance that now the IFRS numbers.Johannes ThormannUnderstood  thank you.OperatorAnd now we have Benjamin Bathurst from RBC Capital Markets on the line.Benjamin BathurstAfternoon  all. Thanks for taking my question. Can I ask what was the proportion of overall group revenues from recurring sources in Q1. And there's a follow-up to that. Do you have any updated view on prospects for growing that proportion in 2020 versus 2021  just in light of the strong cyclical contribution to revenue growth in Q1?Gregor PottmeyerYeah  exactly. So the number is 52% recurring revenues. It's a little bit below the share we achieved last year  we were about 55%. And the reason for that is that we have now more equit -- last year we had cyclical headwinds and now we have one cyclical tailwind  and that's the reason why the nonrecurring elements are cyclical driven higher  but in principal  over the next 2 to 3 years. So our expectation is that the recurring revenue number will increase out of stronger performance. We already talked about ESG products and then data analytics what usually has higher growth space  so it should be [Indiscernible] compared to the non-recurring business. And secondly  also from an M&A perspective  we're more interested to invest in business ' recurring revenues. And so these are the reasons for our expectation that the recurring level will increase for the next year.Benjamin BathurstThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Harlan Tender from Auto PHS.Harlan TenderYes  good afternoon. Two questions from my side. First of all  I would like to come back to the commodities business. Could you elaborate here a little bit more on the risk management? Do you need actually state guarantees to run this business and did you model for extreme shocks and what would be the outcome in these scenarios? Secondly  you mentioned in the fund service business partnership as [Indiscernible] could you maybe detail a little bit business or market opportunity you're tipping here into? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. And this regards commodities  risk management. I think a little bit  are already elaborated on that side. So  we have obviously seen a strong increase of our margin  our collateral at our clearing house of the EX. So it wasn't the peak roughly €70 billion and it's none range more to €40 billion. And two or three years ago  was when the range of €5 billion. Then obviously  you have seen here  tremendous increase year to reflect that completely different market situation. But again  the good thing is that there were no surprises for the market participants. The risk models worked as designed. And there was -- and we didn't miss any margin calls here so far. So far  no need for any state guarantees  right. So the market was able to manage that.Obviously  we are also discussing some shock scenarios. So obviously -- and that's what we're also analyzing. But the outcome and the consequences really depends on the [Indiscernible] scenarios. But in principle  as mentioned earlier. And so  when we talked with the German government in search for this next item to [Indiscernible]  then we have a clear understanding that the markets should be opened as long as possible without a government interfering. So that is the basic idea. But nevertheless  we would be also prepared for different things.Segment pressed in around [Indiscernible] I think  yes  in principle there are different opportunities to grow our business. So customer can decide to purely connect to our platform  they can outsource of the business  they can sell the business  or they can do -- partner up with us. So as in FX decided to partner up with RCM and for us  it's a big opportunity to enter in the UK market  that we are currently not present  and so that we have a broader spectrum from a regional perspective  and so that it can attract more customers. So that's the main strategically to get together with FX.Benjamin BathurstOkay  thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Martin Price  from Jefferies.Martin PriceGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry to go back to this  but I just wanted to clarify my understanding of the M&A strategy in the fund services space specifically  just wasn't [Indiscernible] to your response on this question earlier  rolling out larger M&A was in relation to IFRS or IFS strike fund services. In short  so I just clarify  if you were to do a deal in the fund services space  your current thinking is that it would probably be in the one or two million euro range rather than anything larger. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  Martin  as already mentioned by Theodor  so there's no pressure from our side to do anything here so -- and throughout specifically in the fund services business. So usually you have seen our transactions we did here in the past though it was usually a €20 million  €30 million acquisition and depending on the portfolio side of the banks and even we do not announce all the deals we do here. Sometimes also customers are shy to be mentioned publicly here. But we have a long and strong customer pipeline where customers are interested to ride together with us. And again  sometimes they decide to purely connect to our platforms  they're doing a partnership  sometimes they want to outsource business or that we take over also their people and then streamlining the processes or some partners are interested to save the business rise. For all of these three options we are very open and we have a long customer path and in all of these three areas so there's no need from our perspective to do other deals here.Martin PriceUnderstood. Thanks [Indiscernible] and thanks Gregor.Jan StreckerAll right. There are no further questions on the call. Thank you very much for your participation today. If there is anything else then please feel free to reach out directly to us and have a good day.OperatorThe conference is no longer being recorded.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.58,0.21,0.21,True,English,"['Deutsche Borse AG', 'CEO Theodor Weimer', 'Earnings Call Transcript', 'DBOEY', 'Q1', 'Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited', 'stronger U.S. dollar', 'other constant currency basis', 'regular secular growth achievements', 'U.S. derivatives exchange', 'attractive interest rate level', 'Secular net revenue growth', 'leading fund data manager', 'cyclical net revenue growth', 'Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call', 'interest rate hedge', 'organic earnings growth', '5% net revenue growth', 'record quarterly level', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'strong cyclical tailwinds', 'ESG related products', 'regulatory reporting services', 'existing client base', 'positive top-line development', 'Deutsche Borse AG', 'Deutsche Borse anaylst', 'continuous improvement program', 'buying agent services', 'organic operating costs', 'Illuminate fintech fund', 'Chief Financial Officer', 'Investor Relations section', 'M&A strategy', 'fund service business', 'investor conference call', 'Conference Call Participants', 'first quarter results', 'financial derivatives', 'Q1 2022 results', 'data management', 'strong start', 'financial results', 'Company Participants', 'business model', 'nice improvement', 'buying application', 'operating leverage', 'fund industry', 'Deutsche Bank', 'financial highlights', 'first-quarter 2022 results', 'Andrew Coombs', 'Haley Tam', 'Credit Suisse', 'Arnaud Giblat', 'Exane BNP', 'Benjamin Goy', 'Michael Werner', 'Bruce Hamilton', 'Morgan Stanley', 'Kyle Voigt', 'Philip Middleton', 'Ian White', 'Autonomous Research', 'Tobias Lukesch', 'Kepler Cheuvreux', 'Johannes Thormann', 'The Hongkong', 'Martin Price', 'Jefferies Operator', 'brief overview', 'key developments', 'product innovation', 'growing demand', 'remaining 2 months', 'higher volatility', 'asset losses', 'hedging needs', 'fixed income', 'one-off effects', 'REGIS-TR disposal', 'inflationary pressures', 'partial disposal', 'line item', 'software impairment', 'European Commission', 'CFR regulation', 'indefinite time', 'senior bond', 'financial investments', 'Jan Strecker', 'Union Bank', 'last year', 'market shares', 'market valuation', 'Theodor Weimer', 'Gregor Pottmeyer', 'presentation materials', 'greater detail', 'full-year guidance', 'one-off gain', 'OTCPK', 'DBOEY', 'April', '8:00 AM', 'Head', 'Citi', 'Switzerland', 'Keefe', 'Bruyette', 'Woods', 'America', 'afternoon', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'questions', 'email', 'website', 'replay', 'side', 'CFO', 'contrast', 'contribution', 'EBITDA', 'increase', 'commodities', 'continued', 'trend', 'outsourcing', 'March', 'acquisition', 'Indiscernible', 'clients', 'equities', 'FX', 'benefits', 'infrastructure', 'productivity', 'today', 'perspective', 'Page', 'holding', 'addition', 'sale', 'FairX', 'Coinbase', 'Depreciation', 'Eurex.', 'decision', '55']",2022-04-27,2022-04-27,seekingalpha.com

(""Pharming"" or the ""Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has received a positive decision from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on a Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) submission for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) in patients from 1 year of age to less than 18 years of age. The Company also announces that the MHRA has granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation to leniolisib for the treatment of APDS.Pharming Group N.V. logo (PRNewsfoto/Pharming Group N.V.)A PIP is a development plan aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained to support the marketing authorization of a medicine in the pediatric population. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines in children require the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP  unless the medicine is exempt due to a deferral or waiver. The leniolisib PIP includes two planned global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS  the first in children ages 4-11 years and the second in children ages 1-6 years. The Company expects to initiate recruitment for this pediatric program for leniolisib during the second half of 2022.A PIM designation indicates that a medicinal product is a promising candidate for the MHRA's Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS)  which provides pre-market access to products that are intended for the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition and have the potential to address an unmet medical need.Story continuesAnurag Relan MD  Pharming's Chief Medical Officer  commented:""We are pleased to have received agreement of this PIP and the PIM designation from the MHRA  these represent important regulatory milestones as we continue to advance leniolisib for the treatment of APDS  a rare  often debilitating  and sometimes fatal condition. The agreed PIP and the PIM designation further support our confidence in the potential of leniolisib to address APDS  as they provide us with a pathway toward marketing authorization in the United Kingdom. Pharming looks forward to continuing to work with regulatory authorities globally to bring leniolisib to patients with this significant unmet medical need as expeditiously as possible.""Leniolisib  which has received Orphan Drug Designation in Europe  received the same designation from the US Food and Drug Administration on January 30  2018.As previously announced  Pharming plans to begin submitting global registration filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the US in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both a Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and a Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

(NYSE: PFE) today reported positive Phase 2 pediatric data for their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15. Based …,"SAINT-HERBLAIN  France & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company  and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported positive Phase 2 pediatric data for their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15. Based on these new results  Valneva and Pfizer plan to proceed with inclusion of pediatric participants in their planned Phase 3 trial. The trial will evaluate VLA15 in adults and pediatric subjects 5 years of age and above and is expected to be initiated in the third quarter of 2022  subject to regulatory approval.The Phase 2 trial  VLA15-221  is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old). It compared the immunogenicity and safety of VLA15 after administration of two (at months 0 and 6) or three (at months 0  2 and 6) primary series doses in groups aged 5-11  12-17 and 18-65 years. In pediatric participants (5-17 years old) who received VLA15 in either the two-dose schedule (N=93) or three-dose schedule (N=97)  VLA15 was found to be more immunogenic than in adults with both vaccination schedules tested. These data build on the strong immunogenicity profile already reported for adult participants (18-65 years old) in February 20221. Like in adults  the immunogenicity and safety data support a three-dose primary vaccination schedule in pediatric participants in the Phase 3 study.The safety and tolerability profile observed in the 5- to 17-year age group was similar to the previously reported profile in adult participants. No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed.Valneva and Pfizer plan to submit these data for publication and presentation at a future scientific congress.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “Lyme disease affects all age groups  but with their affinity for being active outdoors  the pediatric population is at the greatest risk of Lyme disease. These first pediatric results are therefore extremely important and support the inclusion of pediatric participants in our planned Phase 3 trial. In partnership with Pfizer  we are excited to further investigate our VLA15 vaccine candidate  which will hopefully help protect both adults and children against Lyme disease.”Kathrin U. Jansen  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer  said: “The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens. These positive pediatric data mark an important step forward in the ongoing development of VLA15  and we are excited to continue working with Valneva to potentially help protect both adults and children from Lyme disease.”About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immunogenicity and safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 20172. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA153.About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 is a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old).585 healthy participants received VLA15 at two different immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=187]) or three doses of placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=208]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 µg  which was selected based on data generated in the two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout was performed one month after the primary vaccination series. A subset of participants will receive a booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 18 (booster phase) and will be followed for three additional years to monitor antibody persistence.VLA15 is tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study is being conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and has enrolled both volunteers with a cleared past infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks4. It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere. While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States5 and 130 000 people in Europe6. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more unspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system. The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens7.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

Qui…,--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Wolters Kluwer:What: The tax world is a strange place. Did you know swimming pools  ransom payments  and candy bars could be tax deductible?Tax provisions can be very complex  and that complexity can lead to very unusual distinctions. Quite often a decision in a tax case in court creates a precedent that can survive for many years after. Questions such as “Can that expense be treated as an ordinary and necessary business expense?” and “Is that expense based on a prescription from a physician for a recognized medical condition?” can lead to unexpected outcomes.Why: When in doubt about the tax treatment of an item of income or expense  always check with your tax return preparer. The answers may often surprise you:Cosmetic surgery  while generally not deductible  may be deductible if a taxpayer can demonstrate the procedure increases their incomeWhile a general work uniform like a business suit is not deductible as a business expense  very specialized uniforms and tools  such as leather clothes  whips  or handcuffs belonging to a person who makes their living as a dominatrix may be deductibleA swimming pool would not normally be deductible  but a swimming pool prescribed by a doctor for a particular medical condition may be deductibleClarinet lessons for a child with an overbite may be deductible as a medical expenseFood for stray cats in a junk yard may be a deductible business expense for pest controlPaying ransom to a hacker may be a deductible business expense if a police report is filed and the incident is reported to the SECIn a few states  candy bars are taxable or not depending on whether they contain flourA petting zoo to entertain children of visiting clients may be a deductible business expenseAt least one state taxes blocks of ice but not ice cubesIn another state  an unsliced bagel is not taxed but when sliced  toasted  or smeared then it is taxedIn a third state  pumpkins for decorations are taxed but pumpkins for food are notFostering animals in conjunction with an IRS recognized charity may lead to a qualified charitable contribution for related expensesWho: Tax expert Mark Luscombe  JD  LL.M  CPA  Principal Federal Tax Analyst at Wolters Kluwer Tax & Accounting  is available to discuss unusual provisions in the tax law and the logic behind them.PLEASE NOTE: These materials are designed to provide accurate and authoritative information in regard to the subject matter covered.

It will also allow Quantum Genomics to reinforce and broaden their shareholding structure.Otium Capital  the family office of Pierre-Edouard Stérin  founder of SmartBox Group  committed to subscribe a minimum of €10 million to the Deal  with a maximum price of 2.8€ per share. This follows SmartBox Groups’ subscription of €4 million to the Company’s last capital increase in December 2020. Vatel Capital also agreed to subscribe between €2 and 2.5 million to the Deal.In parallel with the preparation in December 2021 of an exclusive licensing and production agreement with Quantum Genomics  the company Gulf Pharmaceutical Industries Julphar will subscribed simultaneously to a reserved capital increase of $2 million (in accordance with the 15th resolution of June 24  2021 Annual General Meeting)  independent from the Deal  at the same subscription price as the price set for the Deal. The shares issued have a mandatory lock-up period of one year. This represents an increased focus by Quantum Genomics and Julphar’s on their cooperation to market firibastat in the Middle East  Africa  some member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States and Turkey.Story continuesJean-Philippe Milon  CEO of Quantum Genomics  commented:""By committing to subscribe to this deal  Otium Capital and Vatel Capital are demonstrating  alongside our partner Julphar  their trust in our corporate objectives and execution. We are delighted to be able to count on their support. Our ambition is to develop a portfolio of innovative products that bring hope to millions of patients worldwide suffering from diseases with unmet needs"".A Decisive Deal for a Value-Creating Project and the Market Launch of firibastat at the end of 2023The Company plans to use the proceeds from the Deal to finance: (i) the continued development of firibastat through to the first registration at the end of 2023 and (ii) the exploration of new therapeutic indications based on the BAPAI platform.The firibastat development program  which is currently in Phase III in difficult-to-treat and resistant hypertension  is running its course with the aim of a first registration at the end of 2023. With this objective  Quantum Genomics have focused their research activities on this first indication and set up a first-rate team to carry out this key step in their development  as illustrated by the recent appointment of Stéphane Cohen as Head of Global Operations.Therefore  despite the health restrictions and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic  the last patient for the FRESH randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study should be enrolled in the next few days  for results which will now be published by the end of October 2022. The study is taking place under the supervision of an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) and no serious adverse event liable to result in a change to the protocol has been reported.The Phase III REFRESH study kicked off in the first half of 2021 with the aim of demonstrating the three-month efficacy of firibastat after a single daily dose  as well as the long-term safety (six to twelve months). Based on the intermediate results of this study  expected for mid-2023  the application for marketing authorization of firibastat will be filed in the third quarter 2023  as planned.In the heart failure indication  following the results of QUORUM announced in August 2021  the search for a partner to support the next development activities is still ongoing  while the development plan is being finalized with the Regulatory Authorities.Quantum Genomics are therefore on their way to validating a new drug class based on an innovative mechanism  directly targeting the brain  to treat patients with cardiovascular disease who are poorly controlled or whose treatment has failed. To go even further and supplement its historical activities  Quantum Genomics now intends to explore new therapeutic fields based on the patented technology platform built around BAPAIs. Through this strategy  the company intends to leverage its development expertise to become a benchmark player in the formulation of innovative treatments addressing needs that are currently unmet.Based on its cash position of M€ 5.1 as of March 31  2021  subscription commitments received from institutional investors for minimum of M€ 12 and Julphar’s investment of M$ 2  Quantum Genomics has cash visibility until the end of the first quarter 2023.Main Terms of the DealThe Deal will take place with cancellation of the Company's existing shareholders' pre-emptive subscription right  with French and international institutional investors  as part of an offering of new shares (the ""New Shares"") to a category of persons within the meaning of Article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code  in accordance with the 16th resolution of the General Meeting of Shareholders of Quantum Genomics held on June 24  2021 (the ""General Meeting"") and the decision made today by the CEO following authorization from the Board of Directors on April 25  2022.Subscription for the New Shares will include cancellation of the shareholders' pre-emptive subscription right and will be exclusively reserved for the following category of persons  as defined by the Board of Directors' decisions of April 25  2022 in accordance with the delegation from the General Meeting:""French and foreign investments firms and funds (including  but not limited to  any Innovation Fund  Venture Capital Fund or Local Investment Fund) (i) habitually investing or (ii) having invested over the last 60 months more than 1 million Euros in ""small caps"" (i.e. whose capitalization  when they are listed  does not exceed one billion Euros (€1 000 000 000)) linked to the biotechnologies or health sector  investing a unit amount of more than €100 000 (issue premium included).""The number of New Shares issued in the context of the Deal will be defined by decision of the CEO in accordance with the authorization given by the Board of Directors on April 25  2022.

EUR 2 million worth of contracts with European and African clients for chili and paprika off-take signedBERLIN  GERMANY / ACCESSWIRE / April 26  2022 / Amatheon Agri Holding N.V. (the ""Company"")  the Euronext listed agribusiness and farming group (ISIN NL0010273694  Symbol MLAAH)  announces the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding for a 5-year Global Development Alliance project with a total volume of US$21m.A double reason to celebrate: On International Earth Day 2022  Amatheon Agri Zambia Ltd. joined U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)  The Nature Conservancy (TNC)  Kashikoto Conservancy Ltd.  Alliance partners  government officials and local leaders to officially launch the Eastern Kafue Nature Alliance. The Alliance  which operates under USAID's Global Development Alliance (GDA) brings together public  private and civil society actors  along with local communities  to address threats to the rich biodiversity in and around the Greater Kafue Ecosystem (GKE) of Zambia.5-year flagship project with USAID and TNCA Cooperative Agreement signed by USAID and TNC initiates implementation of a five-year programme of US$21.3m out of which $10m will be funded by USAID and $11.3m in leverage from the private sector. Amatheon Agri Zambia Ltd. (AAZ) plays the key role in this programme for further increasing the sustainable agricultural production of high-value crops within the communities in Mumbwa District  in which the company has its operations.The Minister of Tourism  Honourable Rhodine Sikumba  officially launched the Alliance and highlighted the importance of bringing together like-minded people to conserve the rich landscape of the GKE and improve the well-being and prosperity of its communities. ""Sustainable development requires cross-sectoral commitments from local and global stakeholders "" said Honourable Mr. Sikumba.Story continuesAlso the Minister of Green Economy and Environment  Honourable Collins Nzovu  touched on the great opportunities that inclusive agriculture can bring for communities and nature simultaneously  and appreciated Amatheon's approach to introduce cash crop cultivation as a sustainable  alternative source of income for the communities in the GKE.Uplifting communities in Mumbwa District with increasing demand for Capsicum productsWith the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)  Amatheon Agri Zambia's Managing Director  Troy Minne  said the company commits to ramp up its herbs and spices production with small-scale farmers  starting with different varieties of capsicum products (hot chillies and paprika). Over a period of 5 years  Amatheon Agri Zambia will support crop diversification into high-value herbs and spices  produced under climate-smart techniques through the provision of market services  including input finance  extension and demonstration of sustainable farming practices to address economic constraints communities face in Mumbwa District.With its newly established state-of-the-art processing  cleaning and storage facilities  AAZ is able to process the dried chillies and paprika into flakes in various sizes  with or without seeds  in accordance with international food and processing standards. The global demand for chilli products continues to grow  which offers great opportunity for Amatheon to connect smallholder farmers to high-level value chains and increase its trading volumes as new supply contracts come into fruition.Successful conclusion of major orders in the first quarter of 2022""The first major deals from European and African clients for high-margin chilli and paprika products have been closed  resulting in ca. EUR 2 million worth of contracts being signed in Q1 2022 for delivery later in the year "" says Amatheon's Director of International Sales and Marketing  Victoria Cavanagh.""The high quality of the products  combined with year-round availability and on-site processing  makes Amatheon Agri a strategic supplier for many new clients "" says Cavanagh. ""Traditional origins for chilli and paprika are experiencing quality and supply challenges  and the market is eager to develop new origins especially with large-scale farming companies where traceability is stronger "" she says.Second AAZ-USAID partnership for community developmentFor AAZ  the launch marked a special moment in the company's history with USAID  which played a crucial role in the development of Amatheon Agri's Outgrower Programme in 2016. During the first USAID partnership  AAZ established a trading network with more than 10 000 farmers in Mumbwa District and embedded the Outgrower Programme as a core part of the company's operations in Zambia.""We are excited to partner again in such an ambitious and fundamentally important project  which will uplift our Outgrower Programme and the communities surrounding Amatheon's farm "" said Sustainability Manager Laura Schenck.The Alliance project activities will be implemented over a course of five years until September 2026.The Management BoardBerlin  Germany  26 April 2022** *For further information please see the Group's website: https://amatheon-agri.comContact:Laura SchenckAmatheon Agri Holding N.V.Friedrichstrasse 95  10117 Berlin  GermanyTel: +49 30 53 000 90 121Fax: +49 30 53 000 90 20email: l.schenck@amatheon-agri.comAbout Amatheon Agri Holding N.V.:Amatheon Agri is a European agri-food company with headquarters in Berlin and production sites in Sub-Saharan Africa and cooperation with small-scale local farmers (outgrowers).

First  growth in Mobile businesses picked up significantly (up 21.2%). And second  the inflationary environment has led to sharp growth in the volume of discount coupons  with purchasing power a key concern for consumers. To support our clients in accelerating the retail transformation  we will continue investing in innovation in two key areas: the shift towards digital promotions and the emergence of Web3 retail.”Q1 2022 BUSINESS GROWTH DRIVEN BY DIGITALAs anticipated  HighCo showed slight growth in Q1 2022 and posted a 1.1% increase in gross profit to €18.8 M.This change is mainly due to:Double-digit growth in Mobile (up 21.2%);Healthy performance of coupon clearing with increasing volumes (up 9%);Slight drop in the management of traditional promotions;Decline in marketing & communication consulting businesses in France (down 14.2%).These factors resulted in 5.7% growth in Digital for Q1 2022.

The main reasons for this growth are: double-digit growth in Mobile businesses (up 20.8%)  the substantial rise in volumes of coupons cleared (up 11%)  and the decline in the management of traditional promotions and in marketing & communication consulting businesses.Digital rose 6.9% in Q1 2022  representing two-thirds of total business activities.

Performance was driven by growth in coupon clearing businesses and the slowdown in promotion management. The share of Digital in Belgian businesses represented 52.7% of gross profit.With double-digit growth (up 13.5%)  business in other countries (Spain and Italy) was stronger and accounted for 1.9% of the Group’s gross profit.2022 GUIDANCE CONFIRMEDThe Group points out that it is not directly or indirectly active in the regions involved in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. However  the ongoing war  on top of the Covid-19 pandemic which continues to spread  is creating uncertainty.In this complex and changing environment  HighCo remains watchful of the potential impact on its brand and retailer clients  in particular the consequences of the sharp rise in commodities prices and in inflation.Given the performance reported in Q1 and the business growth outlook expected for Q2 (comparable to Q1 reported growth)  the Group has confirmed its guidance for 2022:Slight growth in gross profit (2021 gross profit: €76.52 M);A rise in adjusted operating margin (adjusted headline PBIT/gross profit) of 50 basis points (2021 adjusted operating margin: 20.3%).HIGHCO VENTURI STARTUP STUDIO: FIRST EQUITY INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF PROJECTS UNDER WAYHaving radically changed the way we do things  the Covid-19 crisis has accelerated the retail transformation. Brands and retailers face huge new challenges: the transformation of physical points of sale  strong growth in e-commerce  development of m-commerce and social media  and the emergence of Web3.Through its startup studio HighCo Venturi  HighCo continues to invest in innovation to support its clients in accelerating the retail transformation in two key areas: the shift towards digital promotions and the emergence of Web3 retail.Shifting towards digital promotionsIn an inflationary environment in which purchasing power is a key concern for consumers  promotions are central to the strategy of brands and retailers.Through its growth stage startups and a first equity investment  HighCo invests in creating solutions to:develop digital coupons  andprovide retailers with a technological platform for managing promotions.1) DEVELOPING DIGITAL COUPONSUniversal mobile discount coupons: HighCo Nifty continues its development with the aim of simplifying access to brand generosity.

Big-name brands such as Danone and Blédina use this solution to optimise the ROI of their relational programmes by industrialising campaign personalisation based on their first-party data.2) PROVIDING RETAILERS WITH TOOLS FOR MANAGING PROMOTIONSHighCo announces its equity investment in the launch of the very first SaaS centralised promotion management platform.In the context of the increasing use of promotions  retailers are faced with a growing need for automated management  campaign planning  regulatory compliance  and so forth. This situation is what led the startup RetailTech founded by Martin Rennert to develop its technological platform Unipromo for retailers. HighCo has invested €0.5 M in the first funding round  acquiring one-third of the share capital.Supporting the emergence of Web3 retailVirtual commerce may still be nascent  but HighCo is already guiding brands and retailers in their first steps towards Web3 through a comprehensive offering: creating a collection of non-fungible tokens (NFTs)  buying lands in the metaverse  developing interfaces with e-commerce  and more.For example  HighCo has recently worked with the French department store chain Printemps to create its very first virtual and immersive shopping experience.

That window can be extended by six months if approved by a shareholder vote.Goldman Sachs is handling a two-day bookbuilding process which will conclude on Wednesday.SPACs are investment vehicles that raise money on stock markets to buy private businesses  providing an easy route for the target to go public without going through the more complex process of a traditional initial public offering (IPO).RA’s listing ranks as the second SPAC deal on Euronext Amsterdam this year after Luxembourg-based GP Bullhound Acquisition I SE went public in February raising 200 million euros from investors.The Euronext Amsterdam stock market is Europe’s biggest SPAC hub  with blank cheque firms including Dutch Star Companies TWO and Odyssey SPAC also recently finalising their deals.Meanwhile London has failed to attract as many SPAC deals in recent years despite adopting new listing rules to step up its SPAC pipeline  with only one listing finalised in November.Along with co-investors  Ripplewood owns 75% of Latvia’s Citadele Bank and is also the second largest shareholder in Egypt-based investment bank EFG Hermes  with an 11.7% stake according to Refinitiv data.In 1999 Ripplewood partnered with U.S private equity firm JC Flowers to acquire the predecessor bank of Shinsei after it went bankrupt in Japan’s late 1990s banking crisis.

The fall in sales in the second quarter was limited to €4.5 million compared to 2021. In this uncertain climate  the Group expects business to recover only slowly in the short term.In Russia  the Group is mainly focused on agricultural equipment. Given the need to minimize future impacts on food supply  EXEL Industries is maintaining as much of its activity as possible  in compliance with European rules and applying special vigilance.As a reminder  the Group’s sales in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine made up 4% of 2020–2021 sales.Second quarter 2021–2022 salesSales for the second quarter of the 2021-2022 fiscal year amounted to €247.5 million  up 2.0% compared with the same period of the previous fiscal year. At constant exchange rates and same scope  (+€3.7 million  mainly due to the rises of the US dollar and the GBP)  Group sales were down 3.3%. Two factors explain the fall: first  the introduction of a new ERP software in the gardening business led to delays in dispatching orders; second  the ongoing supply chain difficulties particularly in components again disrupted production this quarter  postponing some deliveries  notably in agricultural spraying.Story continuesThe scope effect is the result of two recently acquired businesses by the Group: the nautical activity was consolidated from September 30  2021 and contributed €3 million this quarter and €5.1 million in the half-year; GF Garden (Italy) has been consolidated into the garden division since February 15  2022 and generated €6 million this quarter.AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING  sales of €122.1 million  up €2.4 million (up 1.9%)The conflict in Ukraine boosted the prices not only of agricultural commodities (wheat  corn  rape  etc.) but also spare parts and components. Sales from agricultural spraying grew slightly in volumes with different trends seen in different markets. Europe has remained stable and in Australia the healthy tendency glimpsed in the first quarter continued. In contrast  North America was held back by a lack of spare parts and components. Again this quarter  production at all the Group’s plants was affected by shortages in supply chains for mechanical  hydraulic and electronic components resulting in severely late deliveries.SUGAR BEET HARVESTERS  sales of €21.5 million  a €4.7 million increase (up 28.2%)This quarter confirmed the healthy start made in the first quarter by this business  following on from a year of strong growth in 2020-2021. Sales of second-hand machines and spare parts are up  and price increases  as a consequence of the inflation of the prices of steel and components  were passed in all product families.LEISURE  sales of €38.2 million  down 17%The acquisitions of the nautical division on September 30  2021 (Wauquiez  Rhéa Marine  Tofinou) and of GF Garden on February 15  2022  resulted in a scope effect increasing sales for this activity by €9 million. At constant exchange rates and same scope  the garden business had a difficult quarter in a downward European market and was affected by significant delays caused by migrating the IT systems to SAP. At the same time  the pricing offer was adapted to compensate for the sharp rises in costs (logistics  commodities).INDUSTRY  sales of €65.7 million  a €5.5 million increase (up 9.3%)North America and China continue to drive growth in industrial spraying  in both volume and value terms (automotive and wood industry). The position is more difficult in Europe and the economic environment remains uncertain. In technical hoses  rising costs of commodity led to regular sales price rises  resulting in increased revenue for this business.OutlookAGRICULTURAL SPRAYINGAgricultural commodity prices are expected to remain at high levels  encouraging farmers to renew their machines.Commercial brands are adjusting their sales prices  to offset the steel and components costs increases and to try to limit the impact on margins.The order book is rising ahead of its 2020-2021 levels  but supply chain disruptions (components) persist and will continue to affect productivity and the pace of deliveries.Some orders are likely to be canceled as a result of the conflict in Ukraine.SUGAR BEET HARVESTERSStabilization of new machine sales expected in the fiscal year  despite canceled/delayed orders in Ukraine and Russia.Confirmation that the diversification into the Terra Variant range can act as a driver of growth into new regions.Sales of spare parts and used machines remain strong.LEISUREThe change of ERP software implemented in the second quarter (migration to SAP) should disturb less the dispatching of orders in the third quarter  with a gradual recovery in volumes over the third and fourth quarters. However  in this seasonal business  a portion of these delays will be difficult to recover.The new Easy-Mix composter  which has won a string of awards from different organizations  looks set to grow sales.After briefly stabilizing  commodity prices are rising-up again.The commercial and industrial restructuring of the nautical activity continues.INDUSTRYThe automotive market is difficult in all regions  with carmakers showing signs of a wait-and-see attitude.Asia and America should continue to support growth in other markets.Yves Belegaud  Chief Executive Officer of the EXEL Industries Group  said:“By being able to rely on its diversified businesses  the Group showed  in the second quarter  its resilience in an uncertain geopolitical context. Sales were slightly up on the second quarter 2020-2021  despite an unfavorable basis of comparison and the disruptions we are currently facing. The order book nonetheless remains strong  in an uncertain global environment but with very favorable agricultural commodity prices. EXEL Industries again showed its pricing power to cope with an even more inflationary environment.”Upcoming eventsMay 31  2022: 2021-2022 half-year resultsJuly 26  2022 after market closing: third quarter 2021-2022 salesAbout EXEL IndustriesEXEL Industries is a French family-owned group that designs  manufactures and markets capital equipment and provides associated services that enable its customers to improve efficiency and productivity or enhance their well-being while achieving their CSR objectives.Driven by an innovation strategy for 70 years  EXEL Industries has based its development on innovative ideas designed to offer customers unique  efficient  competitive and user-friendly products.Since its inception  the Group has recorded significant growth in each of its markets through both organic growth and corporate acquisitions  underpinned by a stable shareholder base guided by a long-term development strategy.EXEL Industries employs approximately 3 546 permanent employees spread across 27 countries and five continents.

(NYSE: PFE) today reported positive Phase 2 pediatric data for their Lyme disease vaccine candidate  VLA15. Based on these new results  Valneva and Pfizer plan to proceed with inclusion of pediatric participants in their planned Phase 3 trial. The trial will evaluate VLA15 in adults and pediatric subjects 5 years of age and above and is expected to be initiated in the third quarter of 2022  subject to regulatory approval.The Phase 2 trial  VLA15-221  is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old). It compared the immunogenicity and safety of VLA15 after administration of two (at months 0 and 6) or three (at months 0  2 and 6) primary series doses in groups aged 5-11  12-17 and 18-65 years. In pediatric participants (5-17 years old) who received VLA15 in either the two-dose schedule (N=93) or three-dose schedule (N=97)  VLA15 was found to be more immunogenic than in adults with both vaccination schedules tested. These data build on the strong immunogenicity profile already reported for adult participants (18-65 years old) in February 20221. Like in adults  the immunogenicity and safety data support a three-dose primary vaccination schedule in pediatric participants in the Phase 3 study.The safety and tolerability profile observed in the 5- to 17-year age group was similar to the previously reported profile in adult participants. No vaccine-related serious adverse events (SAEs) were observed.Story continuesValneva and Pfizer plan to submit these data for publication and presentation at a future scientific congress.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “Lyme disease affects all age groups  but with their affinity for being active outdoors  the pediatric population is at the greatest risk of Lyme disease. These first pediatric results are therefore extremely important and support the inclusion of pediatric participants in our planned Phase 3 trial. In partnership with Pfizer  we are excited to further investigate our VLA15 vaccine candidate  which will hopefully help protect both adults and children against Lyme disease.”Kathrin U. Jansen  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research & Development at Pfizer  said: “The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens. These positive pediatric data mark an important step forward in the ongoing development of VLA15  and we are excited to continue working with Valneva to potentially help protect both adults and children from Lyme disease.”About VLA15VLA15 is the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate currently in clinical development. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is one of the most dominant surface proteins expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 has demonstrated a strong immunogenicity and safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical studies so far. The program was granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 20172. Valneva and Pfizer entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA153.About Clinical Study VLA15-221VLA15-221 is a randomized  observer-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 2 study. It is the first clinical study with VLA15 which enrolled a pediatric population (5-17 years old).585 healthy participants received VLA15 at two different immunization schedules (month 0-2-6 [N=190] or month 0-6 [N=187]) or three doses of placebo (month 0-2-6 [N=208]). Vaccine recipients received VLA15 at a dose of 180 µg  which was selected based on data generated in the two previous Phase 2 studies. The main safety and immunogenicity readout was performed one month after the primary vaccination series. A subset of participants will receive a booster dose of VLA15 or placebo at month 18 (booster phase) and will be followed for three additional years to monitor antibody persistence.VLA15 is tested as an alum-adjuvanted formulation and administered intramuscularly. The study is being conducted at U.S. sites located in areas where Lyme disease is endemic and has enrolled both volunteers with a cleared past infection with Borrelia burgdorferi as well as Borrelia burgdorferi-naïve volunteers.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by infected Ixodes ticks4. It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere. While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  it is estimated to annually affect approximately 476 000 people in the United States5 and 130 000 people in Europe6. Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called Erythema migrans or more unspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  arthralgia or myalgia) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious complications affecting the joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system. The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens7.About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company takes a highly specialized and targeted approach to vaccine development and then applies its deep understanding of vaccine science to develop prophylactic vaccines addressing these diseases.

In France  we have finalized our store optimization plan in order to benefit from a world-class network that will enable us to offer our customers the best possible in-store experience. Despite a strong start to the quarter in APAC  the resurgence of Covid and the restrictions imposed have had a significant impact on our performance. Globally  we continued to successfully follow our One Journey strategic plan  implementing initiatives to further increase the desirability of our brands  planning tailored openings in Europe and Asia  and achieving continuous significant progress in our full price strategy. Looking ahead to the rest of the year  we are closely monitoring the health situation in APAC  and we restate our financial targets provided that the situation improves relatively quickly.”Story continues€m except %Unaudited figures Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Organicchange1 Reportedchange Sales by region France 78.6 93.7 +22.7% +19.1% EMEA 47.5 83.1 +72.9% +74.9% Americas 24.9 38.6 +44.5% +55.0% APAC 72.8 67.6 -13.9% -7.2% Sales by Brand Sandro 103.6 134.1 +25.9% +29.4% Maje 89.3 112.2 +22.1% +25.6% Other brands2 31.0 36.8 +21.0% +18.6% TOTAL 223.9 283.0 +23.7% +26.4%2022 FIRST QUARTER SALESConsolidated sales reached €283.0m in Q1 2022  up +26.4% compared to Q1 2021  including an organic increase of +23.7%5 (driven by like-for-like growth of +23.6% owing to strong local demand) and a positive currency impact of +2.7%. This performance  driven by our biggest brands Sandro and Maje  reflects an outstanding momentum in the Americas and EMEA  a progressive improvement over the quarter in France  and a good start in APAC then significantly impacted by very high Covid restrictions  notably in Hong-Kong and in Mainland China.Over the first three months of the year  the Group generated strong digital sales penetration of 25%; reaching +10 pp vs. the 2019 level (15%).In line with our One Journey strategic plan  we continued to make strong progress on our full price strategy  notably through our deliberate reduction of the promotional sales share  and managing to decrease the discount rate  both in B&M and digital  with -6.1 pp vs. Q1 2021.As planned  during this quarter  SMCP finalized its brick-and-mortar network optimization plan  with 17 net closures of points of sales (POS)  of which 13 in France (mainly small points of sales  in small cities) including the end of the Suite 341 format (7 closures over the quarter). In EMEA  SMCP recorded 3 POS net closures from consolidation (such as Sandro women and Sandro men becoming a unisex store) or relocation opportunities  partly offset by openings in Belgium or Estonia (new country for the Group). SMCP operated a stable network in the Americas and APAC.Sales breakdown by region and by brandIn France  sales are up +22.7% on an organic basis  reflecting a strong acceleration over the quarter. SMCP outperformed the market owing to a good start to our spring-summer collections; an outperformance mainly driven by like-for-like growth (+22.0%)  including a sharp reduction in the discount rate down -10 pp vs. 2021 and a finalization of our network optimization plan (-13 POS of which -7 Suite 341).In EMEA  Group sales grew +72.9% on an organic basis vs. 2021 and exceeding 2019 level for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic  owing to a significant acceleration over the quarter driven by local demand. This strong sales momentum  supported by an historical like-for-like growth of +100.0%  includes a -7pp decrease in the discount rate and a rather stable network base.Despite a good start to the quarter in APAC (successful Chinese New Year)  the recent Covid restrictions had a significant impact on sales  notably in Hong-Kong and in Mainland China (lockdowns and impact on mobility and traffic)  leading to a -13.9% decrease on an organic basis vs. 2021. This performance takes into account a high comparison base  especially in Mainland China. Compared to 2019  Mainland China sales were up +3.7% on an organic basis  improving growth compared to Q4 2021. The desirability of our brands remains strong in Asia  and especially in China. Over the quarter  digital penetration grew by +3 pp vs. last year  and the network base was stable.The Americas recorded a strong growth of +44.5% on an organic basis vs. 2021  outstanding momentum mainly driven by like-for-like growth (+41.7%)  including a new sharp reduction in discount rate down -14 pp vs. 2021 and a stable network base. The United States and Canada outperformed  driven by high demand across all our distribution channels. The region’s growth is also very strong vs. 2019 (+20% on an organic basis  of which +25% in the U.S).FINANCIAL OUTLOOKSMCP is closely monitoring the health context in APAC and the impact of the restrictions on the in-store traffic as well as on supply chain capabilities. The Group remains cautious as the situation in Mainland China can evolve rapidly and new cities could be impacted.SMCP confirms its financial guidance for 2022 provided that the health context in APAC improves fairly rapidly.As a reminder  for Full Year 2022  SMCP anticipates solid double-digit sales growth vs. 2021 and mid-single-digit sales growth vs. 2019. Regarding profitability  the Group expects an adjusted EBIT margin (as a % of sales) in line with 2021 in a context of significant inflation. SMCP thus anticipates a net debt leverage ratio of <2x at the end of 2022 (instead of end of 2023).A conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 9:00 a.m. (Paris time).Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSThe Group uses certain key financial and non-financial measures to analyze the performance of its business.

As part of our agile management of the crisis  we have decided to proactively negotiate with banks a temporary waiver on our debt covenant in order to increase our financial flexibility. In addition  we have also revised upward our planned asset divestment program to be achieved by the end of 2023.Further to these measures  the Board of Directors has also decided to propose to our next Shareholders’ meeting to exceptionally suspend dividend payment in 2022.Our full-year 2022 guidance for FORVIA (Faurecia + 11 months of consolidation of HELLA)  that we release today for the first time  is based on a cautious assumption for worldwide automotive production of 74.2 million vehicles  reflecting the current low visibility  and nevertheless demonstrates the strong resilience of FORVIA.We are more than ever convinced about the huge potential of profitable growth and value creation of FORVIA  accelerated by the acquisition of HELLA that enhances our advanced technology portfolio and generates significant synergies. We also strongly reaffirm our commitment to reduce indebtedness post-HELLA acquisition  taking all necessary measures to accelerate return to the planned deleveraging trajectory  even if the current context imposes some delay in 2022.”The Board of Directors  under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN  met on April 25 and  on this occasion  reviewed the present press release.“Operating income” presented as Faurecia’s main performance indicator is Operating income before amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations.“Adjusted EBITDA” is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation  this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).“Debt covenant” is the ratio “Net financial debt at the end of the period” vs. “Adjusted EBITDA over the last 12 months”; it is tested twice every year  at June 30 and at December 31.All other definitions are explained at the end of this Press Release  under the section “Definitions of terms used in this document”.All figures related to worldwide or regional automotive production refer to the S&P Global Mobility (ex-IHS Markit) forecast dated April 2022 (vehicles segment in line with CAAM for China  i.e. excluding vehicles > 3.5t).GROUP SALESin €m Q1 2021 Currency effect Organic growth Scope effect (HELLA 2 months) Q1 2022 Reported change Group sales 4 005 129 46 1 143 5 322 +32.9% % last year’s sales +3.2% +1.1% +28.5% Worldwide auto. prod.* (m units) 19 721 -4.2% 18 885 Outperformance (bps) 530* Source: S&P Global Mobility (ex-IHS Markit) dated April 2022 (vehicles segment in line with CAAM for China)Sales in the quarter amounted to €5 322 million  up 32.9% on a reported basis.They included:A positive currency effect of €129 million representing 3.2% of last year’s sales  mainly due to the USD and CNY vs. the euroA scope effect of €1 143 million representing 28.5% of last year’s sales  due to the first two months of consolidation of HELLA (starting February 1  2022)On an organic basis  sales grew by 1.1% in the quarter. While January and February posted solid organic growth  March mainly reflected the disruptions in supply chain for European automakers  due to the war in Ukraine  but also initial effects from Covid-19 restrictions in some Chinese areas.On an organic basis  sales in March were down 6% at Group level: this included a drop of c. 20% in European sales  not fully offset by growth in all other regions (in China  organic growth in March remained in positive territory at +6%  well below that recorded in January and February).The 1.1% organic sales growth in the quarter is to be compared with a 4.2% drop in worldwide automotive production  i.e. an outperformance of 530bps.SALES BY BUSINESS GROUPin €m Seating Interiors Clean Mobility Clarion Electr.

The guidance released on February 21  2022 was a guidance for Faurecia standalone and didn’t include any effect from the consolidation of HELLA and any impact from the war in Ukraine or Covid-related restrictions in China that had not started yet at that time.INCREASED FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO GET THROUGH THE CURRENT UNCERTAIN ENVIRONMENT THANKS TO COVENANT RENEGOTIATION  EXCEPTIONAL SUSPENSION OF DIVIDEND PAYMENT IN 2022 AND UPGRADE OF ASSET DIVESTMENT PROGRAMOn January 31  2022  in line with the expected timeline  Faurecia closed the strategic and transformative acquisition of HELLA  creating the 7th largest automotive supplier in the world.Faurecia now holds 81.5% of HELLA  for which it paid a total price of €5.4 billion: €0.5 billion was paid in shares through a Faurecia’s capital increase reserved to the Hueck/Roepke Family pool (now holding 8.95% of Faurecia’s share capital) and €4.9 billion was paid in cash to other HELLA shareholders and to the Family pool for the part not paid in Faurecia shares.Unexpectedly  on February 24  2022  the war in Ukraine started  creating significant uncertainty on market conditions  mainly for the European automotive industry. Visibility on the duration and magnitude of this war’s impacts is currently low  both in terms of volumes and cost inflation.On top of this low visibility  the pandemic in China represents an additional risk on volumes in 2022.In this uncertain environment and to increase its financial flexibility  Faurecia has proactively renegotiated its debt covenant with banks. Banks were fully supportive of Faurecia’s strategy and deleveraging strategy and agreed that debt covenant will not be tested at June 30  2022 and will be of 3.75x at December 31  2022 (instead of 3.0x) before returning to 3.0x as from June 30  2023. This new temporary covenant limit of 3.75x at year-end has been tailored to offer enough headroom  even in the current uncertain environment.Further increasing financial flexibility is the decision taken by Faurecia to increase its asset divestment program from a target of €500 million of proceeds to be closed by end 2023 (as indicated in August 2021 when the HELLA acquisition was announced) to a target of €1 billion of proceeds to be closed by end 2023.Lastly  the Board of Directors  at its meeting held yesterday (April 25  2022)  decided to propose to the next Shareholders’ meeting to exceptionally suspend dividend payment in 2022 to further contribute to the increase in financial flexibility (instead of €1 per share as previously announced on February 21  2022).NEXT STEPS REGARDING THE REFINANCING OF THE ACQUISITION OF HELLA AND CONFIRMED DELEVERAGING STRATEGYAs regards the refinancing of the HELLA acquisition  given recent market conditions  Faurecia has decided not to launch a capital increase yet  waiting for more favorable conditions.As a reminder  the bridge-to-equity offers time headroom until mid-February 2023  while the bridge-to-bond offers even more headroom until mid-August 2023.This time headroom and the increase in financial flexibility gained through covenant renegotiation  suspended dividend and upgraded asset divestment program give comfort to Faurecia in order to wait for adequate market conditions and launch the next steps in the refinancing process of the acquisition of HELLA.Faurecia is strongly committed to deleverage its financial structure  post the acquisition of HELLA. Even if the unexpected current market conditions impose some delay on the short term vs. the initial plan  Faurecia confirms that it will take all necessary actions to return as soon as possible to its deleveraging trajectory.SAVE THE DATESThe annual Shareholders’ meeting will be held at Faurecia’s headquarters  in Nanterre  on June 1  2022 (instead of June 8  2022  as previously announced on February 21  2022). A press release will be issued shortly to give all relevant details about this meeting.Medium-term 2025 perspectives for FORVIA will be presented at a Capital Markets Day to be held early November 2022.Faurecia's Q1 2022 sales presentation is also available on the Faurecia website: www.faurecia.comA webcast will be held today at 08:00am (Paris time).

It corresponds to net income of fully consolidated companies before:Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations;Other non-recurring operating income and expense  corresponding to material  unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization expenses and early retirement costs  the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business  the closure or sale of an industrial site  disposals of non-operating buildings  impairment losses recorded for property  plant and equipment or intangible assets  as well as other material and unusual losses;Income on loans  cash investments and marketable securities; Finance costs;Other financial income and expense  which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets  the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges  changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in relationship cannot be demonstrated under IFRS 9  and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries;Taxes.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation  this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).Net cash-flowNet cash-flow is defined as follow: Net cash from (used in) operating and investing activities less (acquisitions)/disposal of equity interests and businesses (net of cash and cash equivalents)  other changes and proceeds from disposal of financial assets.

For the balance of the year  I am fully confident in our teams’ ability to mitigate the multiple headwinds ahead and achieve our 2022 objectives.” said Gonzalve Bich  Chief Executive Officer.Story continues2022 Outlook (based on current market assumptions1F2)Given Q1 better-than-expected performance  we now expect to be at the high-end of our 7% to 9% Net Sales growth objective at constant currencies in 2022.The recent acceleration of input cost inflation is expected to have a negative impact on operating margins  and we are taking the necessary actions to mitigate this impact. We nonetheless expect FY 2022 adjusted EBIT to grow year-on-year in absolute terms  driven by higher volumes and positive price impact. We maintain our target of over 200 million euros Free Cash Flow.Q1 2022 KEY GROUP FINANCIAL FIGURESin million euros Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Group Net Sales 411.0 515.7 Change as reported +15.1% +25.5% Change on a comparative basis +20.9% +18.8% Change on a constant currency basis +25.6% +20.4% EBIT Margin 55.3% 19.0% Adjusted EBIT Margin 14.7% 19.8% EPS (in euros) 3.59 1.53 Adjusted EPS (in euros) 0.96 1.60 Free Cash Flow before acquisitions and disposals 36.0 (1.9) Net Cash Position 393.6 340.1Q1 2022 KEY HIGHLIGHTSTop-Line GrowthFirst Quarter 2022 Net Sales increased 20.4% at constant currencies and 18.8% on a comparative basis.Flame For Life was the main contributor to organic growth  with US Lighters contributing to 37% of the Group Net Sales growth on a comparative basis. The outstanding performance of Lighters’ Sell-in in the US (+29% growth) was fueled by the shipment of orders that could not be completed in Q4 2021 (approximately 17 pts of the growth)  and by significant distribution gains driven by strong commercial execution  the continued success of BIC EZ Reach Utility Pocket Lighter  and price impact (approximately 13 pts of the growth in total).Human Expression organic growth was notably driven by a solid Back-to-school Season in Brazil  where the Stationery market increased 72%3  driven by the coloring segment. We gained 0.5 pts of market share in value thanks to robust Point of Sales execution. The Core Stationery business performance in Europe and North America was notably driven by early Back-to-school orders (approximately 5 million euros impact on Q1 Net Sales). Mexico  South Africa  and India  which were strongly hit by the pandemic  recovered sharply  with high double-digit to triple-digit growth on a comparative basis.In Blade Excellence  value-added products continued to drive the performance of our one-piece business  accounting for more than 70% of the segment's growth in Q1.

The impact of input cost inflation (-3 pts compared to Q1 2021) was more than offset by favorable fixed cost absorption (+2.7 pts) and a positive pricing (+0.7 pts). Adjusted EBIT grew 68.3%  and adjusted EBIT margin was 19.8%  driven by strong Net Sales operating leverage (+6.3 pts)  which more than offset the increase in Freight and Distribution (-0.6 pts) and Brand Support (-1.0 pts). For the Full Year  and based on current market assumptions  total input cost inflation should weigh approximately 100 million euros on adjusted EBIT. This negative impact is expected to be more than offset by volume increase and and price adjustments.Cash FlowOperating Cash Flow reached 122.8 million euros  fueled by strong business performance. The -107.1 million euros change in Working Capital and others was driven by Trade and other Receivables (-49.3M€)  as a result of strong Net Sales growth  an increase in Inventory levels (- 84.9M€) due primarily to 2022 Back-to-school sell-in stock building to ensure supply to customers  and to a lesser extent  input cost inflation (Raw Material  Freight and Electricity). Q1 2022 Free Cash Flow before acquisitions and disposals was -1.9 million euros. The end of March Net Cash position was 340.1 million euros  and included 58.3 million euros used for the acquisition of Inkbox.UPDATE ON HORIZON PLAN EXECUTIONConsumer-centricity and InnovationConsistent with our Horizon Plan  Q1 Net Sales performance was fueled by a consumer-centric and strong innovation pipeline.

BIC Soleil Escape  our new female razor offering a sensorial experience  and the disposable version of Us  our gender-neutral shaver  were among the key drivers of year-to-date Blade Excellence's performance in the US.E-commerceTotal e-commerce sales were driven by double digit growth from Omniretailers  offsetting the slowdown of Pure Players  on the back of a strong Q1 2021  which was driven by post-pandemic inventory replenishment. Sales in developing markets grew more than 50%  driven by a triple-digit growth in India  and a strong performance from retail customers in Brazil. Our shaver business saw a strong start to the year with over 50% of Net Sales growth  driven by North America.Revenue Growth ManagementAs we continued our focus to drive complexity reduction across our portfolio  we achieved a 10% SKU reduction in Q1 2022.

(""Pharming"" or the ""Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) announces that it has received a positive decision from the UK's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on a Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) submission for leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS) in patients from 1 year of age to less than 18 years of age. The Company also announces that the MHRA has granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation to leniolisib for the treatment of APDS.A PIP is a development plan aimed at ensuring that the necessary data are obtained to support the marketing authorization of a medicine in the pediatric population. All applications for marketing authorization for new medicines in children require the results of studies as described in an agreed PIP  unless the medicine is exempt due to a deferral or waiver. The leniolisib PIP includes two planned global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS  the first in children ages 4-11 years and the second in children ages 1-6 years. The Company expects to initiate recruitment for this pediatric program for leniolisib during the second half of 2022.A PIM designation indicates that a medicinal product is a promising candidate for the MHRA's Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS)  which provides pre-market access to products that are intended for the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition and have the potential to address an unmet medical need.Anurag Relan MD  Pharming's Chief Medical Officer  commented:""We are pleased to have received agreement of this PIP and the PIM designation from the MHRA  these represent important regulatory milestones as we continue to advance leniolisib for the treatment of APDS  a rare  often debilitating  and sometimes fatal condition. The agreed PIP and the PIM designation further support our confidence in the potential of leniolisib to address APDS  as they provide us with a pathway toward marketing authorization in the United Kingdom. Pharming looks forward to continuing to work with regulatory authorities globally to bring leniolisib to patients with this significant unmet medical need as expeditiously as possible.""Leniolisib  which has received Orphan Drug Designation in Europe  received the same designation from the US Food and Drug Administration on January 30  2018.As previously announced  Pharming plans to begin submitting global registration filings for leniolisib in the second quarter of 2022 and  subject to approval  launching the treatment in the US in the first quarter of 2023 and starting a series of European launches in the second half of 2023.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that affects approximately one to two people per million. Also known as PASLI  it is caused by variants in either of two genes  PIK3CD or PIK3R1  that regulate maturation of white blood cells. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway.1 2 Balanced signaling in the PI3Kδ pathway is essential for physiological immune function. When this pathway is hyperactive  immune cells fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 3 APDS is characterized by severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 The only way to definitively diagnose this condition is through genetic testing.About leniolisibLeniolisib is a small-molecule inhibitor of the delta isoform of the 110 kDa catalytic subunit of class IA PI3K with immunomodulating and potentially anti-neoplastic activities. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate (PIP3). PIP3 serves as an important cellular messenger specifically activating AKT and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Unlike PI3Kα and PI3Kβ  which are ubiquitously expressed  PI3Kẟ and PI3Kγ are expressed primarily in cells of hematopoietic origin. The central role of PI3Kẟ in regulating numerous cellular functions of the adaptive immune system (B-cells and  to a lesser extent  T cells) as well as the innate immune system (neutrophils  mast cells  and macrophages) strongly indicates that PI3Kẟ is a valid and potentially effective therapeutic target for several immune diseases.To date  leniolisib has been well tolerated during both a Phase 1 first-in-human trial in healthy subjects and a Phase II/III registration-enabling study.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

The company is finalizing its seed round of funding and plans to do a Series A round later this year.Both Mazzarese and Mulvihill formerly worked at FXCM  and Mazzarese was previously Citi’s head of foreign exchange margin sales in the Americas.Rysin co-founded FastMatch FX  an electronic trading venue in the spot foreign exchange market  in 2012.Euronext acquired 90% of the company in 2017 for $153 million  and Rysin became the chief technology officer of the combined company. Prior to launching FastMatch  Rysin was the CTO of Credit Suisse’s fixed income clearing corporation division and head of core electronic trading.“I share the notion that institutional clients entering crypto will require low-latency infrastructure  advanced order logic and deep liquidity in addition to a robust list of coins on offer ” he said in a statement. “While it is still very early for institutional clients joining crypto  we are building our exchange for the future and are excited to become a primary venue for digital assets.”Institutional clients are not used to trading on cloud-based or locally hosted technology with limited support  Mazzarese said. They require response times measured in microseconds and reliable trade confirmations.Rysin’s experience in building ultra-low latency exchanges for large financial institutions will allow Crossover Markets Group to come to the market with one of the fastest and most robust matching engines in crypto  he said.“Our decision to build our product from scratch allows us to use the most cutting-edge technology  rather than rely on legacy tech that could be 10 or 15 years old already ” Mazzarese said. “We believe this is truly our differentiator.”Get the day’s top crypto news and insights delivered to your inbox every evening.

3671,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/euroclear-delivers-strong-q1-performance-080000090.html,Euroclear delivers a strong Q1 performance,Euroclear today provides an update on its financial and operational performance in the first quarter of 2022.,"BRUSSELS  April 27  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Euroclear today provides an update on its financial and operational performance in the first quarter of 2022.Financial SummaryEuroclear delivered a strong financial and operational performance in Q1 2022. Net profit increased +11% to EUR 134 million.Operating income was up +10% year-on-year to EUR 438 million driven by strong business income growth  up +9% to EUR 405 million and Interest  Banking and Other income up 39% to EUR 32 million.We increased our investments in technology in line with our strategy. Operating expenses increased to EUR 260 million  up 11% compared to Q1 2021.Sanctions related to the invasion of Ukraine have led to increased cash held on our balance sheet  which are explained further below.Chart 1Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1805340/Euroclear_1.jpgNote: 2021 figures have been restated to include MFEX pro forma  in order to allow for like-for-like comparison.Operational highlightsThroughout the first quarter  Euroclear continued to make strategic progress  while remaining focused on our responsibilities as a critical financial market infrastructure. This is reflected in the key operating metrics shown below:Q1 total % change vs Q1 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 37 trillion +8% Number of Transactions 80 million +5% Turnover EUR 270 trillion +13% Fund assets under custody EUR 3 trillion +12% Collateral Highway EUR 2 trillion +18%The integration of MFEX is progressing to plan as we combine MFEX's established fund distribution platforms with Euroclear's post-trade expertise to create a new end-to-end funds offering.We have also made two strategic investments during the first quarter.Firstly  we have further advanced Euroclear's digital strategy through our investment in Fnality  an international consortium of global banks and financial market infrastructures focused on building regulated payment systems to support the adoption of tokenised assets and marketplaces.Story continuesSecondly  we have progressed our sustainable finance and ESG strategy through an investment in Greenomy  a Belgium based sustainable finance technology platform. Greenomy helps corporates  credit institutions and asset managers comply with new European Union sustainable finance legislation by digitalising the data capturing and reporting processes.As part of our commitment to ESG  we are pleased to announce that Euroclear has taken the important step to reduce its global carbon footprint by committing to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We will now set CO2 reduction actions with the commitment to achieve net-zero value chain Green House Gas (GHG) emissions by no later than 2050.Implications from the invasion of Ukraine and SanctionsOur thoughts are with those affected by the humanitarian crisis resulting from the invasion of Ukraine. We have focused on supporting our staff  especially those of Ukrainian and Russian origin  as well as those in bordering countries.Euroclear is complying with the international sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine and has suspended all transactions with sanctioned entities since 28 February. In addition to ensuring all the sanctions are applied immediately and completely  our teams are supporting clients diligently in managing the exceptional situation. We are working closely with clients to apply all new rules fully and according to the spirit of the sanctions.A consequence of the sanctions is that assets owned by sanctioned parties are blocked in the respective financial market infrastructures  including Euroclear. As the assets mature through their lifecycle  cashflows (e.g. coupons and redemptions) that are normally transferred to the underlying parties accumulate on our balance sheet for as long as the sanctions remain in place. We do not expect these sanctions to affect our financial performance. During the first quarter  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by €23 billion year-on-year  for which the company is working on the mitigation of potential regulatory capital requirements.In light of these circumstances  the Board of Euroclear considers it to be prudent to wait until the second half of 2022 to formally decide on the dividend payment of EUR 88.5 per share (equating to a total of EUR 279 million) as announced in its full year results.Commenting on the results  Lieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer  said:""The invasion of Ukraine is deeply troubling and our thoughts are with all who are impacted. As a financial market infrastructure  we have an important role to play in a turbulent world. I am proud of the staff response as our people mobilised swiftly to apply the sanctions; to support clients during the exceptional circumstances; and to contribute to relief efforts for those affected. From a financial and operational perspective  Euroclear continues to perform very well  achieving another strong quarter as we continue to deliver on our strategy.""Appendix: Financial Statements for Euroclear Bank and Euroclear InvestmentsChart 2Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1805341/Euroclear_2.jpgAbout EuroclearEuroclear Group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

3674,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.fxempire.com/news/article/russian-sanctions-give-euroclear-a-capital-headache-981337,Russian sanctions give Euroclear a capital headache,By Huw Jones LONDON (Reuters) -   Securities settlement house Euroclear said on Wednesday it has delayed paying a dividend as it may need to set aside more capital to cover a swelling balance sheet due to Russian sanctions.,Belgium-based Euroclear  owned by an array of big banks and exchanges like the London Stock Exchange and Euronext  ensures transactions are completed with cash exchanged for legal ownership of assets.After Russia invaded Ukraine  the European Union barred Euroclear and rival Clearstream from serving Russian customers from Feb. 28 as Western powers severed ties with the country’s financial system.Euroclear said on Wednesday that during the first quarter its balance sheet rose by 23 billion euros ($24.41 billion) year-on-year  or nearly 80%.“We do not expect these sanctions to affect our financialperformance ” Euroclear said in a statement.It was now looking at what this means for “potential regulatory capital requirements” as the cashpile is expected to keep growing as sanctions remain in place for months  if not years  and redemptions and coupon payments on Russian assets fall due but can’t be transferred to underlying parties.Euroclear is looking to reinvest the money in money market funds or instruments such as short term commercial paper while the sanctions last  and risk from such investments typically need to be covered by capital in case they turn sour.“In light of these circumstances  the board of Euroclear considers it to be prudent to wait until the second half of 2022 to formally decide on the dividend payment of 88.5 euros per share  equating to a total of 279 million euros as announced in its full-year results ” Euroclear said.Euroclear said net profit in the first quarter rose by 11% to 134 million euros.($1 = 0.9422 euros)(Reporting by Huw Jones  Editing by Louise Heavens),negative,0.02,0.09,0.9,negative,0.02,0.21,0.77,True,English,"['Russian sanctions', 'capital headache', 'Euroclear', 'short term commercial paper', 'potential regulatory capital requirements', 'London Stock Exchange', 'money market funds', 'big banks', 'legal ownership', 'European Union', 'Russian customers', 'Western powers', 'financial system', 'first quarter', 'balance sheet', 'financial performance', 'coupon payments', 'underlying parties', 'second half', 'dividend payment', 'full-year results', 'net profit', 'Huw Jones', 'Louise Heavens', '23 billion euros', '279 million euros', '134 million euros', 'Russian assets', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', '88.5 euros', '0.9422 euros', 'array', 'exchanges', 'Euronext', 'transactions', 'Ukraine', 'rival', 'Clearstream', 'Feb.', 'country', 'Wednesday', 'sanctions', 'statement', 'cashpile', 'place', 'months', 'years', 'redemptions', 'instruments', 'risk', 'investments', 'case', 'light', 'circumstances', 'board', 'share', 'total']",2022-04-27,2022-04-27,fxempire.com

Included in adjusted EBITDA was a foreign exchange gain of $28.4 million.Doug Pferdehirt  Chair and CEO of TechnipFMC  stated  “ Looking at the first quarter  total Company revenue was $1.6 billion  with adjusted EBITDA of $154 million. Total Company inbound orders were $2.2 billion  driving sequential growth in backlog. With cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.2 billion and our confidence that we will generate strong free cash flow in the second half of the year  we are taking aggressive steps to further reduce debt in the second quarter. This is another important milestone on our path to shareholder distributions.”Pferdehirt continued  “ In Subsea  inbound orders of $1.9 billion increased more than 80 percent when compared to the fourth quarter  resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5. We announced two awards in the period  including our first iEPCI™ project with Wintershall Dea for the Maria field. The breadth of operators and regional diversification was particularly notable in the quarter  with projects from more than 30 clients across all major offshore basins. We continue to anticipate Subsea order growth of up to 30 percent in 2022  with iEPCI™  direct awards and Subsea services together approaching 75 percent of total inbound.”“ Surface Technologies inbound orders were $291 million  with a book-to-bill above 1.0  driven by strength in the U.S. market. North American sales and profitability grew sequentially  driven by increased drilling and completion activity and an improved pricing environment. Outside of North America  we are investing in new manufacturing capacity in Saudi Arabia to support the strong Middle East outlook. We are now undergoing final production testing and expect final certification of the facility by the end of the second quarter  at which time we anticipate an acceleration of orders in-country. We remain confident in meeting our full-year expectations.”Pferdehirt added  “ First quarter results demonstrated our ability to effectively navigate the ongoing challenges facing the global supply chain. While not immune to the market dislocations  we have taken many strategic actions over the last several years that have mitigated the near-term effects on our Company. Our internal efforts to drive simplification  standardization and industrialization are also transforming our supply chain.”Pferdehirt concluded  “ We are in the midst of a multi-year upcycle for oil and gas investment. Our Subsea Opportunity List highlights this very robust market outlook  representing an opportunity set of larger projects that totals more than $20 billion in potential industry awards over the next 24 months. In the current environment  we are also experiencing improvements in pricing and contractual arrangements that more appropriately balance the terms and conditions needed to support this growth.”Operational and Financial HighlightsSubseaFinancial Highlights Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in financial schedules.

Net income  excluding charges and credits  as well as measures derived from it (including Diluted EPS  excluding charges and credits; Income before net interest expense and taxes  excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted Operating profit""); Depreciation and amortization  excluding charges and credits; Earnings before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted EBITDA""); and net cash) are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges and credits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate TechnipFMC's operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period  and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked or misleading to both investors and management by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management as performance measures in determining certain incentive compensation. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors in addition to  not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of the most comparable financial measures under GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures.

3684,Euroclear,Google API,https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/euroclear-delivers-strong-q1-performance-080000195.html,Euroclear delivers a strong Q1 performance,13 hours ago,"BRUSSELS  April 27  2022 /CNW/ -- Euroclear today provides an update on its financial and operational performance in the first quarter of 2022.Financial SummaryEuroclear delivered a strong financial and operational performance in Q1 2022. Net profit increased +11% to EUR 134 million.Operating income was up +10% year-on-year to EUR 438 million driven by strong business income growth  up +9% to EUR 405 million and Interest  Banking and Other income up 39% to EUR 32 million.We increased our investments in technology in line with our strategy. Operating expenses increased to EUR 260 million  up 11% compared to Q1 2021.Sanctions related to the invasion of Ukraine have led to increased cash held on our balance sheet  which are explained further below.Chart 1Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1805340/Euroclear_1.jpgNote: 2021 figures have been restated to include MFEX pro forma  in order to allow for like-for-like comparison.Operational highlightsThroughout the first quarter  Euroclear continued to make strategic progress  while remaining focused on our responsibilities as a critical financial market infrastructure. This is reflected in the key operating metrics shown below:Q1 total % change vs Q1 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 37 trillion +8% Number of Transactions 80 million +5% Turnover EUR 270 trillion +13% Fund assets under custody EUR 3 trillion +12% Collateral Highway EUR 2 trillion +18%The integration of MFEX is progressing to plan as we combine MFEX's established fund distribution platforms with Euroclear's post-trade expertise to create a new end-to-end funds offering.We have also made two strategic investments during the first quarter.Firstly  we have further advanced Euroclear's digital strategy through our investment in Fnality  an international consortium of global banks and financial market infrastructures focused on building regulated payment systems to support the adoption of tokenised assets and marketplaces.Story continuesSecondly  we have progressed our sustainable finance and ESG strategy through an investment in Greenomy  a Belgium based sustainable finance technology platform. Greenomy helps corporates  credit institutions and asset managers comply with new European Union sustainable finance legislation by digitalising the data capturing and reporting processes.As part of our commitment to ESG  we are pleased to announce that Euroclear has taken the important step to reduce its global carbon footprint by committing to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We will now set CO2 reduction actions with the commitment to achieve net-zero value chain Green House Gas (GHG) emissions by no later than 2050.Implications from the invasion of Ukraine and SanctionsOur thoughts are with those affected by the humanitarian crisis resulting from the invasion of Ukraine. We have focused on supporting our staff  especially those of Ukrainian and Russian origin  as well as those in bordering countries.Euroclear is complying with the international sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine and has suspended all transactions with sanctioned entities since 28 February. In addition to ensuring all the sanctions are applied immediately and completely  our teams are supporting clients diligently in managing the exceptional situation. We are working closely with clients to apply all new rules fully and according to the spirit of the sanctions.A consequence of the sanctions is that assets owned by sanctioned parties are blocked in the respective financial market infrastructures  including Euroclear. As the assets mature through their lifecycle  cashflows (e.g. coupons and redemptions) that are normally transferred to the underlying parties accumulate on our balance sheet for as long as the sanctions remain in place. We do not expect these sanctions to affect our financial performance. During the first quarter  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by €23 billion year-on-year  for which the company is working on the mitigation of potential regulatory capital requirements.In light of these circumstances  the Board of Euroclear considers it to be prudent to wait until the second half of 2022 to formally decide on the dividend payment of EUR 88.5 per share (equating to a total of EUR 279 million) as announced in its full year results.Commenting on the results  Lieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer  said:""The invasion of Ukraine is deeply troubling and our thoughts are with all who are impacted. As a financial market infrastructure  we have an important role to play in a turbulent world. I am proud of the staff response as our people mobilised swiftly to apply the sanctions; to support clients during the exceptional circumstances; and to contribute to relief efforts for those affected. From a financial and operational perspective  Euroclear continues to perform very well  achieving another strong quarter as we continue to deliver on our strategy.""Appendix: Financial Statements for Euroclear Bank and Euroclear InvestmentsChart 2Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1805341/Euroclear_2.jpgAbout EuroclearEuroclear Group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

Welcome to the Deutsche Borse anaylst and investor conference call regarding the Q1 2022 results remote.Jan StreckerWelcome  ladies and gentlemen. And thank you for joining us today to go through our first-quarter 2022 results. With me are Theodor Weimer  Chief Executive Officer  and Gregor Pottmeyer  Chief Financial Officer. Theodor and Gregor will take you through the presentation. Afterwards  we will be happy to take your questions. The presentation materials for this call has been sent out via email and can also be downloaded from the Investor Relations section of our website. As usual  the conference call will be recorded and is available for replay afterwards. With this  let me now hand over to you Theodor.Theodor WeimerThank you  Jan. Welcome ladies and gentlemen from my side  as well. Well  let's start today's call with a brief overview of the financial highlights and the key developments in the first quarter. Afterwards  Gregor  our CFO  will be presenting the financial results in greater detail. In contrast to last year  our regular secular growth achievements and a contribution from M and A have been complemented by strong cyclical tailwinds. This has contributed to our net revenue growth of 24% to a record quarterly level of more than £1 billion; 2  to the operating leverage of our business model the EBITDA even increased by 32% during the first quarter. Secular net revenue growth at 8%  both slightly above our guidance. This was particularly driven by product innovation in financial derivatives  an increase of market shares in commodities  the growing demand for ESG related products at ISS  and the continued trend towards outsourcing in the fund industry. M&A contributed another 5% net revenue growth.This was mainly driven by the contribution of the remaining 2 months of ISS  which we started to consolidate in March last year. We also continued to implement our M&A strategy and have closed the acquisition of [Indiscernible]  a leading fund data manager  in March this year. This will further strengthen our fund service business because we can now offer data management and regulatory reporting services to our existing client base. The strong cyclical tailwinds resulted from higher volatility in almost all asset losses  and accordingly  hedging needs of our clients increased significantly.This was very visible in commodities and equities  but fixed income and FX benefited as well. In total  cyclical net revenue growth amounted to 11%  which also includes the one-off effects from the REGIS-TR disposal  and some benefits from the stronger U.S. dollar. With a much more positive top-line development compared to last year  we slightly increased investments in growth and infrastructure.This is why other constant currency basis to organic operating costs increased by 5% in the quarter. But we also continued to increase productivity through our continuous improvement program. This helped offset most of the inflationary pressures. such as quite frankly  strong start to the year is very likely from today's perspective that we will exceed our full-year guidance. With that  let me now hand it over to you  GregorGregor PottmeyerThank you  Theodor. On Page 2  we showed the first quarter results of [Indiscernible] in detail. While cyclically boosted net revenue  we saw a nice improvement of the operating leverage and an organic earnings growth of 30%. The result from financial investments include around €17 million from our investment in the Illuminate fintech fund. This is driven by the market-to-market valuation of the fund and the partial disposal of our holding of the fund. In addition  the line item includes a gain of around €12 million from the sale of the [Indiscernible] stake in the U.S. derivatives exchange FairX to Coinbase. Depreciation includes a software impairment of around €6 million on the buying agent services that were developed at Eurex. This is the result of the decision by the European Commission to remove the buying application from the CFR regulation for an indefinite time. The financial result includes a one-off gain of around €4 million from an interest rate hedge. This is related to the senior bond we placed at the end of March. We secured an attractive interest rate level already in 2021 which reduces the effective yield of the bond to around 0.6%.The proceeds from the issue of the bond will be used to refinance the corporate bond maturing in October 2022. On Slide 3  we give you an overview of the quarterly results in the new segment reporting structure. We have simplified our reporting structure by reducing the number of segments from eight to four and applying a more product driven approach. The new segments are Data and Analytics  which comprises Contigo and ISS  Trading and Clearing  which is Eurex  EX  Xetra  and 360T  Fund Services  which is identical with Clearstream investment fund service business and Security Services  which consists of core equity and fixed income custody and settlement business of Clearstream. We have also simplified the net revenue line items within the segments  but you still will find most details disclosed in the appendix of this presentation.I'm now turning to the quarterly results of the segments  starting with data and analytics on Page 4. The segment performance was mainly driven by the continued out performance of ISS compared to our expectations. On an organic and constant currency basis  ISS 's net revenue increased by around 19%. The ESG business was mainly driven by higher double-digit growth in ESG analytics and corporate solutions.Governance solutions also performed well. The index business saw a mix of tailwinds from Eurex exchange licenses and some headwinds from market valuation in ETF licenses. Analytics saw some headwinds from slightly higher point in time net revenue in the same period last year. Let me turn to Slide 5 into Trading and Clearing segment. The overall segment clearly benefited from higher volatility and increased hedging needs  particularly in commodities and financial derivatives. Financial derivatives were driven by equity and equity index related derivatives with a 25% net revenue increase. Interest rate-related product also performed well.They include interest rate derivatives and the OTC clearing with an overall net revenue increase of 21%. The strongest [Indiscernible] in the segment was achieved by commodities. On the one hand  this was due to higher trading and hedging needs that we incurred. On the other hand  the margin fees continued to increase in the quarter amounted to €16 million. Since hedging was the main driver for trading activity in the quarter  net revenue in cash equities did not call quite as much as other parts of the segments  but still achieved a plus of 5%. Demand for our foreign exchange products including swaps and forwards was significantly higher compared to previous quarters  and net revenue increased by 18%. The Fund Services segments which you can find on page 6  continued its strong performance in the first quarter.Due to onboarding of new clients and portfolios  cyclical headwinds from market valuations in equities and bonds were over compensated. As a result  we exceeded our organic cost target of around 10% despite cyclical headwinds. To further complement the fund service of our we acquired Kneip at the end of March. Kneip is a leader in firm data management and reporting solutions for the asset management industry. The expectation is already closed and form the basis for creating a leading fund data up with significant cross-selling potential into our existing client base. In addition  we announced a partnership with a global wealth management platform  FNZ 2 weeks ago. Together  we will create a leading business intelligence solutions provider and help rollout fronts distribution services into FNZ  client basis in the UK. Our security services segment on slide 7 benefited from the divestiture of REGIS-TR.But also saw solid growth despite some market headwinds. The divestiture of Clearstream 50% stakes in REGIS-TR to ICBA CLIA resided in a one-off proceeds of around £49 million  and at the same time in a recurring decline of net revenue by around 5 million euro per quarter. Headwinds from lower equity market valuations and a slight decline of retail participation  they're overcompensated by solid leverage of fixed income issuance activity. The net interest income started to develop more positively and amounted to around £19 million. This is mainly because of increase in cash balances in the quarter. On [Indiscernible] we discontinued the cash handling fee on U.S. dollar balances after the first set rate hike in March.This means that the potential further hikes will directly translate in higher net interest income. The current sensitivity is an increase of short-term interest rate by a 100 basis points higher that'll expand the NII by around £90 million on an annualized basis. The last page of today's presentation shows our guidance for 2022 in the context of our midterm plan.Due to stronger-than-expected cyclical net revenue growth in the first quarter  we currently expect more than €3.8 billion of net revenue and more than €2.2 billion Europe EBITDA. Previously  we had only committed ourselves to achieving something around these values for both KPIs. Taking the first quarter into consideration and leaving our assumptions for the rest of the year unchanged  we would currently be looking at roughly €70 million of additional net revenue for the full-year.Since we are expecting the U.S. dollar to remain strong and since we continue to invest slightly more  the up side to the EBITDA guidance would be somewhat less than €70 million. But still  there are nine months to go in the year  though there could be both cyclical headwind  as well as tailwinds to the close  we [Indiscernible] expect. Headwind  could for instance arise from a recession in Europe as a result of the war in the Ukraine or [Indiscernible] line of volatility and volumes into the second half of the year  similar to the development in 2020. Tailwinds could arise if U.S. interest rate are increasing to 2% or more to go at year-end  which is current the market expectation. This concludes our presentation. We're now looking forward to your questions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorLadies and gentlemen [Operator Instructions]. And the first question comes from Andrew Coombs from Citi. Over to you.Andrew CoombsOpening. I did 3 questions [Indiscernible] I can do very short one and followed by the main question. The short factor one is  can you provide the AuA in Clearstream Fund Centre or the fund distribution AuA? That could be done in the appendix. I would appreciate figuring that. And then the main question is just on the NII sensitivity. You talked about the revised charging in March to now it should flow through  previous set between 25 basis points is $19 million. Does that still stand? And are there any offsets elsewhere? They could come Q3 to finance expense line or when anywhere out that we should be aware of. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerSure  Andrew. Thanks for your questions. AUA at Fund Center is roughly €400 billion with regard to the sensitivity of the NIR liberated that having currently roughly 9 billion customer cash balances in U.S. dollar. So a rate increased by 1% translates into €90 million. So that is a sensitivity. You can take for your model.Andrew CoombsI meant no offset to many other changes in pricing or you'd have any floating rate debt issued which is dollar sensitive  anything in those lines?Gregor PottmeyerNo. There is no compensating effect.Andrew CoombsPerfect. And just on follow-up on the first point  the 400  I think you said 400 now for the last three quarters  we've been in a negative mark-to-market impact on that fund [Indiscernible]Jan StreckerAnd -- well  that's the rough number  though  unfortunately  we don't have it readily available per month yet  we're working on that. So definitely as you can see from the revenues  there was a little bit of a headwind from equity and fixed income valuations but I think we've nicely offset this also through growth in terms of declined base and the funds that are covered.Andrew CoombsPerfect. Okay. Thank you.OperatorNext up is Haley Tam from Credit Suisse. Over to you.Haley TamAfternoon. Thank you very much for taking my question. I wanted to ask about all the different components of secular growth but I guess I will pick just one  therefore  to ask about. If I can ask you about the ESG data  revenue growth  obviously it was very strong year-on-year but has been partly stable I think for the last three quarters. So I just wondered  can you help us understand how to think about this business? Is it like an annual subscription model that we should see the growth come through once a year or is there something else that's causing that stability? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes  Haley  thanks for the question. Obviously  ESG is one of the key cost driver for [Indiscernible] business today at 7% to 8% of the overall group's net revenue and it will continuously increase obviously over the next year. [Indiscernible] higher organic growth on that side. In the first quarter  it was roughly 30% on a constant portfolio basis  so that's obviously higher than in the other business areas  and we expect that this trend will continue to happen in the future. Secondly  we will continue to look for M&A in this area so that we also increase our bases here. So the singular drivers here are basically two components in ESG  it's our ISS business obviously; and secondly  it's also our EEX business what contributes a lot. So these are the two main drivers for this ESG cost.Haley TamThank you  Gregor. If I can clarify  in the ISS ESG data revenue line  I think it was about €50 million -- €51 million for the last three quarters. That's a stable number I should expect. And really  I should be looking at the EEX business for growth  is that the right interpretation?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. So as you're also focusing on the recurring elements or -- usually in that kind of business in ISS it's a returning revenue  and so that you should see sustainable and continued growth here with regard to EAX. Obviously there's also a trading component to what the conceited idea is  the [Indiscernible] with this. And then therefore we have a clear classification  and here we expect that this will also continue to grow on a secular basis. Today it's more than 40% of the increase over the next year  so there's a secular component. But definitely there's also a current -- a cyclical component as overall  there are also higher market volatility  but in principle it's more a secular trend.Haley TamThank you very much.OperatorThe next question comes from Arnaud Giblat from BnP Exane. The floor is yours.Arnaud GiblatYes. Good morning. Good afternoon. Sorry  very quick follow-up and my main question  if I may. The follow-up  the first is cash equity yields have come off a bit this quarter versus previous quarters. I'm just wondering what's going on in the mix since that's maybe a little the top participation that's making a bit. My second question is with regards to ISS mostly from distribution. Do you see a significant consolidation opportunity ahead? Could mean there's some logic transactions happening there. And more important  if there's any potential transaction into issues with the competition commission. I think we've been there before but how should we think about that in terms of market definition? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Arnaud  let me pick up the second question. The [Indiscernible] the consolidation on the ISS. I tend to be very clear and outspoken  right? There are no plans on our side to enter into any consolidation games which might arise at the fall or rise near because there's such a strong organic growth that we see no need and be. We feel comfortable with our acquisition which we have done  right? When we acquired. So let's be very clear here We feel extremely well with what we have acquired so far.Theodor WeimerAnd on cash equity and all  it's basically the product mix. What we've seen is a quite substantial decline actually in retail trading compared to the strong previous year  and retail trading typically has a higher fee margin or the product mix is changed  but nothing really structured.Arnaud GiblatThank you.OperatorOur next question comes from Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.Benjamin GoyHi  good afternoon. Just wanted to check on your M&A higher power. Can you confirm where you're standing was  the upper target? And would that mean that we should expect more of the same  meaning this 200 million type acquisition here and day-out  or do you see there's more room to grow in organically? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerThanks  Benjamin. As we got through M&A of higher power  I think you're aware that we're a strong cash flow generating business. So on a yearly basis we roughly generate €1.5 billion in cash flow  so let's say €600 million for dividend  let's say €200 million for CapEx  so it remains roughly €700 million. So you can see that we generate very quickly on cash and therefore  on a higher power from a funding perspective  we see [Indiscernible] to do transactions we would like to do. From a rating perspective  we are also now back on track with regard to our debt levels. So obviously with this on Q1 and with this year expectation here so we will come back through the agreed on KPIs with the rating agents [Indiscernible]. So no reflections from a firepower perspective as we got to M&A. As we got through our M&A strategy  I think you are aware that roughly a €150 million are missing for our 2023 target so long favorite it's roughly €600 million what we contribute with the 5% M&A contribution over the four years  roughly €450 million was already have already delivered  so meeting a €150 million  and that's still potentially the level we definitely want to achieve  but currently there's no big pressure. So if we find an attractive target then obviously we can look at it and no pressure from that point of view.Benjamin Goy[Indiscernible]. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Mike Werner from UBS.Michael WernerThank you very much. Just a question on the -- within trading and clearing the revenues per contract or the revenues per volume within equities and interest rate derivatives. We saw volumes up quite strongly in both  and surprisingly  also we did see a bit of an uptake as well in the yields on those products year-on-year. I was just wondering -- usually  we tend to see the opposite  but I was just wondering what was going on in the next year. Thank you.Jan StreckerNo  Mike. At Eurex  typically  there are no significant volume rebates or aside from market making rebates  it's pretty much price list fees. But what we've seen and what also contributed to the secular growth in trading and clearing in Eurex  is basically new products and product innovations or MSCI derivatives  dividend derivatives  volatility derivatives  and so on  typically  are higher price  so they help to bring up the [Indiscernible] already for the last couple of quarters  at least modestly.Michael WernerThank you. And just perhaps a follow-up with regards to the interest rate derivatives. In terms of the over-the-counter business  I'm just curious to hear how that progressed in the over-the-counter clearing. How did that progress in Q1?Theodor WeimerExcept for the effect that we funded it'd now an interest rate derivative doesn't mean it has not performed well. It has indeed performed extremely well. It was the strongest quarter ever with close to €90 million of net revenue.Michael WernerThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.Bruce HamiltonHi  good afternoon  guys and congratulations on the numbers. Quick one  maybe on the M&A landscape and you've been quite clear  it sounds like on the ISS and your view that actually what you have there is growing very nicely  you no need to acquire  to further grow. So what are the nice  interesting areas as you assess the landscape today? And has that changed the total? It sounds like ESG would still be a big focus  perhaps data as well. So I'm just interested in what you're saying. And then just to confirm on the net EBITDA  what you're saying. If you are now at 1.75 times as at the end of Q1 will take so just I make sure I've answered it. Thank you.Theodor WeimerThank you  Bruce. From my side  let me firstly position our M&A strategy in the context of the current environment. First  you need to understand  right  if we are benefiting from strong tailwinds  then our operating model works perfectly  so our EBITDA margin goes up  right? Which is probably nice for you and for us both? On the other side  if you do M&A  there is a tendency that M&A has a negative effect on the EBITDA margin because it's very hard to find as profitable companies as we run our own company. And therefore  we run this smart balance of we want to keep the high margins  but also we want to grow our business smartly forward. But there is no need and no pressure from our side. We don't feel pressed in a situation like this where still the valuations are pretty high. We don't think we should let ourselves get in a position that we feel pressed by the markets whereby anybody out there that we should go eventually towards the M&A route.As a rule of thumb  until the year 2020  we have grown by M&A on average by 2% per year  2%. Our target is now in the range of 5%. What we have started in 2020 until 2023  we want to grow to 5% and we are actually exactly on the 5%  as Gregor and I pointed out during our first part of the presentation. So we feel we are pretty well underway  there have come great opportunities out there. We look at those and we have proven that we are in a position to do deals. We have done [Indiscernible] and of course  the key areas we are predominantly focused on the pre -trading and the funds areas. That's what we have done so far and definitely will continue. But again  we're in a pretty good track already and we are not pressed. We are rather focused on the good opportunities  to identify good opportunities. We are less constrained by the financial situation.Gregor PottmeyerAs we got to the financial  so what we agreed upon it's what you said  that the net-debt EBITDA is 1.75%  is our target  and the other KPI is FFO net-debt free funds from operation  that's 50%. And so these are the two KPIs we agreed upon to come back at the end of the year with the rating agencies.Bruce HamiltonGreat. Thank you very much.OperatorThe next step is Kyle Voigt from KBW.Kyle VoigtHi  thank you for taking my question. So in Clearstream  settlement activity was down 17% year-on-year  but cash balance has grown 13%. I'm wondering why you think there's such a divergence there. And does that imply that the balances may currently be slightly elevated as clients are parking cash here because they still have very few alternatives to get higher yields? And lastly  is it reasonable to assume that as rates continue to move higher  your clients may migrate some of those balances out of Clearstream for yield alternatives? Thank you.Jan StreckerYeah  Kyle. There's no direct immediate correlation. So indeed the cash balances are driven by settlement  but only by the ICSE settlements or the international settlement  not by the domestic ones. And therefore  the numbers might not quite match up. What we've seen last time around  so when interest rates went down  and when we introduced the cash handling fee  that balances actually went down. So our question remains whether this is now a sign that balances are even structurally increasing  that needs to be seen. So apparently clients borrowing a little bit more about an explicit charge and not sort of an implicit cost. So from that angle it's a little bit early to predict  but we definitely wouldn't believe they would go down substantially. So either they remain stable  driven by settlement activity  or maybe they even trend slightly upwards as we have seen in marginal.Kyle VoigtUnderstood. Thank you.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Philip Middleton from the Bank of America. Philip  your line is up now. We cannot hear you  maybe you're still on mute.Philip MiddletonYeah. You've booked some gains on your financial assets  basically on the venture portfolio. I know there was some disposals in there to which well-done but in general  this is a difficult quarter for venture investing. And how come you're like -- you sounds like you've experienced positive mark-to-market  what's going on there and how are you feeling about the next quarter or two in terms of valuation of these assets?Gregor PottmeyerYeah. Thanks  Philip  for the questions. Obviously to make some prediction on a quarterly basis is a little bit difficult. So what we see is a continued increasing contribution out of our financial SSVP invested. And so since beginning of [Indiscernible] I joined here  one of this is path to professionals this year  and we have done very successful investments here over the last three years and we see the benefits now. And last year we told you that so far over the last few years  you haven't seen anything in our P&L because all of the gains are booked against our equity  and now we made for a certain investment  we changed it specifically for the new ones because if you had made the decision that -- three years ago that you're showing on an -- just into balance sheet on equity basis then you can change it. So it has to be done in the first time. And therefore  we decided now for different SFC acquired recently or what the last month that you see a fair value -- valuation in our P&L. And we have single investments  that we have to make a decision  and we have also some portfolio investments. And this was the case now in Q1. It was illuminate. So here is to invest more in the Fintech portfolio and not in a specific thing investment. And this is shown in our P&L. So it's the [Indiscernible] positive elements here. If they are disposals or even some [Indiscernible] [Indiscernible] you see this in our P&L.And there are many others and now -- where you could see potential impact. And it really depends whether a transaction takes place  yes or no. So for instance  our 360X business and as the leadership of [Indiscernible]  we talked about non-financial FX building platforms  market infrastructure plays based on blockchain technology. If you would see here on transaction  here  you would also see then a P&L impact. Though the general message is  if we will continue to do successful investments here in that area  you will see continued positive contributions here in our P&L for that.Philip MiddletonOkay  thank you. But the overall environment still hasn't been [Indiscernible] helpful  so you did well in Q1 for idiosyncratic reasons?Gregor PottmeyerNo  there are obviously positive and negative elements and now as you have seen  Illuminate obviously there was a very positive element. There was another  it was participation in FairX what we hold at [Indiscernible]  what we have at [Indiscernible] made a transaction for various attractive pricing and therefore there's another $13 million U.S. positive impact here. So these were the two main drivers for Q1 but over the next quarter  it could be different elements that would contribute. It really depends on whether a transaction takes place  yes or no.Philip MiddletonOkay  thank you.OperatorAnd the next question comes from Ian White from Autonomous Research.Ian WhiteHi  afternoon. Thanks today. Thanks for the presentation. I had one follow-up and one potential question  please. The follow-up is trend; I think is the final comment you made around guidance that this year. And can I just clarify  please? I heard 17 million of additional net revenue versus the previous guidance  less than that on EBITDA. And assuming that U.S. rates go to 2% by year-end. And if I got that correct  please from which I have misunderstood on what you're saying there in terms of the assumptions on depending. There is a tweak  you've made to the guidance for FY22. And then my question really just tasks for a bit more detail on commodity trading. What do you think that in terms of the breadth of participation in counter-party growth in the first quarter? And could you say a bit about the challenges we're seeing in some energy markets around high collateral requirements for end-users and how you see that developing over the coming quarters  please. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. With regard to the questions with regard guidance  when I mentioned the €70 million  so that is the surplus we achieved in Q1 compared to our plan. And obviously  when the second comment you made  they had included a 2% Fed fund rate at the end of the year; obviously not  because I talked about €70 million in Q1. So if the Fed rate would go up to 2%  obviously  it would be additional upside potentially for what is not included so far. Your second question around the commodity business. Yes  obviously  was another 40% net revenue increase. High market activity here in power and in gas  strong increase in pricing  and yes indeed  there was a strong increase in our margins we asked for in our collateral. And the good thing is that there were no surprises for the market participants. So the model growth is designed and/or the market participants were able to deliver the collateral. But nevertheless  it's obviously a stress situation at some peak times at ECC  so our clearing house for power and for gas  we had €70 billion margin and it's now reduced to closer to €40 billion but even the €70 billion or the market participants they are able to deliver are definitely expressive duration. But we are in a good dialogue with all the market participants and so far  the [Indiscernible] and everybody is highly interested that this market solution will also continue to happen so that you have a reasonable pricing  that you have a reasonable allocation of gas and power supply  and this also was strongly supported by our German government but also from EU commission perspective. So that is in principle the target to let the markets open and to have a clear price discovery process and the market driven solution.Ian WhiteGot it. Thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Tobias Lukesch from Kepler Cheuvreux.Tobias LukeschAnd it's good afternoon. Three questions from my side if I may as well. I wanted some costs in one on your performance in the potential recessionary environment. On the cross I mean on the 22 development I think now you have some leeway  especially compared to last year. And I was wondering now with the segments down to 4  could give us maybe a bit of an indication how costs will develop segmentalwise. Do you see one segment with especially stronger investment needs and the other one  well  are there some products where you think that this will be extended to overall view on the cost base. And secondly. you mentioned that if we have a more troubled economy  that also Deutsche Börse  of course would suffer. And then maybe could you point out the product lines which you would see most at risk at performing at the expected underlying levels. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  to be [Indiscernible] as we've got to the cost  obviously  it's good that we were able to show cost discipline in the first quarter where there's a 5% cost growth on a constant portfolio and constant ethics basis  I think that's a very clear thing now to you and to our investors that we will continue to do prudent cost management. Obviously  a strong development in Q1 would give us some leeway  and obviously that's obviously good if it has that kind of leverage. But you will see for the next nine months a prudent cost management from digital management here again. With regards to your second question  that's a little bit of speculation  but nevertheless  you cannot rule out that a consequence of this Russia - Ukraine war crisis could be potentially a recession. And so there are some scenarios of some 2% or even a little bit more reduction of GDP in Europe this year. So it's -- but it's more or less just a scenario planning. So it's not the base case scenario so far  but the best case scenario if still at 2% to 3% GDP growth  so here we are talking about some negative scenario. And then it really depends on what really happen  what is the reason for our potential recession. It's the reason that there's a shutdown of guests’ delivery out of Russia and so that most probably more industry and companies would be impacted by that. So -- and then there wouldn't be such a big impact on our side but there could be also a different scenario. So in principle  we just wanted to say  look  after the COVID development in 2020  so we had also a very strong Q1 and then we said  look  in the second half year  it could be potentially some cyclical headwind and unfortunately  we have seen that. So we just wanted to remind all of us if there would be a stronger recession  obviously market activity would be reduced and also less volatility so that we cannot rule out even if it's not our base case.Tobias LukeschYeah  thank you. So on the cross side  I take that there is no special investment need on the specific product line or set news but it's more across the board  right?Gregor PottmeyerNo  if we see interesting opportunities  then we would have the freedom to invest here. But -- so prudent cost management is important for Deutsche Börse.Tobias Lukesch[Indiscernible] Thank you.OperatorAnd next up is Johannes Thormann from high HSBC.Johannes ThormannGood afternoon  everybody. I'm Johannes from HSBC. Two questions from me. First of all  on Kneip  could you provide a bit more details how you really want to target the synergies you're promising in the fund services business? And secondly  would it be fair to say that the annualized revenue contribution is about €30 million for the next years? And secondly  on Axioma  if we look at the year-on-year decline in revenues  is this a fixed [Indiscernible]  which would surprise or what are the reasons for [Indiscernible]? It looks like the current business performance of Axioma completely different to the picture drawn by [Indiscernible] at the time of the deal. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah. You can address trends  but fair enough. And so tonight  annualized cost is more in the range of £22 million to €25 million so that's the number of EVP expect on an annualized basis for this year. So it's not 30 million you mentioned. But obviously this wasn't very strategic direction and efficient for us. So we always told you that we have two strong legs in the investment fund service business  so there's the settlement and the custody leg. Secondly  we have now the fund distribution leg with the acquisition of specifically UPF fund center and we missed the fund data leg. So obvious now a third leg and that's exactly what we need. Now  when we talk to customers so we can offer now the full range of the value chain as regard to the fund service business. And therefore we think there are we naturally by the range that we obviously create additional services for our customers. So we can definitely do hear some cross-selling  and so there should be very positive element out of that. If I got to your second question Axioma.Yes indeed  the performance is not as good as we have targeted when we made the acquisition. Sure there is some corona impact out of that. But more specifically in Q1  if you take that comparison with Q1 last year  then in Q1 last year we had a relatively high share of point in time revenue. So -- And therefore  on these IFS numbers  as you see here  another very strong performance. If you would go like what others do  more on an onewave perspective  and we are currently working on that model that we also show you some onewave expected for the for the next 12 months basically  then you would see double-digit growth on the Axioma side. Here it's not as good as [Indiscernible] because usually in the past there was a growth rate of 15%-20%  so currently we are not there. But the onewave concept would show a better performance that now the IFRS numbers.Johannes ThormannUnderstood  thank you.OperatorAnd now we have Benjamin Bathurst from RBC Capital Markets on the line.Benjamin BathurstAfternoon  all. Thanks for taking my question. Can I ask what was the proportion of overall group revenues from recurring sources in Q1. And there's a follow-up to that. Do you have any updated view on prospects for growing that proportion in 2020 versus 2021  just in light of the strong cyclical contribution to revenue growth in Q1?Gregor PottmeyerYeah  exactly. So the number is 52% recurring revenues. It's a little bit below the share we achieved last year  we were about 55%. And the reason for that is that we have now more equit -- last year we had cyclical headwinds and now we have one cyclical tailwind  and that's the reason why the nonrecurring elements are cyclical driven higher  but in principal  over the next 2 to 3 years. So our expectation is that the recurring revenue number will increase out of stronger performance. We already talked about ESG products and then data analytics what usually has higher growth space  so it should be [Indiscernible] compared to the non-recurring business. And secondly  also from an M&A perspective  we're more interested to invest in business ' recurring revenues. And so these are the reasons for our expectation that the recurring level will increase for the next year.Benjamin BathurstThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Harlan Tender from Auto PHS.Harlan TenderYes  good afternoon. Two questions from my side. First of all  I would like to come back to the commodities business. Could you elaborate here a little bit more on the risk management? Do you need actually state guarantees to run this business and did you model for extreme shocks and what would be the outcome in these scenarios? Secondly  you mentioned in the fund service business partnership as [Indiscernible] could you maybe detail a little bit business or market opportunity you're tipping here into? Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYes. And this regards commodities  risk management. I think a little bit  are already elaborated on that side. So  we have obviously seen a strong increase of our margin  our collateral at our clearing house of the EX. So it wasn't the peak roughly €70 billion and it's none range more to €40 billion. And two or three years ago  was when the range of €5 billion. Then obviously  you have seen here  tremendous increase year to reflect that completely different market situation. But again  the good thing is that there were no surprises for the market participants. The risk models worked as designed. And there was -- and we didn't miss any margin calls here so far. So far  no need for any state guarantees  right. So the market was able to manage that.Obviously  we are also discussing some shock scenarios. So obviously -- and that's what we're also analyzing. But the outcome and the consequences really depends on the [Indiscernible] scenarios. But in principle  as mentioned earlier. And so  when we talked with the German government in search for this next item to [Indiscernible]  then we have a clear understanding that the markets should be opened as long as possible without a government interfering. So that is the basic idea. But nevertheless  we would be also prepared for different things.Segment pressed in around [Indiscernible] I think  yes  in principle there are different opportunities to grow our business. So customer can decide to purely connect to our platform  they can outsource of the business  they can sell the business  or they can do -- partner up with us. So as in FX decided to partner up with RCM and for us  it's a big opportunity to enter in the UK market  that we are currently not present  and so that we have a broader spectrum from a regional perspective  and so that it can attract more customers. So that's the main strategically to get together with FX.Benjamin BathurstOkay  thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from Martin Price  from Jefferies.Martin PriceGood afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry to go back to this  but I just wanted to clarify my understanding of the M&A strategy in the fund services space specifically  just wasn't [Indiscernible] to your response on this question earlier  rolling out larger M&A was in relation to IFRS or IFS strike fund services. In short  so I just clarify  if you were to do a deal in the fund services space  your current thinking is that it would probably be in the one or two million euro range rather than anything larger. Thank you.Gregor PottmeyerYeah  Martin  as already mentioned by Theodor  so there's no pressure from our side to do anything here so -- and throughout specifically in the fund services business. So usually you have seen our transactions we did here in the past though it was usually a €20 million  €30 million acquisition and depending on the portfolio side of the banks and even we do not announce all the deals we do here. Sometimes also customers are shy to be mentioned publicly here. But we have a long and strong customer pipeline where customers are interested to ride together with us. And again  sometimes they decide to purely connect to our platforms  they're doing a partnership  sometimes they want to outsource business or that we take over also their people and then streamlining the processes or some partners are interested to save the business rise. For all of these three options we are very open and we have a long customer path and in all of these three areas so there's no need from our perspective to do other deals here.Martin PriceUnderstood. Thanks [Indiscernible] and thanks Gregor.Jan StreckerAll right. There are no further questions on the call. Thank you very much for your participation today. If there is anything else then please feel free to reach out directly to us and have a good day.OperatorThe conference is no longer being recorded.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.58,0.21,0.21,True,English,"['Deutsche Borse AG', 'CEO Theodor Weimer', 'Earnings Call Transcript', 'DBOEY', 'Q1', 'Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited', 'stronger U.S. dollar', 'other constant currency basis', 'regular secular growth achievements', 'U.S. derivatives exchange', 'attractive interest rate level', 'Secular net revenue growth', 'leading fund data manager', 'cyclical net revenue growth', 'Q1 2022 Earnings Conference Call', 'interest rate hedge', 'organic earnings growth', '5% net revenue growth', 'record quarterly level', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'strong cyclical tailwinds', 'ESG related products', 'regulatory reporting services', 'existing client base', 'positive top-line development', 'Deutsche Borse AG', 'Deutsche Borse anaylst', 'continuous improvement program', 'buying agent services', 'organic operating costs', 'Illuminate fintech fund', 'Chief Financial Officer', 'Investor Relations section', 'M&A strategy', 'fund service business', 'investor conference call', 'Conference Call Participants', 'first quarter results', 'financial derivatives', 'Q1 2022 results', 'data management', 'strong start', 'financial results', 'Company Participants', 'business model', 'nice improvement', 'buying application', 'operating leverage', 'fund industry', 'Deutsche Bank', 'financial highlights', 'first-quarter 2022 results', 'Andrew Coombs', 'Haley Tam', 'Credit Suisse', 'Arnaud Giblat', 'Exane BNP', 'Benjamin Goy', 'Michael Werner', 'Bruce Hamilton', 'Morgan Stanley', 'Kyle Voigt', 'Philip Middleton', 'Ian White', 'Autonomous Research', 'Tobias Lukesch', 'Kepler Cheuvreux', 'Johannes Thormann', 'The Hongkong', 'Martin Price', 'Jefferies Operator', 'brief overview', 'key developments', 'product innovation', 'growing demand', 'remaining 2 months', 'higher volatility', 'asset losses', 'hedging needs', 'fixed income', 'one-off effects', 'REGIS-TR disposal', 'inflationary pressures', 'partial disposal', 'line item', 'software impairment', 'European Commission', 'CFR regulation', 'indefinite time', 'senior bond', 'financial investments', 'Jan Strecker', 'Union Bank', 'last year', 'market shares', 'market valuation', 'Theodor Weimer', 'Gregor Pottmeyer', 'presentation materials', 'greater detail', 'full-year guidance', 'one-off gain', 'OTCPK', 'DBOEY', 'April', '8:00 AM', 'Head', 'Citi', 'Switzerland', 'Keefe', 'Bruyette', 'Woods', 'America', 'afternoon', 'ladies', 'gentlemen', 'questions', 'email', 'website', 'replay', 'side', 'CFO', 'contrast', 'contribution', 'EBITDA', 'increase', 'commodities', 'continued', 'trend', 'outsourcing', 'March', 'acquisition', 'Indiscernible', 'clients', 'equities', 'FX', 'benefits', 'infrastructure', 'productivity', 'today', 'perspective', 'Page', 'holding', 'addition', 'sale', 'FairX', 'Coinbase', 'Depreciation', 'Eurex.', 'decision', '55']",2022-04-27,2022-04-27,seekingalpha.com

Belgium-based Euroclear  owned by an array of ...,"By Huw JonesLONDON (Reuters) - Securities settlement house Euroclear said on Wednesday it has delayed paying a dividend as it may need to set aside more capital to cover a swelling balance sheet due to Russian sanctions.Belgium-based Euroclear  owned by an array of big banks and exchanges like the London Stock Exchange and Euronext  ensures transactions are completed with cash exchanged for legal ownership of assets.After Russia invaded Ukraine  the European Union barred Euroclear and rival Clearstream from serving Russian customers from Feb. 28 as Western powers severed ties with the country's financial system.Euroclear said on Wednesday that during the first quarter its balance sheet rose by 23 billion euros ($24.41 billion) year-on-year  or nearly 80%.""We do not expect these sanctions to affect our financialperformance "" Euroclear said in a statement.It was now looking at what this means for ""potential regulatory capital requirements"" as the cashpile is expected to keep growing as sanctions remain in place for months  if not years  and redemptions and coupon payments on Russian assets fall due but can't be transferred to underlying parties.Euroclear is looking to reinvest the money in money market funds or instruments such as short term commercial paper while the sanctions last  and risk from such investments typically need to be covered by capital in case they turn sour.""In light of these circumstances  the board of Euroclear considers it to be prudent to wait until the second half of 2022 to formally decide on the dividend payment of 88.5 euros per share  equating to a total of 279 million euros as announced in its full-year results "" Euroclear said.Euroclear said net profit in the first quarter rose by 11% to 134 million euros.($1 = 0.9422 euros)(Reporting by Huw Jones  Editing by Louise Heavens)",negative,0.02,0.09,0.9,negative,0.02,0.24,0.73,True,English,"['Russian sanctions', 'capital headache', 'Euroclear', 'short term commercial paper', 'potential regulatory capital requirements', 'Securities settlement house', 'swelling balance sheet', 'London Stock Exchange', 'money market funds', 'Huw Jones', 'big banks', 'legal ownership', 'European Union', 'Russian customers', 'Western powers', 'financial system', 'first quarter', 'financial performance', 'coupon payments', 'underlying parties', 'second half', 'full-year results', 'net profit', 'Louise Heavens', '23 billion euros', '279 million euros', '134 million euros', 'Russian assets', 'dividend payment', 'Russian sanctions', 'Belgium-based Euroclear', '88.5 euros', '0.9422 euros', 'Reuters', 'Wednesday', 'array', 'exchanges', 'Euronext', 'transactions', 'Ukraine', 'rival', 'Clearstream', 'Feb.', 'country', 'statement', 'cashpile', 'place', 'months', 'years', 'redemptions', 'instruments', 'risk', 'investments', 'case', 'light', 'circumstances', 'board', 'share', 'total']",2022-04-27,2022-04-27,sg.news.yahoo.com

Welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time  all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder  this conference is being recorded.It is now my pleasure to introduce your host  Brett Iversen  General Manager  Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.Brett IversenGood afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Amy Hood  Chief Financial Officer; Alice Jolla  Chief Accounting Officer; and Keith Dolliver  Deputy General Counsel.On the Microsoft Investor Relations website  you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck  which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today’s call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures.Unless otherwise specified  we will refer to non-GAAP metrics on the call.

They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company’s third quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results.All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.And with that  I’ll turn the call over to Satya.Satya NadellaThank you  Brett. It was a record third quarter  driven by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud  which surpassed $23 billion in revenue  up 32% year-over-year. Going forward  digital technology will be the key input that powers the world’s economic output. Across the tech stack  we are expanding our opportunity and taking share as we help customers differentiate  build resilience  and do more with less.Now I’ll highlight examples  starting with Azure. We are building a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to help every organization build  run  and manage mission-critical workloads anywhere. This quarter  we helped more customers than ever simplifying and accelerating their cloud migrations.And it’s still early days. We are winning Tier 1 infrastructure workloads. Leaders in every industry  from Blackrock  to Bridgestone  to Lufthansa  are all moving mission-critical workloads to Azure. And we are the market leader for customers’ SAP workloads in the cloud. Atos  Chevron  Fujitsu  and Woolworths all migrated their SAP applications to Azure in recent months.Overall  we are seeing larger  more strategic Azure commitments  from industry leaders  including Boeing  Kraft Heinz  US Bank  and Westpac  who all chose our cloud to accelerate their digital transformations. The number of $100 million-plus Azure deals more than doubled year-over-year. And we’re seeing consumption growth across every industry  customer segment  and geography.Now  to data and AI. Our data stack is unique in bringing best-in-class operational databases  analytics  and governance into one integrated data fabric. Cosmos DB transactions and data volume increased over 100% year-over-year for the third quarter in a row. Synapse data volume more than doubled year-over-year. And we’re seeing strong adoption of Purview  as we help organizations govern  protect  and manage their data estate across platforms and clouds. From Deutsche Boerse to EY  customers in every industry are using our end-to-end data platform. In AI  we continue to see strong usage of Azure Machine Learning. The number of monthly inference requests increased 86% year-over-year  with companies like PepsiCo using the service to predict which products are most likely to sell.And our Azure Open AI Service brings together advanced language models with the enterprise capabilities of Azure  helping companies like CarMax turn customer reviews into customized content for shoppers.Now  to developer tools. From Azure DevOps and GitHub to Visual Studio  we have the most comprehensive and loved developer SaaS service. Increasingly  every new developer project starts with our tools. Visual Studio has more than 31 million monthly active users  including most of the Fortune 500. And GitHub usage is increasing among both independent developers and startups  as well as the world’s most established enterprises. 90% of the Fortune 100 use GitHub. In fact  Mercedes Benz  for example  is using GitHub Enterprise to provide a unified development platform for more than 20 000 employees to build  ship  and maintain software.Now  on to Power Platform. Power Platform has become the leading business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts in every industry. Power Platform surpassed $2 billion in revenue over the past twelve months  up 72% year-over-year  making it one of the fastest growing businesses  at scale. Power Apps is the market leader in low code/no code app development  and Power BI has more than 200 000 customers. And our acquisition of MINE-it adds new process mining capabilities  helping organizations identify bottlenecks and opportunities for operational efficiency.Now  to Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is growing faster than the business applications market overall. For example  in a world of supply chain constraints we are helping companies like Cracker Barrel and Unilever predict disruptions before they happen. Businesses like Heineken and Siemens are turning to Dynamics 365 to drive and deliver more consistent and personalized customer engagement and service. We are leading innovation in the new industrial metaverse to help companies optimize their operations using technologies such as IOT  Digital Twins  Connected Spaces  and Mixed Reality applications. And we’re further differentiating the Microsoft Cloud by bringing together Dynamics 365  Teams  and Synapse to usher in a new era of collaborative applications that transform every business function and process.When it comes to industry  our six industry clouds  are helping customers speed time to value. Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last month  where we introduced Azure Health Data Services to unify disparate clinical  imaging  and medtech data. Cleveland Clinic will use the solution to normalize data from different systems and integrate insights into the clinician workflow.And with our acquisition of Nuance  I’m excited about our opportunity to apply the company’s deep enterprise AI expertise to accelerate the growth of both Nuance’s business  and our industry clouds.Now  on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement  as more than 830 million professionals used the platform to connect  learn  grow  and get hired. Amid the Great Reshuffle  we’re seeing a skills-first labor market emerge. The number of companies using skills filters on LinkedIn to fill open roles has doubled year-over-year. In this dynamic labor market  hires on LinkedIn has increased 88%.Talent Solutions revenue was up 43%  marking the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. Our Marketing Solutions business continues to thrive as we offer advertisers high reach and ROI. And creators are increasingly turning to the platform to establish their voices and grow their communities  using tools like Newsletters to share content they are passionate about. 28 million members now subscribe to at least one newsletter on LinkedIn  up 51% over the past quarter alone.Now  on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. The last two years have proven that every organization needs a digital fabric that connects the entire organization  from the boardroom to the frontline  to customers and partners. No company is better positioned to meet this need than Microsoft  with Microsoft 365 and Teams. Teams is the most used and most advanced platform for work  and the only solution with meetings  calls  chat  collaboration  and business process automation. And organizations from enterprises to SMBs are relying on Teams to run their business.Our comprehensive approach reduces complexity and costs. Microsoft 365 customers can save as much as 60%  compared to a patchwork of single point identity  productivity  collaboration  and meetings solutions. Teams usage has never been higher. We’re seeing growth in every segment  including very small businesses with Teams Essentials.Teams is the leading platform for collaborative apps. From Asana to Zendesk  there are over 1 000 third-party apps available the Teams app store. And companies in every industry  including CBRE  CVS Health  and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom  have built custom line of business apps within Teams  bringing business process directly into the flow of work. And we’re adding new growth engines to meet the demands of hybrid work with Teams Rooms  Teams Phone  and Microsoft Viva.Teams Rooms is bridging the gap between people working remotely and those in the office  with innovations like Front Row. Teams Phone with Operator Connect enables organizations to easily bring their existing calling service to Teams. Total Operator Connect minutes increased 8x quarter-over-quarter. And Viva has more than 10 million monthly active users at companies like Blum  Cerner  and Marks & Spencer. This quarter  we added LinkedIn’s Glint employee engagement tool to Viva  ensuring leaders can more easily solicit employee feedback and receive actionable insights.All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Organizations across the private and public sector  including American Family Insurance  the Queensland Government  and Telefonica are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security  compliance  voice  and analytics.Now  on to Windows. The PC has never been more relevant to work  life  and play. The number of use cases is increasing as is the amount of time spent on PCs. More than 100 million PCs have shipped in each of the last eight quarters  and Windows continues to take share. With Windows 11  we continue to see the highest quality scores of any version of the operating system. The enterprises are adopting Windows 11 at a faster pace than any previous release.With Windows 365  we’re bringing the power of Azure computing to Windows computers  enabling businesses like Lands’ End  SES  and Xerox to stream the full Windows experience to any employee device. New integrations between Windows 11 and Windows 365 will make it possible to switch between Cloud PC and the local PC with a single click. And we continue to help organizations like AIG  Grant Thornton  and Sage shift their on-premise virtualization services to the cloud with Azure Virtual Desktop.In consumer  Windows is key to curating our content and services to help every person with their everyday tasks  from browsing and searching  to learning  and gaming  and shopping  all with security and privacy built-in. We are seeing strong engagement  with nearly 500 million monthly active users of our personalized content feed  Microsoft Start. As usage continues to grow  we are seeing a flywheel emerge between content  consumption  and commerce  as we generate new opportunities for content creators  as well as advertisers. And our browser  Microsoft Edge  continues to gain share as we help people save money and shop securely.Now  to security. Security is a top priority for every organization undergoing a digital transformation. To keep our customers secure  we build security by design into every product we sell. And we deliver end-to-end solutions spanning security  compliance  identity  device management  and privacy  across clouds and platforms  informed by 24 trillion threat signals each day.This comprehensive capability has been critical during the recent world events  and we continue to disrupt cyber attacks and share threat intelligence with the Ukrainian government  as well as other public sector agencies. Multi-cloud  multi-platform support is central to our approach. In security  we are the only cloud provider with native multi-cloud protection for the industry’s top three cloud platforms.In identity  we now provide permissions management across all clouds. Azure Active Directory is the undisputed market leader with more than 550 million monthly active users. In management  the number of Windows  Android  and iOS devices protected by Intune grew over 60% year-over-year. And we’re expanding to new market segments with Microsoft Defender for Business  which helps keep small businesses secure.This innovation and differentiation is driving our overall growth. All up  the number of customers who trust our security solutions grew nearly 50% year-over-year to 785 000  including Citrix  Domino’s Pizza  Fujitsu  Heineken  Petronas  who rely on us to protect their multi-cloud infrastructure. And we have over 15 000 partners in our security ecosystem  more than anyone else in the industry.Now  on to gaming. Our ambition is to power gamers to play when  and how  and where they want. With our Xbox Series S and X consoles  we have taken share globally for two quarters in a row and we are the market leader this quarter among the next gen consoles in the United States  Canada  UK  and Western Europe. And with Xbox Cloud Gaming  we are redefining how games are distributed  played  and viewed. To date  more than 10 million people have streamed games. Many of our most popular titles  including Flight Simulator are now accessible on phones  tablets  low-spec PCs for the first time.Our Game Pass library now includes hundreds of titles across PC and console  including more games from third-party publishers than ever before. Billions of hours have been played by subscribers over the past 12 months  up 45%. And with Azure  we are building the best cloud for game studios of all sizes to build  host  and grow their games. New capabilities speed time to development and to help connect players across platforms. Azure gaming revenue fiscal year to date increased 66%.In closing  we are entering a new era where every company will become a digital company. Our portfolio of durable digital businesses and diverse business models  built on a common tech stack  position us well to capture the massive opportunities ahead.With that  I’ll hand it over to Amy.Amy HoodThank you  Satya  and good afternoon  everyone. This quarter  revenue was $49.4 billion  up 18% and 21% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.22 and increased 14% and 18% in constant currency when adjusted for the tax benefit from the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. Several items impacted our financial performance that were not included in the guidance provided on our January earnings call.First  Nuance. My comments today across Q3 results and Q4 outlook include the impact from the Nuance acquisition which closed on March 4. Our results include $111 million in revenue and a negative $0.01 impact to earnings per share  including purchase accounting  integration  and transaction related expenses. Within our results  unless specifically noted otherwise  Nuance was not a material driver of growth rates. We continue to expect the Nuance acquisition will be minimally dilutive in FY2022 and accretive in FY2023 to non-GAAP EPS.Second  FX. The U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter and created an incremental 1 point FX headwind to total company revenue compared to expectations. As a result  revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $302 million and $0.03 per share  respectively. Finally  the war in Ukraine. We suspended all new sales of our products and services in Russia. Revenue generated in Russia represents less than 1% of total company revenue and we expect that it will decline significantly.The impact to operating income this quarter was roughly $130 million split evenly between lower revenue and higher bad debt expense  resulting in a negative $0.01 impact to EPS. Our results for the quarter are better than we expected across revenue  operating income  and EPS as we again delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth.In our commercial business  healthy demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings together with excellent execution by our sales teams and partners drove increased commitment to our platform as well as higher usage of our services that Satya mentioned earlier.Commercial bookings increased 28% and 35% in constant currency  significantly ahead of expectations driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. We also saw better than expected growth in large  long-term Azure contracts against a very strong prior year comparable. Nuance benefited bookings by roughly 5 points.Our on-premises transactional licensing revenue  across both the Office and Server businesses  was more negatively impacted than expected due to the transition from our Open Licensing program to our Cloud Solution Provider program.Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 32% and 34% in constant currency to $155 billion with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond  the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96%. Commercial Cloud revenue was $23.4 billion and grew 32% and 35% in constant currency  again ahead of expectations.Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for useful lives  the Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points driven by improvement across the cloud services  partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. In our consumer business  as you heard from Satya  we saw market share gains across PCs  gaming consoles  and our Edge browser.Now back to the company level. As noted earlier  the U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter. FX decreased total company revenue by 3 points  1 point unfavorable to expectations  decreased COGS by 1 point  in line with expectations  and decreased operating expense growth by 2 points  1 point favorable to expectations.Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 21% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate  gross margin percentage increased approximately 1 point driven primarily by improvement in our cloud services noted earlier.Operating expense increased 15% and 17% in constant currency  slightly lower than expected as investments that shifted to future quarters were partially offset by the inclusion of Nuance. At a total company level  headcount grew 20% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering  customer deployment  LinkedIn  and sales  and included approximately 4 points of growth from the addition of Nuance.Operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency and operating margins increased slightly year-over-year to 41%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate  operating margins expanded roughly 2 points year-over-year.Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15.8 billion and grew 17% and 19% in constant currency in line with expectations. Better than expected results across Office 365  LinkedIn  and Office consumer were offset by impacts from incremental FX  the Open Licensing transition  Russia  as well as lower than expected results in Dynamics.Office commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 20% in constant currency  driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments  as well as higher ARPU from continued momentum in E5 revenue.Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 16% year-over-year to nearly 345 million  with continued growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. And nearly 45% of our Office 365 commercial seats were purchased through Microsoft 365.Office commercial licensing was lower than expected  down 28% and 25% in constant currency  driven by the factors discussed earlier and a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.Office consumer revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency  ahead of expectations  driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions  which grew 16% to 58.4 million.Dynamics revenue grew 22% and 25% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365  which grew 35% and 38% in constant currency  substantially faster than the market although a bit lower than expected as we focus on stronger execution on our recent investments.LinkedIn revenue increased 34% and 35% in constant currency  with better than expected performance in Talent Solutions as well as continued strength in Marketing Solutions and record levels of engagement on the platform.Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 19% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate  gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13% and 14% in constant currency  and operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency.Next  the Intelligent Cloud segment  which includes approximately four weeks of results from Nuance. Revenue was $19.1 billion  increasing 26% and 29% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of Nuance and the approximately $150 million greater FX than expected  revenue results were ahead of expectations.Overall  server products and cloud services revenue increased 29% and 32% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services grew 46% and 49% in constant currency  ahead of expectations  driven by continued strength in our consumption-based services. The inclusion of Nuance cloud services did not change the Azure constant currency growth rate.In our per-user business  the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 25% to over 218 million seats. In our on-premises server business  revenue increased 5% and 7% in constant currency  ahead of expectations driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings partially offset by the Open Licensing transition mentioned earlier. The inclusion of Nuance on premises offerings did not change the server constant currency growth rate.Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 6% in constant currency  driven by growth in Enterprise Support Services. The inclusion of Nuance professional services impacted the constant currency growth rate by 1 point.Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 27% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate  gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point with improvements in Azure partially offset by the sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 17% and 19% in constant currency and operating income grew 29% and 33% in constant currency.Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.5 billion  increasing 11% and 13% in constant currency  above expectations driven by better than expected performance in search and Windows offset by Surface. FX decreased segment revenue approximately $100 million greater than expected. Windows OEM revenue increased 11%  with continued strength in the commercial PC market  which has higher revenue per license.Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 14% and 19% in constant currency  ahead of expectations  driven by demand for Microsoft 365 with some benefit from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.Surface revenue grew 13% and 18% in constant currency  lower than expected  driven by consumer channel  partially offset by strength in commercial. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 23% and 25% in constant currency  better than expected  benefiting from an increase in search volumes even as we saw headwinds during March from the impact of the war in Ukraine.And in Gaming  on a high prior year comparable  revenue increased 6% and 8% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue was better than expected as increased supply of consoles in quarter drove growth of 14% and 16% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue grew 4% and 6% in constant currency  below expectations  driven by lower engagement across the platform  even as it remains above pre-pandemic levels.Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Operating expenses increased 17% and 18% in constant currency and operating income grew 7% and 10% in constant currency.Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6.3 billion  in line with expectations. Cash paid for PP&E was $5.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $25.4 billion  increasing 14% as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds as we manage continued uncertainty in the supply chain. Free cash flow was $20.0 billion  up 17%. This quarter  other income and expense was negative $174 million  lower than anticipated driven by net losses on investments  including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio  and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year  a negative 2-point impact on year-over-year EPS growth. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%.And finally  we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now  before we turn to our outlook  a few reminders. First  FX; with the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates  we now expect FX to decrease total company revenue growth by approximately 2 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments  we anticipate roughly 3 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and 2 points in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing.Second  my remarks for the next quarter include a full quarter of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Third  we anticipate the war in Ukraine to continue to impact our business in Q4 with a roughly $110 million impact on revenue and minimal impact on operating expenses. Next  we have taken into account the current impact of shutdowns in China in our outlook. However  extended production shutdowns that reach into May would further negatively impact our outlook across Windows OEM  Surface  and Xbox hardware. Finally  the outlook we give  unless specifically noted otherwise  is on a USD basis.With that context in place  let’s turn to our Q4 outlook. In our largest quarter of the year we expect our differentiated market position  customer demand across the solution portfolio  and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth. In commercial bookings  a growing Q4 expiry base  strong execution across our core annuity sales motions  and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth against a strong prior year comparable. As a reminder  the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts  which are more unpredictable in their timing  always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be down roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate  Q4 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 1 point driven by continued improvement across our cloud services partially offset by a revenue mix shift to Azure. Capital expenditures  we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services.Next to segment guidance; in Productivity and Business Processes  we expect revenue between $16.65 billion and $16.9 billion. In Office Commercial  revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by a point or two on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business  we expect revenue to decline similar to last quarter.In Office consumer  we expect revenue to grow in the high single digits  driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn  we expect revenue growth in the high-20s driven by the strong job market and healthy engagement on the platform. And in Dynamics  we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue between $21.1 billion and $21.35 billion.Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which as a reminder can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 2 points on a constant currency basis with a bit more FX impact on U.S. dollar growth than at the segment level. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in our consumption business. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum  though we expect moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base.In our on-premises server business  we expect revenue to decline in the low-to-mid single digits as demand for our hybrid offerings will be more than offset by the strong prior year comparable  which included 4 points of benefit from contracts with higher in period revenue recognition  as well as continued transactional weakness from the licensing program transition noted earlier. And in Enterprise Services  we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits.In more Personal Computing  we expect revenue between $14.65 billion and $14.95 billion. As mentioned earlier  our guidance reflects the current constraints from the shutdowns in China  which have negatively impacted Q4 supply for OEM  Surface and Xbox consoles. In Windows OEM we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid-single digits driven by the continued shift to a commercial-led PC market where revenue per license is higher.In Windows commercial products and cloud services  customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low-double digits. In Surface  revenue should grow in low-double digits. In Search and news advertising ex-TAC  we expect revenue growth of approximately 20%.And in Gaming  we expect revenue to decline in the mid-to-high single digits driven by lower engagement hour’s year-over-year as well as constrained console supply. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline mid-single digits though engagement hours are expected to remain higher than pre-pandemic levels.Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $16.6 billion to $16.8 billion and operating expense of $14.8 billion to $14.9 billion resulting in another quarter of operating margin expansion excluding the change in useful life. We expect other income and expense to be negative $50 million reflecting FX remeasurement impact based on market conditions in April. Similar to the rest of our guidance  further equity and FX movements through Q4 are not reflected in this number. As a reminder  we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio  which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.We expect to close FY22  even in a more complex macro environment  with the same consistency we have delivered throughout the year. With strong revenue growth  share gains  and improved operating margins as we invest in the areas that are key to sustaining that growth. As we look toward FY23  our track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets gives us confidence that we will drive continued healthy double-digit revenue and operating income growth.Now  Brett lets go to Q&A.Brett IversenThanks Amy. We will now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call we request the partisans please only ask one question.Jesse  can you please repeat your instructions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorAbsolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Keith WeissExcellent. Thank you guys so much for taking the question  and really impressive results. And what we see is a pretty difficult climate out there. Definitely from the stock market perspective  but if we think about interest rates  we think about inflation  there’s a  a conflict going on in Europe right now. It does seem to be a tough backdrop. You guys are operating super well. I mean  the acceleration in Azure at that scale is truly awesome. And so if I’m not mistaken Office 365 commercial accelerated as well in the quarter  so really impressive results.But I think the question that most investors are going to have is where do you garner the confidence and the durability of this growth given how volatile this macro backdrop is? Is it conversations you are having with customers? Is it what you see in the backlog? Maybe if you could give us some kind of insight into what gives you guys the confidence to put out that guide  to put out those healthy comments for FY23  what are you seeing that could maybe help us give us and give investors a little bit more confidence in the durability of this growth in this environment?Satya NadellaYes  maybe I’ll start. Maybe at three levels Keith  one is just the competitiveness of our tech stack all up sort of from infrastructure all the way to the SaaS applications when it comes to the commercial cloud and as well as how we are able to monetize for example  the install base of our consumer franchises as well. So both of these places we feel we are competitive and increasingly so coming out of the pandemic to gain share. I’d also say that in many of these places  we have price leadership. I mean  take the one point I made which is  if there is any macro-headwind where you have more value for less price means you win. And in our case  when it comes to our commercial cloud offerings we have significant advantages on that across the stack.The second thing is in the conversations we are having with our customers. The interesting thing I find from perhaps even past challenges whether macro or micro is no  I don’t hear of businesses looking to their IT budgets or digital transformation projects is the place for cuts  if anything  some of these projects are the way they’re going to accelerate their transformation or for that matter automation for example. I have not seen this level of demand for automation technology to improve productivity because in an inflationary environment  the only deflationary force is software. So that’s the second micro thing the tone thing that’s different.At the end of the day though  I mean  none of us here are trying to forecast macro. So all we think of is the TAMs that we are competing in a large  as a percentage of GDP tech spend is on a secular basis by the end of the decade going to double. We just want to keep driving usage  driving share and be competitive  so that’s kind of how we view what we are doing. And that’s where our confidence comes from in terms of our outlays  whether it’s OpEx or CapEx.So I don’t know if Amy  if you want to add to that.Amy HoodI think the only thing Satya  I might add is  I think we’ve always and I think we’ve used this language quite frequently focused on the long–term opportunity. You talked about it as the TAM that we’re focused on. I would say also  there’s still a lot of that TAM left to go – left to go after and it is quite early  still. And the transitions you’re talking about from a digital transformation perspective  from an automation perspective  from a type of value and real productivity enhancements that can be made. And so I think the continuity of the execution has certainly been very good from the sales and partner side. But I would also say to your point  we’re investing for a long-term opportunity and our confidence that that long-term outcome is right is where the – is I think the basis for where you and I are talking  giving this answer from.Keith WeissOutstanding. Great quarter.Brett IversenThanks  Keith  Jesse  next question please.OperatorAbsolutely. Our next question is coming from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.Brent ThillThanks. Amy on your guidance  are you changing any of your close rate considerations or adding more supply chain constraints into that or is this the same guidance methodology that you you’ve been giving us in the past?Amy HoodI assume we’re specifically talking about most of the guidance in the more personal computing segment where the supply chain constraints  which are specifically related to the production shutdowns in China. I generally follow the same principle I try to follow  which is I give you my best knowledge as of today. I did note and tried to do that with a lot of clarity that were the production shutdowns to extend into May  there would be further negative impact on those from a supply constraint position.As you know  on the OEM business  that revenue is recognized at the point of production and then for Xbox consoles as well as Surface it’s a sell-in. So production delays even earlier in May can obviously have big impact on the quarter. So we’re watching it and I’ve tried to make that transparent in the guidance  outside of that my guidance is reasonably consistent with how I – with how I like to do it.Brent ThillGreat. Thanks.Brett IversenThanks  Brent. Jesse  next question please.OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.Mark MoerdlerThank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter and on the strong guidance  I think it’s going to not just help the stock  but hopefully help a little bit more across into the industry. I’d like to look at Office which had strength probably more than people expected. Where are we in the up-sell opportunity from E3 to E5? And can you give us any sense of the sizing of how much of the growth not just now  but going forward do you think is going to come from frontline users? Thank you.Amy HoodMaybe I’ll start answering that question and Satya if you want to add  add anything. Very specifically Mark  I would say  this quarter was quite similar in nature to what you saw in the past few. Seat growth while across all segments was especially good in frontline worker and SMB. That did mask a little bit as it often does the ARPU improvement  given those tend to be lower priced SKUs  the ARPU improvement that we’re seeing from the transitions into E5. The transition from E3 to E5 still has opportunity. I would say  we’re in the earlier transitions of that show in terms as  I think  about going forward there is certainly still room for both seat growth specifically and frontline worker  as you noted as well as SMB. And then ARPU expansion through the E5 transition.The thing I would add that Satya mentioned in his comments and again in his first answer is really the value that is available to customers in E5  whether that is security  whether it’s compliance  whether it’s phone  whether it’s analytics  the value of that suite  and if you think even more broadly  the value of Microsoft 365  which adds in more components around Windows. I think we are offering high value and that tends to give us some optimism that we can continue to execute well in that segment.I don’t know Satya if there is anything you would add to that.Satya NadellaNo  you counted well  Amy. I mean  I think  the fundamentals are pretty strong here still  whether it’s E5 growth  SMB growth  frontline worker  I’d also add emerging markets. I mean  this is the first time I feel that we have products that fit just emerging markets like Teams Essentials  where we can even really penetrate markets that we’ve never sold anything in the past.And then the new growth engines that you talked about  Teams Phones  Teams Rooms  Viva and even Windows 365 are all things that we can again  drive growth from. And the point about sort of our value is probably a very  very strong in a time like this in particular. And we see it like the one thing also I’d say is the usage data that we are seeing is peak everywhere. And so that’s the other thing  is we definitely will optimize for driving usage and deployment and that’s going to be our priority.Mark MoerdlerThank you very much. I really appreciate it. Congrats.Brett IversenThanks Mark. Jesse  next question  please.OperatorOur next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Karl KeirsteadOkay  great. Amy  you called out some transactional weakness  which in the March quarter we can see in the on-prem Office segment and in your guidance in the server products  you suggest we might see it there too. Is that something that you would characterize as Microsoft specific  as you describe in your comments  your transitioning customers off your Open License program? Or do you feel like that’s a broader issue where maybe we’re starting to see a little bit of a tilt from on-prem to cloud even faster than we’ve seen before? Thank you.Amy HoodThanks  Karl. That’s a very good question. I would say it does not feel like the tilt from on-prem to cloud felt any different in a way that would have impacted the quarter anymore  so than it normally does in terms of the normal transitions. We’ve seen to your point on Office or frankly  even in server  as we have people move those workloads and migrate those workloads to the cloud.This really was very significant. Think of it as a where partners transact. And we have such a broad  and valuable  and really needed partner community that is very vast. And we put this and had planned for this change for January 1. And we executed the change on January 1 as plan  and it’s just taking us a little longer to onboard all of this community to make sure that they can transact the way they want to in the program.So  I do think it’s going to take us longer than we thought  we’re going to continue to see that impact in Q4. And I know the teams are working hard to make sure that partners get comfortable with the new system  which is important to us.Karl KeirsteadGot it.Satya NadellaAnd the only thing I’d add is that this change is super good for both the partners  the customers and Microsoft long-term.Amy HoodAbsolutely.Satya NadellaSo  there is execution ahead  but we want to do this because it benefits everybody.Karl KeirsteadGot it. Thanks Satya.Brett IversenThanks Karl. Jesse  next question  please.OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Mark MurphyYes. Thank you very much. Satya handful of infrastructure software companies have commented that their consumption activity actually started to slow a few months ago. And so  I’m curious what in your view is allowing your Azure trajectory to show better resilience. And do you in fact  see some of the newer products kicking in such as Azure or Synapse Cognitive Services  OpenAI and perhaps contributing to the strength and health and resiliency of that Azure number?Satya NadellaYes  I mean  what I’d say Karl [ph] is that what we are seeing is a classic what happens with consumption meters  right  which is they grow  and then they get optimized and they grow again both existing and new. And so  it’s sort of  will always have some amount of volatility that even Amy referenced quarter-over-quarter.But if I walk up  one thing that we look at is growth coming from all segments  right? So small business and enterprise  is it coming from all regions? And it is. We also look at the type of workloads it’s coming from. And so it looks healthy in all of those. And if you walk up the stack to your point on the infrastructure side  the Tier 1 workloads is where I think we are seeing some big Tier 1 workloads  and I had many comments on SAP and other workloads moving.The second thing I’d say is on the past services and our DevFest that’s another area where we have differentiated value. So we see good growth there. Data and AI for sure  I mean  the thing that I find really to be something that I think the long run is going to probably be one of the bigger drivers of our growth and differentiation is our data fabric  because we are the only guys who have a complete data fabric from the operational store that’s fully integrated into an analytics engine that’s fully integrated into governance.And that increasingly is going to become more and more important  right? I mean you can be dealing with this a new regulation coming on privacy and governance on one end and your operational store being divorced from that. So we have a very differentiated offer and I talked about some of the growth numbers there.The AI inference is also finally kicking. They’re very small today  but even when I look at the total com – that’s just essentially a compute meter  there’s growth there. So overall  I think we will see quarter-over-quarter  some cyclicality  depending on which customers. In fact  we pay people at Microsoft to reduce customer bills and which we should. So given that we may see cyclicality in terms of how optimizations happen  but overall we’re still very early on as the world sort of migrates to the cloud and users  essentially cloud infrastructure and compute is sort of to drive their operational efficiencies and product.Mark MurphyThank you.Brett IversenThanks  Mark. Jesse  next question  please.OperatorOur next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Kash RanganThank you so much. Congrats on a spectacular quarter. Satya  I have very clearly on your comments and particularly you talked about tech as a percentage of GDP doubling over the next seven  eight years or so. Nobody could have really predicted maybe besides yourself  that Azure would be this big and growing this fast at this point in time relative to say five  six years back. So as you look forward  what part of the Microsoft tech stack do you think is underrepresented in the digital word and has therefore more opportunity to gain as you build out your thesis on tech as a percentage of GDP doubling. Thank you so much.Satya NadellaI mean the thing that I always go back Kash is that all enterprise value at least as far as I can tell  gets created at three layers of the tech stack. What happens with infrastructure  whenever something can be 10x better. So for example  when we talk about the next generation of multi-edge  multi-cloud  infrastructure remaining one of the leaders  that’s going to be a massive EV creation as a percentage of GDP tech spend double. So that’s where everything from Azure  Azure  our database  our – all of that’s super important.The other one is  this is sort of age of AI. In other words  the core business logic is not being written. It’s being written by software. So when I look at  when I use get up co-pilot  that’s the therein lies the future of what how all business logic gets written. And so to me the AI layer  both the training  supercomputers  as well as the inference layer that’s a place where you’ll see us integrate what today you all consider to be two different businesses  whether it’s Azure and Windows  they’re just one business to me  because to me  where in training happens  where inference happens will be written once by developers.And then it’ll light up across this distributed fabric. So that’s another place where I think there’s tons of enterprise value that’ll get created over time. And then of course the UI layer always is the biggest one. And the next inflection point  whether it’s what happens with MetaWare  so what happens with even on the industrial side with IoT and digital twins those are all things that I think will be the ones that we will be focused on. So these three things translated into workloads and what we call our customer solution areas are the ways that at least we are investing in.Kash RanganFascinating. Thank you so much.Brett IversenThanks  Kash. Jesse  next question  please.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.Michael TurrinHey  there  good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question and great job with the results. Azure growth and commercial booking strengths stand out. You mentioned a step down expected in Azure growth in Q4  but still suggest very impressive growth at that scale. Can you expand on the large deal commentary the longer-term strategic deals you’ve referenced a few times over the past couple of quarters  how those impact visibility or maybe the approach to framing targets there? And anything you can add just around how the addition of Nuance helps the cloud business and the industry cloud approach as well is greatly appreciated. Thank you.Amy HoodSatya  do you want to start with your comments maybe on Nuance overall  and then – and I can address sort of how the larger long-term contracts.Satya NadellaYes. Sure. Just a couple of quick things. One is on the strategic commitments that are being made. We are sort of working at them workload at a time  and so we feel very  very good about both the type of workloads. In fact  I – there is a migration of a bunch of workloads that we may have won in the client server that are migrating  but the most exciting thing is the type of Tier 1 workloads that we have never seen run on any Microsoft infrastructure that’s running on Azure today and being optimized on Azure.So that’s the thing that we see as we win these large strategic deals. On Nuance  for me  the thing that’s exciting is Nuance is a platform layer for these AI driven applications that are getting deployed  whether it’s in healthcare or even in the enterprise contact center.So we are very excited about Nuance now being part of the Microsoft family. You’ll see us pretty aggressively go innovate there and grow the impact of these solutions in both what is sort of the large percentages of our GDP  like healthcare where I think things like tackling issues like physician burdens with new innovative solutions is much needed and we are really looking forward to exercising that.Amy HoodAnd Michael  maybe specifically you’re absolutely right. I tend to mention the impact of large long-term Azure contract  both in the context of commercial bookings and some volatility we often can see in that because of it. But really  I think the way we think about them maybe outside of this phone call  is that it’s the beginning of the commitment between us and a customer to start to work together to deliver value.And so we go workload by workload  opportunity by opportunity and I think that’s what you were inferring a bit is that it’s almost the top of the funnel to create value for the customer. We call it delivering success to make sure they’re spending the dollars the most effective way  making sure we’re tackling the hardest problems that they need solved.And with that comes our investments that we’ve made and deployment resources and usage resources specifically in Azure to make that possible with customers. And so you’re right to say  I do talk about them in terms of volatility they create  what it creates inside the company is the beginning of a commitment to make sure we’re tackling the workloads and the solutions that the customers want to make happen across all the workloads frankly that Satya has talked about today.Michael TurrinThe great complimentary points also highlight. Thanks very much.Brett IversenThanks  Michael. Jesse  we have time for one last question.OperatorThank you. Our final question will come from Keith Bachman with BMO. Please proceed with your question.Keith BachmanHi  and many thanks. I wanted to break it up into two parts. But I was wondering if you could comment on what you see is the strength of the PC market as you look out over the course of the calendar year  if you focus on the demand side equation  not the supply side of the equation. And really the more important related part is given the outlook that you may have for the PC market. How are you thinking about the durability of the Windows side of your business? In particular  if you comment on the fundamentals related PC market  but also the opportunities to keep mixing up  so to speak helped by Microsoft 365. Many thanks.Satya NadellaSo let me…Amy HoodWhy don’t you start and I’ll add on.Satya NadellaPerfect. So I think on the commercial side  I think it’s well understood is that Windows is the socket for Microsoft 365. We have tremendous value  Amy referenced this earlier. In fact  we just launched Windows 11 and pro value with Windows 365  that’s resonating super well. The customer sat adoption rates when it comes  whether it’s security  whether it’s our productivity  we feel good about the commercial business. So we’ll stay focused on it on the commercial side.And on the consumer side  the coming out again the pandemic  the intensity of the usage has gone up. So one of the areas of focus for us is some of the stuff that I talked about in my remarks is just the usage  right? So where – when you think about 500 million users engaging with Microsoft start  that’s not the type of engagement we had.And so with a large installed base now  we have a significant room there  the browser share growth  we have significant room there. And then  of course  the subscription attaches whether it’s gaming or whether it’s productivity or suites. So that’s kind of how I look at what we are going to do at least in the immediate future. PC remains a very important category and I think people’s lives is what we’ve discovered during the pandemic. And if anything  the intensity of usage is increased. And there will be cyclical demand that we’ll go through. But the number of use cases is definitely  I think  structurally increased.Amy HoodExactly. I think the one thing I would add on your demand side  we have seen the transition from  I would say  in the middle of pandemic  definitely a consumer driven demand cycle. We’ve transitioned that to be a commercial part of the demand side. And so I do expect that to be the case  obviously  I think this is the second quarter in the row. We’ve seen that transition expect Q4 to be even more of that. And then we’ll wait and see how the second half of the year shapes up.Keith BachmanOkay. Many thanks.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen’s 2021 Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com.Appendix: geographic breakdown of total sales by medicineFirst Quarter Total North America Europe7 Rest of the World 2022 2021 % change 2022 2021 % change 2022 2021 % change 2022 2021 % change €m €m Actual CER8 €m €m Actual CER8 €m €m Actual CER8 €m €m Actual CER8 Oncology 556.4 495.4 12.3% 8.9% 184.3 176.2 4.6% -2.7% 267.9 247.1 8.4% 7.6% 104.3 72.1 44.6% 42.1% Somatuline 286.0 277.0 3.3% -0.7% 151.5 151.5 0.0% -6.9% 105.5 104.4 1.1% 0.4% 29.0 21.1 37.3% 39.3% Decapeptyl 129.2 106.3 21.6% 19.0% - - - - 73.7 66.0 11.7% 11.3% 55.5 40.3 37.9% 31.6% Cabometyx 98.9 83.3 18.8% 18.5% 4.0 3.3 19.0% 10.7% 75.2 69.2 8.8% 8.3% 19.7 10.8 82.7% 85.9% Onivyde 40.1 26.5 51.4% 40.9% 28.7 21.2 35.0% 25.6% 11.4 5.3 117.4% 103.0% - - - - Other Oncology 2.2 2.4 -8.5% -9.2% 0.1 0.2 -39.7% -43.9% 2.0 2.3 -12.6% -12.9% 0.1 0.0 n.a. n.a.

The increase was driven primarily by a EUR 8.2 million increase in employee costs  with full-time equivalent (FTE) employees increasing from 55 in 2020 to 76.9 in 2021. EUR 2.4 million of the employee cost increase can be attributed to additional FTEs while EUR 5.8 million can be attributed to share-based payment expense due to accelerated vesting of the Company’s Employee Investment Plan on the date of the Company’s IPO.Consulting services and other costs associated with research and development of the Company’s therapies increased by EUR 0.4 million vs. 2020. Activities to drive enrollment in the Company’s Up-LIFT pivotal trial and other clinical study related costs contributed to an increase of EUR 1.4 million vs. 2020. The Company also incurred an incremental EUR 0.4 million for marketing and market access activities in the US and Europe. The Company’s 2021 IPO and the incremental costs of operating as a public company added EUR 2.4 million not incurred in 2020. These costs include uncapitalized consulting and legal expenses relating to the IPO and assuring compliance with financial regulatory requirements.Operating Loss for the PeriodThe Company’s Operating Loss for the period increased by EUR 13 million  driven by the increase in Operating Expenses.Net Loss for the PeriodThe Company realized a Net Loss for the period of EUR 34.3 million vs. EUR 20 million in 2020. EUR 13.0 million of this increase can be attributed to the Operating Loss for the period. An additional EUR 1.2 million is due to an increase in the Company’s Net Finance Expense  driven primarily by an increase in Interest Expense.Cash PositionCash and cash equivalents increased by EUR 83 million vs. 2020. The year-end balance was EUR 89.4 million on December 31  2021 vs. EUR 6.4 million on December 31  2020.Net cash used in operating activities was EUR 19.9 million vs. EUR 12.9 million in 2020. The increase was driven by the increase in the Operating Loss for the period.The company invested EUR 2.3 million in assets in 2021  a EUR 2.2 million increase vs. 2020. The increase was driven primarily by IPO-related license fees paid and capitalized as intangible assets.The Company successfully raised EUR 110 million through investing activities in 2021. EUR 80 million was raised via the IPO on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Amsterdam  preceded by a pre-IPO convertible note financing of EUR 30 million.

Net cash generated from financing activities was EUR 105.3 million in 2021 vs. EUR 4.4 in 2020.Interest Bearing LoansThe decrease in Interest Bearing Loans from EUR 41.8 million in 2020 to EUR 11.5 million in 2021 was mainly attributable to the conversion of the Company’s preference A shares into ordinary shares immediately preceding the IPO.EquityThe positive Equity position of the Company as of December 31  2021 was EUR 82.7 million  an increase of EUR 114.8 million vs. December 31  2020. This increase resulted from the proceeds from the IPO (EUR 80 million)  the conversion of the convertible note into ordinary shares (EUR 31 million)  the conversion of preference A shares into ordinary shares (EUR 34 million) and the accelerated vesting of the Employee Investment Plan (EUR 8.5 million). The increase was offset by the Net Loss for the period (EUR 34.3 million) and the total paid and unpaid capitalized IPO fees (EUR 4.9 million).Q1 2022 Business Update and 2022 OutlookThe Company’s cash balance was EUR 83 million as of March 31  2022  reflecting a cash burn of EUR 6.4 million during Q1 2022.

GAUSSIN  a leading group in new technologies for clean and intelligent mobilityGaussin continued to grow in 2021  increasing revenues 30% to €52.8 million in 2021 driven by synergies with Metalliance  which has increased its turnover from €10.4 million (6 months) to €26.5 million  and the transfer of the ATM and APM lines to the Saint-Vallier site.Gaussin reported strong improvements in results for the second half of 2021 compared to the first half of the year. Revenues and license income was €32.3 million compared to €20.5 million in the first half and net income was €2.8 million compared to a loss of €9.8 million in the first half of 2021 (see PR of H1 results on October 31  2021).EBITDA for the year was close to break-even at -€0.4 million reflecting rising input costs and significant levels of R&D activity.Including the contribution of the strong improvements in financial results in the second half of the year  the net loss was -€7.3 million for the year. This result is mainly impacted by significant provisions of €6.4 million.GAUSSIN's commercial growth is a testament to the technological advances highlighted at the Dakar Rally in January 2022 with the H2 Racing Truck®  the most powerful hydrogen-powered truck in the world.Under a compressed timetable  the truck was developed in barely a year by GAUSSIN's R&D teams and has begun a world tour. The H2 World Tour is intended to broaden awareness of Gaussin’s products and promote the deployment of licenses and sales of the range's flagship products  logistics and port vehicles.The order for 36 APM® 75T HEs placed by Bolloré Ports and the Maersk group in 2021 for the CIT port terminal in Abidjan is evidence of growing customer acceptance of our products. This order  which is currently being delivered  demonstrates the success of GAUSSIN's clean port vehicles  which are also used in their autonomous version at the Port of Singapore  via the license sold to STELS.Demand for clean and intelligent mobility is anticipated to remain strong in the years to come. GAUSSIN is perfectly positioned to seize the opportunities that will arise. Based on the order book at year-end  Gaussin expects to generate strong growth in 2022 and is targeting turnover of €75 million.Highlights of the Year:A business model of licenses adapted to the explosion of freight costsThe GAUSSIN group is implementing a strategy for deploying its technology on a worldwide scale based on the Global Licensing program and the development of strategic partnerships with major international players. This strategy enables GAUSSIN products to be rapidly deployed internationally  both for distribution and maintenance. It is also a response to the explosion of freight costs insofar as it makes it possible to produce locally. Finally  this business model is low capital intensive. The group has signed three licenses to date and is still aiming for forty or so within two and a half years.A scaled industrial tool with the possibility of extensionGAUSSIN expanded its manufacturing footprint in 2021  increasing its production capacities by 8 000 square meters at the new site of Saint-Vallier  in the Saône-et-Loire region. This new site  which covers several hectares and is dedicated to the production of ATM® logistics and APM® port vehicles  will enable the company to meet the increased demand on the European and American markets  in particular.

The other co-founder of the exchange is chief compliance officer Anthony Mazzarese  a long-time business partner of Mulvihill. They will also be joined by technologist Vlad Rysin  the former chief technology officer of Euronext FX  a trading services company.The new exchange will focus on offering improved technology that speeds up cryptocurrency trading and reduces latency to the standards expected in traditional FX or equities by institutional investors. Mazzarese says this is often lacking in retail-focused exchanges:“There seems to be a notion that latency doesn’t matter when it comes to trading crypto. We disagree.”“We polled our network of institutional relationships globally and one of the biggest and most common requirements was reliable 24/7 technology with the same service levels and customization features they are accustomed to in other markets such as FX or equities.

Faurecia is addressing the increasing complexity of the supplier manufacturing environment by improving logistics flow  boosting efficiency  reducing costs  and delivering products to customers on time in a more sustainable way.Faurecia is using Dassault Systèmes’ “On Target Vehicle Launch” industry solution experience based on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to determine and validate the best logistics scenarios for make-to-order assembly lines. Faurecia can simulate and visualize AGV routing with regards to work stations  resource availability  assembly constraints and variabilities  line balancing and flow in one virtual twin experience  before starting production for a customer.Automotive supplier manufacturing environments are increasingly complex  producing a greater number of product variants for simultaneous programs under tighter deadlines  while managing last-minute engineering changes in factories that are more and more automated.Optimizing AGV routing is a key step in Faurecia’s digital factory program  which was initiated by its Clean Mobility business and now is used to transform the production processes of seats  interiors and electronics for connected  personalized and predictive automotive “cockpits of the future” in response to these trends. With the 3DEXPERIENCE platform  Faurecia can synchronize machines  optimize supplies  reduce the layout footprint of a shop floor  shorten cycle times  and improve energy and manufacturing efficiency  with full digital continuity across products  processes and a plant.Story continues“We’ve committed to being carbon neutral by 2030  starting by reducing energy consumption in our factories by 15%. This means simultaneous engineering on new products and processes and reducing waste in terms of logistics flows ” said Patrick Brionne  Group Industrial strategy & ME director  Faurecia. “With the 3DEXPERIENCE platform we are optimizing our AGV routing and boosting our production performance from day one. Already  we’ve identified a bottleneck before starting production and reworked the process design  layout and AGV flow to ensure that we can supply parts to our customer as promised.”“Suppliers must be able to introduce new products  launch new programs  and streamline production processes quickly and sustainably. AGV flow plays a key role in gaining a competitive advantage. The 3DEXPERIENCE platform enables suppliers like Faurecia to improve logistics at existing factories  and plan for future ones that are even more efficient ” said Laurence Montanari  Vice President  Transportation & Mobility Industry  Dassault Systèmes.###FOR MORE INFORMATIONDassault Systèmes’ industry solution experiences for Transportation & Mobility: https://ifwe.3ds.com/transportation-mobilityDassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform  3D design software  3D Digital Mock Up and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions: http://www.3ds.comSHARE THIS ON TWITTERAdvancing its digital factory program  Faurecia optimizes AGV logistics with #3DEXPERIENCE @Dassault3DSABOUT DASSAULT SYSTÈMESDassault Systèmes  the 3DEXPERIENCE Company  is a catalyst for human progress.

Significant price increases were implemented in 2021 and 2022 to offset the effects of inflation in purchasing costs  therefore the Group also measures the change in like-for-like sales including price adjustments in the CIS countries.1. Revenue for the first quarter 2022Net revenue was 685 million euros  up by +22.5% compared to the first quarter of 2021. Organic growth reached +19.2% including selling price increases in the CIS countries implemented to offset the inflation in purchasing costs and the devaluation of the rouble (1). The total effect of the selling price increases implemented across all segments is +12.9% on average compared to the first quarter of 2021.Story continuesThe EMEA segment achieved revenue of 238 million euros  an increase of +8.1% compared to the first quarter of 2021 due to the acceleration of selling price increases. Volumes fell slightly given anticipated orders in December 2021 ahead of selling price increases  as well as a selective approach in the Residential segment due to a procurement environment for raw materials that remains strained. Commercial sales are more sustained  mostly due to the good performance of luxury vinyl tiles and commercial carpets.The North America segment reported revenue of 204 million euros  an increase of +27.3% compared to the first quarter of 2021  reflecting solid like-for-like growth of +18.1% and a positive exchange rate effect. Volumes and selling prices contributed to organic growth  particularly sustained in the Commercial Health and Education segments using vinyl or rubber accessories and flooring. Business in the office and hospitality segments was also strong  confirming the positive trend seen in the fourth quarter of 2021.Revenue in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment was 134 million euros  an increase of +18.7% compared to the first quarter in 2021 despite a negative foreign exchange effect linked to the rouble  partially offset by the appreciation of the Brazilian real. Like-for-like sales increased by +0.5%  or +20.5% including selling price increases in the CIS countries implemented to offset inflation and the devaluation of the rouble.Volumes are falling in the CIS due to the cessation of sales in Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict on 24 February 2022 and slower business in Russia and Kazakhstan. Beyond selling price increases planned for the beginning of the year  an additional significant increase was rolled out urgently in Russia in early March to offset the devaluation of the rouble. Sales in Russia made up approximately 9% of total Group sales in the first quarter of 2022. The APAC region is growing and the LATAM region achieved an excellent quarter with strong growth in volumes while maintaining higher price levels.As expected  business grew strongly in the Sports segment. Revenue was 109 million euros  up by +66.0% and including +55.7% organic growth compared to the first quarter of 2021. North America is the strongest geographical region thanks to sustained demand and success of the Tarkett range. Backlog remains at a particularly high level.2. 2022 Environment and OutlookThe macroeconomic environment and the geopolitical situation in Ukraine and Russia have created a particularly unpredictable situation and make it difficult to assess the change in demand across our different markets.The Group unequivocally condemns the war in Ukraine and is monitoring the situation closely. Since the beginning of the conflict  priority has been given to the safety of teams in Ukraine with whom daily contact is maintained. Tarkett is actively supporting its 375 employees and their families  notably with salary continuance and temporary accommodation measures. The Group has also set up an internal solidarity fund allowing to provide financial aid to the teams based in Ukraine. Sales have resumed at a very slow pace  however the production site located in the west of the country is currently able to continue operating.In Russia  the Group has been producing flooring for the Residential market for over 20 years. Aware of its responsibility as an employer  particularly to its 1 550 local employees  the Group continues to operate in the country in full compliance with international & local regulations. However  the Group has frozen all significant new investments in Russia. Anticipating a fall in demand and increase in supply restrictions  the Group expects a marked slowdown in the second quarter  although it is currently impossible to quantify.In Europe  the combination of inflation and the geopolitical situation could affect demand  particularly in the Residential segment. Trends at the beginning of the year were stronger in North America  however the Residential segment could also level off. In Sports  a good level of business is expected throughout the year due to the good backlog.Tarkett is continuing the roll out of new product ranges and its ambitious circular economy strategy  notably with innovative and significant investments in its recycling capabilities. The Group also announced its new Climate Roadmap for 2030 with the objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its entire value chain by 30% and increase the recycled content of its products to 30% by 2030. These objectives will be assessed and approved by the independent organization Science Based Targets (SBTi) by the end of the year.Actions to reduce the cost structure are well underway and the Group is forecasting around 30 million euros of annual structural savings in 2022.The significant increase in oil and energy prices will contribute to the increase in purchasing costs now valued at 250 million euros compared to 2021 (against an estimated 220 million euros at the beginning of the year).The Group continues to implement selling price increases across all its geographies to offset the effect of increased purchasing costs over the year. At the current level of purchasing prices  the Group is targeting a neutral inflation balance over the year (selling price effect compared to 2021 minus purchasing price effect).This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

The exchange rate effect is obtained by applying the prior year’s exchange rate to sales for the current year and calculating the difference with sales for the current year. It also includes the effect of price adjustments in the CIS countries intended to offset the change in local currencies against the euro.The effect of changes in scope is composed of: current year sales by entities not included in the scope of consolidation in the same period of the prior year  until the anniversary of their consolidation; the reduction in sales due to discontinued operations that are not included in the current year's scope of consolidation but were included in sales for the same period of the prior year  until the anniversary of their disposal.In millions of euros Q1 2022 revenue Q1 2021 revenue Change Of which volume Of which selling prices Of which CIS selling prices Of which exchange rate effect Of which effect of changes in scope Group Total Q1 684.7 558.8 +22.5%+6.4%+8.8%+4.1% +3.3% - Of which organic growth +15.2% Of which selling price increases +12.9%2/ Bridges in millions of euros Q1 2022Revenue by segmentQ1 2021 558.8 +/- EMEA +19.0 +/- North America +29.1 +/- CIS  APAC & Latin America +0.5 +/- Sports +36.2 Q1 2022 Like-for-like 643.7 +/- Scope effect +0.2 +/- Currencies +22.8 +/- Lag effect in CIS +18.0 Q1 2022 684.7***Attachment,neutral,0.3,0.63,0.07,mixed,0.33,0.2,0.47,True,English,"['Q1 2022 Net Sales', 'Solid performance', 'sustained activity', 'price increases', 'acceleration', 'selling', 'negative foreign exchange effect', 'positive exchange rate effect', 'New selling price increases', '+3.3% exchange rate effect', 'The North America segment', 'higher price levels', 'The Supervisory Board', 'alternative performance indicators', 'strongest geographical region', 'price increases Results', 'Significant price increases', 'luxury vinyl tiles', 'Latin America segment', 'Selling price adjustments', 'additional significant increase', 'organic growth” indicator', 'The EMEA segment', 'Q1 2022 Net Sales', 'total Group sales', 'total effect', 'positive trend', 'Residential segment', 'price changes', 'selling prices', 'good performance', 'LATAM region', 'Sports segment', 'The Group', '+55.7% organic growth', 'sustained activity', 'first quarter', 'slight decrease', 'good start', 'purchasing costs', 'raw materials', 'energy prices', 'currency movements', 'selective approach', 'commercial carpets', 'Commercial Health', 'rubber accessories', 'fourth quarter', 'Brazilian real', 'excellent quarter', 'strong growth', 'high level', 'geopolitical situation', 'unpredictable situation', 'different markets', 'Solid performance', 'Commercial sales', 'procurement environment', 'Education segments', 'hospitality segments', 'APAC region', 'macroeconomic environment', 'Organic change', '238 million euros', '204 million euros', '109 million euros', 'Strong increase', 'high backlog', 'Euronext Paris', 'Q1 2021 Change', 'sustained demand', 'Net revenue', 'CIS countries', 'slower business', 'early March', 'Tarkett range', 'Continued inflation', '2022 Environment', 'acceleration', '6.4% volume', 'volumes', 'year', 'Step-up', 'impact', 'April', 'TKTT', 'consolidated', 'IFRS', 'detail', 'appendix', 'document', 'millions', 'effects', 'devaluation', 'rouble', 'Story', 'orders', 'December', 'flooring', 'office', 'appreciation', 'cessation', 'Ukraine', 'beginning', 'conflict', '24 February', 'Russia', 'Kazakhstan', 'success', 'Outlook', 'war', '1.', '685']",2022-04-27,2022-04-27,finance.yahoo.com

Tenant sales have recovered further during the quarter and reached 93% of 2019 levels in Q1 and 95% in March. This has supported the continued improvement of rent collection to 93% for the Group as a whole.The vital role our centres play in the omnichannel strategy of leading brands was also illustrated by strong leasing performance. We signed more deals than in Q1-2019  realising an MGR uplift of +6%.We also laid the foundations for our strategy to grow media revenues by converting our footfall into qualified audiences. During the quarter  we signed a new media contract with Clear Channel France  built on an improved revenue share  and activated a programmatic digital out-of-home advertising campaign  that will allow us to better measure the effectiveness of in-mall advertising  audience behaviours and sales conversion.Story continuesDuring the quarter  we pursued our deleveraging effort with the streamlining of our US portfolio through the disposal of the former Promenade Mall land plot  while in Europe the Group signed an agreement for the disposal of Gera Arcaden  both at a premium to the last appraisal.Based on Q1 performance  including the improved collection levels and sustained leasing activity  we confirm our 2022 AREPS guidance of €8.20 to €8.40 per share  while we are monitoring very closely the potential impact of the wider economic and geopolitical situation on our markets.”1. TurnoverThe proportionate turnover1 of URW for the first three months of 2022 amounted to €897.1 Mn  up by +34.2% year-on-year  reflecting the impact of the post COVID-19 recovery and asset deliveries  partly offset by the impact of disposals.Turnover IFRS Proportionate YTD in € Mn  excluding VAT Q1-2022 Q1-2021 restated2 Change Q1-2022 Q1-2021 restated2 Change Shopping Centres 572.9 442.8 29.4% 733.3 569.8 28.7% Gross Rental Income 480.8 360.6 33.4% 622.4 472.8 31.7% Service charge income 92.1 82.2 12.0% 110.9 97.0 14.3% Offices & Others 22.0 21.1 4.2% 23.5 23.2 1.1% Gross Rental Income 17.8 17.4 2.0% 19.0 19.5 -2.3% Service charge income 4.3 3.7 14.4% 4.5 3.7 18.9% Convention & Exhibition 61.2 12.8 n.m. 61.9 13.0 n.m.

Gross Rental IncomeFrom an accounting standpoint  Gross Rental Income (“GRI”) includes the COVID-19 rent discounts  indexation  vacancy impact  and variable revenues  while doubtful debtor provisions are part of the property operating expenses.The GRI for the Shopping Centre division amounted on a proportionate basis to €622.4 Mn for Q1-2022  an increase of +31.7%. The GRI increase is primarily due to a base effect of rent relief provided in Q1-2021  when lockdowns were in place in all regions except in the US  while no rent relief has been accounted for shopping centres3 in the Q1-2022 P&L  as well as due to indexation.Growth was strong in Austria and Poland (in the Central Europe region) where rents and service charges were not due during lockdown periods. In addition  the Group benefitted from an improvement in variable income (SBR  parking income and Commercial Partnerships)  in particular in the UK and the US. The Netherlands benefitted from the delivery of Westfield Mall of the Netherlands in March 2021  while results for the Nordics were affected by the disposal of Solna Centrum in February 2022. In the US  the Group also benefitted from a positive FX impact  partly offset by the foreclosure of Sarasota  Broward and Palm Desert and remaining rental abatements for tenants in the airport business.GRI for the Offices & Others division was down marginally compared to Q1-2021  driven by the disposal of SHiFT  Les Villages 3  4 and 6  Le Blériot  and the Palisade residential building at Westfield UTC in 2021  partly offset by the successful leasing of Trinity and the delivery of Pullman Montparnasse. Convention & Exhibition GRI increased to €42.1 Mn from €10.2 Mn in Q1-2021  as the business has recovered strongly with 102 events in Q1-2022 compared to 13 events in Q1-2021.Gross Rental Income IFRS Proportionate YTD in € Mn  excluding VAT Q1-2022 Q1-2021 Change Q1-2022 Q1-2021 Change Shopping Centres 480.8 360.6 33.4% 622.4 472.8 31.7% France 139.4 111.3 25.3% 141.9 112.8 25.8% Spain 43.0 33.9 26.9% 43.1 33.9 27.0% Southern Europe 182.4 145.2 25.6% 185.0 146.8 26.1% Central Europe 51.9 34.4 50.9% 57.6 36.1 59.4% Austria 36.3 13.5 168.7% 36.3 13.5 168.7% Germany 23.8 14.5 64.4% 34.5 20.4 68.9% Central and Eastern Europe 111.9 62.3 79.5% 128.3 70.0 83.2% Nordics 28.9 27.9 3.4% 28.9 27.9 3.4% The Netherlands 22.6 13.9 63.1% 22.6 13.9 63.1% Northern Europe 51.5 41.8 23.2% 51.5 41.8 23.2% United Kingdom 25.7 9.5 169.9% 47.7 20.2 135.7% United States 109.3 101.7 7.4% 209.9 193.9 8.2% Offices & Others 17.8 17.4 2.0% 19.0 19.5 -2.3% France 12.3 9.3 32.2% 12.9 9.3 37.8% Other countries 5.4 8.1 -32.9% 6.2 10.2 -39.3% Convention & Exhibition 41.4 10.1 n.m. 42.1 10.2 n.m.

In Q1  the Omicron wave with a record high number of COVID-19 cases  led to a lockdown in The Netherlands as well as some restrictions in other countries  including guidance to work from home  capacity restrictions  reduced opening hours for F&B  restrictions for non-vaccinated persons and mask mandates  holding back the recovery. Sales in Germany and Austria  which had more stringent restrictions  remained more impacted  while Central Europe and the Nordics performed well at 96% and 93%. The UK showed an improvement from 84% in Q4-2021 to 89% in Q1-2022.In the US  sales continue to be consistently above 2019 levels  reaching 102% in Q1 and 104% in March.

Leasing and vacancyLeasing activity remained strong with 521 deals signed in Q1  up +4% vs. 2019 (50111)  for a total Minimum Guaranteed Rent of €85.2 Mn (vs. €80.8 Mn in Q1-2019) and a MGR uplift of +6%  illustrating continued retailer appetite for URW’s Flagship destinations.The Group pursued its pragmatic and proactive leasing strategy designed to protect asset values and select the right time to negotiate long-term leases under improved conditions  with the proportion of long-term deals (above 36 months) signed in Q1 improving compared to H2-2021  at 60% vs. 55%  mainly driven by the European portfolio.The uplift continued to be positive on long-term deals for the Group  while in the US and the UK  short term deals had a negative MGR uplift  partly compensated by increased SBR.SBR  which is mainly driven by the US  amounted to €32.5 Mn in Q1-2022  almost double the €16.8 Mn of SBR in Q1-2021.The lettings included:A nearly 3 000 sqm H&M in Westfield Les 4 Temps;A 1 350 sqm food hall concept in Westfield Mall of Scandinavia;Gucci in Westfield London;Sephora in Bonaire;American Girl in Westfield Century City;Céline in Westfield Valley Fair;JD Sports in Westfield Euralille and Westfield CentrO.In addition  the Group saw several key store openings in Q1  notably the AMC theatres in Westfield UTC and Westfield Montgomery  Rihanna’s Savage X Fenty lingerie store in Westfield Culver City  the SmileDirectClub in Westfield London and Westfield Stratford City  illustrating the growing health segment  Lego in Rennes Alma and Youseum  a social media experience  in Westfield Mall of Scandinavia.EPRA vacancy increased by +50 bps in the quarter vs. December 2021 to 7.5% for the Group  in line with the seasonal pattern observed in previous years. The vacancy is expected to decrease below 2021 levels in 2022.In Continental Europe  vacancy increased by +20 bps to 4.2%  mainly driven by Austria and Germany  partly offset by the Nordics and The Netherlands. In the UK  the vacancy increased from 10.6% to 11.6%  mainly driven by Westfield London. Plans to repurpose retail space in Westfield London to high-growth alternative uses are in place. In the US  the vacancy increase was +40 bps to 11.4% due to the CBD assets12 which are still affected by work from home. Excluding the CBD assets  the vacancy in US Flagships fell with -40 bps to 8.9%.4. Commercial PartnershipsCommercial Partnerships13 increased from €10.8 Mn in Q1-2021 to €25.5 Mn in Q1-2022.At its Investor Day in March  the Group presented its plan to increase revenues from advertising  brand experience and data by turning URW’s footfall into qualified audiences highly valued by brands. URW expects to generate €75 Mn in annual net revenues14 in Europe by 2024  a +€45 Mn increase compared to 2021  with strong growth potential beyond the plan horizon.In line with this  the Group announced an 8-year new media contract with Clear Channel France  the operator of URW’s over 600 digital out-of-home media screens throughout URW’s 20 French shopping centres  which welcome more than 185 million customer visits each year. The agreement will increase URW’s income through an improved revenue share and new innovative solutions  and is part of the €8.5 Mn14 of additional media advertising revenues that have already been secured  as announced at the Investor Day.5. DisposalsOn February 1  2022  URW completed the sale of Solna Centrum to Alecta Fastigheter for an agreed Total Acquisition Cost of €272 Mn.In addition  the Group completed on February 16  2022  the disposal of a 45% stake in the Westfield Carré Sénart shopping centre to Société Générale Assurances and BNP Paribas Cardif  with an IFRS net debt reduction of €280 Mn.Furthermore  the Group announced on April 4  2022  an agreement with an institutional investor for the sale of Gera Arcaden  in Germany  for an agreed Total Acquisition Cost of €116 Mn (at 100%  URW share 51%)  which represents a premium to the last appraised value. The transaction is expected to complete in Q2-2022  subject to standard closing conditions.URW also continued to streamline its US regional portfolio with the sale of the 34-acre site of the former Promenade Mall  located in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles  to a group of private investors. This transaction demonstrates the significant potential for alternative investment in and around the company’s assets  which URW can leverage to support its efforts to deleverage. The sale price of $150 Mn (at 100%  URW share 55%) reflects a 60% premium to the latest appraisal.6. OutlookBased on Q1 performance  including the improved collection levels and sustained leasing activity  the Group confirms its 2022 AREPS guidance of €8.20 to €8.40 per share  while the Group continues to closely monitor the potential impact of the wider economic and geopolitical situation on its markets7.

More than 50 peer-reviewed studies and 48 on-farm trials in 14 countries show Bovaer® consistently reduces enteric methane emissions by approximately 30% for dairy cows and even higher percentages for beef cattle.DSM and Elanco intend to provide farmers  dairy and beef companies  and retailers with a solution to substantially lower the carbon footprint of beef and dairy production  supporting the animal protein industry's ESG efforts and helping secure a sustainable future for the planet. The methane reduction from feeding a million cows Bovaer® is equivalent to planting 45 million trees or removing 300 000 cars from the road. With 9 million dairy cows and 14 million beef cattle on feed in the U.S. alone  the product would contribute to a significant and immediate reduction of the environmental footprint of meat and dairy products  supporting the Global Methane Pledge to cut emissions 30% by 2030.Story continuesThe strategic alliance is expected to enable both parties to maximize the opportunity for the product in the U.S. market  once approved  while also nearly doubling previously announced Bovaer® production capacity globally. Elanco will be responsible for the U.S. approval process  commercialization strategy and product supply  supporting DSM supply in markets outside the U.S. Elanco will assess and evaluate the regulatory submission and manufacturing options with the intent to bring Bovaer® to the U.S. market as quickly as possible. Already the State of Indiana  for example  has indicated its support for expanded manufacturing investment in the state as it continues to build public-private partnerships supporting the state's growing agriculture economy.""We are excited to partner with DSM to start the process of bringing this game-changing innovation to U.S. livestock producers "" said Jeff Simmons  president and CEO of Elanco. ""It will further strengthen Elanco's efforts to create the livestock sustainability market and the next era of value for farmers by adding to our efforts to reduce  measure and monetize emission reductions  including Experior™  Uplook™ and Athian. We are eager to work with regulators to bring a unique innovation like DSM's Bovaer® to the U.S. market as quickly as possible to support farmers and positively impact the climate crisis.""Geraldine Matchett and Dimitri de Vreeze  Co-CEOs of Royal DSM  commented: ""This agreement marks an important milestone for DSM  Elanco  and the climate change mitigation efforts of the U.S. We believe Elanco  as a company that shares our determination to revolutionize the sustainability of the cattle industry  is the ideal partner to help us increase and accelerate the total impact of our game-changing feed additive by bringing us closer to customers across the U.S. This alliance will help us realize Bovaer®'s potential as a powerful solution with a significantly positive impact on the planet. In addition  and fully aligned with our purpose-led performance-driven strategy  the alliance enables us as DSM to monetize our long-term innovation faster.""With an estimated global market opportunity for livestock methane reduction of $1 billion to $2 billion  Elanco expects Bovaer® to have blockbuster annual revenue potential in excess of US$200 million in the U.S. market with initial contribution by mid-decade.

This reflects the combination of a 53% growth at constant exchange rates and a positive currency impact of 3%3.On a sequential basis  fourth quarter revenue was up 35% at constant exchange rates compared with the third quarter of FY’22  representing a seventh consecutive quarter-over-quarter organic revenue growth since the first quarter of FY’21.Paul Boudre  Soitec’s CEO  commented: “Thanks to another record quarter  we completed our fiscal year with a 50% annual organic growth  an even higher level than initially anticipated allowing us to pass the one billion US dollars revenue mark for the first time. We are very proud of such a strong performance and particularly pleased that significant growth was achieved by all our products  demonstrating the value that we bring to our customers on our three end markets: mobile communications  automotive and industrial  and smart devices.“Among the key events of the quarter  in line with our FY’26 strategic roadmap  we announced the expansion of our manufacturing footprint in Bernin to ramp up overall production and manufacture innovative SmartSiC™ wafers. SmartSiC™ will primarily address the key challenges of the electric vehicle and industrial markets ” added Paul Boudre.Story continuesFourth quarter FY’22 consolidated revenue (unaudited)Q4’21 Q4’22 Q4’22/Q4’21 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates 150/200-mm 74 94 +27% +25% 300-mm 95 175 +85% +81% Royalties and other revenue 12 13 +10% +9% Total revenue 181 282 +56% +53%Soitec recorded a 53% total revenue increase at constant exchange rates in the fourth quarter of FY’22 compared to the fourth quarter of FY’21  with a solid performance across all types of products in each end market.Soitec achieved another strong growth in Mobile communications  its largest end market  which continues to be supported by the deployment of 5G  whether in sub-6 GHz or in mmWave. The expansion of 5G is translating into much higher sales of RF-SOI wafers dedicated to radiofrequency applications  POI wafers dedicated to RF filters  and also FD-SOI wafers for 5G mmWave modules. Growth was enabled by the ramp-up in production following the capacity increase in our Singapore facility dedicated to 300-mm SOI products and in Bernin III  dedicated to 150-mm POI products.Soitec enjoyed further growth in Automotive & Industrial as evidenced by the sustained sales of Power-SOI and FD-SOI  which continue to benefit from the recovery of the automotive market.Soitec also achieved a sharp increase in revenue from Smart devices thanks to much higher sales of FD-SOI wafers for Internet of Things and edge computing applications as well as of Photonics-SOI wafers for data centers.150/200-mm wafer revenue150/200-mm wafers are mostly dedicated to radiofrequency applications  including filters  and  for a smaller part  to power applications. In the fourth quarter of FY’22  150/200-mm wafer revenue reached 94 million Euros  a 25% growth at constant exchange rates compared to the fourth quarter of FY’21. This growth mostly reflects a strong increase in volumes of 150-mm POI wafers produced in Bernin III  as well as a higher output of 200-mm SOI wafers in Bernin I thanks to the industrial performance and at Simgui  Soitec’s partner based in Shanghai. It also reflects a positive price/mix effect.150/200-mm wafer revenue growth was mainly supported by:Higher RF-SOI 200-mm wafer sales compared to the fourth quarter of FY’21 An increase in POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafer sales compared to the fourth quarter of FY21.On a sequential basis  150/200-mm wafer revenue was up 9% at constant exchange rates compared to the third quarter of FY’22  with higher RF-SOI 200-mm and Power SOI wafer sales.300-mm wafer revenueIn the fourth quarter of FY’22  300-mm wafer sales reached 175 million Euros  an 81% increase at constant exchange rates  compared with the fourth quarter of FY’21. Sales growth essentially results from a strong demand on Soitec’s three end markets and the Group’s capacity to deliver more volumes from Bernin II (thanks to the very good industrial performance) and from Singapore (thanks to the capacity increase)  and to a small extent from a positive price/mix effect.RF-SOI 300-mm wafer sales significantly increased compared with the fourth quarter of FY’21. Sales continue to be supported by the ongoing deployment of 5G smartphones and by the increase in RF content in every 5G smartphone.FD-SOI wafer sales continued to enjoy a strong growth and were significantly higher than in the fourth quarter of FY’21  as FD-SOI is increasingly benefitting applications across Soitec’s three end markets  i.e. Smart devices  Automotive and Industrial  and Mobile communications  especially 5G mmWave modules.Sales of Imager-SOI wafers  which allow 3D image sensing for facial recognition in smartphones  also reached a higher level than in the fourth quarter of FY’21.Finally  sales of Photonics-SOI wafers for data centers were much higher than in the fourth quarter of FY’21  confirming the positive trend experienced since the fourth quarter of FY’21.On a sequential basis  300-mm wafer revenue increased 50% at constant exchange rates compared to the third quarter of FY’22  with strong growth achieved in every product line.Royalties and other revenueTotal Royalties and other revenue reached 13 million Euros in the fourth quarter of FY’22 compared to 12 million Euros in the fourth quarter of FY’21  up 9% at constant exchange rates.FY’22 annual consolidated revenue (unaudited)FY’21 FY’22 FY’22/FY’21 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates 150/200-mm 277 344 +24% +26% 300-mm 277 488 +77% +79% Royalties and other revenues 30 30 +1% +2% Total revenue 584 863 +48% +50%Annual consolidated revenue reached 863 million Euros in FY’22  an all-time high record. Revenue was up 48% from 584 million Euros in FY’21. This reflects the combination of a 50% growth at constant exchange rates and a negative currency impact of 2%.150/200-mm wafer sales were up 26% at constant exchange rates compared to FY’21 while 300-mm wafer sales were up 79% at constant exchange rates.FY’22 OutlookThanks in particular to the higher revenue level in Q4’22  FY’22 EBITDA1 margin2 is now expected around 35.5%  Soitec having previously guided around 34% with a potential upside to reach around 35%.FY’23 outlookSoitec anticipates FY’23 revenue up around 20% at constant exchange rates and perimeter and EBITDA margin at least at the level of FY’22 EBITDA1 margin2.FY’26 Financial modelSoitec is anticipating significant growth on each of its end markets and is managing its business to reach by FY’26 a revenue target of around 2.3 billion US Dollar and an EBITDA1 margin2 target of around 40% (at a 1.20 Euro/US Dollar exchange rate)  as compared to a revenue of 2 billion US Dollar (with a high case around 2.4 billion US Dollar) and a 35% EBITDA1 margin2 communicated during its Capital Markets Day in June 2021.Key events of the quarterDolphin Design opens a processing center in SingaporeOn January 5th  2022  Dolphin Design  specialized in advanced chip design  announced that it will open its new dedicated Edge Computing and AI branch in Soitec’s fab in Singapore.

Elanco has secured the exclusive U.S. licensing rights to develop  manufacture and commercialize Bovaer® for beef and dairy cattle.Bovaer® is a first-in-class methane-reducing product for beef and dairy cattle approved in Europe  Brazil  Chile and Australia. As part of its authorization in those countries  more than 50 peer-reviewed studies and 48 on-farm trials in 14 countries show Bovaer® consistently reduces enteric methane emissions by approximately 30% for dairy cows and even higher percentages for beef cattle1.DSM and Elanco intend to seek U.S. authorization for the product to provide farmers  dairy and beef companies  and retailers with a solution to substantially lower the carbon footprint of beef and dairy production  supporting the animal protein industry’s ESG efforts and helping secure a sustainable future for the planet. Based on published research  the methane reduction from feeding a million cows Bovaer® is equivalent to planting 45 million trees or removing 300 000 cars from the road. With 9 million dairy cows and 14 million beef cattle on feed in the U.S. alone  the product  if authorized in the U.S.  would contribute to a significant and immediate reduction of the environmental footprint of meat and dairy products  supporting the Global Methane Pledge to cut emissions 30% by 2030.2The strategic alliance is expected to enable both parties to maximize the opportunity for the product in the U.S. market  once approved  while also nearly doubling previously announced Bovaer® production capacity globally. Elanco will be responsible for the U.S. approval process  commercialization strategy and product supply  supporting DSM supply in markets outside the U.S. Elanco will assess and evaluate the regulatory submission and manufacturing options with the intent to bring Bovaer® to the U.S. market as quickly as possible. Already the State of Indiana  for example  has indicated its support for expanded manufacturing investment in the state as it continues to build public-private partnerships supporting the state’s growing agriculture economy.“ We are excited to partner with DSM to start the process of bringing this game-changing innovation to U.S. livestock producers ” said Jeff Simmons  president and CEO of Elanco. “ It will further strengthen Elanco’s efforts to create the livestock sustainability market and the next era of value for farmers by adding to our efforts to reduce  measure and monetize emission reductions  including Experior™  Uplook™ and Athian. We are eager to work with regulators to bring a unique innovation like DSM’s Bovaer® to the U.S. market as quickly as possible to support farmers and positively impact the climate crisis.”Geraldine Matchett and Dimitri de Vreeze  Co-CEOs of Royal DSM  commented: “ This agreement marks an important milestone for DSM  Elanco  and the climate change mitigation efforts of the U.S. We believe Elanco  as a company that shares our determination to revolutionize the sustainability of the cattle industry  is the ideal partner to help us increase and accelerate the total impact of our game-changing feed additive by bringing us closer to customers across the U.S. This alliance will help us realize Bovaer®’s potential as a powerful solution with a significantly positive impact on the planet. In addition  and fully aligned with our purpose-led performance-driven strategy  the alliance enables us as DSM to monetize our long-term innovation faster.”With an estimated global market opportunity for livestock methane reduction of $1 billion to $2 billion  Elanco expects Bovaer® to have blockbuster annual revenue potential in excess of US$200 million in the U.S. market with initial contribution by mid-decade. This alliance is not expected to impact Elanco’s previously stated financial commitments.ABOUT ELANCOElanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE: ELAN) is a global leader in animal health dedicated to innovating and delivering products and services to prevent and treat disease in farm animals and pets  creating value for farmers  pet owners  veterinarians  stakeholders  and society as a whole.

Albeit negative  revenue growth at constant currency improved sequentially  driven by an improvement in our Tech Foundations business while Digital and Cybersecurity remained well into positive territory.Atos actively laid the foundations of its transformation  with the swift adaptation of its governance under the helm of a strengthened senior executive team  while continuing to capitalize on its core expertise. Gartner recently ranked Atos the new number one company in managed security services worldwide. We also unveiled our new exascale-class BullSequana supercomputer  bolstering our position as the undisputed European leader in supercomputing.We continued to press ahead with large-scale recruitment in our growth activities and exceeded our Q1 target with 8 200 gross new hires  mainly in offshore and nearshore locations.These are encouraging signs that the Group is starting to reap the benefits of the energetic turnaround plan engaged since the beginning of the year. I am confident that we are taking the right steps to position Atos on a long-term value creation path.”Q1 2022 revenue: -0.6% at constant currency  -2.4% organicallyAtos’ consolidated revenue was € 2 747 million in Q1 2022  up +2.1% on a reported basis  and down -0.6% at constant currency. On an organic basis  revenue decreased by -2.4%. Q1 2022 showed a significant sequential improvement compared to Q4 2021  where revenue contracted -5.4% at constant currency and -6.9% organically excluding the impact of the UK BPO contract reassessment.Story continuesThe acquisition of Cloudreach was finalized on January 3rd  leading to full consolidation and reporting under the Americas as well as Northern Europe & APAC regions since that date. In total  acquisitions contributed +1.7% to the Group’s revenue growth. Foreign exchange contributed +2.7%  mainly reflecting the appreciation of the American Dollar and the Pound Sterling against the Euro over the period.Q1 2022 revenue by Regional Business UnitUnder Atos’ new simplified governance  regional business units have been modified. The table below presents pro forma figures for Q1 2021 at constant currency. A reconciliation between former regional business units and the new ones is presented in the appendix of this press release.In € million Q1 2022 Q1 2021* Change at constant currency Americas 647 637 +1.5% Northern Europe & APAC 821 841 -2.3% Central Europe 617 629 -1.8% Southern Europe 601 607 -1.0% Rest of the World 60 51 +18.3% Total 2 747 2 765 -0.6% * At constant currencyAmericas revenue grew by +1.5% at constant currency  driven by the contribution of recent acquisitions in multi-cloud services (Cloudreach) and in product lifecycle management (Processia). Growth in Digital activities  in particular with the ramp-up of a large contract in Healthcare & Life Sciences  was offset by a decrease in Unified Communication & Collaboration activities.Northern Europe & APAC revenue decreased by -2.3% at constant currency. Strong business growth in Manufacturing and Healthcare & Life Sciences was offset by a decrease in other industries  especially Telecom  Media & Technology  which suffered from a volume reduction in its “lab as a service” activity  and in Financial Services & Insurance  following the reassessment of the large BPO contract in Q4 2021  which effect was mitigated by the ramp up of other contracts.Central Europe revenue decreased by -1.8% at constant currency  driven by a significant decrease in Telecom  Media & Technology due to the ramp down of contracts with two large telecom customers. Most of the other industries delivered growth  in particular Resources & Services with the start of new contracts for a global foodservice retailer and a leading logistic company.Southern Europe revenue decreased by -1.0% at constant currency. The situation was contrasted across industries  with strong growth in Healthcare & Life Sciences’ digital activities  as well as in Manufacturing  driven by the ramp-up of a large automotive contract and the catch up on High-Performance Computing deals that slipped from 2021 to 2022. Conversely  revenue decreased in Public Sector & Defense due to lower High-Performance Computing sales  in Financial Services & Insurance due to the termination of a contract with a major Spanish bank  and in Telecom  Media & Technology  due to lower hardware and software resale.Rest of the World revenue grew strongly  by +18.3% at constant currency  supported by business related to the Beijing Olympics and a strong growth across most industries.Q1 2022 revenue by IndustryThe situation was contrasted across Industries with Manufacturing  Resources & Services and Healthcare & Lifesciences recording growth  while revenue decreased in Financial Services & Insurance  Public Sector & Defense and Telecom  Media & Technology.In € million Q1 2022 Q1 2021* Change at constant currency Manufacturing 521 494 +5.6% Financial Services & Insurance 539 563 -4.3% Public Sector & Defense 573 589 -2.7% Telecom  Media & Technology 347 386 -10.1% Resources & Services 412 406 +1.6% Healthcare & Life Sciences 355 327 +8.4% Total 2 747 2 765 -0.6% * At constant currencyManufacturing revenue grew by +5.6% at constant currency  rebounding from a low Q1 2021  supported by the acquisition of Processia in June 2021 and by increased volumes in the cloud computing sector.Financial Services & Insurance revenue decreased by -4.3% at constant currency  following the reassessment of the large BPO contract conducted in Q4 2021  and the termination of a contract with a major Spanish Bank.Public Sector & Defense revenue decreased by -2.7% at constant currency  due to lower High-Performance Computing sales and the ramp-down of digital workplace projects with a US State.In Telecom  Media & Technology  revenue contracted by -10.1% at constant currency  driven by a volume reduction in the “lab as a service” activity  as well as contracts ramp-down in telecoms.Resources & Services revenue grew by +1.6% at constant currency as solid growth in transport & logistics compensated a decrease in the energy sector.Healthcare & Life Sciences posted a strong +8.4% growth at constant currency  with solid growth in most regions.Commercial activityOrder entry was € 2.0 billion in Q1 2022  representing a book to bill ratio of 72%  compared to 96% in Q1 2021. This low level is not representative of revenue trends expected for the balance of the year  as it is primarily the reflect of (i) the timing of contract renewals  as significant renewals took place in prior quarters  including in Q1 2021 and (ii) a decrease in the average duration of new contracts.Full backlog was € 23.3 billion  decreasing by € 0.7 billion at constant currency compared to the end of 2021 and representing 2.1 years of revenue. The full qualified pipeline reached € 6.9 billion  broadly stable compared to the end of 2021 at constant currency.Human resourcesTotal headcount stood at 111 355 at the end of March 2022  up +2.0% compared to 109 135 at the end of December 2021 (+1.4% organically).In the first quarter of 2022  Atos hired 8 234 new employees (gross) mainly in Digital and BDS  and predominantly in offshore and nearshore countries  and welcomed Cloudreach’s 742 employees.2022 full-year objectives confirmedAtos confirms its 2022 full-year objectives and reiterates that its performance will be back-end loaded towards the second half of the year.While the first half of the year will be impacted by the continued decline in classic IT services  combined with personnel cost inflation and supply chain tensions  we target an improvement in the second half  with revenue growth at constant currency turning positive  and an uptick in operating margin. This improvement will be the reflect of performance optimization actions already implemented  an easier comparison basis and a more favorable revenue mix.Free cash flow should improve compared to 2021  and will largely depend on operating margin delivery and further working capital fluctuations.For the full-year  Atos expects:Revenue growth at constant currency of -0.5% to +1.5%;Operating margin of 3% to 5%;Free cash flow between €-150 million and € 200 million.Atos confirmed managed exit of Russia-based operationsAtos condemns the war in Ukraine. On April 5  the Group confirmed the managed exit of its Russia-based operations  that generated c. 0.4% of Group revenue in 2021. Atos delivers critical digital services to some of its global clients out of Russia.The feasibility of exiting Russia has required significant planning in terms of implications for business operations and for Atos employees based there.

US based Wenger is a global leader in processing solutions focused on pet food  alternative protein and aqua feed and has around 500 employees and ~USD 190m in annual revenues. The USD 540m acquisition of Wenger is a platform investment into new and attractive growth markets for Marel and will form a fourth business segment for the Marel brand  in addition to the current full-line offering for poultry  meat and fish. Pro forma leverage expected to be around 3x net debt / EBITDA.Acquisition of Sleegers Technique announced on 22 April 2022. With 27 FTEs and revenues of ~EUR 5m  Sleegers is a Dutch provider of interleaving  stacking  loading  and slicing solutions. Complimentary product offering and strategic fit with case-ready products within plant-based proteins  as well as poultry  meat and fish.Story continuesÁrni Oddur Thórdarson  CEO“We have delivered yet another record quarter in orders received of EUR 422 million. Our pioneering solutions and our decisive decision to ramp up the sales and service coverage ahead of the growth curve is clearly bearing fruits in strengthening our market position  while short-term it is increasing the operating cost as a proportion of revenues.It is interesting to see how fast the investment appetite by our poultry and fish customers is increasing. In an inflationary environment  those segments can provide excellent consumer ready food at favorable feed conversion rates. Furthermore  while mobility increases  sushi is clearly back on the menu. We are seeing significant organic increase in order intake in the fish segment  with strong order intake in the poultry segment while the meat segment is stable between quarters.Revenues are at EUR 372 million  a slight increase between quarters and 11% increase between years. While we were targeting higher revenue levels  the year started slowly impacted by absenteeism and disrupted flows in the value chain  but ramped up gradually throughout the quarter. Operational results are hampered with 8.4% EBIT margins. Cash flow remains strong. We are taking action to clarify accountability  improve the flow and increase the speed. Additionally  we have implemented dynamic pricing adjustments in the recent two quarters that will counterbalance inflation although it takes time to filter through. We will gradually ramp up revenues throughout the year that support better cost coverage and stronger operational results. We stay firm on our target to reach a run rate of 16% EBIT before year-end 2023.We are thrilled to announce the agreement to acquire Wenger  a US-based company with 500 employees and ~USD 190 million in annual revenues and good profitability. Marel and Wenger have a shared passion to transform the way food is processed through innovation in close partnerships with customers. This platform acquisition will form the fourth segment in our business model  in addition to our full-line offering for the poultry  meat and fish industries. This is a decisive step into the plant-based protein industry where the addressable market is forecast to grow at a rate of 15-20% annually. Consumers are demanding a healthy and balanced diet where proteins  animal and plant-based  will be at the center of the plate. Additionally  Wenger is a leading global provider of solutions to the sizeable pet food industry and has a strong foothold in the aquafeed industry.On a pro-forma basis  this new business segment accounts for around 10% of Marel’s total revenues and 12% of combined EBITDA. Leverage following completion of the acquisition is estimated at close to 3x net debt/EBITDA. Based on our strong financials  robust cash flow and organizational readiness  our continued focus is on strategic moves that support our 2026 growth targets.”Financial performanceStrong start to the year following record orders in 2021Orders received in the quarter were EUR 421.7m up 5.2% QoQ and 14.2% YoY (4Q21: 400.7m  1Q21: 369.4m)  with strong orders across all industries and all processing stages benefiting from structural volume growth in the industry.Good product mix with clear step up in sales of standard consumer-ready solutions and continued momentum in aftermarket.Megatrends such as increased need for automation and digitalization CAPEX in food processing are ongoing  accelerated by the pandemic and increased geopolitical tensions. Coupled with rising commodity prices  labor scarcity  and increased focus from consumers and regulators on sustainability in food production  the demand for Marel’s pioneering solutions is on the rise evidenced by record orders received and a very strong pipeline.M&A continues to stimulate organic growth and accelerate the innovation roadmap. Recent bolt-on acquisitions in the fish sector have positively contributed to record orders received for Marel Fish in the quarter where a broader product portfolio following recent acquisitions was key.Order book at a high levelThe order book at end of March was EUR 619.1m  up 8.8% QoQ and 36.0% YoY (4Q21: 569.0m  1Q21: 455.3m)  representing 44.3% of 12-month trailing revenues.The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.13  compared to an average of 1.11 in the past four quarters (2Q21-1Q22)  and the fifth consecutive quarter where book-to-bill is around 1.10.Revenues rose to EUR 372m with 40% recurring aftermarket revenues contributing to earnings resilienceRevenues totaled EUR 371.6m  up 1.1% QoQ and 11.3% YoY (4Q21: 367.4m  1Q21: 334.0m).Revenues were below expectations mainly due to inefficiencies in availability of parts and absenteeism at an all time high in the quarter  resulting in slower throughput and installation and thus revenue recognition  especially in the first two months of the year.Marel is targeting further step-up in revenue growth in 2H22 and into 2023 on the back of a high order book and strong pipeline.Resilience of earnings supported by aftermarket revenues  comprised of services and spare parts  at 40% of total revenues in the quarter (4Q21: 40%  1Q21: 39%). Spare parts were at a record level for the third sequential quarter  continued full focus on strengthening the spare parts delivery model and shortening lead times.Price increases coupled with volume upside will support margin improvementGross profit margin was 36.1% in the quarter (4Q21: 35.9%  1Q21: 37.2%) and gross profit was EUR 134.0m (4Q21: 131.9m  1Q21: 124.4m)  impacted by array of headwinds  inflationary environment  and general inefficiencies due to supply chain pressures  bottlenecks and pandemic-related absenteeism peaking in early 2022.It is expected that cost pressures from global supply chain  logistics and inflation will continue to have an impact on operational results in 2022  thereafter returning to more normalized levels.Continued focus on mitigating actions to offset cost inflation and parts availability  e.g. improving flexibility of operations and dynamic value-based pricing. Marel has actively raised prices in the last two quarters  while orders and pipeline build up continues on a strong note. Time lag in cost/revenue development varies somewhat depending on business mix  where aftermarket takes on average 6-8 weeks to price through  standard equipment between 3-6 months and larger projects on average 9-12 months.Continued investment to transform spare parts handling with focus on investments in fulfillment centers and digitizing and automating the end-to-end parts handling to ensure shorter lead times. A new and digitalized global distribution center will be located in Eindhoven  strategically located close to Marel’s major distribution partners.Step up in revenues to provide better cost coverageSG&A of 21.5% (4Q21: 19.2%  1Q21: 19.7%)  compared to the mid-term YE23 target of 18.0%. SG&A is temporarily higher and better cost coverage will be reached through more volume.Sales and marketing (S&M) costs were at a level of 13.8% of revenues in 1Q22 (4Q21: 12.4%  1Q21: 12.0%)  compared to 12.2% of orders received  and reflect the customer activity and step up in market coverage  which has started to translate into increased orders.Travel for customer visits and exhibitions on the rise as restrictions are lifted  focus on maintaining cost efficiencies from new ways of working  but expecting high customer activity with key upcoming trade exhibitions taking place in Q1 and Q2.General administrative (G&A) costs were 7.7% of revenues (4Q21: 6.8%  1Q21: 7.7%)  with important transformative initiatives ongoing to support YE23 targets aimed at lowering G&A costs.Innovation costs at 6.1% (4Q21: 5.5%  1Q21: 6.2%).Marel does not adjust results for non-recurring costs  except for PPA and acquisition related costs.Continued focus on improved EBIT marginEBIT1 was EUR 31.3m (4Q21: 41.0m  1Q21: 38.0m)  translating to an EBIT1 margin in the quarter of 8.4% (4Q21: 11.2%  1Q21: 11.4%).EBIT margin in the quarter was colored by continued external margin pressures on gross profit from supply chain challenges  geopolitics and absenteeism at an all time high  in addition to higher operating expenses as a result of step up in market coverage and infrastructure initiatives to increase speed and agility.Strong orders received across all industries and processing stages will increase volume with foreseen more favorable industry mix  resulting in better cost coverage and higher operating profits.Management continues to target medium and long-term EBIT margin expansion for all industries. In the short term however  higher costs and non-recurring costs will continue to put pressure on margins in 2Q22.Group margin improvement expected in 2H22 with full focus to reach YE23 financial targets of 16% EBIT margin.Robust cash flow conversionOperating cash flow was EUR 32.7m in the quarter (4Q21: 54.5m  1Q21: 60.2m). Operating cash flow before inventory buildup at healthy level.Strong balance sheet used to mitigate supply chain challenges  inventory buildup of EUR 27.6m in the quarter  tying up capital and cash flow  to ensure timely delivery of equipment and spare parts to customers.Cash capital expenditures (Cash CAPEX) excluding R&D investments are expected to increase to on average 4-5% of revenues in 2021-2026  thereafter  returning to more normalized levels.Cash CAPEX excluding R&D investments in 1Q22 were EUR 7.7m (4Q21: 25.0m  1Q21: 6.8m).Free cash flow was EUR 14.6m in the quarter (4Q21: 15.8m  1Q21: 45.5m). Free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by inventory buildup  negative development in working capital and higher trade debtors.Full acquisition of fish processing solutions provider Curio announced and completed on 1 February 2022  where the additional 50.0% of the share capital of Curio was acquired for an investment of EUR 15.9m  bringing Marel’s total share of Curio to 100%.Strong cash conversion supports continued investments in innovation  infrastructure and strategic inventory buildup when needed.Strong balance sheet and robust financial position to support the 2017-2016 growth strategyLeverage was 1.2x at the end of 1Q22 (4Q21: 1.0x  1Q21: 0.8x)  well below the targeted capital structure of 2-3x.Committed liquidity of EUR 622.1m at the end of 1Q22  including fully committed all-senior funding in place until 2025.The strong financial position enables continued investment and will facilitate future strategic moves in the ongoing industry consolidation wave  in line with the company’s 2017-2026 growth strategy.As a subsequent event  Marel has announced the agreement to acquire Wenger on 27 April and the acquisition of Sleegers on 22 April. Pro forma leverage expected to be around 3x net debt EBITDA.All proposals approved at the 2022 AGMThe AGM agreed to a dividend of 5.12 euro cents per share for the operational year 2021 which was paid out in 1Q22.

Mitigation actions in place and order book targeted to convert faster into revenues in coming quartersEBIT1 margin in 1Q22 was -2.3% (4Q21: 4.6%  1Q21: 5.3%). Temporary decline in margins mainly due to less revenues against cost. Additionally  integration costs of newly acquired companies are not adjusted and impacting financial performance in 1Q22.

The audit has been carried out and the audit report relating to the certification of the accounts is available on Solutions 30’s website. The audit procedures are detailed at the end of the press release.Gianbeppi Fortis  Chairman of the Management Board of Solutions 30  states:“After the disruptions of the pandemic and of successive lockdowns in 2020 that helped to drive our telecoms activity in France  2021 saw a return to more normative levels of growth in this mature market segment for France  as well as supply chain difficulties and strong growth in the Benelux and Italy.France and Spain were some of the first European countries to roll out ultra-fast Internet networks. Today  other countries are also beginning to deploy their fiber-optic networks. In such a context  the group will take advantage of these growth opportunities everywhere it operates. This can already be seen in the first contracts signed in Italy and in the Benelux in 2021.We have thus begun to duplicate the success of our model in France.Over the coming months  the most important challenge will be to seize these growth opportunities throughout Europe and to put the tools  processes  and teams in place to ensure that this growth takes place in the right conditions  just as we did in France between 2015 and 2020.Story continuesWhile the negotiation and implementation phases of these new major contracts are having periodic negative effects on profitability  with our experience  our expertise  and our solid financial structure  we will make it through this learning curve and scale up our processes to quickly bring our margins up into the double digits.At the same time  in both France and Spain  we will need to consolidate our position in the more mature telecoms roll-out market and to increase our market share in fiber-optic network maintenance  electric mobility  energy savings  and renewable energy. This requires updating our tools and services  as we did in 2021  and will continue to do throughout 2022.The group is on the verge of a new period of growth  which should begin to show more clearly in the second half of 2022.All our teams are ready  composed  and confident going into this new growth phase  thanks to the work we’ve done to improve governance  compliance  and risk management  and our proven know-how.”Key figures – Consolidated dataIn millions of euros 12/31/2021 12/31/2020 Change Revenue 874.0 819.3 6.7% Operating margin (Adjusted EBITDA) 82.4 106.5 -22.7% As a % of revenue 9.4% 13.0% Adjusted EBIT(1) 40 8 60.9 -32.9% As a % of revenue 4.7% 7.4% Operating income (EBIT) 12 9 48.3 -73% As a % of revenue 1.5% 5.9% Consolidated net income 22.5 35.8 -37.3% As a % of revenue 2.6% 4.4% Net income  group share 21.5 34.5 -37.7% As a % of revenue 2.5% 4.2% Free cash flow(1) 32.4 124.8 - 92.4 Financial structure figures 12/31/2021 12/31/2020 Change Equity 191.6 170.0 +21.5 Net debt 33.1 28.9 +4.1 Net bank debt(1) - 52.3 - 59.2 +6.9(1) See glossary at the end of this documentActivityFor 2021  Solutions 30 posted revenue of €874.0 million compared to €819.3 million for 2020  representing growth of +6.7% (+3.6% organic growth) compared to 2020 and +26.4% compared to 2019  before the pandemic.After solid initial growth of 20.9% in the first half of the year  the second half of the year stood in sharp contrast:A mature market in France  which is returning to normal after a highly unusual 2020  with growth drivers (energy transition  5G) scaling up less quickly than forecasted due to supply chain issues.The end-of-year impact of high rates of quarantine-related absences due to more contagious variants  despite the continued use of prevention measures and procedures to protect the health of our employees and our customers.Strong sales momentum in other countries where we operate  with higher and higher growth rates masking the effects of supply chain disruptions. There are new opportunities cropping up everywhere  driven by unprecedented recovery plans. The Benelux and other countries are now driving the group’s growth  with revenue up 17.7% and 28.7% respectively.ProfitabilityAdjusted EBITDA was €82.4 million at the end of December 2021  down 23% compared to 2020.Operating costs increased by +4.1 percentage points compared to 2020 and represented 81.3% of revenue  compared to 77.2% a year earlier  while the burden of structural costs fell to 9.3% of revenue compared with 9.8% in 2020.The operating margin stood at 9.4% of revenue  compared to 13.0% one year earlier.Besides less absorption of fixed costs due to falling revenue in France and a changing geographic mix to focus on activities that have yet to reach a critical size  this decrease can be explained by:Effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions for €4 millionEvolving business needs and the operational transition needed to adapt and to develop new activities in France for €6.7 millionOngoing and upcoming ramp-up initiatives  especially for new businesses and countries that have not reached their critical size for €9.8 millionRemoving these factors  the EBITDA margin amounts to 11.8%  a decrease of only 120 basis points.The start-up phases of important contracts—which is currently the case in the Benelux and Italy—require the creation of new organizational structures and more robust processes  the adoption of new IT tools  and new trainings for on-site teams. Solutions 30 is making the most of the expertise it has built up in France to shorten this investment phase  although it is an essential step for improving profitability before the industrial phase begins.After accounting for €16.2 million in impairments and operational provisions  and after amortizing the usage rights for leased assets (IFRS 16)  worth €25.3 million  adjusted EBIT stood at €40.8 million  a 32.9% decrease compared to the previous year.2021 saw €13.3 million in non-current operating expenses  including €7.1 million in group spending to combat an aggressive smear campaign. The remaining balance came from restructuring operations to adapt our organizational structure to changes in the market  especially in Germany and France.Customer relationship amortization amounted to €14.7 million in 2021  compared to €13.0 million a year earlier.Financial income rose to €4.2 million in profit  from the (downward) adjustment of contingent consideration (earnout) values for €6.4 million  compared to an expense of €4.1 million in 2020.After including tax income of €5.4 million due to loss carryforwards  compared to an expense of €8.4 million a year earlier  the group share of net income amounted to €21.5 million  compared to €34.5 million in 2020.Financial structureAt December 31  2021  the group had €191.6 million in equity  compared to €170.0 million at December 31  2020. The group had €129.8 million in gross cash  compared to €159.3 million at the end of December 2020. Gross bank debt stood at €77.5 million  compared to €100.0 million on December 31  2020  due to scheduled debt repayments. The group had €52.3 million in cash net of debt at the end of December 2021  compared to €59.2 million at the end of December 2020.Including €66.6 million in leasing liabilities (IFRS 16) and €18.8 million in potential financial debt on future call options and earnouts  the group has a total net debt of €33.1 million  compared to €28.9 a year earlier. The group maintains a solid financial structure  with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 40% and a net debt-to-equity ratio of 17.3%.Outstanding receivables under the group’s non-recourse factoring program amounted to €92.3 million on December 31  2021  compared to €94 million on December 31  2020. This program finances working capital requirements from recurring activities that are fully developed.The use of factoring frees up the cash generated by these receivables to finance the group’s growth strategy  specifically the ramp-up of new contracts  at a cost of less than 1% of the amount of assigned receivables. This program  combined with a solid financial structure  provides Solutions 30 with the resources it needs to finance its ambitious growth strategy.Operating cash flow amounted to €60.8 million  compared to €89.0 million in 2020. The ramp-up of contracts and the return to more normal payment terms than in 2020 resulted in a €13.3 million increase in working capital requirements  which are negative at €25.0 million.Cash flow from business activities stood at €47.5 million in 2021  compared to €136.8 million a year earlier  and net investments reached €15.1 million  or 1.7% of revenue  compared to 1.4% a year earlier. This falls within a normal range  generally considered to be between 1.5% and 4% of revenue  and goes mostly to investing in the group’s IT infrastructure and technical equipment. Overall  this means there was €32.4 million in free cash flow  compared to €124.8 million in 2020.Data by segment2021 2020 Change France Revenue 507.3 522.7 -2.9% EBITDA 66.4 86.6 -23.3% % 13.1% 16.6% Benelux Revenue 160.4 136.3 17.7% EBITDA 22.9 21.4 7.0% % 14.3% 15.7% Other countries Revenue 206.3 160.2 28.8% EBITDA 2.2 7.6 -71.1% % 1.1% 4.8%In France  revenue came to €507.3 million at December 31  2021  compared to €522.7 million a year earlier. After peaking in the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021  the telecom business returned to normal levels in this more mature ultra-fast Internet market. By the end of December 2021  29.7 million locations were eligible for a fiber connection  for a total coverage rate of 70%  and the country already has 14.5 million fiber subscribers  i.e. 48% of eligible households or 34% of all locations. At the same time that the roll-out of smart electricity meters is winding down  the growth of other market segments connected to the energy transition has slowed due to periodic disruptions in the supply chain. A decrease in revenue in the second half of the year ate into profits in France  which will need to adapt to this new context. For these reasons  adjusted EBITDA reached €66.45 million  for a margin of 13.1%  compared to 16.6% a year earlier. Changing activity levels and preparations for launching new businesses reduced EBITDA by €6.7 million  while supply chain delays decreased it by another €1.1 million.In the Benelux  revenue reached €160.4 million  up +17.7% (+14.3% organic growth). The group is entering a high-growth phase in Belgium and the Netherlands  in both its telecoms and energy businesses. The installation of smart meters for the energy company Fluvius began at the start of the year and is continuing at a rapid pace. As for telecoms  previously signed contracts for rolling out ultra-fast Internet are now entering the production phase. As explained above  such ramp-up phases may periodically impact group profitability. Thus  adjusted EBITDA was €22.9 million  for a margin of 14.3%  compared to 15.7% a year earlier.In other countries  Solutions 30’s revenue stood at €206.3 million for 2021  an increase of 28.7% (+15.6% organic growth).In Germany  2021 revenue amounted to €63.3 million compared to €67.2 million the previous year.In Italy  revenue grew by 70% (55% like-for-like) in 2021  reaching €46.8 million  and will continue to be driven by the contract we signed with TIM at the beginning of the year.In Spain  the group generated revenue of €53.1 million  with purely organic growth of 36.0%.In Poland  revenue remained stable  at €24.9 million.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions 30 generated €18.2 million in revenue for 2021.Adjusted EBITDA was €2.2 million  equivalent to 1.1% of revenue  compared with 4.8% a year earlier. This reflects the start-up of a contract signed in Italy  the integration of acquisitions made in the United Kingdom  and the reorganization initiative in Germany to make the most of expected growth in the telecoms sector in the second half of 2022.Q1 2022 revenue:In millions of euros Q1 2022 Q12021 % change Total 222.7 225.2 -1.1% From France 116.7 142.1 -17.9% From Benelux 46.7 37.0 +26.3% From other countries 59.3 46.1 +28.5%Solutions 30’s consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2022 amounted to €222.7 million  down slightly (1.1%) compared to the same period in 2021 (down (3.0%) organically).The first quarter is a continuation of the last quarter 2021 with:On the one hand  activity in France penalized by the triple effect of maturing markets  supply chain difficulties  and the high rate of quarantined technicians  especially at the beginning of the year  due to the pandemic.On the other hand  business is growing strongly in the rest of the countries and this positive trend is masking supply chain disruptions and the impact of the pandemic.In France  revenue for the first quarter of 2022 amounted to €116.7 million compared to €142.1 million a year ago.With €84.5 million in revenue  the telecom business is down by 18% compared to the first quarter of 2021. The market is in the midst of an operational transition as fiber roll-out has peaked and the market for new subscriber connections is under consolidation after being driven by widespread remote working and measures to limit social interactions. These two market conditions are still only partially compensated by maintenance activities.For the energy business  revenue stood at €15.9 million  compared to €23.3 million the previous year  a decrease of 32%. The business has been strongly impacted by the end of smart electricity meter roll-outs in France  revenue from which is down by 60%. Other activities  related to electric mobility and renewable energies  are not yet compensating for this decrease in revenue. They are growing by 8%  but their ramp-up remains delayed by current supply chain problems.The IT business posted revenue of €11.9 million  up 8% for the quarter  while the security and payments business generated €4.4 million in revenue  compared to €4.6 million a year earlier.In the Benelux  revenue in the first quarter of 2022 amounted to €46.7 million compared to €37.0 million a year earlier  up 26.3% (26.6% organic growth).The telecoms business  which grew organically by 14%  generated quarterly revenue of €33.0 million. Sales activity remains strong and the first roll-outs began with the start-up of contracts signed with Fiberklaar and Open Dutch Fiber in the second half of 2021.Revenue for the energy business amounted to €9.6 million  compared with €3.9 million a year earlier  representing purely organic growth of 145%. The deployment of smart meters in Flanders on behalf of Fluvius began during the first quarter of 2021 and is now fully developed.Revenue from the IT business remained stable at €2.3 million  compared with €2.4 million a year earlier. Quarterly revenue from the retail and security businesses was €1.9 million compared to €1.7 million for the first quarter of 2021.In all other countries  the group posted annual revenue of €59.3 million  an increase of 29% (19% organic growth) compared to the same period in 2021.In Germany  revenue amounted to €14.4 million compared to €16.2 million the previous year. The return to growth is expected in the second half of 2022  when the efforts made by the group to adapt its organization should begin to bear fruit.In Italy  revenue grew by 67% in the first quarter of 2022 to €14.6 million  driven by the contract signed at the beginning of the year with TIM to deploy its ultra-fast infrastructure in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley.In Spain  revenue grew organically by 24% to €14.5 million  thanks to strong momentum in the telecoms business (fiber and 5G mobile networks).In Poland  the group confirmed its return to growth and posted revenue of €6.7 million  representing organic growth of 19%.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions 30 posted quarterly revenue of €9.0 million  up 131% (23% organic growth)  thanks to the excellent momentum in the telecoms sector and the start-up of new ultra-fast Internet and 5G deployment programs.OutlookIn 2021  Solutions 30 announced that it would be accelerating the improvement plan it began in 2019  which has already seen concrete progress  including the adoption of IFRS in 2019  the transfer of company shares to a regulated exchange  and enhanced governance. As part of these actions to support its strong growth  Solutions 30 created a transformation plan with the goal of improving and harmonizing governance  risk management  and compliance procedures.This project has led to (i) a review of the existing group policies and procedures  (ii) gap analysis against applicable laws and regulations  (iii) interviews with the management teams of Solutions 30 and its subsidiaries  and (iv) consolidation and analysis of the information gathered in the above-mentioned steps to define areas for improving governance  risk management  and compliance. Six workstreams have been identifiedUniform third parties’ due diligence processes Uniform risk mitigation procedures and enhanced internal control Revised code of conduct Improve whistleblower processes Training Definition of disciplinary actionsNew procedures and policies were defined and harmonized throughout 2021 and the beginning of 2022. They are being implemented gradually over the first half of 2022.Solutions 30 is thus opening a new chapter in its growth in markets that  no matter their maturity  have significant potential for growth and are supported by unprecedented stimulus plans that are channeling public investment into the digital transformation and energy transition.With a solid financial structure and a business model that allows it to self-fund its growth  Solutions 30’s priority this year will be increasing its market share. We are therefore expecting a new period of dynamic growth starting in the second half of the year  while the first half of the year will more closely resemble the second half of 2021. The group should also be able to return to a more active acquisitions policy than over the last two years  helping to drive growth.Audit proceduresConsidering that the previous auditor was unable to express an opinion on Solutions 30’s consolidated financial statements at 12/31/2020  the group’s new auditor  PKF Audit & Conseil  carried out in-depth due diligence on the opening balance sheet at January 1  2021  in accordance with professional standards.This work included:A detailed review and analysis of the findings of independent investigations conducted by Deloitte and Didier Kling Expertises & Conseil in the first half of 2021. A review of the various items in the opening balance sheet and the performance of additional due diligence if deemed necessary. A review of measures Solutions 30 put into place in 2021  especially in terms of risk management and internal control.The analysis of the opening balance sheet did not reveal any anomalies.As the previous auditor was unable to express an opinion on the group’s annual consolidated financial statements at 12/31/2020  PKF’s audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the group for the year ended December 31  2021 includes  in accordance with IAS 710  a technical reservation relating to the comparability of the figures in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income with the corresponding figures of the previous year.Subject to this qualification  upon completion of the audit of the 2021 annual accounts  PKF Audit & Conseil confirms that the consolidated financial statements present fairly  in all material respects  the financial position of the group at December 31  2021  and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.Upcoming eventHY1 2022 revenue July 27  2022About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

Revenue results were well aligned with our objectives. License and other software revenue grew double digits  during the period. At the same time  we delivered strong profitability  demonstrating the strength of our business model and excellent performance by our team. This supports our confidence to raise our 2022 EPS objective to 9-11% year-over-year growth.From a profitability perspective  we outperformed our objectives during the quarter  even as we continued to invest in our business and achieved our hiring objectives. Diluted EPS grew 20% to €0.27. Operating margin increased 117 basis points to 35%. Cash flow from operations was €630 million. We remain well ahead of schedule in achieving our deleveraging objective.”Looking to the second quarter of 2022  we are targeting total revenue growth of 9%-11%  and diluted EPS growth of 11%-16% to €0.24 to €0.25. For fiscal 2022  we are reaffirming our total revenue growth objective of 9%-10%  in constant currencies. At the same time  we are raising our diluted EPS objective to 9%-11% growth to €1.04 to €1.06  offsetting the negative impact of Russia while reflecting currency and operating performance.”Financial Objectives for 2022Dassault Systèmes’ second quarter and full year 2022 financial objectives presented below are given on a non-IFRS basis and reflect the principal 2022 currency exchange rate assumptions for the US dollar and Japanese yen as well as the potential impact from additional non-Euro currencies:Q2 2022 FY 2022 Total Revenue (billion) €1.295 to €1.320 €5.355 to €5.405 Growth 12-14% 10-11% Growth ex FX 9-11% 9-10% Software revenue growth * 9-11% 9-10% Of which licenses and other software revenue growth * 14-19% 10-12% Of which subscription and support revenue growth * 8-9% ~9% Services revenue growth * 9-11% 8-10% Operating Margin 31.7% – 32.4% 33.4% – 33.7% EPS Diluted €0.24 - €0.25 €1.04 - €1.06 Growth 11-16% 9-11% US dollar $1.15 per Euro $1.14 per Euro Japanese yen (before hedging) JPY 130.0 per Euro JPY 130.1 per Euro * Growth in Constant CurrenciesThese objectives are prepared and communicated only on a non-IFRS basis and are subject to the cautionary statement set forth below.The Russian invasion of Ukraine is above all a human tragedy. Dassault Systèmes has implemented all actions to suspend its business operations in Russia  which represent less than 0.5% of non-IFRS revenues in 2021.The 2022 non-IFRS financial objectives set forth above do not take into account the following accounting elements below and are estimated based upon the 2022 principal currency exchange rates above: no significant contract liabilities write-downs; share-based compensation expenses  including related social charges  estimated at approximately €148.7 million (these estimates do not include any new stock option or share grants issued after March 31  2022); amortization of acquired intangibles and of tangibles reevaluation  estimated at approximately €369.4 million  largely impacted by the acquisition of Medidata; and lease incentives of acquired companies at approximately €2.7 million. The above objectives also do not include any impact from other operating income and expenses  net principally comprised of acquisition  integration and restructuring expenses  and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets; from one-time items included in financial revenue; from one-time tax effects; and from the income tax effects of these non-IFRS adjustments. Finally  these estimates do not include any new acquisitions or restructuring completed after March 31  2022.Corporate AnnouncementsToday’s Webcast and Conference Call InformationToday  Thursday  April 27  2022  Dassault Systèmes will host  from London  a webcasted presentation at 9:00 AM London Time/ 10:00 AM Paris time  and will then host a conference call at 9:00 AM New York time / 2:00 PM London time / 3:00 PM Paris time.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2022  available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Economic Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within automotive  aerospace or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Systèmes’ business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;current inflation forecasts  as well as uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of this trend  could adversely affect the financial condition of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and geopolitical crises in particular – could have consequences for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.”In preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.15 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY130.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the second  third and fourth quarters 2022. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.14 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY130.1 to €1.00  before hedging for the full year 2022. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group’s results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations. It is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for IFRS measurements.

We believe it is helpful to evaluate our growth exclusive of currency impacts  particularly to help understand revenue trends in our business. Therefore  we provide percentage increases or decreases in our revenue and expenses (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values  particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen  relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed by us “in constant currencies”  the results of the “prior” period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year  and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.While constant currencies calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure  we do believe these measures are critical to understanding our global revenue results and to compare with many of our competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore  we are including this calculation for comparing IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods as well as for comparing non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All information at constant exchange rates are expressed as a rounded percentage and therefore may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.Information on Growth excluding acquisitions (“organic growth”)In addition to financial indicators on the entire Group’s scope  Dassault Systèmes provides growth excluding acquisitions effect  also named organic growth.The related growth rate was determined by restating the scope of activity as follows:for entities entering the consolidation scope in the current year  subtracting the contribution of the acquisition from the aggregates of the current year;for entities entering the consolidation scope in the previous year  subtracting the contribution of the acquisition from January 1st of the current year  until the last day of the month of the current year when the acquisition was made the previous year.Information on Industrial SectorsDassault Systèmes’ Industries develop Solution Experiences  industry-focused offerings that deliver specific value to companies and users in a particular industry. We serve eleven industries structured into three sectors:Manufacturing industries Sector : Transportation & Mobility; Aerospace & Defense; Marine & Offshore; Industrial Equipment; High-Tech; Home & Lifestyle; Consumer Packaged Goods & Retail;Life Sciences & Healthcare Sector : Life Sciences & Healthcare;Infrastructure & Cities Sector : Infrastructure  Energy & Materials; Architecture  Engineering & Construction; Cities  Public & Business Services.Information on Product LinesOur product lines financial reporting include the following financial information:Industrial Innovation software revenue  which includes our CATIA  ENOVIA  SIMULIA  DELMIA  GEOVIA  NETVIBES  and 3DEXCITE brands;Life Sciences software revenue  which includes our MEDIDATA and BIOVIA brands;Mainstream Innovation software sales for SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises)  which includes our CENTRIC PLM and 3DVIA brands  as well as our 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS family which includes the SOLIDWORKS brand.3DEXPERIENCE Licenses and Software ContributionTo measure the progressive penetration of 3DEXPERIENCE software  we utilize the following ratios:for Licenses revenue  we calculate the percentage contribution by comparing total 3D EXPERIENCE Licenses revenue to Licenses revenue for all product lines except SOLIDWORKS and acquisitions (“related Licenses revenue”);for software revenue  the Group calculates the percentage contribution by comparing total 3DEXPERIENCE software revenue to software revenue for all product lines except SOLIDWORKS and acquisitions (“related software revenue”).Cloud RevenueCloud revenues correspond to revenue generated through a catalog of online services delivered by Dassault Systèmes via a cloud infrastructure hosted by Dassault Systèmes  or by third party providers of cloud computing infrastructure services.

Loss from continuing operations attributable to TechnipFMC was $42.3 million  or $0.09 per diluted share. These results included after-tax charges and credits totaling $29.3 million of expense  or $0.06 per share  which included the following (Exhibit 6):Impairment  restructuring and other charges of $0.8 million; andLoss from equity investment in Technip Energies of $28.5 million.Adjusted loss from continuing operations was $13 million  or $0.03 per diluted share (Exhibit 6).Adjusted EBITDA  which excludes pre-tax charges and credits  was $153.5 million; adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.9 percent (Exhibit 7). Included in adjusted EBITDA was a foreign exchange gain of $28.4 million.Doug Pferdehirt  Chair and CEO of TechnipFMC  stated  “ Looking at the first quarter  total Company revenue was $1.6 billion  with adjusted EBITDA of $154 million. Total Company inbound orders were $2.2 billion  driving sequential growth in backlog. With cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.2 billion and our confidence that we will generate strong free cash flow in the second half of the year  we are taking aggressive steps to further reduce debt in the second quarter. This is another important milestone on our path to shareholder distributions.”Pferdehirt continued  “ In Subsea  inbound orders of $1.9 billion increased more than 80 percent when compared to the fourth quarter  resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5. We announced two awards in the period  including our first iEPCI™ project with Wintershall Dea for the Maria field. The breadth of operators and regional diversification was particularly notable in the quarter  with projects from more than 30 clients across all major offshore basins. We continue to anticipate Subsea order growth of up to 30 percent in 2022  with iEPCI™  direct awards and Subsea services together approaching 75 percent of total inbound.”“ Surface Technologies inbound orders were $291 million  with a book-to-bill above 1.0  driven by strength in the U.S. market. North American sales and profitability grew sequentially  driven by increased drilling and completion activity and an improved pricing environment. Outside of North America  we are investing in new manufacturing capacity in Saudi Arabia to support the strong Middle East outlook. We are now undergoing final production testing and expect final certification of the facility by the end of the second quarter  at which time we anticipate an acceleration of orders in-country. We remain confident in meeting our full-year expectations.”Pferdehirt added  “ First quarter results demonstrated our ability to effectively navigate the ongoing challenges facing the global supply chain. While not immune to the market dislocations  we have taken many strategic actions over the last several years that have mitigated the near-term effects on our Company. Our internal efforts to drive simplification  standardization and industrialization are also transforming our supply chain.”Pferdehirt concluded  “ We are in the midst of a multi-year upcycle for oil and gas investment. Our Subsea Opportunity List highlights this very robust market outlook  representing an opportunity set of larger projects that totals more than $20 billion in potential industry awards over the next 24 months. In the current environment  we are also experiencing improvements in pricing and contractual arrangements that more appropriately balance the terms and conditions needed to support this growth.”Operational and Financial HighlightsSubseaFinancial Highlights Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in financial schedules.

Net income  excluding charges and credits  as well as measures derived from it (including Diluted EPS  excluding charges and credits; Income before net interest expense and taxes  excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted Operating profit""); Depreciation and amortization  excluding charges and credits; Earnings before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted EBITDA""); and net cash) are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges and credits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate TechnipFMC's operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period  and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked or misleading to both investors and management by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management as performance measures in determining certain incentive compensation. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors in addition to  not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of the most comparable financial measures under GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures.

That window can be extended by six months if approved by a shareholder vote.Goldman Sachs is handling a two-day bookbuilding process which will conclude on Wednesday.SPACs are investment vehicles that raise money on stock markets to buy private businesses  providing an easy route for the target to go public without going through the more complex process of a traditional initial public offering (IPO).RA’s listing ranks as the second SPAC deal on Euronext Amsterdam this year after Luxembourg-based GP Bullhound Acquisition I SE went public in February raising 200 million euros from investors.The Euronext Amsterdam stock market is Europe’s biggest SPAC hub  with blank cheque firms including Dutch Star Companies TWO and Odyssey SPAC also recently finalising their deals.Meanwhile London has failed to attract as many SPAC deals in recent years despite adopting new listing rules to step up its SPAC pipeline  with only one listing finalised in November.Along with co-investors  Ripplewood owns 75% of Latvia’s Citadele Bank and is also the second largest shareholder in Egypt-based investment bank EFG Hermes  with an 11.7% stake according to Refinitiv data.In 1999 Ripplewood partnered with U.S private equity firm JC Flowers to acquire the predecessor bank of Shinsei after it went bankrupt in Japan’s late 1990s banking crisis.

The increase was driven primarily by a EUR 8.2 million increase in employee costs  with full-time equivalent (FTE) employees increasing from 55 in 2020 to 76.9 in 2021. EUR 2.4 million of the employee cost increase can be attributed to additional FTEs while EUR 5.8 million can be attributed to share-based payment expense due to accelerated vesting of the Company's Employee Investment Plan on the date of the Company's IPO.Consulting services and other costs associated with research and development of the Company's therapies increased by EUR 0.4 million vs. 2020. Activities to drive enrollment in the Company'sUp-LIFT pivotal trial and other clinical study related costs contributed to an increase of EUR 1.4 million vs. 2020. The Company also incurred an incremental EUR 0.4 million for marketing and market access activities in the US and Europe. The Company's 2021 IPO and the incremental costs of operating as a public company added EUR 2.4 million not incurred in 2020. These costs include uncapitalized consulting and legal expenses relating to the IPO and assuring compliance with financial regulatory requirements.Operating Loss for the PeriodThe Company's Operating Loss for the period increased by EUR 13 million  driven by the increase in Operating Expenses.Net Loss for the PeriodThe Company realized a Net Loss for the period of EUR 34.3 million vs. EUR 20 million in 2020. EUR 13.0 million of this increase can be attributed to the Operating Loss for the period.

The year-end balance was EUR 89.4 million on December 31  2021 vs. EUR 6.4 million on December 31  2020.Net cash used in operating activities was EUR 19.9 million vs. EUR 12.9 million in 2020. The increase was driven by the increase in the Operating Loss for the period.The company invested EUR 2.3 million in assets in 2021  a EUR 2.2 million increase vs. 2020. The increase was driven primarily by IPO-related license fees paid and capitalized as intangible assets.The Company successfully raised EUR 110 million through investing activities in 2021. EUR 80 million was raised via the IPO on Euronext Brussels and Euronext Amsterdam  preceded by a pre-IPO convertible note financing of EUR 30 million. The cash generated was offset by capitalized IPO fees paid in the amount of EUR 4.6 million. Net cash generated from financing activities was EUR 105.3 million in 2021 vs. EUR 4.4 in 2020.Interest Bearing LoansThe decrease in Interest Bearing Loans from EUR 41.8 million in 2020 to EUR 11.5 million in 2021 was mainly attributable to the conversion of the Company's preference A shares into ordinary shares immediately preceding the IPO.EquityThe positive Equity position of the Company as of December 31  2021 was EUR 82.7 million  an increase of EUR 114.8 million vs. December 31  2020.

This strong improvement comes from the contribution of gas sales in Béthune and to the optimization of production volumes (+23%)  in a context of rising gas market prices (€38.7/MWh on average over the first 9 months of 2022  compared to €13.9/MWh over the first 9 months of 2021).Revenues from electricity generation amounted to €8.0 million at the end of March 2022 (+70%). This increase reflects the contribution of the two cogeneration units in Béthune and the commissioning in January 2022 of three additional cogeneration units (4.5 MW) in Anderlues.The activity was also supported by improving electricity market prices in Belgium  which rose significantly to €156/MWh (vs. €41/MWh in 2021). FDE took advantage of those favorable market conditions to set over €200/MWh the price of its electricity volumes to be sold in Belgium over the next 6 months.Revenue generated from the heat sales  related to the Béthune project and also the largest solar thermal power plant connected to a heating network in Creutzwald  amounted to €272 000  up by 100% year-on-year.FDE revenues growth confirmed for 2022In the coming months  the Group will continue its strong organic growth and strengthen its unique positioning through the deployment of new local low-carbon energy solutions: cogenerations in Hauts-de-France and the initial 15 MW trench of his first photovoltaic plant in the Grand Est region. In the current energy markets  FDE is in discussions with leading energy players to optimize the revenues associated with these future producing assets.In addition  on April 19th 2022  FDE announced the acquisition of 94% of the capital of Cryo Pur  a company specializing in the treatment of biogas and its liquefaction into Liquefied BioGas (LBG) and Bio-CO2. This acquisition allows the group to integrate the purification and liquefaction of all types of gas (biogas  mine gas  landfill gas  flare gas  rare gas  etc.) in its portfolio and strengthen its position on the strategic green gas and CO2 markets. Revenues derived from new contracts under discussion for this activity will drive additional growth for the Group from 2023 onwards.FDE will communicate its new growth prospects for 2026 during the publication of its FY 2022 annual sales.Next announcements:Investors Day – April 27th 2022FY 2022 annual sales – July 21st 2022Reuters code: FDEL.PA | Bloomberg code : FDE.FPAbout La Française de l’Énergie (« FDE »)FDE is a negative carbon footprint energy Group  specialized in the implementation via short circuits  of energy recovery and production sites  allowing the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.

3765,EuroNext,Google API,https://tech.eu/2022/04/27/the-belgian-tech-scene-report/,Bytes and Beers: Belgium's burgeoning tech scene,13 hours ago,Since our first Tech.eu Summit in Brussels is happening on 17 May  we charted the Belgian tech scene from 2018 until today  together with our partner BeTech  the Belgian Tech initiative.Overall  Belgium has a small but dynamic tech scene  and the past four years have seen rapid growth across the board  with 200-plus Belgian startups and scale-ups netting over €2.7 billion in investment between 2018 and the end of 2021. Four of those tech companies raised more than €100 million each  and 280 investors got involved in deals.A country of only 11.5 million inhabitants  Belgium is diverse in terms of culture and languages  and its tech ecosystem is not just concentrated in the capital  but spread out across different cities and towns. In terms of verticals  Belgium excels in bio tech and health tech  followed by analytics  software  and fintech  with a focus on B2B.Without further ado  let's jump into the charts to see what the Tech.eu database revealed about Belgium’s top companies and investors  and how the scene is faring in the first quarter of 2022.Exits and M&A activityBelgian's brightest and best startups have been busy in the past four years  with a total of 76 exits. While the majority of the deals (64 to be precise) were undisclosed  the 12 that were disclosed hit a combined value of just over €2.1 billion. The biggest deal was Orange Belgium's $1.5 billion 75 percent stake in telco VOO in December last year.In June 2019  Belgium's Combell merged with TransIP Group from The Netherlands  creating a new holding called team.blue  which  the two companies said  valued it at over $1 billion. Ali Niknam  who founded TransIP in his early twenties  and went on to found bunq  is one of our speakers at the Tech.eu Summit on 17 May.Seventy-two companies participated in Belgian exits over the past four years  while 49 Belgian companies were involved with exit deals at home and abroad.The highest-valued exit where a Belgium company was involved was the €4.4 billion takeover of Borsa Italiana by the pan-European Euronext stock exchange in 2020.2022 off to a robust startIn the first three month of this year  33 companies received funding to the tune of €440 million in total. Deliverect  the Ghent-based software maker that integrates online orders from food delivery channels into restaurants’ POS raised the Q1 total for all when it got a whopping €133 million in Series D funding in January. Deliverect chief executive Zhong Xu will be on stage at the first Tech.eu Summit on 17 May (tickets here!).How is Belgium faring in terms of its share of the total European investment pie? Well  it's not in the top 10  which is dominated by heavyweights like the UK  Germany and France  but comes in at 11th place in terms of total amounts raised by each country's tech industry in the past four years.To find out more about the European tech scene  and hear from an awesome line up of investors  founders  and thought-leaders  come along to the Tech.eu Summit on May 17 in Brussels.
