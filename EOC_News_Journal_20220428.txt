3671,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/euroclear-delivers-strong-q1-performance-080000090.html,Euroclear delivers a strong Q1 performance,Euroclear today provides an update on its financial and operational performance in the first quarter of 2022.,"BRUSSELS  April 27  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Euroclear today provides an update on its financial and operational performance in the first quarter of 2022.Financial SummaryEuroclear delivered a strong financial and operational performance in Q1 2022. Net profit increased +11% to EUR 134 million.Operating income was up +10% year-on-year to EUR 438 million driven by strong business income growth  up +9% to EUR 405 million and Interest  Banking and Other income up 39% to EUR 32 million.We increased our investments in technology in line with our strategy. Operating expenses increased to EUR 260 million  up 11% compared to Q1 2021.Sanctions related to the invasion of Ukraine have led to increased cash held on our balance sheet  which are explained further below.Chart 1Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1805340/Euroclear_1.jpgNote: 2021 figures have been restated to include MFEX pro forma  in order to allow for like-for-like comparison.Operational highlightsThroughout the first quarter  Euroclear continued to make strategic progress  while remaining focused on our responsibilities as a critical financial market infrastructure. This is reflected in the key operating metrics shown below:Q1 total % change vs Q1 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 37 trillion +8% Number of Transactions 80 million +5% Turnover EUR 270 trillion +13% Fund assets under custody EUR 3 trillion +12% Collateral Highway EUR 2 trillion +18%The integration of MFEX is progressing to plan as we combine MFEX's established fund distribution platforms with Euroclear's post-trade expertise to create a new end-to-end funds offering.We have also made two strategic investments during the first quarter.Firstly  we have further advanced Euroclear's digital strategy through our investment in Fnality  an international consortium of global banks and financial market infrastructures focused on building regulated payment systems to support the adoption of tokenised assets and marketplaces.Story continuesSecondly  we have progressed our sustainable finance and ESG strategy through an investment in Greenomy  a Belgium based sustainable finance technology platform. Greenomy helps corporates  credit institutions and asset managers comply with new European Union sustainable finance legislation by digitalising the data capturing and reporting processes.As part of our commitment to ESG  we are pleased to announce that Euroclear has taken the important step to reduce its global carbon footprint by committing to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We will now set CO2 reduction actions with the commitment to achieve net-zero value chain Green House Gas (GHG) emissions by no later than 2050.Implications from the invasion of Ukraine and SanctionsOur thoughts are with those affected by the humanitarian crisis resulting from the invasion of Ukraine. We have focused on supporting our staff  especially those of Ukrainian and Russian origin  as well as those in bordering countries.Euroclear is complying with the international sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine and has suspended all transactions with sanctioned entities since 28 February. In addition to ensuring all the sanctions are applied immediately and completely  our teams are supporting clients diligently in managing the exceptional situation. We are working closely with clients to apply all new rules fully and according to the spirit of the sanctions.A consequence of the sanctions is that assets owned by sanctioned parties are blocked in the respective financial market infrastructures  including Euroclear. As the assets mature through their lifecycle  cashflows (e.g. coupons and redemptions) that are normally transferred to the underlying parties accumulate on our balance sheet for as long as the sanctions remain in place. We do not expect these sanctions to affect our financial performance. During the first quarter  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by €23 billion year-on-year  for which the company is working on the mitigation of potential regulatory capital requirements.In light of these circumstances  the Board of Euroclear considers it to be prudent to wait until the second half of 2022 to formally decide on the dividend payment of EUR 88.5 per share (equating to a total of EUR 279 million) as announced in its full year results.Commenting on the results  Lieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer  said:""The invasion of Ukraine is deeply troubling and our thoughts are with all who are impacted. As a financial market infrastructure  we have an important role to play in a turbulent world. I am proud of the staff response as our people mobilised swiftly to apply the sanctions; to support clients during the exceptional circumstances; and to contribute to relief efforts for those affected. From a financial and operational perspective  Euroclear continues to perform very well  achieving another strong quarter as we continue to deliver on our strategy.""Appendix: Financial Statements for Euroclear Bank and Euroclear InvestmentsChart 2Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1805341/Euroclear_2.jpgAbout EuroclearEuroclear Group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

Loss from continuing operations attributable to TechnipFMC was $42.3 million  or $0.09 per diluted share. These results included after-tax charges and credits totaling $29.3 million of expense  or $0.06 per share  which included the following (Exhibit 6):Impairment  restructuring and other charges of $0.8 million; andLoss from equity investment in Technip Energies of $28.5 million.Adjusted loss from continuing operations was $13 million  or $0.03 per diluted share (Exhibit 6).Adjusted EBITDA  which excludes pre-tax charges and credits  was $153.5 million; adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.9 percent (Exhibit 7). Included in adjusted EBITDA was a foreign exchange gain of $28.4 million.Doug Pferdehirt  Chair and CEO of TechnipFMC  stated  “ Looking at the first quarter  total Company revenue was $1.6 billion  with adjusted EBITDA of $154 million. Total Company inbound orders were $2.2 billion  driving sequential growth in backlog. With cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.2 billion and our confidence that we will generate strong free cash flow in the second half of the year  we are taking aggressive steps to further reduce debt in the second quarter. This is another important milestone on our path to shareholder distributions.”Pferdehirt continued  “ In Subsea  inbound orders of $1.9 billion increased more than 80 percent when compared to the fourth quarter  resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5. We announced two awards in the period  including our first iEPCI™ project with Wintershall Dea for the Maria field. The breadth of operators and regional diversification was particularly notable in the quarter  with projects from more than 30 clients across all major offshore basins. We continue to anticipate Subsea order growth of up to 30 percent in 2022  with iEPCI™  direct awards and Subsea services together approaching 75 percent of total inbound.”“ Surface Technologies inbound orders were $291 million  with a book-to-bill above 1.0  driven by strength in the U.S. market. North American sales and profitability grew sequentially  driven by increased drilling and completion activity and an improved pricing environment. Outside of North America  we are investing in new manufacturing capacity in Saudi Arabia to support the strong Middle East outlook. We are now undergoing final production testing and expect final certification of the facility by the end of the second quarter  at which time we anticipate an acceleration of orders in-country. We remain confident in meeting our full-year expectations.”Pferdehirt added  “ First quarter results demonstrated our ability to effectively navigate the ongoing challenges facing the global supply chain. While not immune to the market dislocations  we have taken many strategic actions over the last several years that have mitigated the near-term effects on our Company. Our internal efforts to drive simplification  standardization and industrialization are also transforming our supply chain.”Pferdehirt concluded  “ We are in the midst of a multi-year upcycle for oil and gas investment. Our Subsea Opportunity List highlights this very robust market outlook  representing an opportunity set of larger projects that totals more than $20 billion in potential industry awards over the next 24 months. In the current environment  we are also experiencing improvements in pricing and contractual arrangements that more appropriately balance the terms and conditions needed to support this growth.”Operational and Financial HighlightsSubseaFinancial Highlights Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in financial schedules.

Net income  excluding charges and credits  as well as measures derived from it (including Diluted EPS  excluding charges and credits; Income before net interest expense and taxes  excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted Operating profit""); Depreciation and amortization  excluding charges and credits; Earnings before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted EBITDA""); and net cash) are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges and credits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate TechnipFMC's operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period  and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked or misleading to both investors and management by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management as performance measures in determining certain incentive compensation. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors in addition to  not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of the most comparable financial measures under GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement.And with that  I’ll turn the call over to Satya.Satya NadellaThank you  Brett. It was a record third quarter  driven by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud  which surpassed $23 billion in revenue  up 32% year-over-year. Going forward  digital technology will be the key input that powers the world’s economic output. Across the tech stack  we are expanding our opportunity and taking share as we help customers differentiate  build resilience  and do more with less.Now I’ll highlight examples  starting with Azure. We are building a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to help every organization build  run  and manage mission-critical workloads anywhere. This quarter  we helped more customers than ever simplifying and accelerating their cloud migrations.And it’s still early days. We are winning Tier 1 infrastructure workloads. Leaders in every industry  from Blackrock  to Bridgestone  to Lufthansa  are all moving mission-critical workloads to Azure. And we are the market leader for customers’ SAP workloads in the cloud. Atos  Chevron  Fujitsu  and Woolworths all migrated their SAP applications to Azure in recent months.Overall  we are seeing larger  more strategic Azure commitments  from industry leaders  including Boeing  Kraft Heinz  US Bank  and Westpac  who all chose our cloud to accelerate their digital transformations. The number of $100 million-plus Azure deals more than doubled year-over-year. And we’re seeing consumption growth across every industry  customer segment  and geography.Now  to data and AI. Our data stack is unique in bringing best-in-class operational databases  analytics  and governance into one integrated data fabric. Cosmos DB transactions and data volume increased over 100% year-over-year for the third quarter in a row. Synapse data volume more than doubled year-over-year. And we’re seeing strong adoption of Purview  as we help organizations govern  protect  and manage their data estate across platforms and clouds. From Deutsche Boerse to EY  customers in every industry are using our end-to-end data platform. In AI  we continue to see strong usage of Azure Machine Learning. The number of monthly inference requests increased 86% year-over-year  with companies like PepsiCo using the service to predict which products are most likely to sell.And our Azure Open AI Service brings together advanced language models with the enterprise capabilities of Azure  helping companies like CarMax turn customer reviews into customized content for shoppers.Now  to developer tools. From Azure DevOps and GitHub to Visual Studio  we have the most comprehensive and loved developer SaaS service. Increasingly  every new developer project starts with our tools. Visual Studio has more than 31 million monthly active users  including most of the Fortune 500. And GitHub usage is increasing among both independent developers and startups  as well as the world’s most established enterprises. 90% of the Fortune 100 use GitHub. In fact  Mercedes Benz  for example  is using GitHub Enterprise to provide a unified development platform for more than 20 000 employees to build  ship  and maintain software.Now  on to Power Platform. Power Platform has become the leading business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts in every industry. Power Platform surpassed $2 billion in revenue over the past twelve months  up 72% year-over-year  making it one of the fastest growing businesses  at scale. Power Apps is the market leader in low code/no code app development  and Power BI has more than 200 000 customers. And our acquisition of MINE-it adds new process mining capabilities  helping organizations identify bottlenecks and opportunities for operational efficiency.Now  to Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is growing faster than the business applications market overall. For example  in a world of supply chain constraints we are helping companies like Cracker Barrel and Unilever predict disruptions before they happen. Businesses like Heineken and Siemens are turning to Dynamics 365 to drive and deliver more consistent and personalized customer engagement and service. We are leading innovation in the new industrial metaverse to help companies optimize their operations using technologies such as IOT  Digital Twins  Connected Spaces  and Mixed Reality applications. And we’re further differentiating the Microsoft Cloud by bringing together Dynamics 365  Teams  and Synapse to usher in a new era of collaborative applications that transform every business function and process.When it comes to industry  our six industry clouds  are helping customers speed time to value. Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last month  where we introduced Azure Health Data Services to unify disparate clinical  imaging  and medtech data. Cleveland Clinic will use the solution to normalize data from different systems and integrate insights into the clinician workflow.And with our acquisition of Nuance  I’m excited about our opportunity to apply the company’s deep enterprise AI expertise to accelerate the growth of both Nuance’s business  and our industry clouds.Now  on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement  as more than 830 million professionals used the platform to connect  learn  grow  and get hired. Amid the Great Reshuffle  we’re seeing a skills-first labor market emerge. The number of companies using skills filters on LinkedIn to fill open roles has doubled year-over-year. In this dynamic labor market  hires on LinkedIn has increased 88%.Talent Solutions revenue was up 43%  marking the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. Our Marketing Solutions business continues to thrive as we offer advertisers high reach and ROI. And creators are increasingly turning to the platform to establish their voices and grow their communities  using tools like Newsletters to share content they are passionate about. 28 million members now subscribe to at least one newsletter on LinkedIn  up 51% over the past quarter alone.Now  on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. The last two years have proven that every organization needs a digital fabric that connects the entire organization  from the boardroom to the frontline  to customers and partners. No company is better positioned to meet this need than Microsoft  with Microsoft 365 and Teams. Teams is the most used and most advanced platform for work  and the only solution with meetings  calls  chat  collaboration  and business process automation. And organizations from enterprises to SMBs are relying on Teams to run their business.Our comprehensive approach reduces complexity and costs. Microsoft 365 customers can save as much as 60%  compared to a patchwork of single point identity  productivity  collaboration  and meetings solutions. Teams usage has never been higher. We’re seeing growth in every segment  including very small businesses with Teams Essentials.Teams is the leading platform for collaborative apps. From Asana to Zendesk  there are over 1 000 third-party apps available the Teams app store. And companies in every industry  including CBRE  CVS Health  and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom  have built custom line of business apps within Teams  bringing business process directly into the flow of work. And we’re adding new growth engines to meet the demands of hybrid work with Teams Rooms  Teams Phone  and Microsoft Viva.Teams Rooms is bridging the gap between people working remotely and those in the office  with innovations like Front Row. Teams Phone with Operator Connect enables organizations to easily bring their existing calling service to Teams. Total Operator Connect minutes increased 8x quarter-over-quarter. And Viva has more than 10 million monthly active users at companies like Blum  Cerner  and Marks & Spencer. This quarter  we added LinkedIn’s Glint employee engagement tool to Viva  ensuring leaders can more easily solicit employee feedback and receive actionable insights.All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Organizations across the private and public sector  including American Family Insurance  the Queensland Government  and Telefonica are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security  compliance  voice  and analytics.Now  on to Windows. The PC has never been more relevant to work  life  and play. The number of use cases is increasing as is the amount of time spent on PCs. More than 100 million PCs have shipped in each of the last eight quarters  and Windows continues to take share. With Windows 11  we continue to see the highest quality scores of any version of the operating system. The enterprises are adopting Windows 11 at a faster pace than any previous release.With Windows 365  we’re bringing the power of Azure computing to Windows computers  enabling businesses like Lands’ End  SES  and Xerox to stream the full Windows experience to any employee device. New integrations between Windows 11 and Windows 365 will make it possible to switch between Cloud PC and the local PC with a single click. And we continue to help organizations like AIG  Grant Thornton  and Sage shift their on-premise virtualization services to the cloud with Azure Virtual Desktop.In consumer  Windows is key to curating our content and services to help every person with their everyday tasks  from browsing and searching  to learning  and gaming  and shopping  all with security and privacy built-in. We are seeing strong engagement  with nearly 500 million monthly active users of our personalized content feed  Microsoft Start. As usage continues to grow  we are seeing a flywheel emerge between content  consumption  and commerce  as we generate new opportunities for content creators  as well as advertisers. And our browser  Microsoft Edge  continues to gain share as we help people save money and shop securely.Now  to security. Security is a top priority for every organization undergoing a digital transformation. To keep our customers secure  we build security by design into every product we sell. And we deliver end-to-end solutions spanning security  compliance  identity  device management  and privacy  across clouds and platforms  informed by 24 trillion threat signals each day.This comprehensive capability has been critical during the recent world events  and we continue to disrupt cyber attacks and share threat intelligence with the Ukrainian government  as well as other public sector agencies. Multi-cloud  multi-platform support is central to our approach. In security  we are the only cloud provider with native multi-cloud protection for the industry’s top three cloud platforms.In identity  we now provide permissions management across all clouds. Azure Active Directory is the undisputed market leader with more than 550 million monthly active users. In management  the number of Windows  Android  and iOS devices protected by Intune grew over 60% year-over-year. And we’re expanding to new market segments with Microsoft Defender for Business  which helps keep small businesses secure.This innovation and differentiation is driving our overall growth. All up  the number of customers who trust our security solutions grew nearly 50% year-over-year to 785 000  including Citrix  Domino’s Pizza  Fujitsu  Heineken  Petronas  who rely on us to protect their multi-cloud infrastructure. And we have over 15 000 partners in our security ecosystem  more than anyone else in the industry.Now  on to gaming. Our ambition is to power gamers to play when  and how  and where they want. With our Xbox Series S and X consoles  we have taken share globally for two quarters in a row and we are the market leader this quarter among the next gen consoles in the United States  Canada  UK  and Western Europe. And with Xbox Cloud Gaming  we are redefining how games are distributed  played  and viewed. To date  more than 10 million people have streamed games. Many of our most popular titles  including Flight Simulator are now accessible on phones  tablets  low-spec PCs for the first time.Our Game Pass library now includes hundreds of titles across PC and console  including more games from third-party publishers than ever before. Billions of hours have been played by subscribers over the past 12 months  up 45%. And with Azure  we are building the best cloud for game studios of all sizes to build  host  and grow their games. New capabilities speed time to development and to help connect players across platforms. Azure gaming revenue fiscal year to date increased 66%.In closing  we are entering a new era where every company will become a digital company. Our portfolio of durable digital businesses and diverse business models  built on a common tech stack  position us well to capture the massive opportunities ahead.With that  I’ll hand it over to Amy.Amy HoodThank you  Satya  and good afternoon  everyone. This quarter  revenue was $49.4 billion  up 18% and 21% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.22 and increased 14% and 18% in constant currency when adjusted for the tax benefit from the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. Several items impacted our financial performance that were not included in the guidance provided on our January earnings call.First  Nuance. My comments today across Q3 results and Q4 outlook include the impact from the Nuance acquisition which closed on March 4. Our results include $111 million in revenue and a negative $0.01 impact to earnings per share  including purchase accounting  integration  and transaction related expenses. Within our results  unless specifically noted otherwise  Nuance was not a material driver of growth rates. We continue to expect the Nuance acquisition will be minimally dilutive in FY2022 and accretive in FY2023 to non-GAAP EPS.Second  FX. The U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter and created an incremental 1 point FX headwind to total company revenue compared to expectations. As a result  revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $302 million and $0.03 per share  respectively. Finally  the war in Ukraine. We suspended all new sales of our products and services in Russia. Revenue generated in Russia represents less than 1% of total company revenue and we expect that it will decline significantly.The impact to operating income this quarter was roughly $130 million split evenly between lower revenue and higher bad debt expense  resulting in a negative $0.01 impact to EPS. Our results for the quarter are better than we expected across revenue  operating income  and EPS as we again delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom line growth.In our commercial business  healthy demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings together with excellent execution by our sales teams and partners drove increased commitment to our platform as well as higher usage of our services that Satya mentioned earlier.Commercial bookings increased 28% and 35% in constant currency  significantly ahead of expectations driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. We also saw better than expected growth in large  long-term Azure contracts against a very strong prior year comparable. Nuance benefited bookings by roughly 5 points.Our on-premises transactional licensing revenue  across both the Office and Server businesses  was more negatively impacted than expected due to the transition from our Open Licensing program to our Cloud Solution Provider program.Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 32% and 34% in constant currency to $155 billion with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond  the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96%. Commercial Cloud revenue was $23.4 billion and grew 32% and 35% in constant currency  again ahead of expectations.Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for useful lives  the Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points driven by improvement across the cloud services  partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. In our consumer business  as you heard from Satya  we saw market share gains across PCs  gaming consoles  and our Edge browser.Now back to the company level. As noted earlier  the U.S. dollar strengthened throughout the quarter. FX decreased total company revenue by 3 points  1 point unfavorable to expectations  decreased COGS by 1 point  in line with expectations  and decreased operating expense growth by 2 points  1 point favorable to expectations.Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 21% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate  gross margin percentage increased approximately 1 point driven primarily by improvement in our cloud services noted earlier.Operating expense increased 15% and 17% in constant currency  slightly lower than expected as investments that shifted to future quarters were partially offset by the inclusion of Nuance. At a total company level  headcount grew 20% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering  customer deployment  LinkedIn  and sales  and included approximately 4 points of growth from the addition of Nuance.Operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency and operating margins increased slightly year-over-year to 41%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate  operating margins expanded roughly 2 points year-over-year.Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15.8 billion and grew 17% and 19% in constant currency in line with expectations. Better than expected results across Office 365  LinkedIn  and Office consumer were offset by impacts from incremental FX  the Open Licensing transition  Russia  as well as lower than expected results in Dynamics.Office commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 20% in constant currency  driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments  as well as higher ARPU from continued momentum in E5 revenue.Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 16% year-over-year to nearly 345 million  with continued growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. And nearly 45% of our Office 365 commercial seats were purchased through Microsoft 365.Office commercial licensing was lower than expected  down 28% and 25% in constant currency  driven by the factors discussed earlier and a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.Office consumer revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency  ahead of expectations  driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions  which grew 16% to 58.4 million.Dynamics revenue grew 22% and 25% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365  which grew 35% and 38% in constant currency  substantially faster than the market although a bit lower than expected as we focus on stronger execution on our recent investments.LinkedIn revenue increased 34% and 35% in constant currency  with better than expected performance in Talent Solutions as well as continued strength in Marketing Solutions and record levels of engagement on the platform.Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 19% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate  gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13% and 14% in constant currency  and operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency.Next  the Intelligent Cloud segment  which includes approximately four weeks of results from Nuance. Revenue was $19.1 billion  increasing 26% and 29% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of Nuance and the approximately $150 million greater FX than expected  revenue results were ahead of expectations.Overall  server products and cloud services revenue increased 29% and 32% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services grew 46% and 49% in constant currency  ahead of expectations  driven by continued strength in our consumption-based services. The inclusion of Nuance cloud services did not change the Azure constant currency growth rate.In our per-user business  the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 25% to over 218 million seats. In our on-premises server business  revenue increased 5% and 7% in constant currency  ahead of expectations driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings partially offset by the Open Licensing transition mentioned earlier. The inclusion of Nuance on premises offerings did not change the server constant currency growth rate.Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 6% in constant currency  driven by growth in Enterprise Support Services. The inclusion of Nuance professional services impacted the constant currency growth rate by 1 point.Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 27% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate  gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point with improvements in Azure partially offset by the sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 17% and 19% in constant currency and operating income grew 29% and 33% in constant currency.Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.5 billion  increasing 11% and 13% in constant currency  above expectations driven by better than expected performance in search and Windows offset by Surface. FX decreased segment revenue approximately $100 million greater than expected. Windows OEM revenue increased 11%  with continued strength in the commercial PC market  which has higher revenue per license.Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 14% and 19% in constant currency  ahead of expectations  driven by demand for Microsoft 365 with some benefit from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition.Surface revenue grew 13% and 18% in constant currency  lower than expected  driven by consumer channel  partially offset by strength in commercial. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 23% and 25% in constant currency  better than expected  benefiting from an increase in search volumes even as we saw headwinds during March from the impact of the war in Ukraine.And in Gaming  on a high prior year comparable  revenue increased 6% and 8% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue was better than expected as increased supply of consoles in quarter drove growth of 14% and 16% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue grew 4% and 6% in constant currency  below expectations  driven by lower engagement across the platform  even as it remains above pre-pandemic levels.Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Operating expenses increased 17% and 18% in constant currency and operating income grew 7% and 10% in constant currency.Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6.3 billion  in line with expectations. Cash paid for PP&E was $5.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $25.4 billion  increasing 14% as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds as we manage continued uncertainty in the supply chain. Free cash flow was $20.0 billion  up 17%. This quarter  other income and expense was negative $174 million  lower than anticipated driven by net losses on investments  including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio  and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year  a negative 2-point impact on year-over-year EPS growth. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%.And finally  we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now  before we turn to our outlook  a few reminders. First  FX; with the stronger U.S. dollar and based on current rates  we now expect FX to decrease total company revenue growth by approximately 2 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments  we anticipate roughly 3 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and 2 points in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing.Second  my remarks for the next quarter include a full quarter of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Third  we anticipate the war in Ukraine to continue to impact our business in Q4 with a roughly $110 million impact on revenue and minimal impact on operating expenses. Next  we have taken into account the current impact of shutdowns in China in our outlook. However  extended production shutdowns that reach into May would further negatively impact our outlook across Windows OEM  Surface  and Xbox hardware. Finally  the outlook we give  unless specifically noted otherwise  is on a USD basis.With that context in place  let’s turn to our Q4 outlook. In our largest quarter of the year we expect our differentiated market position  customer demand across the solution portfolio  and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth. In commercial bookings  a growing Q4 expiry base  strong execution across our core annuity sales motions  and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth against a strong prior year comparable. As a reminder  the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts  which are more unpredictable in their timing  always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate.Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be down roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate  Q4 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 1 point driven by continued improvement across our cloud services partially offset by a revenue mix shift to Azure. Capital expenditures  we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services.Next to segment guidance; in Productivity and Business Processes  we expect revenue between $16.65 billion and $16.9 billion. In Office Commercial  revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by a point or two on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business  we expect revenue to decline similar to last quarter.In Office consumer  we expect revenue to grow in the high single digits  driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn  we expect revenue growth in the high-20s driven by the strong job market and healthy engagement on the platform. And in Dynamics  we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue between $21.1 billion and $21.35 billion.Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which as a reminder can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 2 points on a constant currency basis with a bit more FX impact on U.S. dollar growth than at the segment level. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in our consumption business. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum  though we expect moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base.In our on-premises server business  we expect revenue to decline in the low-to-mid single digits as demand for our hybrid offerings will be more than offset by the strong prior year comparable  which included 4 points of benefit from contracts with higher in period revenue recognition  as well as continued transactional weakness from the licensing program transition noted earlier. And in Enterprise Services  we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits.In more Personal Computing  we expect revenue between $14.65 billion and $14.95 billion. As mentioned earlier  our guidance reflects the current constraints from the shutdowns in China  which have negatively impacted Q4 supply for OEM  Surface and Xbox consoles. In Windows OEM we expect revenue growth in the low-to-mid-single digits driven by the continued shift to a commercial-led PC market where revenue per license is higher.In Windows commercial products and cloud services  customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low-double digits. In Surface  revenue should grow in low-double digits. In Search and news advertising ex-TAC  we expect revenue growth of approximately 20%.And in Gaming  we expect revenue to decline in the mid-to-high single digits driven by lower engagement hour’s year-over-year as well as constrained console supply. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline mid-single digits though engagement hours are expected to remain higher than pre-pandemic levels.Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $16.6 billion to $16.8 billion and operating expense of $14.8 billion to $14.9 billion resulting in another quarter of operating margin expansion excluding the change in useful life. We expect other income and expense to be negative $50 million reflecting FX remeasurement impact based on market conditions in April. Similar to the rest of our guidance  further equity and FX movements through Q4 are not reflected in this number. As a reminder  we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio  which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%.We expect to close FY22  even in a more complex macro environment  with the same consistency we have delivered throughout the year. With strong revenue growth  share gains  and improved operating margins as we invest in the areas that are key to sustaining that growth. As we look toward FY23  our track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets gives us confidence that we will drive continued healthy double-digit revenue and operating income growth.Now  Brett lets go to Q&A.Brett IversenThanks Amy. We will now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call we request the partisans please only ask one question.Jesse  can you please repeat your instructions.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorAbsolutely. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.Keith WeissExcellent. Thank you guys so much for taking the question  and really impressive results. And what we see is a pretty difficult climate out there. Definitely from the stock market perspective  but if we think about interest rates  we think about inflation  there’s a  a conflict going on in Europe right now. It does seem to be a tough backdrop. You guys are operating super well. I mean  the acceleration in Azure at that scale is truly awesome. And so if I’m not mistaken Office 365 commercial accelerated as well in the quarter  so really impressive results.But I think the question that most investors are going to have is where do you garner the confidence and the durability of this growth given how volatile this macro backdrop is? Is it conversations you are having with customers? Is it what you see in the backlog? Maybe if you could give us some kind of insight into what gives you guys the confidence to put out that guide  to put out those healthy comments for FY23  what are you seeing that could maybe help us give us and give investors a little bit more confidence in the durability of this growth in this environment?Satya NadellaYes  maybe I’ll start. Maybe at three levels Keith  one is just the competitiveness of our tech stack all up sort of from infrastructure all the way to the SaaS applications when it comes to the commercial cloud and as well as how we are able to monetize for example  the install base of our consumer franchises as well. So both of these places we feel we are competitive and increasingly so coming out of the pandemic to gain share. I’d also say that in many of these places  we have price leadership. I mean  take the one point I made which is  if there is any macro-headwind where you have more value for less price means you win. And in our case  when it comes to our commercial cloud offerings we have significant advantages on that across the stack.The second thing is in the conversations we are having with our customers. The interesting thing I find from perhaps even past challenges whether macro or micro is no  I don’t hear of businesses looking to their IT budgets or digital transformation projects is the place for cuts  if anything  some of these projects are the way they’re going to accelerate their transformation or for that matter automation for example. I have not seen this level of demand for automation technology to improve productivity because in an inflationary environment  the only deflationary force is software. So that’s the second micro thing the tone thing that’s different.At the end of the day though  I mean  none of us here are trying to forecast macro. So all we think of is the TAMs that we are competing in a large  as a percentage of GDP tech spend is on a secular basis by the end of the decade going to double. We just want to keep driving usage  driving share and be competitive  so that’s kind of how we view what we are doing. And that’s where our confidence comes from in terms of our outlays  whether it’s OpEx or CapEx.So I don’t know if Amy  if you want to add to that.Amy HoodI think the only thing Satya  I might add is  I think we’ve always and I think we’ve used this language quite frequently focused on the long–term opportunity. You talked about it as the TAM that we’re focused on. I would say also  there’s still a lot of that TAM left to go – left to go after and it is quite early  still. And the transitions you’re talking about from a digital transformation perspective  from an automation perspective  from a type of value and real productivity enhancements that can be made. And so I think the continuity of the execution has certainly been very good from the sales and partner side. But I would also say to your point  we’re investing for a long-term opportunity and our confidence that that long-term outcome is right is where the – is I think the basis for where you and I are talking  giving this answer from.Keith WeissOutstanding. Great quarter.Brett IversenThanks  Keith  Jesse  next question please.OperatorAbsolutely. Our next question is coming from Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your questions.Brent ThillThanks. Amy on your guidance  are you changing any of your close rate considerations or adding more supply chain constraints into that or is this the same guidance methodology that you you’ve been giving us in the past?Amy HoodI assume we’re specifically talking about most of the guidance in the more personal computing segment where the supply chain constraints  which are specifically related to the production shutdowns in China. I generally follow the same principle I try to follow  which is I give you my best knowledge as of today. I did note and tried to do that with a lot of clarity that were the production shutdowns to extend into May  there would be further negative impact on those from a supply constraint position.As you know  on the OEM business  that revenue is recognized at the point of production and then for Xbox consoles as well as Surface it’s a sell-in. So production delays even earlier in May can obviously have big impact on the quarter. So we’re watching it and I’ve tried to make that transparent in the guidance  outside of that my guidance is reasonably consistent with how I – with how I like to do it.Brent ThillGreat. Thanks.Brett IversenThanks  Brent. Jesse  next question please.OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your questions.Mark MoerdlerThank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter and on the strong guidance  I think it’s going to not just help the stock  but hopefully help a little bit more across into the industry. I’d like to look at Office which had strength probably more than people expected. Where are we in the up-sell opportunity from E3 to E5? And can you give us any sense of the sizing of how much of the growth not just now  but going forward do you think is going to come from frontline users? Thank you.Amy HoodMaybe I’ll start answering that question and Satya if you want to add  add anything. Very specifically Mark  I would say  this quarter was quite similar in nature to what you saw in the past few. Seat growth while across all segments was especially good in frontline worker and SMB. That did mask a little bit as it often does the ARPU improvement  given those tend to be lower priced SKUs  the ARPU improvement that we’re seeing from the transitions into E5. The transition from E3 to E5 still has opportunity. I would say  we’re in the earlier transitions of that show in terms as  I think  about going forward there is certainly still room for both seat growth specifically and frontline worker  as you noted as well as SMB. And then ARPU expansion through the E5 transition.The thing I would add that Satya mentioned in his comments and again in his first answer is really the value that is available to customers in E5  whether that is security  whether it’s compliance  whether it’s phone  whether it’s analytics  the value of that suite  and if you think even more broadly  the value of Microsoft 365  which adds in more components around Windows. I think we are offering high value and that tends to give us some optimism that we can continue to execute well in that segment.I don’t know Satya if there is anything you would add to that.Satya NadellaNo  you counted well  Amy. I mean  I think  the fundamentals are pretty strong here still  whether it’s E5 growth  SMB growth  frontline worker  I’d also add emerging markets. I mean  this is the first time I feel that we have products that fit just emerging markets like Teams Essentials  where we can even really penetrate markets that we’ve never sold anything in the past.And then the new growth engines that you talked about  Teams Phones  Teams Rooms  Viva and even Windows 365 are all things that we can again  drive growth from. And the point about sort of our value is probably a very  very strong in a time like this in particular. And we see it like the one thing also I’d say is the usage data that we are seeing is peak everywhere. And so that’s the other thing  is we definitely will optimize for driving usage and deployment and that’s going to be our priority.Mark MoerdlerThank you very much. I really appreciate it. Congrats.Brett IversenThanks Mark. Jesse  next question  please.OperatorOur next question comes from Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.Karl KeirsteadOkay  great. Amy  you called out some transactional weakness  which in the March quarter we can see in the on-prem Office segment and in your guidance in the server products  you suggest we might see it there too. Is that something that you would characterize as Microsoft specific  as you describe in your comments  your transitioning customers off your Open License program? Or do you feel like that’s a broader issue where maybe we’re starting to see a little bit of a tilt from on-prem to cloud even faster than we’ve seen before? Thank you.Amy HoodThanks  Karl. That’s a very good question. I would say it does not feel like the tilt from on-prem to cloud felt any different in a way that would have impacted the quarter anymore  so than it normally does in terms of the normal transitions. We’ve seen to your point on Office or frankly  even in server  as we have people move those workloads and migrate those workloads to the cloud.This really was very significant. Think of it as a where partners transact. And we have such a broad  and valuable  and really needed partner community that is very vast. And we put this and had planned for this change for January 1. And we executed the change on January 1 as plan  and it’s just taking us a little longer to onboard all of this community to make sure that they can transact the way they want to in the program.So  I do think it’s going to take us longer than we thought  we’re going to continue to see that impact in Q4. And I know the teams are working hard to make sure that partners get comfortable with the new system  which is important to us.Karl KeirsteadGot it.Satya NadellaAnd the only thing I’d add is that this change is super good for both the partners  the customers and Microsoft long-term.Amy HoodAbsolutely.Satya NadellaSo  there is execution ahead  but we want to do this because it benefits everybody.Karl KeirsteadGot it. Thanks Satya.Brett IversenThanks Karl. Jesse  next question  please.OperatorOur next question comes from Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.Mark MurphyYes. Thank you very much. Satya handful of infrastructure software companies have commented that their consumption activity actually started to slow a few months ago. And so  I’m curious what in your view is allowing your Azure trajectory to show better resilience. And do you in fact  see some of the newer products kicking in such as Azure or Synapse Cognitive Services  OpenAI and perhaps contributing to the strength and health and resiliency of that Azure number?Satya NadellaYes  I mean  what I’d say Karl [ph] is that what we are seeing is a classic what happens with consumption meters  right  which is they grow  and then they get optimized and they grow again both existing and new. And so  it’s sort of  will always have some amount of volatility that even Amy referenced quarter-over-quarter.But if I walk up  one thing that we look at is growth coming from all segments  right? So small business and enterprise  is it coming from all regions? And it is. We also look at the type of workloads it’s coming from. And so it looks healthy in all of those. And if you walk up the stack to your point on the infrastructure side  the Tier 1 workloads is where I think we are seeing some big Tier 1 workloads  and I had many comments on SAP and other workloads moving.The second thing I’d say is on the past services and our DevFest that’s another area where we have differentiated value. So we see good growth there. Data and AI for sure  I mean  the thing that I find really to be something that I think the long run is going to probably be one of the bigger drivers of our growth and differentiation is our data fabric  because we are the only guys who have a complete data fabric from the operational store that’s fully integrated into an analytics engine that’s fully integrated into governance.And that increasingly is going to become more and more important  right? I mean you can be dealing with this a new regulation coming on privacy and governance on one end and your operational store being divorced from that. So we have a very differentiated offer and I talked about some of the growth numbers there.The AI inference is also finally kicking. They’re very small today  but even when I look at the total com – that’s just essentially a compute meter  there’s growth there. So overall  I think we will see quarter-over-quarter  some cyclicality  depending on which customers. In fact  we pay people at Microsoft to reduce customer bills and which we should. So given that we may see cyclicality in terms of how optimizations happen  but overall we’re still very early on as the world sort of migrates to the cloud and users  essentially cloud infrastructure and compute is sort of to drive their operational efficiencies and product.Mark MurphyThank you.Brett IversenThanks  Mark. Jesse  next question  please.OperatorOur next question comes from Kash Rangan with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.Kash RanganThank you so much. Congrats on a spectacular quarter. Satya  I have very clearly on your comments and particularly you talked about tech as a percentage of GDP doubling over the next seven  eight years or so. Nobody could have really predicted maybe besides yourself  that Azure would be this big and growing this fast at this point in time relative to say five  six years back. So as you look forward  what part of the Microsoft tech stack do you think is underrepresented in the digital word and has therefore more opportunity to gain as you build out your thesis on tech as a percentage of GDP doubling. Thank you so much.Satya NadellaI mean the thing that I always go back Kash is that all enterprise value at least as far as I can tell  gets created at three layers of the tech stack. What happens with infrastructure  whenever something can be 10x better. So for example  when we talk about the next generation of multi-edge  multi-cloud  infrastructure remaining one of the leaders  that’s going to be a massive EV creation as a percentage of GDP tech spend double. So that’s where everything from Azure  Azure  our database  our – all of that’s super important.The other one is  this is sort of age of AI. In other words  the core business logic is not being written. It’s being written by software. So when I look at  when I use get up co-pilot  that’s the therein lies the future of what how all business logic gets written. And so to me the AI layer  both the training  supercomputers  as well as the inference layer that’s a place where you’ll see us integrate what today you all consider to be two different businesses  whether it’s Azure and Windows  they’re just one business to me  because to me  where in training happens  where inference happens will be written once by developers.And then it’ll light up across this distributed fabric. So that’s another place where I think there’s tons of enterprise value that’ll get created over time. And then of course the UI layer always is the biggest one. And the next inflection point  whether it’s what happens with MetaWare  so what happens with even on the industrial side with IoT and digital twins those are all things that I think will be the ones that we will be focused on. So these three things translated into workloads and what we call our customer solution areas are the ways that at least we are investing in.Kash RanganFascinating. Thank you so much.Brett IversenThanks  Kash. Jesse  next question  please.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Turrin with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.Michael TurrinHey  there  good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question and great job with the results. Azure growth and commercial booking strengths stand out. You mentioned a step down expected in Azure growth in Q4  but still suggest very impressive growth at that scale. Can you expand on the large deal commentary the longer-term strategic deals you’ve referenced a few times over the past couple of quarters  how those impact visibility or maybe the approach to framing targets there? And anything you can add just around how the addition of Nuance helps the cloud business and the industry cloud approach as well is greatly appreciated. Thank you.Amy HoodSatya  do you want to start with your comments maybe on Nuance overall  and then – and I can address sort of how the larger long-term contracts.Satya NadellaYes. Sure. Just a couple of quick things. One is on the strategic commitments that are being made. We are sort of working at them workload at a time  and so we feel very  very good about both the type of workloads. In fact  I – there is a migration of a bunch of workloads that we may have won in the client server that are migrating  but the most exciting thing is the type of Tier 1 workloads that we have never seen run on any Microsoft infrastructure that’s running on Azure today and being optimized on Azure.So that’s the thing that we see as we win these large strategic deals. On Nuance  for me  the thing that’s exciting is Nuance is a platform layer for these AI driven applications that are getting deployed  whether it’s in healthcare or even in the enterprise contact center.So we are very excited about Nuance now being part of the Microsoft family. You’ll see us pretty aggressively go innovate there and grow the impact of these solutions in both what is sort of the large percentages of our GDP  like healthcare where I think things like tackling issues like physician burdens with new innovative solutions is much needed and we are really looking forward to exercising that.Amy HoodAnd Michael  maybe specifically you’re absolutely right. I tend to mention the impact of large long-term Azure contract  both in the context of commercial bookings and some volatility we often can see in that because of it. But really  I think the way we think about them maybe outside of this phone call  is that it’s the beginning of the commitment between us and a customer to start to work together to deliver value.And so we go workload by workload  opportunity by opportunity and I think that’s what you were inferring a bit is that it’s almost the top of the funnel to create value for the customer. We call it delivering success to make sure they’re spending the dollars the most effective way  making sure we’re tackling the hardest problems that they need solved.And with that comes our investments that we’ve made and deployment resources and usage resources specifically in Azure to make that possible with customers. And so you’re right to say  I do talk about them in terms of volatility they create  what it creates inside the company is the beginning of a commitment to make sure we’re tackling the workloads and the solutions that the customers want to make happen across all the workloads frankly that Satya has talked about today.Michael TurrinThe great complimentary points also highlight. Thanks very much.Brett IversenThanks  Michael. Jesse  we have time for one last question.OperatorThank you. Our final question will come from Keith Bachman with BMO. Please proceed with your question.Keith BachmanHi  and many thanks. I wanted to break it up into two parts. But I was wondering if you could comment on what you see is the strength of the PC market as you look out over the course of the calendar year  if you focus on the demand side equation  not the supply side of the equation. And really the more important related part is given the outlook that you may have for the PC market. How are you thinking about the durability of the Windows side of your business? In particular  if you comment on the fundamentals related PC market  but also the opportunities to keep mixing up  so to speak helped by Microsoft 365. Many thanks.Satya NadellaSo let me…Amy HoodWhy don’t you start and I’ll add on.Satya NadellaPerfect. So I think on the commercial side  I think it’s well understood is that Windows is the socket for Microsoft 365. We have tremendous value  Amy referenced this earlier. In fact  we just launched Windows 11 and pro value with Windows 365  that’s resonating super well. The customer sat adoption rates when it comes  whether it’s security  whether it’s our productivity  we feel good about the commercial business. So we’ll stay focused on it on the commercial side.And on the consumer side  the coming out again the pandemic  the intensity of the usage has gone up. So one of the areas of focus for us is some of the stuff that I talked about in my remarks is just the usage  right? So where – when you think about 500 million users engaging with Microsoft start  that’s not the type of engagement we had.And so with a large installed base now  we have a significant room there  the browser share growth  we have significant room there. And then  of course  the subscription attaches whether it’s gaming or whether it’s productivity or suites. So that’s kind of how I look at what we are going to do at least in the immediate future. PC remains a very important category and I think people’s lives is what we’ve discovered during the pandemic. And if anything  the intensity of usage is increased. And there will be cyclical demand that we’ll go through. But the number of use cases is definitely  I think  structurally increased.Amy HoodExactly. I think the one thing I would add on your demand side  we have seen the transition from  I would say  in the middle of pandemic  definitely a consumer driven demand cycle. We’ve transitioned that to be a commercial part of the demand side. And so I do expect that to be the case  obviously  I think this is the second quarter in the row. We’ve seen that transition expect Q4 to be even more of that. And then we’ll wait and see how the second half of the year shapes up.Keith BachmanOkay. Many thanks. Congratulations.Amy HoodThank you.Brett IversenThanks  Keith. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

GAUSSIN  a leading group in new technologies for clean and intelligent mobilityGaussin continued to grow in 2021  increasing revenues 30% to €52.8 million in 2021 driven by synergies with Metalliance  which has increased its turnover from €10.4 million (6 months) to €26.5 million  and the transfer of the ATM and APM lines to the Saint-Vallier site.Gaussin reported strong improvements in results for the second half of 2021 compared to the first half of the year. Revenues and license income was €32.3 million compared to €20.5 million in the first half and net income was €2.8 million compared to a loss of €9.8 million in the first half of 2021 (see PR of H1 results on October 31  2021).EBITDA for the year was close to break-even at -€0.4 million reflecting rising input costs and significant levels of R&D activity.Including the contribution of the strong improvements in financial results in the second half of the year  the net loss was -€7.3 million for the year. This result is mainly impacted by significant provisions of €6.4 million.GAUSSIN's commercial growth is a testament to the technological advances highlighted at the Dakar Rally in January 2022 with the H2 Racing Truck®  the most powerful hydrogen-powered truck in the world.Under a compressed timetable  the truck was developed in barely a year by GAUSSIN's R&D teams and has begun a world tour. The H2 World Tour is intended to broaden awareness of Gaussin’s products and promote the deployment of licenses and sales of the range's flagship products  logistics and port vehicles.The order for 36 APM® 75T HEs placed by Bolloré Ports and the Maersk group in 2021 for the CIT port terminal in Abidjan is evidence of growing customer acceptance of our products. This order  which is currently being delivered  demonstrates the success of GAUSSIN's clean port vehicles  which are also used in their autonomous version at the Port of Singapore  via the license sold to STELS.Demand for clean and intelligent mobility is anticipated to remain strong in the years to come. GAUSSIN is perfectly positioned to seize the opportunities that will arise. Based on the order book at year-end  Gaussin expects to generate strong growth in 2022 and is targeting turnover of €75 million.Highlights of the Year:A business model of licenses adapted to the explosion of freight costsThe GAUSSIN group is implementing a strategy for deploying its technology on a worldwide scale based on the Global Licensing program and the development of strategic partnerships with major international players. This strategy enables GAUSSIN products to be rapidly deployed internationally  both for distribution and maintenance. It is also a response to the explosion of freight costs insofar as it makes it possible to produce locally. Finally  this business model is low capital intensive. The group has signed three licenses to date and is still aiming for forty or so within two and a half years.A scaled industrial tool with the possibility of extensionGAUSSIN expanded its manufacturing footprint in 2021  increasing its production capacities by 8 000 square meters at the new site of Saint-Vallier  in the Saône-et-Loire region. This new site  which covers several hectares and is dedicated to the production of ATM® logistics and APM® port vehicles  will enable the company to meet the increased demand on the European and American markets  in particular. The group has the possibility of extending on site up to 28 000 square meters  which would bring the annual production capacity to 2 400 vehicles  and enable Gaussin to satisfy the demands of customers in e-commerce  transport and logistics.Referencing with major American players in e-commerce  transport and logisticsMaster Purchase Agreements (MPAs) have been signed with the American giants of e-commerce  transport and logistics  which allows worldwide referencing of GAUSSIN vehicles  an essential first step in pursuing the commercial relationship.A complete range of clean and intelligent vehiclesGAUSSIN's range of electric vehicles includes the ATM  dedicated to logistics  the APM  dedicated to port transport  and also the AGV  an autonomous vehicle which is used in the port of Singapore. GAUSSIN has enhanced its range by offering these vehicles in a hydrogen version. The AGV H2  the launch of which was announced last month (see press release of March 16  2022)  is the latest hydrogen vehicle from the group. It will help port operators to go immediately to zero emissions while offering a longer range  shorter and less frequent refueling  as well as silent and efficient transport. GAUSSIN's range of clean vehicles also includes vehicles for airport logistics  with the innovation represented by the AMDT FULL ELEC  a multi-directional car transporter for air freight pallets for which Qatar Airways Cargo is the first customer.A global presence2021 was the year of internationalization for GAUSSIN with the opening of subsidiaries in the heart of key markets. Gaussin North America  which opened in January and is based in New York  enables the group to cover the key market of the United States and Canada  where GAUSSIN has already forged valuable partnerships with customers such as Plug Power and Robotics Research  and above all MPAs with the American leaders in E-Commerce and logistics. Gaussin Asia Pacific  based in Singapore  positions the group as a major player in this region which has become the crossroads of international trade  while Gaussin China allows the group to strengthen its presence in the world's largest truck market.2.

The other co-founder of the exchange is chief compliance officer Anthony Mazzarese  a long-time business partner of Mulvihill. They will also be joined by technologist Vlad Rysin  the former chief technology officer of Euronext FX  a trading services company.The new exchange will focus on offering improved technology that speeds up cryptocurrency trading and reduces latency to the standards expected in traditional FX or equities by institutional investors. Mazzarese says this is often lacking in retail-focused exchanges:“There seems to be a notion that latency doesn’t matter when it comes to trading crypto. We disagree.”“We polled our network of institutional relationships globally and one of the biggest and most common requirements was reliable 24/7 technology with the same service levels and customization features they are accustomed to in other markets such as FX or equities. This exactly what Crossover Markets will provide.”Mulvihill said that while the vast majority of traditional institutional investors have not yet entered the crypto space  this is rapidly changing. He stressed the need for exchanges to advance technology in line with market maturity.Related: Crypto gains trust as investment  but still lags behind other options: Bitstamp reportOn Tuesday  global crypto exchange Bitstamp released a survey report that found that the majority of the 28 615 institutional and retail investors survey respondents believe crypto will overtake traditional investment vehicles within a decade. As much as 80% of institutional respondents surveyed answered in the affirmative.Though the two executives left Jefferies in March to set up this new exchange  Jefferies itself has been expanding its crypto services business under the leadership of Alexander Yavorsky  the firm’s managing director of Financial Institutions Group (FIG) Investment Banking.

Faurecia is addressing the increasing complexity of the supplier manufacturing environment by improving logistics flow  boosting efficiency  reducing costs  and delivering products to customers on time in a more sustainable way.Faurecia is using Dassault Systèmes’ “On Target Vehicle Launch” industry solution experience based on the 3DEXPERIENCE platform to determine and validate the best logistics scenarios for make-to-order assembly lines. Faurecia can simulate and visualize AGV routing with regards to work stations  resource availability  assembly constraints and variabilities  line balancing and flow in one virtual twin experience  before starting production for a customer.Automotive supplier manufacturing environments are increasingly complex  producing a greater number of product variants for simultaneous programs under tighter deadlines  while managing last-minute engineering changes in factories that are more and more automated.Optimizing AGV routing is a key step in Faurecia’s digital factory program  which was initiated by its Clean Mobility business and now is used to transform the production processes of seats  interiors and electronics for connected  personalized and predictive automotive “cockpits of the future” in response to these trends. With the 3DEXPERIENCE platform  Faurecia can synchronize machines  optimize supplies  reduce the layout footprint of a shop floor  shorten cycle times  and improve energy and manufacturing efficiency  with full digital continuity across products  processes and a plant.Story continues“We’ve committed to being carbon neutral by 2030  starting by reducing energy consumption in our factories by 15%. This means simultaneous engineering on new products and processes and reducing waste in terms of logistics flows ” said Patrick Brionne  Group Industrial strategy & ME director  Faurecia. “With the 3DEXPERIENCE platform we are optimizing our AGV routing and boosting our production performance from day one. Already  we’ve identified a bottleneck before starting production and reworked the process design  layout and AGV flow to ensure that we can supply parts to our customer as promised.”“Suppliers must be able to introduce new products  launch new programs  and streamline production processes quickly and sustainably. AGV flow plays a key role in gaining a competitive advantage. The 3DEXPERIENCE platform enables suppliers like Faurecia to improve logistics at existing factories  and plan for future ones that are even more efficient ” said Laurence Montanari  Vice President  Transportation & Mobility Industry  Dassault Systèmes.###FOR MORE INFORMATIONDassault Systèmes’ industry solution experiences for Transportation & Mobility: https://ifwe.3ds.com/transportation-mobilityDassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform  3D design software  3D Digital Mock Up and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions: http://www.3ds.comSHARE THIS ON TWITTERAdvancing its digital factory program  Faurecia optimizes AGV logistics with #3DEXPERIENCE @Dassault3DSABOUT DASSAULT SYSTÈMESDassault Systèmes  the 3DEXPERIENCE Company  is a catalyst for human progress.

Significant price increases were implemented in 2021 and 2022 to offset the effects of inflation in purchasing costs  therefore the Group also measures the change in like-for-like sales including price adjustments in the CIS countries.1. Revenue for the first quarter 2022Net revenue was 685 million euros  up by +22.5% compared to the first quarter of 2021. Organic growth reached +19.2% including selling price increases in the CIS countries implemented to offset the inflation in purchasing costs and the devaluation of the rouble (1). The total effect of the selling price increases implemented across all segments is +12.9% on average compared to the first quarter of 2021.Story continuesThe EMEA segment achieved revenue of 238 million euros  an increase of +8.1% compared to the first quarter of 2021 due to the acceleration of selling price increases. Volumes fell slightly given anticipated orders in December 2021 ahead of selling price increases  as well as a selective approach in the Residential segment due to a procurement environment for raw materials that remains strained. Commercial sales are more sustained  mostly due to the good performance of luxury vinyl tiles and commercial carpets.The North America segment reported revenue of 204 million euros  an increase of +27.3% compared to the first quarter of 2021  reflecting solid like-for-like growth of +18.1% and a positive exchange rate effect. Volumes and selling prices contributed to organic growth  particularly sustained in the Commercial Health and Education segments using vinyl or rubber accessories and flooring. Business in the office and hospitality segments was also strong  confirming the positive trend seen in the fourth quarter of 2021.Revenue in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment was 134 million euros  an increase of +18.7% compared to the first quarter in 2021 despite a negative foreign exchange effect linked to the rouble  partially offset by the appreciation of the Brazilian real. Like-for-like sales increased by +0.5%  or +20.5% including selling price increases in the CIS countries implemented to offset inflation and the devaluation of the rouble.Volumes are falling in the CIS due to the cessation of sales in Ukraine since the beginning of the conflict on 24 February 2022 and slower business in Russia and Kazakhstan. Beyond selling price increases planned for the beginning of the year  an additional significant increase was rolled out urgently in Russia in early March to offset the devaluation of the rouble. Sales in Russia made up approximately 9% of total Group sales in the first quarter of 2022. The APAC region is growing and the LATAM region achieved an excellent quarter with strong growth in volumes while maintaining higher price levels.As expected  business grew strongly in the Sports segment. Revenue was 109 million euros  up by +66.0% and including +55.7% organic growth compared to the first quarter of 2021. North America is the strongest geographical region thanks to sustained demand and success of the Tarkett range. Backlog remains at a particularly high level.2. 2022 Environment and OutlookThe macroeconomic environment and the geopolitical situation in Ukraine and Russia have created a particularly unpredictable situation and make it difficult to assess the change in demand across our different markets.The Group unequivocally condemns the war in Ukraine and is monitoring the situation closely. Since the beginning of the conflict  priority has been given to the safety of teams in Ukraine with whom daily contact is maintained. Tarkett is actively supporting its 375 employees and their families  notably with salary continuance and temporary accommodation measures. The Group has also set up an internal solidarity fund allowing to provide financial aid to the teams based in Ukraine. Sales have resumed at a very slow pace  however the production site located in the west of the country is currently able to continue operating.In Russia  the Group has been producing flooring for the Residential market for over 20 years. Aware of its responsibility as an employer  particularly to its 1 550 local employees  the Group continues to operate in the country in full compliance with international & local regulations. However  the Group has frozen all significant new investments in Russia. Anticipating a fall in demand and increase in supply restrictions  the Group expects a marked slowdown in the second quarter  although it is currently impossible to quantify.In Europe  the combination of inflation and the geopolitical situation could affect demand  particularly in the Residential segment. Trends at the beginning of the year were stronger in North America  however the Residential segment could also level off. In Sports  a good level of business is expected throughout the year due to the good backlog.Tarkett is continuing the roll out of new product ranges and its ambitious circular economy strategy  notably with innovative and significant investments in its recycling capabilities. The Group also announced its new Climate Roadmap for 2030 with the objective to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from its entire value chain by 30% and increase the recycled content of its products to 30% by 2030. These objectives will be assessed and approved by the independent organization Science Based Targets (SBTi) by the end of the year.Actions to reduce the cost structure are well underway and the Group is forecasting around 30 million euros of annual structural savings in 2022.The significant increase in oil and energy prices will contribute to the increase in purchasing costs now valued at 250 million euros compared to 2021 (against an estimated 220 million euros at the beginning of the year).The Group continues to implement selling price increases across all its geographies to offset the effect of increased purchasing costs over the year. At the current level of purchasing prices  the Group is targeting a neutral inflation balance over the year (selling price effect compared to 2021 minus purchasing price effect).This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

The exchange rate effect is obtained by applying the prior year’s exchange rate to sales for the current year and calculating the difference with sales for the current year. It also includes the effect of price adjustments in the CIS countries intended to offset the change in local currencies against the euro.The effect of changes in scope is composed of: current year sales by entities not included in the scope of consolidation in the same period of the prior year  until the anniversary of their consolidation; the reduction in sales due to discontinued operations that are not included in the current year's scope of consolidation but were included in sales for the same period of the prior year  until the anniversary of their disposal.In millions of euros Q1 2022 revenue Q1 2021 revenue Change Of which volume Of which selling prices Of which CIS selling prices Of which exchange rate effect Of which effect of changes in scope Group Total Q1 684.7 558.8 +22.5%+6.4%+8.8%+4.1% +3.3% - Of which organic growth +15.2% Of which selling price increases +12.9%2/ Bridges in millions of euros Q1 2022Revenue by segmentQ1 2021 558.8 +/- EMEA +19.0 +/- North America +29.1 +/- CIS  APAC & Latin America +0.5 +/- Sports +36.2 Q1 2022 Like-for-like 643.7 +/- Scope effect +0.2 +/- Currencies +22.8 +/- Lag effect in CIS +18.0 Q1 2022 684.7***Attachment,neutral,0.3,0.63,0.07,mixed,0.33,0.2,0.47,True,English,"['Q1 2022 Net Sales', 'Solid performance', 'sustained activity', 'price increases', 'acceleration', 'selling', 'negative foreign exchange effect', 'positive exchange rate effect', 'New selling price increases', '+3.3% exchange rate effect', 'The North America segment', 'higher price levels', 'The Supervisory Board', 'alternative performance indicators', 'strongest geographical region', 'price increases Results', 'Significant price increases', 'luxury vinyl tiles', 'Latin America segment', 'Selling price adjustments', 'additional significant increase', 'organic growth” indicator', 'The EMEA segment', 'Q1 2022 Net Sales', 'total Group sales', 'total effect', 'positive trend', 'Residential segment', 'price changes', 'selling prices', 'good performance', 'LATAM region', 'Sports segment', 'The Group', '+55.7% organic growth', 'sustained activity', 'first quarter', 'slight decrease', 'good start', 'purchasing costs', 'raw materials', 'energy prices', 'currency movements', 'selective approach', 'commercial carpets', 'Commercial Health', 'rubber accessories', 'fourth quarter', 'Brazilian real', 'excellent quarter', 'strong growth', 'high level', 'geopolitical situation', 'unpredictable situation', 'different markets', 'Solid performance', 'Commercial sales', 'procurement environment', 'Education segments', 'hospitality segments', 'APAC region', 'macroeconomic environment', 'Organic change', '238 million euros', '204 million euros', '109 million euros', 'Strong increase', 'high backlog', 'Euronext Paris', 'Q1 2021 Change', 'sustained demand', 'Net revenue', 'CIS countries', 'slower business', 'early March', 'Tarkett range', 'Continued inflation', '2022 Environment', 'acceleration', '6.4% volume', 'volumes', 'year', 'Step-up', 'impact', 'April', 'TKTT', 'consolidated', 'IFRS', 'detail', 'appendix', 'document', 'millions', 'effects', 'devaluation', 'rouble', 'Story', 'orders', 'December', 'flooring', 'office', 'appreciation', 'cessation', 'Ukraine', 'beginning', 'conflict', '24 February', 'Russia', 'Kazakhstan', 'success', 'Outlook', 'war', '1.', '685']",2022-04-27,2022-04-28,finance.yahoo.com

Tenant sales have recovered further during the quarter and reached 93% of 2019 levels in Q1 and 95% in March. This has supported the continued improvement of rent collection to 93% for the Group as a whole.The vital role our centres play in the omnichannel strategy of leading brands was also illustrated by strong leasing performance. We signed more deals than in Q1-2019  realising an MGR uplift of +6%.We also laid the foundations for our strategy to grow media revenues by converting our footfall into qualified audiences. During the quarter  we signed a new media contract with Clear Channel France  built on an improved revenue share  and activated a programmatic digital out-of-home advertising campaign  that will allow us to better measure the effectiveness of in-mall advertising  audience behaviours and sales conversion.Story continuesDuring the quarter  we pursued our deleveraging effort with the streamlining of our US portfolio through the disposal of the former Promenade Mall land plot  while in Europe the Group signed an agreement for the disposal of Gera Arcaden  both at a premium to the last appraisal.Based on Q1 performance  including the improved collection levels and sustained leasing activity  we confirm our 2022 AREPS guidance of €8.20 to €8.40 per share  while we are monitoring very closely the potential impact of the wider economic and geopolitical situation on our markets.”1.

Gross Rental IncomeFrom an accounting standpoint  Gross Rental Income (“GRI”) includes the COVID-19 rent discounts  indexation  vacancy impact  and variable revenues  while doubtful debtor provisions are part of the property operating expenses.The GRI for the Shopping Centre division amounted on a proportionate basis to €622.4 Mn for Q1-2022  an increase of +31.7%. The GRI increase is primarily due to a base effect of rent relief provided in Q1-2021  when lockdowns were in place in all regions except in the US  while no rent relief has been accounted for shopping centres3 in the Q1-2022 P&L  as well as due to indexation.Growth was strong in Austria and Poland (in the Central Europe region) where rents and service charges were not due during lockdown periods. In addition  the Group benefitted from an improvement in variable income (SBR  parking income and Commercial Partnerships)  in particular in the UK and the US. The Netherlands benefitted from the delivery of Westfield Mall of the Netherlands in March 2021  while results for the Nordics were affected by the disposal of Solna Centrum in February 2022. In the US  the Group also benefitted from a positive FX impact  partly offset by the foreclosure of Sarasota  Broward and Palm Desert and remaining rental abatements for tenants in the airport business.GRI for the Offices & Others division was down marginally compared to Q1-2021  driven by the disposal of SHiFT  Les Villages 3  4 and 6  Le Blériot  and the Palisade residential building at Westfield UTC in 2021  partly offset by the successful leasing of Trinity and the delivery of Pullman Montparnasse. Convention & Exhibition GRI increased to €42.1 Mn from €10.2 Mn in Q1-2021  as the business has recovered strongly with 102 events in Q1-2022 compared to 13 events in Q1-2021.Gross Rental Income IFRS Proportionate YTD in € Mn  excluding VAT Q1-2022 Q1-2021 Change Q1-2022 Q1-2021 Change Shopping Centres 480.8 360.6 33.4% 622.4 472.8 31.7% France 139.4 111.3 25.3% 141.9 112.8 25.8% Spain 43.0 33.9 26.9% 43.1 33.9 27.0% Southern Europe 182.4 145.2 25.6% 185.0 146.8 26.1% Central Europe 51.9 34.4 50.9% 57.6 36.1 59.4% Austria 36.3 13.5 168.7% 36.3 13.5 168.7% Germany 23.8 14.5 64.4% 34.5 20.4 68.9% Central and Eastern Europe 111.9 62.3 79.5% 128.3 70.0 83.2% Nordics 28.9 27.9 3.4% 28.9 27.9 3.4% The Netherlands 22.6 13.9 63.1% 22.6 13.9 63.1% Northern Europe 51.5 41.8 23.2% 51.5 41.8 23.2% United Kingdom 25.7 9.5 169.9% 47.7 20.2 135.7% United States 109.3 101.7 7.4% 209.9 193.9 8.2% Offices & Others 17.8 17.4 2.0% 19.0 19.5 -2.3% France 12.3 9.3 32.2% 12.9 9.3 37.8% Other countries 5.4 8.1 -32.9% 6.2 10.2 -39.3% Convention & Exhibition 41.4 10.1 n.m. 42.1 10.2 n.m.

In Q1  the Omicron wave with a record high number of COVID-19 cases  led to a lockdown in The Netherlands as well as some restrictions in other countries  including guidance to work from home  capacity restrictions  reduced opening hours for F&B  restrictions for non-vaccinated persons and mask mandates  holding back the recovery. Sales in Germany and Austria  which had more stringent restrictions  remained more impacted  while Central Europe and the Nordics performed well at 96% and 93%. The UK showed an improvement from 84% in Q4-2021 to 89% in Q1-2022.In the US  sales continue to be consistently above 2019 levels  reaching 102% in Q1 and 104% in March.

Elanco has secured the exclusive U.S. licensing rights to develop  manufacture and commercialize Bovaer® for beef and dairy cattle.DSM Logo.Bovaer® is a first-in-class and best-in-class methane-reducing innovative feed additive for beef and dairy cattle  already available in Europe  Brazil  Chile and Australia. More than 50 peer-reviewed studies and 48 on-farm trials in 14 countries show Bovaer® consistently reduces enteric methane emissions by approximately 30% for dairy cows and even higher percentages for beef cattle.DSM and Elanco intend to provide farmers  dairy and beef companies  and retailers with a solution to substantially lower the carbon footprint of beef and dairy production  supporting the animal protein industry's ESG efforts and helping secure a sustainable future for the planet. The methane reduction from feeding a million cows Bovaer® is equivalent to planting 45 million trees or removing 300 000 cars from the road. With 9 million dairy cows and 14 million beef cattle on feed in the U.S. alone  the product would contribute to a significant and immediate reduction of the environmental footprint of meat and dairy products  supporting the Global Methane Pledge to cut emissions 30% by 2030.Story continuesThe strategic alliance is expected to enable both parties to maximize the opportunity for the product in the U.S. market  once approved  while also nearly doubling previously announced Bovaer® production capacity globally. Elanco will be responsible for the U.S. approval process  commercialization strategy and product supply  supporting DSM supply in markets outside the U.S. Elanco will assess and evaluate the regulatory submission and manufacturing options with the intent to bring Bovaer® to the U.S. market as quickly as possible. Already the State of Indiana  for example  has indicated its support for expanded manufacturing investment in the state as it continues to build public-private partnerships supporting the state's growing agriculture economy.""We are excited to partner with DSM to start the process of bringing this game-changing innovation to U.S. livestock producers "" said Jeff Simmons  president and CEO of Elanco. ""It will further strengthen Elanco's efforts to create the livestock sustainability market and the next era of value for farmers by adding to our efforts to reduce  measure and monetize emission reductions  including Experior™  Uplook™ and Athian. We are eager to work with regulators to bring a unique innovation like DSM's Bovaer® to the U.S. market as quickly as possible to support farmers and positively impact the climate crisis.""Geraldine Matchett and Dimitri de Vreeze  Co-CEOs of Royal DSM  commented: ""This agreement marks an important milestone for DSM  Elanco  and the climate change mitigation efforts of the U.S. We believe Elanco  as a company that shares our determination to revolutionize the sustainability of the cattle industry  is the ideal partner to help us increase and accelerate the total impact of our game-changing feed additive by bringing us closer to customers across the U.S. This alliance will help us realize Bovaer®'s potential as a powerful solution with a significantly positive impact on the planet. In addition  and fully aligned with our purpose-led performance-driven strategy  the alliance enables us as DSM to monetize our long-term innovation faster.""With an estimated global market opportunity for livestock methane reduction of $1 billion to $2 billion  Elanco expects Bovaer® to have blockbuster annual revenue potential in excess of US$200 million in the U.S. market with initial contribution by mid-decade.

Thanks to its reinforced agility  Worldline intends to actively participate in the European market consolidation still offering a significant number of new opportunities.Story continuesThanks to this very strong start of the year and despite the impact of the Ukrainian crisis  we confirm our 2022 annual guidance  which is a key cornerstone for our strategic roadmap aiming at establishing Worldline as a premium global Paytech at the heart of the European payment system and enriching our portfolio to create more value for merchants and banks.”Q1 2022 revenue by Global Business LineIn € million Q1 2022 Q1 2021* Organic change Merchant Services 627 542 +15.8% Financial Services 223 217 +2.5% Mobility & e-Transactional Services 90 83 +8.4% Worldline 939 841 +11.6%* at constant scope and exchange ratesWorldline’s Q1 2022 revenue reached € 939 million  representing a strong +11.6% organic growth. This achievement was notably reached thanks to the very dynamic growth in Merchant Services at +15.8% organically  benefiting from the strong growth of acquiring MSV (up by +36% in Q1 2022 compared to the same period last year). Mobility & e-Transactional Services also contributed to growth  delivering a strong +8.4% organic growth in Q1. Financial Services was up by +2.5%  a decent performance taking into account the temporary impact from the price decrease conceded by the Group for the successful synchronous renewals of historical large contracts of Equens in Q4 2021.Merchant ServicesMerchant Services’ revenue in Q1 2022 reached € 627 million  representing a strong organic growth by +15.8%  led in particular by the strong acquiring MSV growth by +36% in Q1 2022 compared to the same period last year. By division  the growth was mainly led by:Commercial Acquiring showed a strong double-digit growth in almost all geographies and customer segments with strong dynamics;Payment Acceptance also contributed to the growth of Merchant Services thanks to high single-digit organic growth. Growth was spread in all geographies and led by much stronger transactions’ volumes  in particular for digital native players benefitting from the bounce-back of the Travel vertical  as well as a strong dynamic of SMBs  notably in Germany; andDigital Services delivered a mid-single digit growth with a mixed picture by geography and customer segment.During the first quarter of the year  commercial activity in Merchant Services has been particularly strong with numerous new client wins and upsells signed with existing clients such as among others But  Vinfast  Monoprix  Pearson  Chronopost or Norse.In Q1  leveraging its scale and reach  Worldline continued to play actively its orchestrator role of the payment ecosystem with numerous partnerships signed such as:Microsoft with Next Gen fraud solution for online payments based on Dynamics 365 fraud protection;Alipay for the Integration of Alipay+ enhancing in-store and e-commerce payments with a wide range of e-wallets and bank apps from across Asia;Oracle through the integration agreement including full suite of payment services for hospitality  F&B and Retail verticals;Vesca for Credit card acquiring and POS card acceptance and processing in Japan for instore and online merchants.Financial ServicesFinancial Services delivered a +2.5% organic growth in Q1 2022  a decent performance in line with FY expectations with solid revenue flows partly compensating the temporary impact from the price decrease conceded by the Group for the renewals of historical large contracts of Equens end of 2021  effects that will fade away in the course of the second half 2022. As a results  Q1 2022 revenue reached € 223 million. The performance of each division continued to be contrasted:Issuing Processing: low-to-mid-single-digit organic growth thanks to higher transaction volumes project deliveries in Belgium and Asia  compensating for the impact of price concession of renewed large contracts;Acquiring Processing: improved volume trends in the Netherlands  Belgium and Germany  did not fully compensated for the impact of price concession of renewed large contracts  in particular in the Netherlands  leading to a low-to-mid-single-digit organic decline of the division;Despite the difficult base effect of the UniCredit contract now in its run phase with significant decrease of project works as per plan  Account Payments grew at mid-to-high-single-digit  pursing the positive trend recorded last year and largely benefitting from the significant level of activity of large contracts in Germany in particular;Digital Banking delivered a high-single-digit organic growth with strong volumes in France where the unit continued to benefit from higher authentications volumes related to ecommerce transactions due to enforcement of the PSD2 regulation  as well as strong volumes and project deliveries in Belgium.Since the start of the year  Financial Services continued to extend its business  and notably through the following signatures  among others:a partnership with UniCredit to allow the bank’s customers to connect their accounts in other banks throughout Europe via one single application programming interface (API). This enables UniCredit to effectively offer Account Information Services (AIS) and Payment Initiation Services (PIS) and opens up a range of business opportunities for both UniCredit and its customers. UniCredit has been using Worldline’s Open Banking TPP service since 2020. The partnership has been extended for another two years;a partnership with Mainsys Financial Software  a Belgian IT company that offers comprehensive banking solutions. The joint solution has been recently rolled-out for the first time to manage co-badged Visa Debit-Bancontact cards.Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesRevenue in Mobility & e-Transactional Services reached € 90 million  up organically by +8.4%  thanks to the contribution of each of the three divisions:Trusted Digitization in particular strongly grew at a strong double-digit rate in Q1 2022 with volume increase and new projects signed in France  higher volumes in Tax collection and digital healthcare in Latin America  growing project activity on eHealth solutions in Germany  and new cash-to-invoice solutions sold in the Brexit context.e-Ticketing delivered a high-single-digit growth driven by higher project activity and increasing volumes on rail transactional revenue in the UK  higher transportation and fare collection in Latin America  coupled with several development projects in France and Germany.Finally  e-Consumer & Mobility was slightly up organically with lower revenue on the Group’s cryptographic solutions in Germany  offset by the strong momentum of Contact solutions in France and thanks to higher project activity in Iberia in Connected Living and Mobility.Commercial activity in Mobility & e-Transactional Services was strong in Q1  in particular with the following signatures:The department of the North (largest administrative area in France) has chosen Worldline to use the SaaS solution Worldline Parcours RSA in order to equip their +1 400 social agents.

This reflects the combination of a 53% growth at constant exchange rates and a positive currency impact of 3%3.On a sequential basis  fourth quarter revenue was up 35% at constant exchange rates compared with the third quarter of FY’22  representing a seventh consecutive quarter-over-quarter organic revenue growth since the first quarter of FY’21.Paul Boudre  Soitec’s CEO  commented: “Thanks to another record quarter  we completed our fiscal year with a 50% annual organic growth  an even higher level than initially anticipated allowing us to pass the one billion US dollars revenue mark for the first time. We are very proud of such a strong performance and particularly pleased that significant growth was achieved by all our products  demonstrating the value that we bring to our customers on our three end markets: mobile communications  automotive and industrial  and smart devices.“Among the key events of the quarter  in line with our FY’26 strategic roadmap  we announced the expansion of our manufacturing footprint in Bernin to ramp up overall production and manufacture innovative SmartSiC™ wafers. SmartSiC™ will primarily address the key challenges of the electric vehicle and industrial markets ” added Paul Boudre.Story continuesFourth quarter FY’22 consolidated revenue (unaudited)Q4’21 Q4’22 Q4’22/Q4’21 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates 150/200-mm 74 94 +27% +25% 300-mm 95 175 +85% +81% Royalties and other revenue 12 13 +10% +9% Total revenue 181 282 +56% +53%Soitec recorded a 53% total revenue increase at constant exchange rates in the fourth quarter of FY’22 compared to the fourth quarter of FY’21  with a solid performance across all types of products in each end market.Soitec achieved another strong growth in Mobile communications  its largest end market  which continues to be supported by the deployment of 5G  whether in sub-6 GHz or in mmWave. The expansion of 5G is translating into much higher sales of RF-SOI wafers dedicated to radiofrequency applications  POI wafers dedicated to RF filters  and also FD-SOI wafers for 5G mmWave modules. Growth was enabled by the ramp-up in production following the capacity increase in our Singapore facility dedicated to 300-mm SOI products and in Bernin III  dedicated to 150-mm POI products.Soitec enjoyed further growth in Automotive & Industrial as evidenced by the sustained sales of Power-SOI and FD-SOI  which continue to benefit from the recovery of the automotive market.Soitec also achieved a sharp increase in revenue from Smart devices thanks to much higher sales of FD-SOI wafers for Internet of Things and edge computing applications as well as of Photonics-SOI wafers for data centers.150/200-mm wafer revenue150/200-mm wafers are mostly dedicated to radiofrequency applications  including filters  and  for a smaller part  to power applications. In the fourth quarter of FY’22  150/200-mm wafer revenue reached 94 million Euros  a 25% growth at constant exchange rates compared to the fourth quarter of FY’21. This growth mostly reflects a strong increase in volumes of 150-mm POI wafers produced in Bernin III  as well as a higher output of 200-mm SOI wafers in Bernin I thanks to the industrial performance and at Simgui  Soitec’s partner based in Shanghai. It also reflects a positive price/mix effect.150/200-mm wafer revenue growth was mainly supported by:Higher RF-SOI 200-mm wafer sales compared to the fourth quarter of FY’21 An increase in POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafer sales compared to the fourth quarter of FY21.On a sequential basis  150/200-mm wafer revenue was up 9% at constant exchange rates compared to the third quarter of FY’22  with higher RF-SOI 200-mm and Power SOI wafer sales.300-mm wafer revenueIn the fourth quarter of FY’22  300-mm wafer sales reached 175 million Euros  an 81% increase at constant exchange rates  compared with the fourth quarter of FY’21. Sales growth essentially results from a strong demand on Soitec’s three end markets and the Group’s capacity to deliver more volumes from Bernin II (thanks to the very good industrial performance) and from Singapore (thanks to the capacity increase)  and to a small extent from a positive price/mix effect.RF-SOI 300-mm wafer sales significantly increased compared with the fourth quarter of FY’21. Sales continue to be supported by the ongoing deployment of 5G smartphones and by the increase in RF content in every 5G smartphone.FD-SOI wafer sales continued to enjoy a strong growth and were significantly higher than in the fourth quarter of FY’21  as FD-SOI is increasingly benefitting applications across Soitec’s three end markets  i.e. Smart devices  Automotive and Industrial  and Mobile communications  especially 5G mmWave modules.Sales of Imager-SOI wafers  which allow 3D image sensing for facial recognition in smartphones  also reached a higher level than in the fourth quarter of FY’21.Finally  sales of Photonics-SOI wafers for data centers were much higher than in the fourth quarter of FY’21  confirming the positive trend experienced since the fourth quarter of FY’21.On a sequential basis  300-mm wafer revenue increased 50% at constant exchange rates compared to the third quarter of FY’22  with strong growth achieved in every product line.Royalties and other revenueTotal Royalties and other revenue reached 13 million Euros in the fourth quarter of FY’22 compared to 12 million Euros in the fourth quarter of FY’21  up 9% at constant exchange rates.FY’22 annual consolidated revenue (unaudited)FY’21 FY’22 FY’22/FY’21 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates 150/200-mm 277 344 +24% +26% 300-mm 277 488 +77% +79% Royalties and other revenues 30 30 +1% +2% Total revenue 584 863 +48% +50%Annual consolidated revenue reached 863 million Euros in FY’22  an all-time high record. Revenue was up 48% from 584 million Euros in FY’21. This reflects the combination of a 50% growth at constant exchange rates and a negative currency impact of 2%.150/200-mm wafer sales were up 26% at constant exchange rates compared to FY’21 while 300-mm wafer sales were up 79% at constant exchange rates.FY’22 OutlookThanks in particular to the higher revenue level in Q4’22  FY’22 EBITDA1 margin2 is now expected around 35.5%  Soitec having previously guided around 34% with a potential upside to reach around 35%.FY’23 outlookSoitec anticipates FY’23 revenue up around 20% at constant exchange rates and perimeter and EBITDA margin at least at the level of FY’22 EBITDA1 margin2.FY’26 Financial modelSoitec is anticipating significant growth on each of its end markets and is managing its business to reach by FY’26 a revenue target of around 2.3 billion US Dollar and an EBITDA1 margin2 target of around 40% (at a 1.20 Euro/US Dollar exchange rate)  as compared to a revenue of 2 billion US Dollar (with a high case around 2.4 billion US Dollar) and a 35% EBITDA1 margin2 communicated during its Capital Markets Day in June 2021.Key events of the quarterDolphin Design opens a processing center in SingaporeOn January 5th  2022  Dolphin Design  specialized in advanced chip design  announced that it will open its new dedicated Edge Computing and AI branch in Soitec’s fab in Singapore.

Elanco has secured the exclusive U.S. licensing rights to develop  manufacture and commercialize Bovaer® for beef and dairy cattle.Bovaer® is a first-in-class methane-reducing product for beef and dairy cattle approved in Europe  Brazil  Chile and Australia. As part of its authorization in those countries  more than 50 peer-reviewed studies and 48 on-farm trials in 14 countries show Bovaer® consistently reduces enteric methane emissions by approximately 30% for dairy cows and even higher percentages for beef cattle1.DSM and Elanco intend to seek U.S. authorization for the product to provide farmers  dairy and beef companies  and retailers with a solution to substantially lower the carbon footprint of beef and dairy production  supporting the animal protein industry’s ESG efforts and helping secure a sustainable future for the planet. Based on published research  the methane reduction from feeding a million cows Bovaer® is equivalent to planting 45 million trees or removing 300 000 cars from the road. With 9 million dairy cows and 14 million beef cattle on feed in the U.S. alone  the product  if authorized in the U.S.  would contribute to a significant and immediate reduction of the environmental footprint of meat and dairy products  supporting the Global Methane Pledge to cut emissions 30% by 2030.2The strategic alliance is expected to enable both parties to maximize the opportunity for the product in the U.S. market  once approved  while also nearly doubling previously announced Bovaer® production capacity globally. Elanco will be responsible for the U.S. approval process  commercialization strategy and product supply  supporting DSM supply in markets outside the U.S. Elanco will assess and evaluate the regulatory submission and manufacturing options with the intent to bring Bovaer® to the U.S. market as quickly as possible. Already the State of Indiana  for example  has indicated its support for expanded manufacturing investment in the state as it continues to build public-private partnerships supporting the state’s growing agriculture economy.“ We are excited to partner with DSM to start the process of bringing this game-changing innovation to U.S. livestock producers ” said Jeff Simmons  president and CEO of Elanco. “ It will further strengthen Elanco’s efforts to create the livestock sustainability market and the next era of value for farmers by adding to our efforts to reduce  measure and monetize emission reductions  including Experior™  Uplook™ and Athian. We are eager to work with regulators to bring a unique innovation like DSM’s Bovaer® to the U.S. market as quickly as possible to support farmers and positively impact the climate crisis.”Geraldine Matchett and Dimitri de Vreeze  Co-CEOs of Royal DSM  commented: “ This agreement marks an important milestone for DSM  Elanco  and the climate change mitigation efforts of the U.S. We believe Elanco  as a company that shares our determination to revolutionize the sustainability of the cattle industry  is the ideal partner to help us increase and accelerate the total impact of our game-changing feed additive by bringing us closer to customers across the U.S. This alliance will help us realize Bovaer®’s potential as a powerful solution with a significantly positive impact on the planet. In addition  and fully aligned with our purpose-led performance-driven strategy  the alliance enables us as DSM to monetize our long-term innovation faster.”With an estimated global market opportunity for livestock methane reduction of $1 billion to $2 billion  Elanco expects Bovaer® to have blockbuster annual revenue potential in excess of US$200 million in the U.S. market with initial contribution by mid-decade. This alliance is not expected to impact Elanco’s previously stated financial commitments.ABOUT ELANCOElanco Animal Health Incorporated (NYSE: ELAN) is a global leader in animal health dedicated to innovating and delivering products and services to prevent and treat disease in farm animals and pets  creating value for farmers  pet owners  veterinarians  stakeholders  and society as a whole.

Albeit negative  revenue growth at constant currency improved sequentially  driven by an improvement in our Tech Foundations business while Digital and Cybersecurity remained well into positive territory.Atos actively laid the foundations of its transformation  with the swift adaptation of its governance under the helm of a strengthened senior executive team  while continuing to capitalize on its core expertise. Gartner recently ranked Atos the new number one company in managed security services worldwide. We also unveiled our new exascale-class BullSequana supercomputer  bolstering our position as the undisputed European leader in supercomputing.We continued to press ahead with large-scale recruitment in our growth activities and exceeded our Q1 target with 8 200 gross new hires  mainly in offshore and nearshore locations.These are encouraging signs that the Group is starting to reap the benefits of the energetic turnaround plan engaged since the beginning of the year. I am confident that we are taking the right steps to position Atos on a long-term value creation path.”Q1 2022 revenue: -0.6% at constant currency  -2.4% organicallyAtos’ consolidated revenue was € 2 747 million in Q1 2022  up +2.1% on a reported basis  and down -0.6% at constant currency. On an organic basis  revenue decreased by -2.4%. Q1 2022 showed a significant sequential improvement compared to Q4 2021  where revenue contracted -5.4% at constant currency and -6.9% organically excluding the impact of the UK BPO contract reassessment.Story continuesThe acquisition of Cloudreach was finalized on January 3rd  leading to full consolidation and reporting under the Americas as well as Northern Europe & APAC regions since that date. In total  acquisitions contributed +1.7% to the Group’s revenue growth. Foreign exchange contributed +2.7%  mainly reflecting the appreciation of the American Dollar and the Pound Sterling against the Euro over the period.Q1 2022 revenue by Regional Business UnitUnder Atos’ new simplified governance  regional business units have been modified. The table below presents pro forma figures for Q1 2021 at constant currency. A reconciliation between former regional business units and the new ones is presented in the appendix of this press release.In € million Q1 2022 Q1 2021* Change at constant currency Americas 647 637 +1.5% Northern Europe & APAC 821 841 -2.3% Central Europe 617 629 -1.8% Southern Europe 601 607 -1.0% Rest of the World 60 51 +18.3% Total 2 747 2 765 -0.6% * At constant currencyAmericas revenue grew by +1.5% at constant currency  driven by the contribution of recent acquisitions in multi-cloud services (Cloudreach) and in product lifecycle management (Processia). Growth in Digital activities  in particular with the ramp-up of a large contract in Healthcare & Life Sciences  was offset by a decrease in Unified Communication & Collaboration activities.Northern Europe & APAC revenue decreased by -2.3% at constant currency. Strong business growth in Manufacturing and Healthcare & Life Sciences was offset by a decrease in other industries  especially Telecom  Media & Technology  which suffered from a volume reduction in its “lab as a service” activity  and in Financial Services & Insurance  following the reassessment of the large BPO contract in Q4 2021  which effect was mitigated by the ramp up of other contracts.Central Europe revenue decreased by -1.8% at constant currency  driven by a significant decrease in Telecom  Media & Technology due to the ramp down of contracts with two large telecom customers. Most of the other industries delivered growth  in particular Resources & Services with the start of new contracts for a global foodservice retailer and a leading logistic company.Southern Europe revenue decreased by -1.0% at constant currency. The situation was contrasted across industries  with strong growth in Healthcare & Life Sciences’ digital activities  as well as in Manufacturing  driven by the ramp-up of a large automotive contract and the catch up on High-Performance Computing deals that slipped from 2021 to 2022. Conversely  revenue decreased in Public Sector & Defense due to lower High-Performance Computing sales  in Financial Services & Insurance due to the termination of a contract with a major Spanish bank  and in Telecom  Media & Technology  due to lower hardware and software resale.Rest of the World revenue grew strongly  by +18.3% at constant currency  supported by business related to the Beijing Olympics and a strong growth across most industries.Q1 2022 revenue by IndustryThe situation was contrasted across Industries with Manufacturing  Resources & Services and Healthcare & Lifesciences recording growth  while revenue decreased in Financial Services & Insurance  Public Sector & Defense and Telecom  Media & Technology.In € million Q1 2022 Q1 2021* Change at constant currency Manufacturing 521 494 +5.6% Financial Services & Insurance 539 563 -4.3% Public Sector & Defense 573 589 -2.7% Telecom  Media & Technology 347 386 -10.1% Resources & Services 412 406 +1.6% Healthcare & Life Sciences 355 327 +8.4% Total 2 747 2 765 -0.6% * At constant currencyManufacturing revenue grew by +5.6% at constant currency  rebounding from a low Q1 2021  supported by the acquisition of Processia in June 2021 and by increased volumes in the cloud computing sector.Financial Services & Insurance revenue decreased by -4.3% at constant currency  following the reassessment of the large BPO contract conducted in Q4 2021  and the termination of a contract with a major Spanish Bank.Public Sector & Defense revenue decreased by -2.7% at constant currency  due to lower High-Performance Computing sales and the ramp-down of digital workplace projects with a US State.In Telecom  Media & Technology  revenue contracted by -10.1% at constant currency  driven by a volume reduction in the “lab as a service” activity  as well as contracts ramp-down in telecoms.Resources & Services revenue grew by +1.6% at constant currency as solid growth in transport & logistics compensated a decrease in the energy sector.Healthcare & Life Sciences posted a strong +8.4% growth at constant currency  with solid growth in most regions.Commercial activityOrder entry was € 2.0 billion in Q1 2022  representing a book to bill ratio of 72%  compared to 96% in Q1 2021. This low level is not representative of revenue trends expected for the balance of the year  as it is primarily the reflect of (i) the timing of contract renewals  as significant renewals took place in prior quarters  including in Q1 2021 and (ii) a decrease in the average duration of new contracts.Full backlog was € 23.3 billion  decreasing by € 0.7 billion at constant currency compared to the end of 2021 and representing 2.1 years of revenue. The full qualified pipeline reached € 6.9 billion  broadly stable compared to the end of 2021 at constant currency.Human resourcesTotal headcount stood at 111 355 at the end of March 2022  up +2.0% compared to 109 135 at the end of December 2021 (+1.4% organically).In the first quarter of 2022  Atos hired 8 234 new employees (gross) mainly in Digital and BDS  and predominantly in offshore and nearshore countries  and welcomed Cloudreach’s 742 employees.2022 full-year objectives confirmedAtos confirms its 2022 full-year objectives and reiterates that its performance will be back-end loaded towards the second half of the year.While the first half of the year will be impacted by the continued decline in classic IT services  combined with personnel cost inflation and supply chain tensions  we target an improvement in the second half  with revenue growth at constant currency turning positive  and an uptick in operating margin.

US based Wenger is a global leader in processing solutions focused on pet food  alternative protein and aqua feed and has around 500 employees and ~USD 190m in annual revenues. The USD 540m acquisition of Wenger is a platform investment into new and attractive growth markets for Marel and will form a fourth business segment for the Marel brand  in addition to the current full-line offering for poultry  meat and fish. Pro forma leverage expected to be around 3x net debt / EBITDA.Acquisition of Sleegers Technique announced on 22 April 2022. With 27 FTEs and revenues of ~EUR 5m  Sleegers is a Dutch provider of interleaving  stacking  loading  and slicing solutions. Complimentary product offering and strategic fit with case-ready products within plant-based proteins  as well as poultry  meat and fish.Story continuesÁrni Oddur Thórdarson  CEO“We have delivered yet another record quarter in orders received of EUR 422 million. Our pioneering solutions and our decisive decision to ramp up the sales and service coverage ahead of the growth curve is clearly bearing fruits in strengthening our market position  while short-term it is increasing the operating cost as a proportion of revenues.It is interesting to see how fast the investment appetite by our poultry and fish customers is increasing. In an inflationary environment  those segments can provide excellent consumer ready food at favorable feed conversion rates. Furthermore  while mobility increases  sushi is clearly back on the menu. We are seeing significant organic increase in order intake in the fish segment  with strong order intake in the poultry segment while the meat segment is stable between quarters.Revenues are at EUR 372 million  a slight increase between quarters and 11% increase between years. While we were targeting higher revenue levels  the year started slowly impacted by absenteeism and disrupted flows in the value chain  but ramped up gradually throughout the quarter. Operational results are hampered with 8.4% EBIT margins. Cash flow remains strong. We are taking action to clarify accountability  improve the flow and increase the speed. Additionally  we have implemented dynamic pricing adjustments in the recent two quarters that will counterbalance inflation although it takes time to filter through. We will gradually ramp up revenues throughout the year that support better cost coverage and stronger operational results. We stay firm on our target to reach a run rate of 16% EBIT before year-end 2023.We are thrilled to announce the agreement to acquire Wenger  a US-based company with 500 employees and ~USD 190 million in annual revenues and good profitability. Marel and Wenger have a shared passion to transform the way food is processed through innovation in close partnerships with customers. This platform acquisition will form the fourth segment in our business model  in addition to our full-line offering for the poultry  meat and fish industries. This is a decisive step into the plant-based protein industry where the addressable market is forecast to grow at a rate of 15-20% annually. Consumers are demanding a healthy and balanced diet where proteins  animal and plant-based  will be at the center of the plate. Additionally  Wenger is a leading global provider of solutions to the sizeable pet food industry and has a strong foothold in the aquafeed industry.On a pro-forma basis  this new business segment accounts for around 10% of Marel’s total revenues and 12% of combined EBITDA. Leverage following completion of the acquisition is estimated at close to 3x net debt/EBITDA. Based on our strong financials  robust cash flow and organizational readiness  our continued focus is on strategic moves that support our 2026 growth targets.”Financial performanceStrong start to the year following record orders in 2021Orders received in the quarter were EUR 421.7m up 5.2% QoQ and 14.2% YoY (4Q21: 400.7m  1Q21: 369.4m)  with strong orders across all industries and all processing stages benefiting from structural volume growth in the industry.Good product mix with clear step up in sales of standard consumer-ready solutions and continued momentum in aftermarket.Megatrends such as increased need for automation and digitalization CAPEX in food processing are ongoing  accelerated by the pandemic and increased geopolitical tensions. Coupled with rising commodity prices  labor scarcity  and increased focus from consumers and regulators on sustainability in food production  the demand for Marel’s pioneering solutions is on the rise evidenced by record orders received and a very strong pipeline.M&A continues to stimulate organic growth and accelerate the innovation roadmap. Recent bolt-on acquisitions in the fish sector have positively contributed to record orders received for Marel Fish in the quarter where a broader product portfolio following recent acquisitions was key.Order book at a high levelThe order book at end of March was EUR 619.1m  up 8.8% QoQ and 36.0% YoY (4Q21: 569.0m  1Q21: 455.3m)  representing 44.3% of 12-month trailing revenues.The book-to-bill ratio in the quarter was 1.13  compared to an average of 1.11 in the past four quarters (2Q21-1Q22)  and the fifth consecutive quarter where book-to-bill is around 1.10.Revenues rose to EUR 372m with 40% recurring aftermarket revenues contributing to earnings resilienceRevenues totaled EUR 371.6m  up 1.1% QoQ and 11.3% YoY (4Q21: 367.4m  1Q21: 334.0m).Revenues were below expectations mainly due to inefficiencies in availability of parts and absenteeism at an all time high in the quarter  resulting in slower throughput and installation and thus revenue recognition  especially in the first two months of the year.Marel is targeting further step-up in revenue growth in 2H22 and into 2023 on the back of a high order book and strong pipeline.Resilience of earnings supported by aftermarket revenues  comprised of services and spare parts  at 40% of total revenues in the quarter (4Q21: 40%  1Q21: 39%). Spare parts were at a record level for the third sequential quarter  continued full focus on strengthening the spare parts delivery model and shortening lead times.Price increases coupled with volume upside will support margin improvementGross profit margin was 36.1% in the quarter (4Q21: 35.9%  1Q21: 37.2%) and gross profit was EUR 134.0m (4Q21: 131.9m  1Q21: 124.4m)  impacted by array of headwinds  inflationary environment  and general inefficiencies due to supply chain pressures  bottlenecks and pandemic-related absenteeism peaking in early 2022.It is expected that cost pressures from global supply chain  logistics and inflation will continue to have an impact on operational results in 2022  thereafter returning to more normalized levels.Continued focus on mitigating actions to offset cost inflation and parts availability  e.g. improving flexibility of operations and dynamic value-based pricing. Marel has actively raised prices in the last two quarters  while orders and pipeline build up continues on a strong note. Time lag in cost/revenue development varies somewhat depending on business mix  where aftermarket takes on average 6-8 weeks to price through  standard equipment between 3-6 months and larger projects on average 9-12 months.Continued investment to transform spare parts handling with focus on investments in fulfillment centers and digitizing and automating the end-to-end parts handling to ensure shorter lead times. A new and digitalized global distribution center will be located in Eindhoven  strategically located close to Marel’s major distribution partners.Step up in revenues to provide better cost coverageSG&A of 21.5% (4Q21: 19.2%  1Q21: 19.7%)  compared to the mid-term YE23 target of 18.0%. SG&A is temporarily higher and better cost coverage will be reached through more volume.Sales and marketing (S&M) costs were at a level of 13.8% of revenues in 1Q22 (4Q21: 12.4%  1Q21: 12.0%)  compared to 12.2% of orders received  and reflect the customer activity and step up in market coverage  which has started to translate into increased orders.Travel for customer visits and exhibitions on the rise as restrictions are lifted  focus on maintaining cost efficiencies from new ways of working  but expecting high customer activity with key upcoming trade exhibitions taking place in Q1 and Q2.General administrative (G&A) costs were 7.7% of revenues (4Q21: 6.8%  1Q21: 7.7%)  with important transformative initiatives ongoing to support YE23 targets aimed at lowering G&A costs.Innovation costs at 6.1% (4Q21: 5.5%  1Q21: 6.2%).Marel does not adjust results for non-recurring costs  except for PPA and acquisition related costs.Continued focus on improved EBIT marginEBIT1 was EUR 31.3m (4Q21: 41.0m  1Q21: 38.0m)  translating to an EBIT1 margin in the quarter of 8.4% (4Q21: 11.2%  1Q21: 11.4%).EBIT margin in the quarter was colored by continued external margin pressures on gross profit from supply chain challenges  geopolitics and absenteeism at an all time high  in addition to higher operating expenses as a result of step up in market coverage and infrastructure initiatives to increase speed and agility.Strong orders received across all industries and processing stages will increase volume with foreseen more favorable industry mix  resulting in better cost coverage and higher operating profits.Management continues to target medium and long-term EBIT margin expansion for all industries. In the short term however  higher costs and non-recurring costs will continue to put pressure on margins in 2Q22.Group margin improvement expected in 2H22 with full focus to reach YE23 financial targets of 16% EBIT margin.Robust cash flow conversionOperating cash flow was EUR 32.7m in the quarter (4Q21: 54.5m  1Q21: 60.2m). Operating cash flow before inventory buildup at healthy level.Strong balance sheet used to mitigate supply chain challenges  inventory buildup of EUR 27.6m in the quarter  tying up capital and cash flow  to ensure timely delivery of equipment and spare parts to customers.Cash capital expenditures (Cash CAPEX) excluding R&D investments are expected to increase to on average 4-5% of revenues in 2021-2026  thereafter  returning to more normalized levels.Cash CAPEX excluding R&D investments in 1Q22 were EUR 7.7m (4Q21: 25.0m  1Q21: 6.8m).Free cash flow was EUR 14.6m in the quarter (4Q21: 15.8m  1Q21: 45.5m). Free cash flow in the quarter was impacted by inventory buildup  negative development in working capital and higher trade debtors.Full acquisition of fish processing solutions provider Curio announced and completed on 1 February 2022  where the additional 50.0% of the share capital of Curio was acquired for an investment of EUR 15.9m  bringing Marel’s total share of Curio to 100%.Strong cash conversion supports continued investments in innovation  infrastructure and strategic inventory buildup when needed.Strong balance sheet and robust financial position to support the 2017-2016 growth strategyLeverage was 1.2x at the end of 1Q22 (4Q21: 1.0x  1Q21: 0.8x)  well below the targeted capital structure of 2-3x.Committed liquidity of EUR 622.1m at the end of 1Q22  including fully committed all-senior funding in place until 2025.The strong financial position enables continued investment and will facilitate future strategic moves in the ongoing industry consolidation wave  in line with the company’s 2017-2026 growth strategy.As a subsequent event  Marel has announced the agreement to acquire Wenger on 27 April and the acquisition of Sleegers on 22 April.

Mitigation actions in place and order book targeted to convert faster into revenues in coming quartersEBIT1 margin in 1Q22 was -2.3% (4Q21: 4.6%  1Q21: 5.3%). Temporary decline in margins mainly due to less revenues against cost. Additionally  integration costs of newly acquired companies are not adjusted and impacting financial performance in 1Q22.

The audit has been carried out and the audit report relating to the certification of the accounts is available on Solutions 30’s website. The audit procedures are detailed at the end of the press release.Gianbeppi Fortis  Chairman of the Management Board of Solutions 30  states:“After the disruptions of the pandemic and of successive lockdowns in 2020 that helped to drive our telecoms activity in France  2021 saw a return to more normative levels of growth in this mature market segment for France  as well as supply chain difficulties and strong growth in the Benelux and Italy.France and Spain were some of the first European countries to roll out ultra-fast Internet networks. Today  other countries are also beginning to deploy their fiber-optic networks. In such a context  the group will take advantage of these growth opportunities everywhere it operates. This can already be seen in the first contracts signed in Italy and in the Benelux in 2021.We have thus begun to duplicate the success of our model in France.Over the coming months  the most important challenge will be to seize these growth opportunities throughout Europe and to put the tools  processes  and teams in place to ensure that this growth takes place in the right conditions  just as we did in France between 2015 and 2020.Story continuesWhile the negotiation and implementation phases of these new major contracts are having periodic negative effects on profitability  with our experience  our expertise  and our solid financial structure  we will make it through this learning curve and scale up our processes to quickly bring our margins up into the double digits.At the same time  in both France and Spain  we will need to consolidate our position in the more mature telecoms roll-out market and to increase our market share in fiber-optic network maintenance  electric mobility  energy savings  and renewable energy. This requires updating our tools and services  as we did in 2021  and will continue to do throughout 2022.The group is on the verge of a new period of growth  which should begin to show more clearly in the second half of 2022.All our teams are ready  composed  and confident going into this new growth phase  thanks to the work we’ve done to improve governance  compliance  and risk management  and our proven know-how.”Key figures – Consolidated dataIn millions of euros 12/31/2021 12/31/2020 Change Revenue 874.0 819.3 6.7% Operating margin (Adjusted EBITDA) 82.4 106.5 -22.7% As a % of revenue 9.4% 13.0% Adjusted EBIT(1) 40 8 60.9 -32.9% As a % of revenue 4.7% 7.4% Operating income (EBIT) 12 9 48.3 -73% As a % of revenue 1.5% 5.9% Consolidated net income 22.5 35.8 -37.3% As a % of revenue 2.6% 4.4% Net income  group share 21.5 34.5 -37.7% As a % of revenue 2.5% 4.2% Free cash flow(1) 32.4 124.8 - 92.4 Financial structure figures 12/31/2021 12/31/2020 Change Equity 191.6 170.0 +21.5 Net debt 33.1 28.9 +4.1 Net bank debt(1) - 52.3 - 59.2 +6.9(1) See glossary at the end of this documentActivityFor 2021  Solutions 30 posted revenue of €874.0 million compared to €819.3 million for 2020  representing growth of +6.7% (+3.6% organic growth) compared to 2020 and +26.4% compared to 2019  before the pandemic.After solid initial growth of 20.9% in the first half of the year  the second half of the year stood in sharp contrast:A mature market in France  which is returning to normal after a highly unusual 2020  with growth drivers (energy transition  5G) scaling up less quickly than forecasted due to supply chain issues.The end-of-year impact of high rates of quarantine-related absences due to more contagious variants  despite the continued use of prevention measures and procedures to protect the health of our employees and our customers.Strong sales momentum in other countries where we operate  with higher and higher growth rates masking the effects of supply chain disruptions. There are new opportunities cropping up everywhere  driven by unprecedented recovery plans. The Benelux and other countries are now driving the group’s growth  with revenue up 17.7% and 28.7% respectively.ProfitabilityAdjusted EBITDA was €82.4 million at the end of December 2021  down 23% compared to 2020.Operating costs increased by +4.1 percentage points compared to 2020 and represented 81.3% of revenue  compared to 77.2% a year earlier  while the burden of structural costs fell to 9.3% of revenue compared with 9.8% in 2020.The operating margin stood at 9.4% of revenue  compared to 13.0% one year earlier.Besides less absorption of fixed costs due to falling revenue in France and a changing geographic mix to focus on activities that have yet to reach a critical size  this decrease can be explained by:Effects from the COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain disruptions for €4 millionEvolving business needs and the operational transition needed to adapt and to develop new activities in France for €6.7 millionOngoing and upcoming ramp-up initiatives  especially for new businesses and countries that have not reached their critical size for €9.8 millionRemoving these factors  the EBITDA margin amounts to 11.8%  a decrease of only 120 basis points.The start-up phases of important contracts—which is currently the case in the Benelux and Italy—require the creation of new organizational structures and more robust processes  the adoption of new IT tools  and new trainings for on-site teams. Solutions 30 is making the most of the expertise it has built up in France to shorten this investment phase  although it is an essential step for improving profitability before the industrial phase begins.After accounting for €16.2 million in impairments and operational provisions  and after amortizing the usage rights for leased assets (IFRS 16)  worth €25.3 million  adjusted EBIT stood at €40.8 million  a 32.9% decrease compared to the previous year.2021 saw €13.3 million in non-current operating expenses  including €7.1 million in group spending to combat an aggressive smear campaign. The remaining balance came from restructuring operations to adapt our organizational structure to changes in the market  especially in Germany and France.Customer relationship amortization amounted to €14.7 million in 2021  compared to €13.0 million a year earlier.Financial income rose to €4.2 million in profit  from the (downward) adjustment of contingent consideration (earnout) values for €6.4 million  compared to an expense of €4.1 million in 2020.After including tax income of €5.4 million due to loss carryforwards  compared to an expense of €8.4 million a year earlier  the group share of net income amounted to €21.5 million  compared to €34.5 million in 2020.Financial structureAt December 31  2021  the group had €191.6 million in equity  compared to €170.0 million at December 31  2020. The group had €129.8 million in gross cash  compared to €159.3 million at the end of December 2020. Gross bank debt stood at €77.5 million  compared to €100.0 million on December 31  2020  due to scheduled debt repayments. The group had €52.3 million in cash net of debt at the end of December 2021  compared to €59.2 million at the end of December 2020.Including €66.6 million in leasing liabilities (IFRS 16) and €18.8 million in potential financial debt on future call options and earnouts  the group has a total net debt of €33.1 million  compared to €28.9 a year earlier. The group maintains a solid financial structure  with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 40% and a net debt-to-equity ratio of 17.3%.Outstanding receivables under the group’s non-recourse factoring program amounted to €92.3 million on December 31  2021  compared to €94 million on December 31  2020. This program finances working capital requirements from recurring activities that are fully developed.The use of factoring frees up the cash generated by these receivables to finance the group’s growth strategy  specifically the ramp-up of new contracts  at a cost of less than 1% of the amount of assigned receivables. This program  combined with a solid financial structure  provides Solutions 30 with the resources it needs to finance its ambitious growth strategy.Operating cash flow amounted to €60.8 million  compared to €89.0 million in 2020. The ramp-up of contracts and the return to more normal payment terms than in 2020 resulted in a €13.3 million increase in working capital requirements  which are negative at €25.0 million.Cash flow from business activities stood at €47.5 million in 2021  compared to €136.8 million a year earlier  and net investments reached €15.1 million  or 1.7% of revenue  compared to 1.4% a year earlier. This falls within a normal range  generally considered to be between 1.5% and 4% of revenue  and goes mostly to investing in the group’s IT infrastructure and technical equipment. Overall  this means there was €32.4 million in free cash flow  compared to €124.8 million in 2020.Data by segment2021 2020 Change France Revenue 507.3 522.7 -2.9% EBITDA 66.4 86.6 -23.3% % 13.1% 16.6% Benelux Revenue 160.4 136.3 17.7% EBITDA 22.9 21.4 7.0% % 14.3% 15.7% Other countries Revenue 206.3 160.2 28.8% EBITDA 2.2 7.6 -71.1% % 1.1% 4.8%In France  revenue came to €507.3 million at December 31  2021  compared to €522.7 million a year earlier. After peaking in the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021  the telecom business returned to normal levels in this more mature ultra-fast Internet market. By the end of December 2021  29.7 million locations were eligible for a fiber connection  for a total coverage rate of 70%  and the country already has 14.5 million fiber subscribers  i.e. 48% of eligible households or 34% of all locations. At the same time that the roll-out of smart electricity meters is winding down  the growth of other market segments connected to the energy transition has slowed due to periodic disruptions in the supply chain. A decrease in revenue in the second half of the year ate into profits in France  which will need to adapt to this new context. For these reasons  adjusted EBITDA reached €66.45 million  for a margin of 13.1%  compared to 16.6% a year earlier. Changing activity levels and preparations for launching new businesses reduced EBITDA by €6.7 million  while supply chain delays decreased it by another €1.1 million.In the Benelux  revenue reached €160.4 million  up +17.7% (+14.3% organic growth). The group is entering a high-growth phase in Belgium and the Netherlands  in both its telecoms and energy businesses. The installation of smart meters for the energy company Fluvius began at the start of the year and is continuing at a rapid pace. As for telecoms  previously signed contracts for rolling out ultra-fast Internet are now entering the production phase. As explained above  such ramp-up phases may periodically impact group profitability. Thus  adjusted EBITDA was €22.9 million  for a margin of 14.3%  compared to 15.7% a year earlier.In other countries  Solutions 30’s revenue stood at €206.3 million for 2021  an increase of 28.7% (+15.6% organic growth).In Germany  2021 revenue amounted to €63.3 million compared to €67.2 million the previous year.In Italy  revenue grew by 70% (55% like-for-like) in 2021  reaching €46.8 million  and will continue to be driven by the contract we signed with TIM at the beginning of the year.In Spain  the group generated revenue of €53.1 million  with purely organic growth of 36.0%.In Poland  revenue remained stable  at €24.9 million.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions 30 generated €18.2 million in revenue for 2021.Adjusted EBITDA was €2.2 million  equivalent to 1.1% of revenue  compared with 4.8% a year earlier. This reflects the start-up of a contract signed in Italy  the integration of acquisitions made in the United Kingdom  and the reorganization initiative in Germany to make the most of expected growth in the telecoms sector in the second half of 2022.Q1 2022 revenue:In millions of euros Q1 2022 Q12021 % change Total 222.7 225.2 -1.1% From France 116.7 142.1 -17.9% From Benelux 46.7 37.0 +26.3% From other countries 59.3 46.1 +28.5%Solutions 30’s consolidated revenue for the first quarter of 2022 amounted to €222.7 million  down slightly (1.1%) compared to the same period in 2021 (down (3.0%) organically).The first quarter is a continuation of the last quarter 2021 with:On the one hand  activity in France penalized by the triple effect of maturing markets  supply chain difficulties  and the high rate of quarantined technicians  especially at the beginning of the year  due to the pandemic.On the other hand  business is growing strongly in the rest of the countries and this positive trend is masking supply chain disruptions and the impact of the pandemic.In France  revenue for the first quarter of 2022 amounted to €116.7 million compared to €142.1 million a year ago.With €84.5 million in revenue  the telecom business is down by 18% compared to the first quarter of 2021. The market is in the midst of an operational transition as fiber roll-out has peaked and the market for new subscriber connections is under consolidation after being driven by widespread remote working and measures to limit social interactions. These two market conditions are still only partially compensated by maintenance activities.For the energy business  revenue stood at €15.9 million  compared to €23.3 million the previous year  a decrease of 32%. The business has been strongly impacted by the end of smart electricity meter roll-outs in France  revenue from which is down by 60%. Other activities  related to electric mobility and renewable energies  are not yet compensating for this decrease in revenue. They are growing by 8%  but their ramp-up remains delayed by current supply chain problems.The IT business posted revenue of €11.9 million  up 8% for the quarter  while the security and payments business generated €4.4 million in revenue  compared to €4.6 million a year earlier.In the Benelux  revenue in the first quarter of 2022 amounted to €46.7 million compared to €37.0 million a year earlier  up 26.3% (26.6% organic growth).The telecoms business  which grew organically by 14%  generated quarterly revenue of €33.0 million. Sales activity remains strong and the first roll-outs began with the start-up of contracts signed with Fiberklaar and Open Dutch Fiber in the second half of 2021.Revenue for the energy business amounted to €9.6 million  compared with €3.9 million a year earlier  representing purely organic growth of 145%. The deployment of smart meters in Flanders on behalf of Fluvius began during the first quarter of 2021 and is now fully developed.Revenue from the IT business remained stable at €2.3 million  compared with €2.4 million a year earlier. Quarterly revenue from the retail and security businesses was €1.9 million compared to €1.7 million for the first quarter of 2021.In all other countries  the group posted annual revenue of €59.3 million  an increase of 29% (19% organic growth) compared to the same period in 2021.In Germany  revenue amounted to €14.4 million compared to €16.2 million the previous year. The return to growth is expected in the second half of 2022  when the efforts made by the group to adapt its organization should begin to bear fruit.In Italy  revenue grew by 67% in the first quarter of 2022 to €14.6 million  driven by the contract signed at the beginning of the year with TIM to deploy its ultra-fast infrastructure in Piedmont and the Aosta Valley.In Spain  revenue grew organically by 24% to €14.5 million  thanks to strong momentum in the telecoms business (fiber and 5G mobile networks).In Poland  the group confirmed its return to growth and posted revenue of €6.7 million  representing organic growth of 19%.Finally  in the United Kingdom  Solutions 30 posted quarterly revenue of €9.0 million  up 131% (23% organic growth)  thanks to the excellent momentum in the telecoms sector and the start-up of new ultra-fast Internet and 5G deployment programs.OutlookIn 2021  Solutions 30 announced that it would be accelerating the improvement plan it began in 2019  which has already seen concrete progress  including the adoption of IFRS in 2019  the transfer of company shares to a regulated exchange  and enhanced governance. As part of these actions to support its strong growth  Solutions 30 created a transformation plan with the goal of improving and harmonizing governance  risk management  and compliance procedures.This project has led to (i) a review of the existing group policies and procedures  (ii) gap analysis against applicable laws and regulations  (iii) interviews with the management teams of Solutions 30 and its subsidiaries  and (iv) consolidation and analysis of the information gathered in the above-mentioned steps to define areas for improving governance  risk management  and compliance. Six workstreams have been identifiedUniform third parties’ due diligence processes Uniform risk mitigation procedures and enhanced internal control Revised code of conduct Improve whistleblower processes Training Definition of disciplinary actionsNew procedures and policies were defined and harmonized throughout 2021 and the beginning of 2022. They are being implemented gradually over the first half of 2022.Solutions 30 is thus opening a new chapter in its growth in markets that  no matter their maturity  have significant potential for growth and are supported by unprecedented stimulus plans that are channeling public investment into the digital transformation and energy transition.With a solid financial structure and a business model that allows it to self-fund its growth  Solutions 30’s priority this year will be increasing its market share. We are therefore expecting a new period of dynamic growth starting in the second half of the year  while the first half of the year will more closely resemble the second half of 2021. The group should also be able to return to a more active acquisitions policy than over the last two years  helping to drive growth.Audit proceduresConsidering that the previous auditor was unable to express an opinion on Solutions 30’s consolidated financial statements at 12/31/2020  the group’s new auditor  PKF Audit & Conseil  carried out in-depth due diligence on the opening balance sheet at January 1  2021  in accordance with professional standards.This work included:A detailed review and analysis of the findings of independent investigations conducted by Deloitte and Didier Kling Expertises & Conseil in the first half of 2021. A review of the various items in the opening balance sheet and the performance of additional due diligence if deemed necessary. A review of measures Solutions 30 put into place in 2021  especially in terms of risk management and internal control.The analysis of the opening balance sheet did not reveal any anomalies.As the previous auditor was unable to express an opinion on the group’s annual consolidated financial statements at 12/31/2020  PKF’s audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements of the group for the year ended December 31  2021 includes  in accordance with IAS 710  a technical reservation relating to the comparability of the figures in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income with the corresponding figures of the previous year.Subject to this qualification  upon completion of the audit of the 2021 annual accounts  PKF Audit & Conseil confirms that the consolidated financial statements present fairly  in all material respects  the financial position of the group at December 31  2021  and its consolidated financial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the year then ended  in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union.Upcoming eventHY1 2022 revenue July 27  2022About Solutions 30 SEThe Solutions 30 group is the European leader in solutions for new technologies.

Revenue results were well aligned with our objectives. License and other software revenue grew double digits  during the period. At the same time  we delivered strong profitability  demonstrating the strength of our business model and excellent performance by our team. This supports our confidence to raise our 2022 EPS objective to 9-11% year-over-year growth.From a profitability perspective  we outperformed our objectives during the quarter  even as we continued to invest in our business and achieved our hiring objectives. Diluted EPS grew 20% to €0.27. Operating margin increased 117 basis points to 35%. Cash flow from operations was €630 million. We remain well ahead of schedule in achieving our deleveraging objective.”Looking to the second quarter of 2022  we are targeting total revenue growth of 9%-11%  and diluted EPS growth of 11%-16% to €0.24 to €0.25. For fiscal 2022  we are reaffirming our total revenue growth objective of 9%-10%  in constant currencies. At the same time  we are raising our diluted EPS objective to 9%-11% growth to €1.04 to €1.06  offsetting the negative impact of Russia while reflecting currency and operating performance.”Financial Objectives for 2022Dassault Systèmes’ second quarter and full year 2022 financial objectives presented below are given on a non-IFRS basis and reflect the principal 2022 currency exchange rate assumptions for the US dollar and Japanese yen as well as the potential impact from additional non-Euro currencies:Q2 2022 FY 2022 Total Revenue (billion) €1.295 to €1.320 €5.355 to €5.405 Growth 12-14% 10-11% Growth ex FX 9-11% 9-10% Software revenue growth * 9-11% 9-10% Of which licenses and other software revenue growth * 14-19% 10-12% Of which subscription and support revenue growth * 8-9% ~9% Services revenue growth * 9-11% 8-10% Operating Margin 31.7% – 32.4% 33.4% – 33.7% EPS Diluted €0.24 - €0.25 €1.04 - €1.06 Growth 11-16% 9-11% US dollar $1.15 per Euro $1.14 per Euro Japanese yen (before hedging) JPY 130.0 per Euro JPY 130.1 per Euro * Growth in Constant CurrenciesThese objectives are prepared and communicated only on a non-IFRS basis and are subject to the cautionary statement set forth below.The Russian invasion of Ukraine is above all a human tragedy. Dassault Systèmes has implemented all actions to suspend its business operations in Russia  which represent less than 0.5% of non-IFRS revenues in 2021.The 2022 non-IFRS financial objectives set forth above do not take into account the following accounting elements below and are estimated based upon the 2022 principal currency exchange rates above: no significant contract liabilities write-downs; share-based compensation expenses  including related social charges  estimated at approximately €148.7 million (these estimates do not include any new stock option or share grants issued after March 31  2022); amortization of acquired intangibles and of tangibles reevaluation  estimated at approximately €369.4 million  largely impacted by the acquisition of Medidata; and lease incentives of acquired companies at approximately €2.7 million. The above objectives also do not include any impact from other operating income and expenses  net principally comprised of acquisition  integration and restructuring expenses  and impairment of goodwill and acquired intangible assets; from one-time items included in financial revenue; from one-time tax effects; and from the income tax effects of these non-IFRS adjustments. Finally  these estimates do not include any new acquisitions or restructuring completed after March 31  2022.Corporate AnnouncementsToday’s Webcast and Conference Call InformationToday  Thursday  April 27  2022  Dassault Systèmes will host  from London  a webcasted presentation at 9:00 AM London Time/ 10:00 AM Paris time  and will then host a conference call at 9:00 AM New York time / 2:00 PM London time / 3:00 PM Paris time.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 17  2022  available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Economic Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2021 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within automotive  aerospace or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Systèmes’ business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;current inflation forecasts  as well as uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of this trend  could adversely affect the financial condition of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and geopolitical crises in particular – could have consequences for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.”In preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.15 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY130.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the second  third and fourth quarters 2022. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.14 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY130.1 to €1.00  before hedging for the full year 2022. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group’s results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations. It is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for IFRS measurements.

We believe it is helpful to evaluate our growth exclusive of currency impacts  particularly to help understand revenue trends in our business. Therefore  we provide percentage increases or decreases in our revenue and expenses (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values  particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen  relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed by us “in constant currencies”  the results of the “prior” period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year  and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.While constant currencies calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure  we do believe these measures are critical to understanding our global revenue results and to compare with many of our competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore  we are including this calculation for comparing IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods as well as for comparing non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All information at constant exchange rates are expressed as a rounded percentage and therefore may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.Information on Growth excluding acquisitions (“organic growth”)In addition to financial indicators on the entire Group’s scope  Dassault Systèmes provides growth excluding acquisitions effect  also named organic growth.The related growth rate was determined by restating the scope of activity as follows:for entities entering the consolidation scope in the current year  subtracting the contribution of the acquisition from the aggregates of the current year;for entities entering the consolidation scope in the previous year  subtracting the contribution of the acquisition from January 1st of the current year  until the last day of the month of the current year when the acquisition was made the previous year.Information on Industrial SectorsDassault Systèmes’ Industries develop Solution Experiences  industry-focused offerings that deliver specific value to companies and users in a particular industry. We serve eleven industries structured into three sectors:Manufacturing industries Sector : Transportation & Mobility; Aerospace & Defense; Marine & Offshore; Industrial Equipment; High-Tech; Home & Lifestyle; Consumer Packaged Goods & Retail;Life Sciences & Healthcare Sector : Life Sciences & Healthcare;Infrastructure & Cities Sector : Infrastructure  Energy & Materials; Architecture  Engineering & Construction; Cities  Public & Business Services.Information on Product LinesOur product lines financial reporting include the following financial information:Industrial Innovation software revenue  which includes our CATIA  ENOVIA  SIMULIA  DELMIA  GEOVIA  NETVIBES  and 3DEXCITE brands;Life Sciences software revenue  which includes our MEDIDATA and BIOVIA brands;Mainstream Innovation software sales for SMEs (small and medium-sized enterprises)  which includes our CENTRIC PLM and 3DVIA brands  as well as our 3DEXPERIENCE WORKS family which includes the SOLIDWORKS brand.3DEXPERIENCE Licenses and Software ContributionTo measure the progressive penetration of 3DEXPERIENCE software  we utilize the following ratios:for Licenses revenue  we calculate the percentage contribution by comparing total 3D EXPERIENCE Licenses revenue to Licenses revenue for all product lines except SOLIDWORKS and acquisitions (“related Licenses revenue”);for software revenue  the Group calculates the percentage contribution by comparing total 3DEXPERIENCE software revenue to software revenue for all product lines except SOLIDWORKS and acquisitions (“related software revenue”).Cloud RevenueCloud revenues correspond to revenue generated through a catalog of online services delivered by Dassault Systèmes via a cloud infrastructure hosted by Dassault Systèmes  or by third party providers of cloud computing infrastructure services.

Loss from continuing operations attributable to TechnipFMC was $42.3 million  or $0.09 per diluted share. These results included after-tax charges and credits totaling $29.3 million of expense  or $0.06 per share  which included the following (Exhibit 6):Impairment  restructuring and other charges of $0.8 million; andLoss from equity investment in Technip Energies of $28.5 million.Adjusted loss from continuing operations was $13 million  or $0.03 per diluted share (Exhibit 6).Adjusted EBITDA  which excludes pre-tax charges and credits  was $153.5 million; adjusted EBITDA margin was 9.9 percent (Exhibit 7). Included in adjusted EBITDA was a foreign exchange gain of $28.4 million.Doug Pferdehirt  Chair and CEO of TechnipFMC  stated  “ Looking at the first quarter  total Company revenue was $1.6 billion  with adjusted EBITDA of $154 million. Total Company inbound orders were $2.2 billion  driving sequential growth in backlog. With cash and cash equivalents totaling $1.2 billion and our confidence that we will generate strong free cash flow in the second half of the year  we are taking aggressive steps to further reduce debt in the second quarter. This is another important milestone on our path to shareholder distributions.”Pferdehirt continued  “ In Subsea  inbound orders of $1.9 billion increased more than 80 percent when compared to the fourth quarter  resulting in a book-to-bill of 1.5. We announced two awards in the period  including our first iEPCI™ project with Wintershall Dea for the Maria field. The breadth of operators and regional diversification was particularly notable in the quarter  with projects from more than 30 clients across all major offshore basins. We continue to anticipate Subsea order growth of up to 30 percent in 2022  with iEPCI™  direct awards and Subsea services together approaching 75 percent of total inbound.”“ Surface Technologies inbound orders were $291 million  with a book-to-bill above 1.0  driven by strength in the U.S. market. North American sales and profitability grew sequentially  driven by increased drilling and completion activity and an improved pricing environment. Outside of North America  we are investing in new manufacturing capacity in Saudi Arabia to support the strong Middle East outlook. We are now undergoing final production testing and expect final certification of the facility by the end of the second quarter  at which time we anticipate an acceleration of orders in-country. We remain confident in meeting our full-year expectations.”Pferdehirt added  “ First quarter results demonstrated our ability to effectively navigate the ongoing challenges facing the global supply chain. While not immune to the market dislocations  we have taken many strategic actions over the last several years that have mitigated the near-term effects on our Company. Our internal efforts to drive simplification  standardization and industrialization are also transforming our supply chain.”Pferdehirt concluded  “ We are in the midst of a multi-year upcycle for oil and gas investment. Our Subsea Opportunity List highlights this very robust market outlook  representing an opportunity set of larger projects that totals more than $20 billion in potential industry awards over the next 24 months. In the current environment  we are also experiencing improvements in pricing and contractual arrangements that more appropriately balance the terms and conditions needed to support this growth.”Operational and Financial HighlightsSubseaFinancial Highlights Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures are provided in financial schedules.

Net income  excluding charges and credits  as well as measures derived from it (including Diluted EPS  excluding charges and credits; Income before net interest expense and taxes  excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted Operating profit""); Depreciation and amortization  excluding charges and credits; Earnings before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  excluding charges and credits (""Adjusted EBITDA""); and net cash) are non-GAAP financial measures. Management believes that the exclusion of charges and credits from these financial measures enables investors and management to more effectively evaluate TechnipFMC's operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period  and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked or misleading to both investors and management by the excluded items. These measures are also used by management as performance measures in determining certain incentive compensation. The foregoing non-GAAP financial measures should be considered by investors in addition to  not as a substitute for or superior to  other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The following is a reconciliation of the most comparable financial measures under GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures.

The person appointed to verify the minutes shall  apart from approving the minutes of the general meeting together with the chairman of the general meeting  check the voting list and that the result of received votes are correctly reflected in the minutes of the general meeting.Item 7b): Resolution in respect of allocation of the company's profits or lossesThe board of directors proposes that the Company's accumulated profits shall be carried forward in new account and that no dividend shall be paid for the financial year 2021.Item 11: Resolution regarding authorization for the board of directors to increase the share capitalThe board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on an authorization for the board of directors to – for the period up to the next annual general meeting and at one or more occasions – resolve upon issuance of new shares  warrants and/or convertible debentures. Payment may be made in cash  in kind  through set-off of claims or otherwise be conditional. The Company's share capital may by support of the authorization be increased by an amount corresponding to 10 per cent of the share capital and number of shares in the Company as of on the date the board of directors make use of the authorization. Deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be allowed in situations where a directed issue is deemed more appropriate for the Company due to timing  commercial or similar reasons  and in order to enable acquisitions. The chairman of the board of directors  the CEO  or anyone authorized by the board of directors  shall have the right to make any minor adjustments required in order to register this resolution. For a valid decision on the proposal on an authorization for the board of directors  as outlined above  requires that the proposal is supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Item 12: Resolution on implementation of a long term incentive program in the form of employee stock options for senior executives and other key persons in the group including (i) a directed issue of warrants and (ii) approval of transfer (Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025);The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on implementation of a long-term incentive program (the ""Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025"") for senior executives and other key persons of the group (the ""Participants"") by way of granting employee stock options giving right to acquire new shares in the Company. Board members are not allowed to participate. The proposal also includes decision on a directed issue of warrants in order to enable delivery of shares under the program (if and to the extent the Company would like to effect delivery of shares by use of such warrants) and to cover potential cash flow effects from social security costs arising from employee stock option program  and approval of transfer of such warrants and/or shares on the terms and conditions set forth below.This proposal has been presented as the board of directors considers it important and in the interests of all shareholders to create involvement for senior executives and other key persons  including employees as well as consultants  in terms of the Company's and the group's development and ensure that these individuals share the goal of generating value-adding growth. It is also important to motivate continued employment and assignments. The board therefore proposes that the annual general meeting resolve as follows below.Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on implementation of the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 in accordance with the guidelines set forth below:1. The program shall consist of no more than 8 000 000 employee stock options to be allotted to the Participants free of charge.2. Each employee stock option confers the holder a right to acquire one (1) new share in the Company against cash consideration at an exercise price of SEK 4  corresponding to 288 % of the volume weighted average price of the latest 10 trading days (i.e. 13 April  2022 to 26 April  2022). The exercise price and the number of new shares that each employee stock option confers right to may be subject to recalculation by the corresponding application of the provisions in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants (see below).3. Notice of participation in the program shall have been received by the Company no later than 30 June 2022 with a right for the board of directors of the Company to prolong the time period. Allotment of employee stock options to Participants shall be made promptly after the expiration of the notification period.4. The employee stock options shall be offered the Participants in accordance with instructions from the board of directors of the Company and the following principles. The Participants right to employee stock options shall be differentiated with regard to position  responsibilities and performance in the group. Only those persons who are included in the categories below shall be offered employee stock options. The board of directors shall decide which persons that shall be deemed to be included in each category and which persons that shall receive employee stock options. In the event of re-calculation  the Participants in each category shall have the right to acquire the same number of employee stock options. Allotment of employee stock options to Participants outside Sweden shall - where applicable - be dependent on the tax effects  that there are no legal obstacles and that the board considers that such allotment can be made with reasonable administrative and financial resources.Category A – CEO: The CEO may be allotted a maximum of 1 930 700 employee stock options.Category B –Senior executives (approximately 4 individuals): participants in this category may be allotted a maximum of 3 089 200 employee stock options collectively and each participant in the category may be allotted a maximum of 772 300 employee stock options individually.Category C – Other key persons (approximately 12 individuals): participants in this category may be allotted a maximum of 2 980 100 employee stock options collectively and each participant may be allotted a maximum of 338 000 employee stock options individually.5. The employee stock options do not constitute securities and may not be transferred or pledged and may only be exercised for acquisition of new shares in the Company by the person to whom they have been granted.6. Alloted employee stock options shall be vested in three equal parts as of the date of each annual general meeting in the Company from 2023 to 2025 (i.e. approximately 33 per cent of the total number of employee stock options will be vested each year) and conditional on continued employment/assignments in the group  with reservation for the terms in the separate option agreements that shall be entered into between each Participant and the Company/Subsidiary.7. The holder may exercise allotted and vested employee stock options during the period from and including 1 July 2025 until and including 31 December 2025. The employee stock options may not be exercised for subscription of new shares during the so called ""closed periods"" according to the EUs Market Abuse Regulation  or otherwise in violation with applicable rules regarding insider information (including the Company's own guidelines in this regard).8. The employee stock options shall be governed by the more detailed terms and conditions set forth in ""Terms and Conditions for Employee Stock Options 2022/2025 in InDex Pharmaceuticals Holding AB (publ)""  in accordance with the board of directors' complete proposal  and separate agreements with each Participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 within the abovementioned substantial terms.Terms and conditions for the issue of warrantsTo enable the Company's delivery of shares under Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 and to cover any cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting of shareholders resolves on a directed issue of no more than 10 513 600 warrants  out of which 2 513 600 warrants are proposed to be issued to cover potential cash flow effects from social security costs arising from Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  according to the following terms.The Company shall issue no more than 10 513 600 warrants of series 2022/2025. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new share in the Company  each with a quotient value of SEK 0.02 . If all warrants are exercised for subscription of new shares  the Company's share capital will increase by SEK 210 272 (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with customary terms and conditions to be applicable in relation to the warrants). The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  only be subscribed for by the Company or its subsidiary InDex Pharmaceuticals AB  org. no. 556704-5140 (the ""Subsidiary""). The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable delivery of shares under Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  and to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025. The Company's/Subsidiary's subscription of the warrants shall be made on a special subscription list within five (5) calendar days from the date of the general meeting that resolves on the issue. The board of directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The warrants are issued without consideration (i.e. free of charge) to the Company/Subsidiary. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the period from and including the registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office until and including 31 March 2026 . Each warrant entitles to subscription for one (1) new share in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 4 per share (the ""Exercise Price""). Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account. Shares issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately following definite registration of the new shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the Company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. The warrants shall also be subject to the terms and conditions  inter alia containing customary recalculation conditions  set forth in the board of directors' complete proposal. The chairman of the board of directors  the CEO or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorised to make any minor adjustments required to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors further proposes that the general meeting of shareholders resolves to approve that the Company may transfer no more than 8 000 000 warrants in the Company to participants in Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  or otherwise dispose of the warrants to secure the Company's commitments in connection with Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 in connection with the Participants being entitled to exercise their employee stock options to acquire shares  and that the Company may dispose of no more than 2 513 600 warrants to cover potential cash flow effects from social security costs in accordance with the terms of Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025.Reasons for the employee stock option program and the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rightsThe reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to create involvement for the Participants in terms of the Company's and the group's development and to ensure that these individuals share the goal of generating value-adding growth  and to motivate continued employment and assignments. The board of directors assess that these objectives are in line with all shareholders' interests. The warrants are proposed to be issued to the Company in order to enable delivery of new shares to the Participants in the program and to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025.Existing share related incentive programsLong term incentive program 2020/2023 (LTIP 2020)At the annual general meeting held on 20 April 2020 it was resolved on a directed issue of 3 965 000 warrants within the framework of an incentive program to senior executives and other key persons. At the time of this proposal there are currently 851 721 outstanding warrants within the framework of the incentive program (after the cancellation of 3 006 612 warrants registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office on 22 March 2021 and the cancellation of 106 667 warrants which is planned to take place before the annual general meeting 2022). Each warrant entitled to subscribe for one new share in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 20.00. The warrants may be exercised from and including 1 May 2023 until and including 31 October 2023. As a result of the rights issue completed during February 2021  the subscription price and the number of shares each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for has been recalculated in accordance with applicable terms and conditions. The recalculated subscription price amounts to SEK 7.804 and each warrant entitles to subscribe to subscribe for 2.5627 shares.Long term incentive program 2021/2024 (LTIP 2021)At the annual general meeting held on 3 June 2021 it was resolved on a directed issue of 7 200 000 warrants within the framework of an incentive program for senior executives and other key persons. At the same time  an additional 2 262 240 warrants were resolved to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs. At the time of this proposal there are 7 203 130 outstanding warrants within the framework of the incentive program (after the cancellation of 2 259 110 warrants which is planned to take place before the annual general meeting 2022). Each warrant entitles to subscribe for one new share in the Company at an subscription price of SEK 4.00. The warrants may be exercised from and including 1 July 2024 until and including 31 December 2024.Costs  dilution  etc.The program will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the employee stock options should be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security costs will in accordance with UFR 7 be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period. Assuming a share price at the time of allotment of SEK 1.50  and that all employee stock options are vested and exercised up-front  the annual cost for the program is in accordance with IFRS 2 estimated to approximately SEK 350 000 per year before tax. Since the social security costs associated with the program are covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants which will be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the employee stock options  the social security costs associated with the program will be fully covered. The hedging measures will instead result in an additional dilution of present shareholders (which is included in the dilution calculations presented below). The costs associated with the establishment of the program are further estimated to a total of SEK 100 000. Further  minor brokerage costs will arise in connection with the exercise of hedging warrants by a financial intermediary. The costs associated with the program are expected to have only a marginal effect on the Company's key ratios.Upon full exercise of all 10 513 600 issued warrants issued in connection with Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  a total of 10 513 600 new shares will be issued in the Company (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with applicable terms and conditions). This corresponds to approximately 1.97 % of the total share capital and number of shares/votes in the Company and would lead to a dilution corresponding to approximately 1.94 % of the total share capital and number of shares/votes (based on the share capital and number of shares/votes in the Company registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office as of the day of this proposal and calculated as the maximum amount of share capital and number of shares/votes that may be issued  divided by the total share capital and the total number of shares/votes in the Company after all warrants have been exercised). The dilution calculation does not take into account potential new shares as a result of existing incentive programmes or the incentive programme for board members proposed to be adopted at the annual general meeting meaning that the potential dilution may be lower than the aforementioned.The above calculations regarding dilution and impact on key ratios are subject to recalculations in accordance with the customary recalculation terms set out for the programs.Preparation of the proposalThis proposal has been prepared by the board of directors together with external advisors and after consultations with certain major shareholders. The final proposal has been presented by the board of directors.Majority requirementsThe proposed implementation of Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 including a directed issue of warrants  and the approval of the transfer of warrants and/or shares  is governed by the provisions in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. Aktiebolagslagen (2005:551))  and a valid resolution therefore requires that the proposal is supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the meeting.MiscellaneousThe board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors shall have the right to make the minor adjustments required to register the resolution  and the board of directors shall have the right to make the minor adjustments required in the incentive program in order to conform with applicable foreign laws and regulations.Resolution proposed by the shareholdersItem 13. Resolution on implementation of a long-term incentive programme for board members by way of (i) a directed issue of warrants and (ii) approval of transfer of warrants (Warrant programme 2022/2027)Linc AB proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on implementation of a long-term incentive programme (Warrant programme 2022/2027) for board members by way of (A) directed issue of no more than 2 800 000 warrants to the Company and/or its subsidiary InDex Pharmaceuticals AB  org. no. 556704-5140 (the ""Subsidiary"")  as set forth in item A below  and (B) approval of transfer of the issued warrants from the Company/Subsidiary to the board members in the Company as set forth in item B below.Main terms of the incentive programmeThe incentive programme shall encompass the board members that are elected or re-elected at the annual general meeting (the ""Participants""). Participation in the incentive programme requires the election or re-election of the board members concerned at the annual general meeting 2022.The incentive programme entails that Participants  who have entered into an agreement with the Company/Subsidiary (the ""Warrant Agreement"")  are offered to acquire warrants at market value  calculated as set forth below. Warrants may be transferred to the Participants free-of-charge provided that it does not entail negative tax consequences for the group (only applicable with respect to Participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden).The Warrant Agreement will include a so called vesting structure with a vesting period of at least three years  a re-purchase right for the Company/Subsidiary applicable under certain circumstances  certain transfer restrictions and other terms and conditions customary for such agreements with some potential differences due to requirements under local law.Each warrant shall entitle the warrant holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company against cash consideration at an exercise price of SEK 4.50. Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account.The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the periods from and including 15 June 2025 until and including 15 July 2025  from and including 15 June 2026 until and including 15 July 2026 and from and including 15 June 2027 until and including 15 July 2027. Subscription of new shares may however not take place during so-called closed periods according to the EU Market Abuse Regulation  or otherwise in breach of relevant insider rules and regulations (including the Company's internal guidelines in this respect). Warrants that have not been exercised for subscription of new shares by 15 July 2027 shall lapse.The rationale for the incentive programme and reasons for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rightsThe rationale for the incentive programme is to create involvement for the Participants in terms of the Company's and the group's development and to ensure that these individuals share the goal of generating value-adding growth  and to motivate continued assignments.The warrants are proposed to be issued to the Company and/or to the Subsidiary in order to enable delivery of new shares to the Participants in the program.Existing share related incentive programmesLong term incentive program 2020/2023 (LTIP 2020)At the annual general meeting held on 20 April 2020 it was resolved on a directed issue of 3 965 000 warrants within the framework of an incentive program to senior executives and other key persons. At the time of this proposal there are currently 851 721 outstanding warrants within the framework of the incentive program (after the cancellation of 3 006 612 warrants registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office on 22 March 2021 and the cancellation of 106 667 warrants which is planned to take place before the annual general meeting 2022). Each warrant entitled to subscribe for one new share in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 20.00. The warrants may be exercised from and including 1 May 2023 until and including 31 October 2023. As a result of the rights issue completed during February 2021  the subscription price and the number of shares each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for has been recalculated in accordance with applicable terms and conditions. The recalculated subscription price amounts to SEK 7.804 and each warrant entitles to subscribe to subscribe for 2.5627 shares.Long term incentive program 2021/2024 (LTIP 2021)At the annual general meeting held on 3 June 2021 it was resolved on a directed issue of 7 200 000 warrants within the framework of an incentive program for senior executives and other key persons. At the same time  an additional 2 262 240 warrants were resolved to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs. At the time of this proposal there are 7 203 130 outstanding warrants within the framework of the incentive program (after the cancellation of 2 259 110 warrants which is planned to take place before the annual general meeting 2022). Each warrant entitles to subscribe for one new share in the Company at an subscription price of SEK 4.00. The warrants may be exercised from and including 1 July 2024 until and including 31 December 2024.Costs  dilution  etc.There are costs associated with the incentive programme in respect of valuation  consultancy services and costs for registration and practical management of the programme. There should not be any security costs or similar payable by the group.Upon full subscription  transfer and exercise of all 2 800 000 issued warrants  a total of 2 800 000 new shares will be issued in the Company (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with customary terms and conditions applicable for the warrants). This corresponds to approximately 0.53 % of the total share capital and number of shares/votes in the Company and would lead to a dilution corresponding to approximately 0.52 % of the total share capital and number of shares/votes (based on the share capital and number of shares/votes in the Company registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office as of the day of this proposal and calculated as the maximum amount of share capital and number of shares/votes that may be issued  divided by the total share capital and the total number of shares/votes in the Company after all warrants have been exercised). The dilution calculation does not take into account potential new shares as a result of existing incentive programmes or the incentive programme for employees and consultants proposed to be adopted at the annual general meeting meaning that the potential dilution may be lower than the aforementioned. The costs associated with the program are expected to have only a marginal effect on the Company's key ratios.The above calculations regarding dilution and impact on key ratios are subject to recalculations in accordance with the customary recalculation terms set out for the programme.Preparation of the proposalThis proposal has been prepared by Linc AB together with external consultants. The final proposal has been presented by the abovementioned party.Majority requirementsThe proposed incentive programme is subject to the provisions in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. Aktiebolagslagen (2005:551))  and a valid resolution therefore requires that the proposal is supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual general meeting.A. Directed issue of warrantsThe Company shall issue no more than 2 800 000 warrants of series 2022/2027. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new share in the Company  each with a quotient value of SEK 0.02 . If all warrants are subscribed  transferred to and exercised by the Participants for subscription of new shares  the Company's share capital will increase by SEK 56 000 (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with customary terms and conditions to be applicable in relation to the warrants). The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  only be subscribed for by the Company/Subsidiary after which they are to be transferred to the Participants in accordance with the resolution adopted by the general meeting. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the warrants are to be used within the proposed incentive programme. The Company's/Subsidiary's subscription of the warrants shall be made on a special subscription list within five (5) calendar days from the date of the general meeting that resolves on the issue. The board of directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The Company/Subsidiary is not to pay any subscription price for the warrants. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the periods from and including 15 June 2025 until and including 15 July 2025   from and including 15 June 2026 until and including 15 July 2026 and from and including 15 June 2027 until and including 15 July 2027 . The subscription price per new share is determined to be SEK 4.50 . Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account. Shares issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately following definite registration of the new shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the Company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. The warrants shall also be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the schedule to the complete proposal. The chairman of the board of directors  the CEO or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorised to make any minor adjustments required to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.B. Approval of transfer of warrant to the ParticipantsA resolution to issue warrants in accordance with this proposal also includes an approval of the transfer of warrants to the Participants.The warrants are to be transferred to the Participants against a premium payable by the Participants corresponding to the theoretical market value of the warrants as of the date of transfer  calculated by an independent valuation agent engaged by the Company by use of the Black & Scholes valuation model. Warrants may be transferred to the Participants free-of-charge provided that it does not entail negative tax consequences for the group (only applicable with respect to Participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden). The market value is preliminary estimated to SEK 0.12 per warrant  based on a market value of the underlying share corresponding to SEK 1.50 and a subscription price of SEK 4.50 per new share.The Participants may be allocated warrants as set forth below. No Participant may be offered a higher number of warrants than the maximum allocation set forth below.Category Maximum number of warrants per Participant Maximum number of warrants within the respective category Chairman of the board of directors 800 000 800 000 Other board members (5 persons) 400 000 2 000 000A Participant can choose to acquire a lower but not a higher number of warrants than offered to the Participant.For Participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden  it is implied that transfer of warrants is legally possible and that transfer  in the Company's opinion  can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial efforts. The Company shall have the right to adjust the terms of the Warrant Programme 2022/2027 to the extent required in order for allotment of warrants to participants in other jurisdictions  to the extent practically possible  to be made under the same conditions imposed by the Warrant Programme 2022/2027.Number of shares and votes in the CompanyThe total number of shares in the Company at the time of issuance of this notice is 532 687 650.

This would put all those in the deal at risk of incurring secondary U.S. sanctions  the company added.The broker had agreed to sell the bonds to Stifel Nicolaus Europe Ltd . — an international brokerage and investment banking company — after it was approached by one of Stifel's agents.The two brokerage firms agreed to the sale on Feb. 23  saying the trade would be settled two days later  Continental said in its defense dated April 22.Stifel told the court that it is still entitled to the money under the terms of the contract because it ""remains ready  willing and able to transfer the bonds upon payment "" Stifel said in its claim filed March 10.But the U.S. Treasuryon Feb. 24 after Russia invaded Ukraine  which Continental argued in its defense prevents it from paying because it is illegal to transfer a sanctioned entity's property.The sanctions prohibit U.S. financial institutions based in America from making transactions in connection with Sovcombank or dealing with its property.Continental argues that  once the sanctions against Sovcombank were in place  transferring the payment for the bonds meant every party in the transaction  including Euroclear PLC — an international securities depository — risked secondary U.S. sanctions and other financial or criminal penalties.The broker also argued that the contract was subject to Euroclear's terms and policies  which state that the depository is not obliged to be part of any illegal transaction  and its ""force majeure"" clause. The clauses are used in contracts to address ""act of God"" events  unexpected events beyond control that disrupt one side's ability to fulfill the promises it made under the contract.British and EU sanctions later made it practically and legally impossible for the trade to be completed  so neither brokers' obligations arose and nor were they both discharged  Continental told the court.The U.K. government froze Sovcombank's British assets on Feb. 28  andfrom the SWIFT cross-border payment messaging system on March 12.Stifel is claiming the $1.3 million as principal debt  $4 176 of interest as well as costs.Neither side responded to requests for comment on Thursday.A subsidiary of Venezuela's state-owned oil company was ordered by a U.S. court in July 2021 to repay a  when it argued it could not repay its debt due to sanctions.Stifel Nicolaus Europe Ltd. is represented by Tom Lowenthal of Blackstone Chambers   instructed by Kieran Rayani  European head of legal at Stifel.Continental Capital Markets Ltd. is represented by Farhaz Khan QC of 3VB  and Leonora Sagan of Fountain Court Chambers   instructed by Yasseen Gailani of Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan UK LLP The case is Stifel Nicolaus Europe Ltd. v.

Deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be allowed in situations where a directed issue is deemed more appropriate for the Company due to timing  commercial or similar reasons  and in order to enable acquisitions. The chairman of the board of directors  the CEO  or anyone authorized by the board of directors  shall have the right to make any minor adjustments required in order to register this resolution. For a valid decision on the proposal on an authorization for the board of directors  as outlined above  requires that the proposal is supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Item 12: Resolution on implementation of a long term incentive program in the form of employee stock options for senior executives and other key persons in the group including (i) a directed issue of warrants and (ii) approval of transfer (Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025);The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on implementation of a long-term incentive program (the ""Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025"") for senior executives and other key persons of the group (the ""Participants"") by way of granting employee stock options giving right to acquire new shares in the Company. Board members are not allowed to participate. The proposal also includes decision on a directed issue of warrants in order to enable delivery of shares under the program (if and to the extent the Company would like to effect delivery of shares by use of such warrants) and to cover potential cash flow effects from social security costs arising from employee stock option program  and approval of transfer of such warrants and/or shares on the terms and conditions set forth below.This proposal has been presented as the board of directors considers it important and in the interests of all shareholders to create involvement for senior executives and other key persons  including employees as well as consultants  in terms of the Company's and the group's development and ensure that these individuals share the goal of generating value-adding growth. It is also important to motivate continued employment and assignments. The board therefore proposes that the annual general meeting resolve as follows below.Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on implementation of the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 in accordance with the guidelines set forth below:1. The program shall consist of no more than 8 000 000 employee stock options to be allotted to the Participants free of charge.2. Each employee stock option confers the holder a right to acquire one (1) new share in the Company against cash consideration at an exercise price of SEK 4  corresponding to 288 % of the volume weighted average price of the latest 10 trading days (i.e. 13 April  2022 to 26 April  2022). The exercise price and the number of new shares that each employee stock option confers right to may be subject to recalculation by the corresponding application of the provisions in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants (see below).3. Notice of participation in the program shall have been received by the Company no later than 30 June 2022 with a right for the board of directors of the Company to prolong the time period. Allotment of employee stock options to Participants shall be made promptly after the expiration of the notification period.4. The employee stock options shall be offered the Participants in accordance with instructions from the board of directors of the Company and the following principles. The Participants right to employee stock options shall be differentiated with regard to position  responsibilities and performance in the group. Only those persons who are included in the categories below shall be offered employee stock options. The board of directors shall decide which persons that shall be deemed to be included in each category and which persons that shall receive employee stock options. In the event of re-calculation  the Participants in each category shall have the right to acquire the same number of employee stock options. Allotment of employee stock options to Participants outside Sweden shall - where applicable - be dependent on the tax effects  that there are no legal obstacles and that the board considers that such allotment can be made with reasonable administrative and financial resources.Category A – CEO: The CEO may be allotted a maximum of 1 930 700 employee stock options.Category B –Senior executives (approximately 4 individuals): participants in this category may be allotted a maximum of 3 089 200 employee stock options collectively and each participant in the category may be allotted a maximum of 772 300 employee stock options individually.Category C – Other key persons (approximately 12 individuals): participants in this category may be allotted a maximum of 2 980 100 employee stock options collectively and each participant may be allotted a maximum of 338 000 employee stock options individually.5. The employee stock options do not constitute securities and may not be transferred or pledged and may only be exercised for acquisition of new shares in the Company by the person to whom they have been granted.6. Alloted employee stock options shall be vested in three equal parts as of the date of each annual general meeting in the Company from 2023 to 2025 (i.e. approximately 33 per cent of the total number of employee stock options will be vested each year) and conditional on continued employment/assignments in the group  with reservation for the terms in the separate option agreements that shall be entered into between each Participant and the Company/Subsidiary.7. The holder may exercise allotted and vested employee stock options during the period from and including 1 July 2025 until and including 31 December 2025. The employee stock options may not be exercised for subscription of new shares during the so called ""closed periods"" according to the EUs Market Abuse Regulation  or otherwise in violation with applicable rules regarding insider information (including the Company's own guidelines in this regard).8. The employee stock options shall be governed by the more detailed terms and conditions set forth in ""Terms and Conditions for Employee Stock Options 2022/2025 in InDex Pharmaceuticals Holding AB (publ)""  in accordance with the board of directors' complete proposal  and separate agreements with each Participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 within the abovementioned substantial terms.Terms and conditions for the issue of warrantsTo enable the Company's delivery of shares under Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 and to cover any cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting of shareholders resolves on a directed issue of no more than 10 513 600 warrants  out of which 2 513 600 warrants are proposed to be issued to cover potential cash flow effects from social security costs arising from Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  according to the following terms.The Company shall issue no more than 10 513 600 warrants of series 2022/2025. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new share in the Company  each with a quotient value of SEK 0.02. If all warrants are exercised for subscription of new shares  the Company's share capital will increase by SEK 210 272 (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with customary terms and conditions to be applicable in relation to the warrants). The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  only be subscribed for by the Company or its subsidiary InDex Pharmaceuticals AB  org. no. 556704-5140 (the ""Subsidiary""). The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable delivery of shares under Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  and to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025. The Company's/Subsidiary's subscription of the warrants shall be made on a special subscription list within five (5) calendar days from the date of the general meeting that resolves on the issue. The board of directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The warrants are issued without consideration (i.e. free of charge) to the Company/Subsidiary. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the period from and including the registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office until and including 31 March 2026. Each warrant entitles to subscription for one (1) new share in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 4 per share (the ""Exercise Price""). Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account. Shares issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately following definite registration of the new shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the Company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. The warrants shall also be subject to the terms and conditions  inter alia containing customary recalculation conditions  set forth in the board of directors' complete proposal. The chairman of the board of directors  the CEO or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorised to make any minor adjustments required to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors further proposes that the general meeting of shareholders resolves to approve that the Company may transfer no more than 8 000 000 warrants in the Company to participants in Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  or otherwise dispose of the warrants to secure the Company's commitments in connection with Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 in connection with the Participants being entitled to exercise their employee stock options to acquire shares  and that the Company may dispose of no more than 2 513 600 warrants to cover potential cash flow effects from social security costs in accordance with the terms of Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025.Reasons for the employee stock option program and the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rightsThe reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to create involvement for the Participants in terms of the Company's and the group's development and to ensure that these individuals share the goal of generating value-adding growth  and to motivate continued employment and assignments. The board of directors assess that these objectives are in line with all shareholders' interests. The warrants are proposed to be issued to the Company in order to enable delivery of new shares to the Participants in the program and to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025.Existing share related incentive programsLong term incentive program 2020/2023 (LTIP 2020)At the annual general meeting held on 20 April 2020 it was resolved on a directed issue of 3 965 000 warrants within the framework of an incentive program to senior executives and other key persons. At the time of this proposal there are currently 851 721 outstanding warrants within the framework of the incentive program (after the cancellation of 3 006 612 warrants registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office on 22 March 2021 and the cancellation of 106 667 warrants which is planned to take place before the annual general meeting 2022). Each warrant entitled to subscribe for one new share in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 20.00. The warrants may be exercised from and including 1 May 2023 until and including 31 October 2023. As a result of the rights issue completed during February 2021  the subscription price and the number of shares each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for has been recalculated in accordance with applicable terms and conditions. The recalculated subscription price amounts to SEK 7.804 and each warrant entitles to subscribe to subscribe for 2.5627 shares.Long term incentive program 2021/2024 (LTIP 2021)At the annual general meeting held on 3 June 2021 it was resolved on a directed issue of 7 200 000 warrants within the framework of an incentive program for senior executives and other key persons. At the same time  an additional 2 262 240 warrants were resolved to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs. At the time of this proposal there are 7 203 130 outstanding warrants within the framework of the incentive program (after the cancellation of 2 259 110 warrants which is planned to take place before the annual general meeting 2022). Each warrant entitles to subscribe for one new share in the Company at an subscription price of SEK 4.00. The warrants may be exercised from and including 1 July 2024 until and including 31 December 2024.Costs  dilution  etc.The program will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the employee stock options should be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security costs will in accordance with UFR 7 be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period. Assuming a share price at the time of allotment of SEK 1.50  and that all employee stock options are vested and exercised up-front  the annual cost for the program is in accordance with IFRS 2 estimated to approximately SEK 350 000 per year before tax. Since the social security costs associated with the program are covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants which will be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the employee stock options  the social security costs associated with the program will be fully covered. The hedging measures will instead result in an additional dilution of present shareholders (which is included in the dilution calculations presented below). The costs associated with the establishment of the program are further estimated to a total of SEK 100 000. Further  minor brokerage costs will arise in connection with the exercise of hedging warrants by a financial intermediary. The costs associated with the program are expected to have only a marginal effect on the Company's key ratios.Upon full exercise of all 10 513 600 issued warrants issued in connection with Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  a total of 10 513 600 new shares will be issued in the Company (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with applicable terms and conditions). This corresponds to approximately 1.97 % of the total share capital and number of shares/votes in the Company and would lead to a dilution corresponding to approximately 1.94 % of the total share capital and number of shares/votes (based on the share capital and number of shares/votes in the Company registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office as of the day of this proposal and calculated as the maximum amount of share capital and number of shares/votes that may be issued  divided by the total share capital and the total number of shares/votes in the Company after all warrants have been exercised). The dilution calculation does not take into account potential new shares as a result of existing incentive programmes or the incentive programme for board members proposed to be adopted at the annual general meeting meaning that the potential dilution may be lower than the aforementioned.The above calculations regarding dilution and impact on key ratios are subject to recalculations in accordance with the customary recalculation terms set out for the programs.Preparation of the proposalThis proposal has been prepared by the board of directors together with external advisors and after consultations with certain major shareholders. The final proposal has been presented by the board of directors.Majority requirementsThe proposed implementation of Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 including a directed issue of warrants  and the approval of the transfer of warrants and/or shares  is governed by the provisions in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. Aktiebolagslagen (2005:551))  and a valid resolution therefore requires that the proposal is supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the meeting.MiscellaneousThe board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors shall have the right to make the minor adjustments required to register the resolution  and the board of directors shall have the right to make the minor adjustments required in the incentive program in order to conform with applicable foreign laws and regulations.Resolution proposed by the shareholdersItem 13. Resolution on implementation of a long-term incentive programme for board members by way of (i) a directed issue of warrants and (ii) approval of transfer of warrants (Warrant programme 2022/2027)Linc AB proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on implementation of a long-term incentive programme (Warrant programme 2022/2027) for board members by way of (A) directed issue of no more than 2 800 000 warrants to the Company and/or its subsidiary InDex Pharmaceuticals AB  org. no. 556704-5140 (the ""Subsidiary"")  as set forth in item A below  and (B) approval of transfer of the issued warrants from the Company/Subsidiary to the board members in the Company as set forth in item B below.Main terms of the incentive programmeThe incentive programme shall encompass the board members that are elected or re-elected at the annual general meeting (the ""Participants""). Participation in the incentive programme requires the election or re-election of the board members concerned at the annual general meeting 2022.The incentive programme entails that Participants  who have entered into an agreement with the Company/Subsidiary (the ""Warrant Agreement"")  are offered to acquire warrants at market value  calculated as set forth below. Warrants may be transferred to the Participants free-of-charge provided that it does not entail negative tax consequences for the group (only applicable with respect to Participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden).The Warrant Agreement will include a so called vesting structure with a vesting period of at least three years  a re-purchase right for the Company/Subsidiary applicable under certain circumstances  certain transfer restrictions and other terms and conditions customary for such agreements with some potential differences due to requirements under local law.Each warrant shall entitle the warrant holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company against cash consideration at an exercise price of SEK 4.50. Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account.The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the periods from and including 15 June 2025 until and including 15 July 2025  from and including 15 June 2026 until and including 15 July 2026 and from and including 15 June 2027 until and including 15 July 2027. Subscription of new shares may however not take place during so-called closed periods according to the EU Market Abuse Regulation  or otherwise in breach of relevant insider rules and regulations (including the Company's internal guidelines in this respect). Warrants that have not been exercised for subscription of new shares by 15 July 2027 shall lapse.The rationale for the incentive programme and reasons for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rightsThe rationale for the incentive programme is to create involvement for the Participants in terms of the Company's and the group's development and to ensure that these individuals share the goal of generating value-adding growth  and to motivate continued assignments.The warrants are proposed to be issued to the Company and/or to the Subsidiary in order to enable delivery of new shares to the Participants in the program.Existing share related incentive programmesLong term incentive program 2020/2023 (LTIP 2020)At the annual general meeting held on 20 April 2020 it was resolved on a directed issue of 3 965 000 warrants within the framework of an incentive program to senior executives and other key persons. At the time of this proposal there are currently 851 721 outstanding warrants within the framework of the incentive program (after the cancellation of 3 006 612 warrants registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office on 22 March 2021 and the cancellation of 106 667 warrants which is planned to take place before the annual general meeting 2022). Each warrant entitled to subscribe for one new share in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 20.00. The warrants may be exercised from and including 1 May 2023 until and including 31 October 2023. As a result of the rights issue completed during February 2021  the subscription price and the number of shares each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for has been recalculated in accordance with applicable terms and conditions. The recalculated subscription price amounts to SEK 7.804 and each warrant entitles to subscribe to subscribe for 2.5627 shares.Long term incentive program 2021/2024 (LTIP 2021)At the annual general meeting held on 3 June 2021 it was resolved on a directed issue of 7 200 000 warrants within the framework of an incentive program for senior executives and other key persons. At the same time  an additional 2 262 240 warrants were resolved to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs. At the time of this proposal there are 7 203 130 outstanding warrants within the framework of the incentive program (after the cancellation of 2 259 110 warrants which is planned to take place before the annual general meeting 2022). Each warrant entitles to subscribe for one new share in the Company at an subscription price of SEK 4.00. The warrants may be exercised from and including 1 July 2024 until and including 31 December 2024.Costs  dilution  etc.There are costs associated with the incentive programme in respect of valuation  consultancy services and costs for registration and practical management of the programme. There should not be any security costs or similar payable by the group.Upon full subscription  transfer and exercise of all 2 800 000 issued warrants  a total of 2 800 000 new shares will be issued in the Company (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with customary terms and conditions applicable for the warrants). This corresponds to approximately 0.53 % of the total share capital and number of shares/votes in the Company and would lead to a dilution corresponding to approximately 0.52 % of the total share capital and number of shares/votes (based on the share capital and number of shares/votes in the Company registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office as of the day of this proposal and calculated as the maximum amount of share capital and number of shares/votes that may be issued  divided by the total share capital and the total number of shares/votes in the Company after all warrants have been exercised). The dilution calculation does not take into account potential new shares as a result of existing incentive programmes or the incentive programme for employees and consultants proposed to be adopted at the annual general meeting meaning that the potential dilution may be lower than the aforementioned. The costs associated with the program are expected to have only a marginal effect on the Company's key ratios.The above calculations regarding dilution and impact on key ratios are subject to recalculations in accordance with the customary recalculation terms set out for the programme.Preparation of the proposalThis proposal has been prepared by Linc AB together with external consultants. The final proposal has been presented by the abovementioned party.Majority requirementsThe proposed incentive programme is subject to the provisions in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. Aktiebolagslagen (2005:551))  and a valid resolution therefore requires that the proposal is supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual general meeting.A. Directed issue of warrantsThe Company shall issue no more than 2 800 000 warrants of series 2022/2027. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new share in the Company  each with a quotient value of SEK 0.02. If all warrants are subscribed  transferred to and exercised by the Participants for subscription of new shares  the Company's share capital will increase by SEK 56 000 (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with customary terms and conditions to be applicable in relation to the warrants). The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  only be subscribed for by the Company/Subsidiary after which they are to be transferred to the Participants in accordance with the resolution adopted by the general meeting. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the warrants are to be used within the proposed incentive programme. The Company's/Subsidiary's subscription of the warrants shall be made on a special subscription list within five (5) calendar days from the date of the general meeting that resolves on the issue. The board of directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The Company/Subsidiary is not to pay any subscription price for the warrants. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the periods from and including 15 June 2025 until and including 15 July 2025  from and including 15 June 2026 until and including 15 July 2026 and from and including 15 June 2027 until and including 15 July 2027. The subscription price per new share is determined to be SEK 4.50. Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account. Shares issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately following definite registration of the new shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the Company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. The warrants shall also be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the schedule to the complete proposal. The chairman of the board of directors  the CEO or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorised to make any minor adjustments required to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.B. Approval of transfer of warrant to the ParticipantsA resolution to issue warrants in accordance with this proposal also includes an approval of the transfer of warrants to the Participants.The warrants are to be transferred to the Participants against a premium payable by the Participants corresponding to the theoretical market value of the warrants as of the date of transfer  calculated by an independent valuation agent engaged by the Company by use of the Black & Scholes valuation model. Warrants may be transferred to the Participants free-of-charge provided that it does not entail negative tax consequences for the group (only applicable with respect to Participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden). The market value is preliminary estimated to SEK 0.12 per warrant  based on a market value of the underlying share corresponding to SEK 1.50 and a subscription price of SEK 4.50 per new share.The Participants may be allocated warrants as set forth below. No Participant may be offered a higher number of warrants than the maximum allocation set forth below.Category Maximum number of warrants per Participant Maximum number of warrants within the respective category Chairman of the board of directors 800 000 800 000 Other board members (5 persons) 400 000 2 000 000A Participant can choose to acquire a lower but not a higher number of warrants than offered to the Participant.For Participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden  it is implied that transfer of warrants is legally possible and that transfer  in the Company's opinion  can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial efforts. The Company shall have the right to adjust the terms of the Warrant Programme 2022/2027 to the extent required in order for allotment of warrants to participants in other jurisdictions  to the extent practically possible  to be made under the same conditions imposed by the Warrant Programme 2022/2027.Number of shares and votes in the CompanyThe total number of shares in the Company at the time of issuance of this notice is 532 687 650.

Financial Summary Euroclear delivered a ...,"BRUSSELS  April 27  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Euroclear today provides an update on its financial and operational performance in the first quarter of 2022.Financial SummaryEuroclear delivered a strong financial and operational performance in Q1 2022. Net profit increased +11% to EUR 134 million.Operating income was up +10% year-on-year to EUR 438 million driven by strong business income growth  up +9% to EUR 405 million and Interest  Banking and Other income up 39% to EUR 32 million.We increased our investments in technology in line with our strategy. Operating expenses increased to EUR 260 million  up 11% compared to Q1 2021.Sanctions related to the invasion of Ukraine have led to increased cash held on our balance sheet  which are explained further below.Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1805340/Euroclear_1.jpgNote: 2021 figures have been restated to include MFEX pro forma  in order to allow for like-for-like comparison.Operational highlightsThroughout the first quarter  Euroclear continued to make strategic progress  while remaining focused on our responsibilities as a critical financial market infrastructure. This is reflected in the key operating metrics shown below:Q1 total % change vs Q1 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 37 trillion +8% Number of Transactions 80 million +5% Turnover EUR 270 trillion +13% Fund assets under custody EUR 3 trillion +12% Collateral Highway EUR 2 trillion +18%The integration of MFEX is progressing to plan as we combine MFEX's established fund distribution platforms with Euroclear's post-trade expertise to create a new end-to-end funds offering.We have also made two strategic investments during the first quarter.Firstly  we have further advanced Euroclear's digital strategy through our investment in Fnality  an international consortium of global banks and financial market infrastructures focused on building regulated payment systems to support the adoption of tokenised assets and marketplaces.Secondly  we have progressed our sustainable finance and ESG strategy through an investment in Greenomy  a Belgium based sustainable finance technology platform. Greenomy helps corporates  credit institutions and asset managers comply with new European Union sustainable finance legislation by digitalising the data capturing and reporting processes.As part of our commitment to ESG  we are pleased to announce that Euroclear has taken the important step to reduce its global carbon footprint by committing to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We will now set CO2 reduction actions with the commitment to achieve net-zero value chain Green House Gas (GHG) emissions by no later than 2050.Implications from the invasion of Ukraine and SanctionsOur thoughts are with those affected by the humanitarian crisis resulting from the invasion of Ukraine. We have focused on supporting our staff  especially those of Ukrainian and Russian origin  as well as those in bordering countries.Euroclear is complying with the international sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine and has suspended all transactions with sanctioned entities since 28 February. In addition to ensuring all the sanctions are applied immediately and completely  our teams are supporting clients diligently in managing the exceptional situation. We are working closely with clients to apply all new rules fully and according to the spirit of the sanctions.A consequence of the sanctions is that assets owned by sanctioned parties are blocked in the respective financial market infrastructures  including Euroclear. As the assets mature through their lifecycle  cashflows (e.g. coupons and redemptions) that are normally transferred to the underlying parties accumulate on our balance sheet for as long as the sanctions remain in place. We do not expect these sanctions to affect our financial performance. During the first quarter  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by â¬23 billion year-on-year  for which the company is working on the mitigation of potential regulatory capital requirements.In light of these circumstances  the Board of Euroclear considers it to be prudent to wait until the second half of 2022 to formally decide on the dividend payment of EUR 88.5 per share (equating to a total of EUR 279 million) as announced in its full year results.Commenting on the results  Lieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer  said:""The invasion of Ukraine is deeply troubling and our thoughts are with all who are impacted. As a financial market infrastructure  we have an important role to play in a turbulent world. I am proud of the staff response as our people mobilised swiftly to apply the sanctions; to support clients during the exceptional circumstances; and to contribute to relief efforts for those affected. From a financial and operational perspective  Euroclear continues to perform very well  achieving another strong quarter as we continue to deliver on our strategy.""Appendix: Financial Statements for Euroclear Bank and Euroclear InvestmentsInfographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1805341/Euroclear_2.jpgAbout EuroclearEuroclear Group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

The person appointed to verify the minutes shall  apart from approving the minutes of the general meeting together with the chairman of the general meeting  check the voting list and that the result of received votes are correctly reflected in the minutes of the general meeting.Item 7b): Resolution in respect of allocation of the company's profits or lossesThe board of directors proposes that the Company's accumulated profits shall be carried forward in new account and that no dividend shall be paid for the financial year 2021.Item 11: Resolution regarding authorization for the board of directors to increase the share capitalThe board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on an authorization for the board of directors to – for the period up to the next annual general meeting and at one or more occasions – resolve upon issuance of new shares  warrants and/or convertible debentures. Payment may be made in cash  in kind  through set-off of claims or otherwise be conditional. The Company's share capital may by support of the authorization be increased by an amount corresponding to 10 per cent of the share capital and number of shares in the Company as of on the date the board of directors make use of the authorization. Deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be allowed in situations where a directed issue is deemed more appropriate for the Company due to timing  commercial or similar reasons  and in order to enable acquisitions. The chairman of the board of directors  the CEO  or anyone authorized by the board of directors  shall have the right to make any minor adjustments required in order to register this resolution. For a valid decision on the proposal on an authorization for the board of directors  as outlined above  requires that the proposal is supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Item 12: Resolution on implementation of a long term incentive program in the form of employee stock options for senior executives and other key persons in the group including (i) a directed issue of warrants and (ii) approval of transfer (Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025);The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on implementation of a long-term incentive program (the ""Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025"") for senior executives and other key persons of the group (the ""Participants"") by way of granting employee stock options giving right to acquire new shares in the Company. Board members are not allowed to participate. The proposal also includes decision on a directed issue of warrants in order to enable delivery of shares under the program (if and to the extent the Company would like to effect delivery of shares by use of such warrants) and to cover potential cash flow effects from social security costs arising from employee stock option program  and approval of transfer of such warrants and/or shares on the terms and conditions set forth below.This proposal has been presented as the board of directors considers it important and in the interests of all shareholders to create involvement for senior executives and other key persons  including employees as well as consultants  in terms of the Company's and the group's development and ensure that these individuals share the goal of generating value-adding growth. It is also important to motivate continued employment and assignments. The board therefore proposes that the annual general meeting resolve as follows below.Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on implementation of the Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 in accordance with the guidelines set forth below:1. The program shall consist of no more than 8 000 000 employee stock options to be allotted to the Participants free of charge.2. Each employee stock option confers the holder a right to acquire one (1) new share in the Company against cash consideration at an exercise price of SEK 4  corresponding to 288 % of the volume weighted average price of the latest 10 trading days (i.e. 13 April  2022 to 26 April  2022). The exercise price and the number of new shares that each employee stock option confers right to may be subject to recalculation by the corresponding application of the provisions in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants (see below).3. Notice of participation in the program shall have been received by the Company no later than 30 June 2022 with a right for the board of directors of the Company to prolong the time period. Allotment of employee stock options to Participants shall be made promptly after the expiration of the notification period.4. The employee stock options shall be offered the Participants in accordance with instructions from the board of directors of the Company and the following principles. The Participants right to employee stock options shall be differentiated with regard to position  responsibilities and performance in the group. Only those persons who are included in the categories below shall be offered employee stock options. The board of directors shall decide which persons that shall be deemed to be included in each category and which persons that shall receive employee stock options. In the event of re-calculation  the Participants in each category shall have the right to acquire the same number of employee stock options. Allotment of employee stock options to Participants outside Sweden shall - where applicable - be dependent on the tax effects  that there are no legal obstacles and that the board considers that such allotment can be made with reasonable administrative and financial resources.Category A – CEO: The CEO may be allotted a maximum of 1 930 700 employee stock options.Category B –Senior executives (approximately 4 individuals): participants in this category may be allotted a maximum of 3 089 200 employee stock options collectively and each participant in the category may be allotted a maximum of 772 300 employee stock options individually.Category C – Other key persons (approximately 12 individuals): participants in this category may be allotted a maximum of 2 980 100 employee stock options collectively and each participant may be allotted a maximum of 338 000 employee stock options individually.5. The employee stock options do not constitute securities and may not be transferred or pledged and may only be exercised for acquisition of new shares in the Company by the person to whom they have been granted.6. Alloted employee stock options shall be vested in three equal parts as of the date of each annual general meeting in the Company from 2023 to 2025 (i.e. approximately 33 per cent of the total number of employee stock options will be vested each year) and conditional on continued employment/assignments in the group  with reservation for the terms in the separate option agreements that shall be entered into between each Participant and the Company/Subsidiary.7. The holder may exercise allotted and vested employee stock options during the period from and including 1 July 2025 until and including 31 December 2025. The employee stock options may not be exercised for subscription of new shares during the so called ""closed periods"" according to the EUs Market Abuse Regulation  or otherwise in violation with applicable rules regarding insider information (including the Company's own guidelines in this regard).8. The employee stock options shall be governed by the more detailed terms and conditions set forth in ""Terms and Conditions for Employee Stock Options 2022/2025 in InDex Pharmaceuticals Holding AB (publ)""  in accordance with the board of directors' complete proposal  and separate agreements with each Participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 within the abovementioned substantial terms.Terms and conditions for the issue of warrantsTo enable the Company's delivery of shares under Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 and to cover any cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting of shareholders resolves on a directed issue of no more than 10 513 600 warrants  out of which 2 513 600 warrants are proposed to be issued to cover potential cash flow effects from social security costs arising from Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  according to the following terms.The Company shall issue no more than 10 513 600 warrants of series 2022/2025. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new share in the Company  each with a quotient value of SEK 0.02. If all warrants are exercised for subscription of new shares  the Company's share capital will increase by SEK 210 272 (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with customary terms and conditions to be applicable in relation to the warrants). The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  only be subscribed for by the Company or its subsidiary InDex Pharmaceuticals AB  org. no. 556704-5140 (the ""Subsidiary""). The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable delivery of shares under Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  and to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025. The Company's/Subsidiary's subscription of the warrants shall be made on a special subscription list within five (5) calendar days from the date of the general meeting that resolves on the issue. The board of directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The warrants are issued without consideration (i.e. free of charge) to the Company/Subsidiary. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the period from and including the registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office until and including 31 March 2026. Each warrant entitles to subscription for one (1) new share in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 4 per share (the ""Exercise Price""). Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account. Shares issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately following definite registration of the new shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the Company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. The warrants shall also be subject to the terms and conditions  inter alia containing customary recalculation conditions  set forth in the board of directors' complete proposal. The chairman of the board of directors  the CEO or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorised to make any minor adjustments required to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The board of directors further proposes that the general meeting of shareholders resolves to approve that the Company may transfer no more than 8 000 000 warrants in the Company to participants in Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  or otherwise dispose of the warrants to secure the Company's commitments in connection with Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 in connection with the Participants being entitled to exercise their employee stock options to acquire shares  and that the Company may dispose of no more than 2 513 600 warrants to cover potential cash flow effects from social security costs in accordance with the terms of Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025.Reasons for the employee stock option program and the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rightsThe reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to create involvement for the Participants in terms of the Company's and the group's development and to ensure that these individuals share the goal of generating value-adding growth  and to motivate continued employment and assignments. The board of directors assess that these objectives are in line with all shareholders' interests. The warrants are proposed to be issued to the Company in order to enable delivery of new shares to the Participants in the program and to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs arising from Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025.Existing share related incentive programsLong term incentive program 2020/2023 (LTIP 2020)At the annual general meeting held on 20 April 2020 it was resolved on a directed issue of 3 965 000 warrants within the framework of an incentive program to senior executives and other key persons. At the time of this proposal there are currently 851 721 outstanding warrants within the framework of the incentive program (after the cancellation of 3 006 612 warrants registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office on 22 March 2021 and the cancellation of 106 667 warrants which is planned to take place before the annual general meeting 2022). Each warrant entitled to subscribe for one new share in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 20.00. The warrants may be exercised from and including 1 May 2023 until and including 31 October 2023. As a result of the rights issue completed during February 2021  the subscription price and the number of shares each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for has been recalculated in accordance with applicable terms and conditions. The recalculated subscription price amounts to SEK 7.804 and each warrant entitles to subscribe to subscribe for 2.5627 shares.Long term incentive program 2021/2024 (LTIP 2021)At the annual general meeting held on 3 June 2021 it was resolved on a directed issue of 7 200 000 warrants within the framework of an incentive program for senior executives and other key persons. At the same time  an additional 2 262 240 warrants were resolved to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs. At the time of this proposal there are 7 203 130 outstanding warrants within the framework of the incentive program (after the cancellation of 2 259 110 warrants which is planned to take place before the annual general meeting 2022). Each warrant entitles to subscribe for one new share in the Company at an subscription price of SEK 4.00. The warrants may be exercised from and including 1 July 2024 until and including 31 December 2024.Costs  dilution  etc.The program will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 – Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the employee stock options should be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security costs will in accordance with UFR 7 be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period. Assuming a share price at the time of allotment of SEK 1.50  and that all employee stock options are vested and exercised up-front  the annual cost for the program is in accordance with IFRS 2 estimated to approximately SEK 350 000 per year before tax. Since the social security costs associated with the program are covered by hedging measures through the issue of warrants which will be exercised by a financial intermediary in connection with the exercise of the employee stock options  the social security costs associated with the program will be fully covered. The hedging measures will instead result in an additional dilution of present shareholders (which is included in the dilution calculations presented below). The costs associated with the establishment of the program are further estimated to a total of SEK 100 000. Further  minor brokerage costs will arise in connection with the exercise of hedging warrants by a financial intermediary. The costs associated with the program are expected to have only a marginal effect on the Company's key ratios.Upon full exercise of all 10 513 600 issued warrants issued in connection with Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025  a total of 10 513 600 new shares will be issued in the Company (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with applicable terms and conditions). This corresponds to approximately 1.97 % of the total share capital and number of shares/votes in the Company and would lead to a dilution corresponding to approximately 1.94 % of the total share capital and number of shares/votes (based on the share capital and number of shares/votes in the Company registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office as of the day of this proposal and calculated as the maximum amount of share capital and number of shares/votes that may be issued  divided by the total share capital and the total number of shares/votes in the Company after all warrants have been exercised). The dilution calculation does not take into account potential new shares as a result of existing incentive programmes or the incentive programme for board members proposed to be adopted at the annual general meeting meaning that the potential dilution may be lower than the aforementioned.The above calculations regarding dilution and impact on key ratios are subject to recalculations in accordance with the customary recalculation terms set out for the programs.Preparation of the proposalThis proposal has been prepared by the board of directors together with external advisors and after consultations with certain major shareholders. The final proposal has been presented by the board of directors.Majority requirementsThe proposed implementation of Employee Stock Option Program 2022/2025 including a directed issue of warrants  and the approval of the transfer of warrants and/or shares  is governed by the provisions in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. Aktiebolagslagen (2005:551))  and a valid resolution therefore requires that the proposal is supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the meeting.MiscellaneousThe board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors shall have the right to make the minor adjustments required to register the resolution  and the board of directors shall have the right to make the minor adjustments required in the incentive program in order to conform with applicable foreign laws and regulations.Resolution proposed by the shareholdersItem 13. Resolution on implementation of a long-term incentive programme for board members by way of (i) a directed issue of warrants and (ii) approval of transfer of warrants (Warrant programme 2022/2027)Linc AB proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on implementation of a long-term incentive programme (Warrant programme 2022/2027) for board members by way of (A) directed issue of no more than 2 800 000 warrants to the Company and/or its subsidiary InDex Pharmaceuticals AB  org. no. 556704-5140 (the ""Subsidiary"")  as set forth in item A below  and (B) approval of transfer of the issued warrants from the Company/Subsidiary to the board members in the Company as set forth in item B below.Main terms of the incentive programmeThe incentive programme shall encompass the board members that are elected or re-elected at the annual general meeting (the ""Participants""). Participation in the incentive programme requires the election or re-election of the board members concerned at the annual general meeting 2022.The incentive programme entails that Participants  who have entered into an agreement with the Company/Subsidiary (the ""Warrant Agreement"")  are offered to acquire warrants at market value  calculated as set forth below. Warrants may be transferred to the Participants free-of-charge provided that it does not entail negative tax consequences for the group (only applicable with respect to Participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden).The Warrant Agreement will include a so called vesting structure with a vesting period of at least three years  a re-purchase right for the Company/Subsidiary applicable under certain circumstances  certain transfer restrictions and other terms and conditions customary for such agreements with some potential differences due to requirements under local law.Each warrant shall entitle the warrant holder to subscribe for one (1) new share in the Company against cash consideration at an exercise price of SEK 4.50. Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account.The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the periods from and including 15 June 2025 until and including 15 July 2025  from and including 15 June 2026 until and including 15 July 2026 and from and including 15 June 2027 until and including 15 July 2027. Subscription of new shares may however not take place during so-called closed periods according to the EU Market Abuse Regulation  or otherwise in breach of relevant insider rules and regulations (including the Company's internal guidelines in this respect). Warrants that have not been exercised for subscription of new shares by 15 July 2027 shall lapse.The rationale for the incentive programme and reasons for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rightsThe rationale for the incentive programme is to create involvement for the Participants in terms of the Company's and the group's development and to ensure that these individuals share the goal of generating value-adding growth  and to motivate continued assignments.The warrants are proposed to be issued to the Company and/or to the Subsidiary in order to enable delivery of new shares to the Participants in the program.Existing share related incentive programmesLong term incentive program 2020/2023 (LTIP 2020)At the annual general meeting held on 20 April 2020 it was resolved on a directed issue of 3 965 000 warrants within the framework of an incentive program to senior executives and other key persons. At the time of this proposal there are currently 851 721 outstanding warrants within the framework of the incentive program (after the cancellation of 3 006 612 warrants registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office on 22 March 2021 and the cancellation of 106 667 warrants which is planned to take place before the annual general meeting 2022). Each warrant entitled to subscribe for one new share in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 20.00. The warrants may be exercised from and including 1 May 2023 until and including 31 October 2023. As a result of the rights issue completed during February 2021  the subscription price and the number of shares each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for has been recalculated in accordance with applicable terms and conditions. The recalculated subscription price amounts to SEK 7.804 and each warrant entitles to subscribe to subscribe for 2.5627 shares.Long term incentive program 2021/2024 (LTIP 2021)At the annual general meeting held on 3 June 2021 it was resolved on a directed issue of 7 200 000 warrants within the framework of an incentive program for senior executives and other key persons. At the same time  an additional 2 262 240 warrants were resolved to cover cash flow effects from potential social security costs. At the time of this proposal there are 7 203 130 outstanding warrants within the framework of the incentive program (after the cancellation of 2 259 110 warrants which is planned to take place before the annual general meeting 2022). Each warrant entitles to subscribe for one new share in the Company at an subscription price of SEK 4.00. The warrants may be exercised from and including 1 July 2024 until and including 31 December 2024.Costs  dilution  etc.There are costs associated with the incentive programme in respect of valuation  consultancy services and costs for registration and practical management of the programme. There should not be any security costs or similar payable by the group.Upon full subscription  transfer and exercise of all 2 800 000 issued warrants  a total of 2 800 000 new shares will be issued in the Company (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with customary terms and conditions applicable for the warrants). This corresponds to approximately 0.53 % of the total share capital and number of shares/votes in the Company and would lead to a dilution corresponding to approximately 0.52 % of the total share capital and number of shares/votes (based on the share capital and number of shares/votes in the Company registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office as of the day of this proposal and calculated as the maximum amount of share capital and number of shares/votes that may be issued  divided by the total share capital and the total number of shares/votes in the Company after all warrants have been exercised). The dilution calculation does not take into account potential new shares as a result of existing incentive programmes or the incentive programme for employees and consultants proposed to be adopted at the annual general meeting meaning that the potential dilution may be lower than the aforementioned. The costs associated with the program are expected to have only a marginal effect on the Company's key ratios.The above calculations regarding dilution and impact on key ratios are subject to recalculations in accordance with the customary recalculation terms set out for the programme.Preparation of the proposalThis proposal has been prepared by Linc AB together with external consultants. The final proposal has been presented by the abovementioned party.Majority requirementsThe proposed incentive programme is subject to the provisions in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. Aktiebolagslagen (2005:551))  and a valid resolution therefore requires that the proposal is supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths (9/10) of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual general meeting.A. Directed issue of warrantsThe Company shall issue no more than 2 800 000 warrants of series 2022/2027. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one (1) new share in the Company  each with a quotient value of SEK 0.02. If all warrants are subscribed  transferred to and exercised by the Participants for subscription of new shares  the Company's share capital will increase by SEK 56 000 (subject to potential recalculations in accordance with customary terms and conditions to be applicable in relation to the warrants). The warrants may  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  only be subscribed for by the Company/Subsidiary after which they are to be transferred to the Participants in accordance with the resolution adopted by the general meeting. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the warrants are to be used within the proposed incentive programme. The Company's/Subsidiary's subscription of the warrants shall be made on a special subscription list within five (5) calendar days from the date of the general meeting that resolves on the issue. The board of directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The Company/Subsidiary is not to pay any subscription price for the warrants. The warrants may be exercised for subscription of new shares during the periods from and including 15 June 2025 until and including 15 July 2025  from and including 15 June 2026 until and including 15 July 2026 and from and including 15 June 2027 until and including 15 July 2027. The subscription price per new share is determined to be SEK 4.50. Any amount that exceeds the quotient value shall be transferred to the nonrestricted share premium account. Shares issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately following definite registration of the new shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and in the Company's share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. The warrants shall also be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the schedule to the complete proposal. The chairman of the board of directors  the CEO or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorised to make any minor adjustments required to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.B. Approval of transfer of warrant to the ParticipantsA resolution to issue warrants in accordance with this proposal also includes an approval of the transfer of warrants to the Participants.The warrants are to be transferred to the Participants against a premium payable by the Participants corresponding to the theoretical market value of the warrants as of the date of transfer  calculated by an independent valuation agent engaged by the Company by use of the Black & Scholes valuation model. Warrants may be transferred to the Participants free-of-charge provided that it does not entail negative tax consequences for the group (only applicable with respect to Participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden). The market value is preliminary estimated to SEK 0.12 per warrant  based on a market value of the underlying share corresponding to SEK 1.50 and a subscription price of SEK 4.50 per new share.The Participants may be allocated warrants as set forth below. No Participant may be offered a higher number of warrants than the maximum allocation set forth below.Category Maximum number of warrants per Participant Maximum number of warrants within the respective category Chairman of the board of directors 800 000 800 000 Other board members (5 persons) 400 000 2 000 000A Participant can choose to acquire a lower but not a higher number of warrants than offered to the Participant.For Participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden  it is implied that transfer of warrants is legally possible and that transfer  in the Company's opinion  can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial efforts. The Company shall have the right to adjust the terms of the Warrant Programme 2022/2027 to the extent required in order for allotment of warrants to participants in other jurisdictions  to the extent practically possible  to be made under the same conditions imposed by the Warrant Programme 2022/2027.Number of shares and votes in the CompanyThe total number of shares in the Company at the time of issuance of this notice is 532 687 650.

The model results in better risk forecasting for asset managers  asset owners and hedge funds with portfolio exposure in the high yield and investment grade space.The Axioma Credit Spread Factor Risk Model can be accessed within Qontigo's award-winning cloud-native enterprise portfolio risk management system  Axioma Risk  and has also been designed to work with portfolio optimization tools. For example  by uploading risk model and exposure files into the Axioma Portfolio Optimizer  users can achieve advanced portfolio construction goals such as minimizing benchmark tracking error while realizing desired exposure tilts.""The Credit Factor Model is built from our extensive collection of issuer credit curves "" said Chris Sturhahn  Chief Product Officer for Analytics. ""Because our factors are derived from the most liquid part of each issuer curve  with bond specific risk estimated from the residuals of issuer curve returns instead of factors based on sector or index spread levels  our model has greater explanatory power for bond returns. The result is more accurate risk and meaningful performance attribution.""Some key benefits of the enhanced model include:Rich Duration Times Spread (DTS)-based factor structure capturing the impact of market exposure  industry groups  country or region  and credit qualitySeparate factor groups for USD IG  USD HY  Euro  Sterling and YenCDS basis factors to ensure consistent yet differentiated modeling of CDS and bondsSuperior specific risk estimation at both the issue and issuer levelBond exposures generated from 12 000 issuer credit spread curves and a proprietary issuer identification methodology that determines bond-to-issuer mappingsIn addition to the Axioma Credit Spread Factor Risk Model  a bottom-up  curves-based granular risk framework known as the Axioma Credit Spread Curve Risk Model is also available. Both versions are part of the Axioma family of fixed income models which includes coverage for sovereign debt  derivatives  MBS  structured debt  commodities and other asset classes.About Qontigo --- Optimizing Impact™Qontigo is a leading global provider of innovative index  analytics and risk solutions that optimize investment impact.

3815,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.gurufocus.com/news/1697617/mawer-canadas-1stquarter-commentary,Mawer Canada's 1st-Quarter Com,23 hours ago,Market overview2022 started with a difficult and volatile period for financial markets globally. The long rally in equities  since the COVID-19 recession  came under stress with central banks turning more hawkish towards inflation. This was compounded by the uncertainties caused by the war in Ukraine including the resulting impact on commodity markets. While there was some variability across regions  many global equity indices entered correction territory during the quarter  although by the end of the period  most markets had partially recovered from their lows. A notable departure from this theme was commodity-heavy markets such as Canadian equities  which moved higher given their larger exposure to energy and mining companies.Supply uncertainty unleashed by the war in Ukraine added to existing inflationary pressures  sending commodity prices higher for crops  oil and gas  and metals. With inflation reaching multi-decade highs  the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada raised interest rates while also indicating the likelihood for more hikes this year. The market’s anticipation for an accelerated pace of rate hikes led Canadian bonds to suffer one of their worst quarters in decades. The Canadian dollar also strengthened against many foreign currencies this quarter  hampering the return of foreign asset classes.How did we do?Performance has been presented for the A-Series Mawer Mutual Funds in Canadian dollars and calculated net of fees for the 3-month period of January 1 – March 31  2022.EquitiesWithin the volatility of global markets  our relative performance this quarter lagged across our equity asset classes—in some cases substantially. A perfect storm emerged as many high-growth and high-quality businesses experienced a pullback  while less competitively advantaged  commodity-focused businesses led the market by a wide margin. In this environment  our equity strategies’ long-term focus on companies with enduring competitive advantages was undoubtedly overshadowed.Many of our higher-growth technology-focused holdings  whose cash flows skew further out into the future  have had their valuations more challenged by central banks’ decisions to raise rates in the face of inflationary pressures. Examples include e-commerce platform Shopify ( SHOP   Financial)   accounting and tax software provider Intuit ( INTU   Financial)   and payments processor Adyen ( XAMS:ADYEN   Financial) .  accounting and tax software provider   and payments processor . Wealth-creating companies  by virtue of the strength of their competitive advantages and the sustainability of their cash flows  are often priced at above-market price-to-earnings multiples to reflect this high quality and  as such  their valuations can exhibit greater sensitivity to rising interest rates. Examples consist of holdings that had their share price pull back this quarter after being terrific compounding investments over the last few years including reference data provider Wolters Kluwer ( XAMS:WKL   Financial)   IT consultant Accenture ( ACN   Financial)  and specialty chemicals company Sika ( XSWX:SIKA   Financial) .  IT consultant  and specialty chemicals company . Other holdings that displayed notable weakness this quarter included those that have revenue tied to financial market levels such as investment fund distribution platform Allfunds Group ( XAMS:ALLFG   Financial)  and private investments companies such as Bridgepoint Group ( LSE:BPT   Financial) and Partners Group ( XSWX:PGHN   Financial) which also experience headwinds from higher rates  lower valuations  and potentially lower fees.Given our philosophy  we tend to have lower exposure to commodity-focused business models. Hence  our underweight in the energy sector and metals and mining industry hampered relative performance this quarter.Where we have exposure to the energy sector in Canada  our holdings generally had strong returns including energy producers Canadian Natural Resources ( TSX:CNR   Financial) and Suncor Energy ( TSX:SU   Financial) .and . Similarly  where we have invested in the metals and mining industry  our holdings performed well including copper miner Grupo Mexico ( GMBXF   Financial)  gold miner Agnico Eagle Mines ( TSX:AEM   Financial)  and base metals miner Lundin Mining ( TSX:LUN   Financial).We also had some holdings that are not commodity-focused have relatively strong returns this quarter.Exchange operators including Deutsche Boerse ( XTER:DB1   Financial) and CME Group (CME) had strong returns as the companies are positioned to possibly benefit from higher interest rates and rate volatility.and had strong returns as the companies are positioned to possibly benefit from higher interest rates and rate volatility. Holdings that may benefit from the inflationary environment also performed well including insurance broker Aon given its commission structure  and convenience store operator Alimentation Couche-Tard (TSX:ATD) given higher fuel margins and the relatively price-insensitive nature of its merchandise customers.Emerging Markets was one of the lower performing regions over the quarter  facing headwinds in China as the country grappled with COVID-19 lockdowns. Russia was also obviously a notable driver of weakness for the region. For balanced investors Mawer’s direct exposure to Russia was very limited and  as the Russia-Ukraine conflict unfolded  we made the decision to exit all our Russian holdings across our portfolios. The timing for exiting our remaining Russian holdings remains uncertain given interruptions in the ability to trade.Balanced investors were affected this quarter by negative returns from bonds and most equity asset classes as it was the weakest period for global equities since the COVID-19 recession. While often bond returns dampen or offset the effect of equity markets  both asset classes experienced similar levels of decline given the dramatic relative rise in yields.From an asset mix perspective  we trimmed our equity target on two occasions  once in January and another late in the quarter. Rather than adding the proceeds to bonds  we elected to increase our cash target to help lower the sensitivity of the portfolio to rising interest rates. For balanced investors with dedicated Canadian equity allocations  the trim to equities left our Canada weight untouched as we have been comfortable seeing our allocation to Canada drift higher. We believe this helps provide more resilience in scenarios of elevated commodity prices or additional supply shocks arising from geopolitical events. Given the current market environment we are more comfortable keeping a lid on our overall equity weight  although we still remain overweight compared to the benchmark.OutlookAs we move forward  the range of possible scenarios is wide as market participants navigate an environment of rising interest rates while also trying to understand the ramifications of the war in Ukraine. With the Russian economy effectively shut off from the western world due to sanctions  we appear to be experiencing a shift away from globalization  the long-term implications of which remain to be seen. In the short-term  inflationary pressures have accelerated with supply chain disruptions persisting and commodity markets running rampant  increasing the challenges for central banks to tame inflation without hampering growth. The U.S. and Canadian yield curves also flattened in the quarter  a potential warning sign for a future slowdown in growth. Yet  on the encouraging side  there are still potential positive offsets from consumers with pent-up demand  a healthy employment environment  and the hope for a resolution to the conflict in Ukraine.With the degree of realized volatility across asset classes during the first quarter  one of the risks is that something breaks. The suspension of nickel trading on the London Metal Exchange in March is one sign of something breaking  but the greater risk is that the volatility we’ve seen upsets more fundamental parts of the financial or banking system  areas we are watching closely for signs of distress.In the middle of a storm  we believe what's most important is being disciplined in adhering to our investment philosophy—and the consistent execution of our process. Predicting the economy’s future is an exceptionally tough task and we do not believe we can do so with any degree of statistically significant success. Rather  we aim to build a resilient portfolio through our bottom-up process: analyzing companies’ competitive advantages and the strength of their management teams  while taking a probabilistic approach to estimating valuation. Given a wide range of possible scenarios  we remain balanced in our approach in an effort to build resilience over the long-term and not being overly exposed to any one outcome. As always  we remain committed to helping our clients manage through uncertainty.This document is for information purposes only.

(NYSE: ""CLB US"" and Euronext Amsterdam: ""CLB NA"") (""Core""  ""Core Lab""  or the ""Company"") reported first quarter 2022 revenue of...","FIRST QUARTER REVENUE OF $115.3 MILLION; UP 6% YEAR-OVER-YEARFIRST QUARTER GAAP EPS OF $(0.04); EPS  EX-ITEMS  $0.08LAUNCH OF INDUSTRY CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION (""CCS"") CONSORTIUMCCS STRATEGIC ALLIANCE WITH TALOS ENERGY INC.REDUCES NET DEBT BY $3.3 MILLIONANNOUNCES Q2 2022 QUARTERLY DIVIDENDAMSTERDAM  April 27  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Core Laboratories N.V. (NYSE: ""CLB US"" and Euronext Amsterdam: ""CLB NA"") (""Core""  ""Core Lab""  or the ""Company"") reported first quarter 2022 revenue of $115 300 000. Core's operating loss was $400 000  with a loss per diluted share of $0.04  all in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). Operating income  ex-items  a non-GAAP financial measure  was $7 200 000  yielding operating margins of 6.2% and earnings per diluted share (""EPS"")  ex-items  of $0.08. During the first quarter of 2022  the Company recorded: 1) approximately $3 900 000 of non-cash stock compensation expense associated with full recognition of awards when employees reach their eligible retirement age  2) severance and facility consolidation expense of $3 300 000  and 3) bad debt expense of $800 000 for doubtful accounts receivable due from Ukraine clients. The severance and facility consolidation expense is associated with Core's continuing strategic objective to improve operational efficiencies and optimize Core's global network to support its clients. In addition to the anticipated typical seasonal decline in the first quarter of 2022  financial results were further impacted by higher-than-expected business disruptions associated with COVID-19 and the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict. A full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures is included in the attached financial tables.Core's CEO  Larry Bruno stated  ""First and foremost our thoughts are with our Ukrainian employees and their families during the unprecedented conflict. Core Lab has suspended operations in Ukraine to secure their safety. During the first quarter of 2022  two significant events impacted Core's financial results: 1) the continued outbreak and global spread of the Omicron variant of COVID-19  which generated a significantly greater impact than initially anticipated  and 2) business disruptions associated with the geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine  which negatively impacted both business segments.Story continuesDespite these headwinds  we were pleased to announce an emerging growth opportunity during the first quarter  as we formalized our collaboration with Talos Energy Inc. (""Talos"") to deliver CCS solutions aimed at reducing industrial carbon emissions. This alliance  built on complementary technical strengths in subsurface characterization and reservoir optimization  will enhance the speed at which scalable  reliable and sustainable carbon sequestration solutions can be delivered to the market. We are excited about the positive impact this work will ultimately have  by both returning value to our shareholders and advancing CO 2 emission reduction initiatives. Additionally  during the first quarter of 2022  Core Lab inaugurated a joint-industry CCS consortium. Core Lab has a long history of conducting successful multi-company projects aimed at evaluating oil and gas opportunities. This new consortium will enhance the nascent CCS industry's knowledge of the geotechnical challenges associated with subsurface storage of CO 2   with a focus on reservoir capacity  injectivity and containment integrity  all of which align with Core Lab's expertise in subsurface characterization. As government regulations encourage investment in CCS projects  Core Lab will see growing opportunities to leverage this expertise.Looking forward  Core Lab's outlook for the remainder of 2022 remains positive with sequential improvement expected in the second quarter followed by further acceleration during the second half of the year. Furthermore  we continue to anticipate a multi-year international cycle supported by market fundamentals.""Russia-Ukraine Conflict and COVID-19 Business ImpactThe on-going geopolitical conflict between Russia and Ukraine is adversely impacting service revenue and product sales  affecting both business segments. To date  Reservoir Description has been more heavily impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As part of Core's global laboratory network  the Company provides analytical services on crude oil  natural gas and derived products  including both reservoir condition analysis and ambient condition assay work. Business interruptions arising from cyber-attacks against third party facilities began prior to direct military engagement; these cyber-attacks disrupted demand for crude-oil assay work  particularly in Europe. As direct military conflict ensued  disruptions in crude-oil assay work in Europe  Russia and Ukraine were even further negatively impacted. Traditional supply chains associated with the movement of crude oil are realigning to new logistical patterns in response to both the military conflict and the economic sanctions imposed on Russia. Given that global demand for crude oil and natural gas has not meaningfully diminished  Core Lab expects supply channels to realign  and the demand for the Company's associated laboratory services to resume  albeit with a different geographic spread. Completion product sales delivered through Core's Production Enhancement segment directly into Ukraine have also been suspended. Core has historically generated approximately 5% to 8% of its total revenue from Russia  Ukraine and the Southeastern European region.Also during the first quarter of 2022  global COVID-19 caseloads rose very sharply as the Omicron variant spread across all regions. More than 15% of Core Lab's employees tested positive for COVID-19 during the first quarter. In addition  other staff were subject to quarantine restrictions. As a business that runs on people more than  for example  equipment rental day rates  this higher-than-expected surge in COVID-19 cases caused disruption to the Company's operations; concurrently  clients were also impacted by the spike in COVID-19 cases and quarantine requirements  which delayed progress on projects.Reservoir DescriptionReservoir Description operations are closely correlated with trends in international and offshore activity levels  with approximately 80% of revenue sourced from outside the U.S. Reservoir Description revenue in the first quarter of 2022 was $74 800 000  down 7% sequentially and flat year-over-year. Operating income for the first quarter of 2022 on a GAAP basis was $400 000  while operating income  ex-items  was $3 900 000  yielding operating margins of 5%. Cost of operations in the first quarter of 2022 increased due to restoration of employee salary costs and continued operational inefficiencies associated with the global pandemic. In addition to the greater-than-expected COVID-19 caseload and typical seasonal decline in revenue  first quarter 2022 Reservoir Description results were negatively impacted by the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict. The military conflict disrupted traditional patterns of crude oil movement in Russia  Ukraine and Europe and negatively affected demand for Core Lab's crude oil assay work in these regions.During the first quarter of 2022  Core conducted a large core and reservoir data analysis workshop for Kuwait Oil Company (""KOC""). This comprehensive five-day workshop was the culmination of a multi-year  multi-well analytical program that included proprietary Core Lab technologies and interpretation techniques  focused on hydrocarbon potential and pay recognition in prospective unconventional and tight conventional reservoir targets. Core leveraged its proprietary  web-enabled RAPID™ database to organize and analyze well and laboratory data. Fracture analysis and interpretation was conducted utilizing Core's Dual-Energy Computed Tomography Scanner  which allowed for 3D visualization of conventional cores and calibration of third-party borehole image logs. Advanced petrophysical log models were developed that included fluid flow prediction and assessment of well productivity. KOC stated that the workshop was a great success and their technical teams are able to incorporate and build on the recently concluded work. An expansion of the study is currently being planned to include other fields and also to address additional reservoir challenges.During the first quarter of 2022  Core Lab  under the direction of The CarbonNet Project commenced the next phase of advanced rock property analysis on conventional core extracted from the Gular-1 appraisal well  located in the Gippsland Basin  offshore southeast Australia. The CarbonNet Project is expected to be a world-class  CCS center to manage future carbon emissions from industrial sources in South East Australia. In a recent press release  the CarbonNet Project announced  ""The CarbonNet Project is advancing the science and viability for establishing a commercial-scale carbon capture and sequestration network."" If successful  the network would bring together multiple carbon dioxide (""CO 2 "") capture projects in Victoria's Latrobe Valley  transporting CO 2 via a shared pipeline and injecting it into deep  underground  offshore storage sites in the Bass Strait. During this phase of the CarbonNet Project analytical program  Core Lab is employing proprietary technologies to provide detailed insight into rock and pore system properties  rock-fluid compatibility  and fluid flow behaviors  as well as geomechanical properties. The results of the advanced testing will be utilized to expand the CarbonNet Project's understanding of the CO 2 storage capacity  optimal methodologies for injecting CO 2 and the integrity of the seal rock  all of which are critical to evaluating and reducing geologic risk associated with the project. A substantial risk in any CO 2 sequestration project is failing to properly assess the complexity of the targeted geologic subsurface formation and the in-situ pore fluids. Core Lab's eighty-plus years of expertise in evaluating subsurface geology and fluid flow through natural porous media is essential for accessing these types of CO 2 sequestration projects.Production EnhancementProduction Enhancement operations  which are focused on complex completions in unconventional  tight-oil reservoirs in the U.S.  as well as conventional offshore projects across the globe  posted first quarter 2022 revenue of $40 500 000  down 10% sequentially and up 27% year-over-year. Operating loss on a GAAP basis was $900 000  while operating income  ex-items  was $3 100 000  yielding operating margins of 8%. Production Enhancement's financial performance for the first quarter of 2022 was impacted by a sequential decrease of 19% in international product sales  which includes the suspension of product sales into Ukraine. However  energetic product sales into the U.S. market increased over 7% sequentially.Production Enhancement has been a long-standing innovator of both energetic system products and diagnostic services  which aim to improve completions and monitor well performance. With Core's combined expertise in energetic systems and design and engineering of diagnostic technologies  Core Lab is pleased to announce the introduction of its patent-pending GoTrace™ product solution. GoTrace™ is an innovative  organically-developed  technology that directly incorporates Core's diagnostic services into the Company's energetic system products. The integration of Core's proprietary perforating products and diagnostic tracers into one system allows Core's clients to cost-effectively introduce unique tracers into specific perf clusters simultaneous with the perforating process. By providing diagnostic evaluation at the cluster level  clients gain significantly more granularity when evaluating a completion program  as compared to stage-level diagnostic treatment alternatives. Recently  TotalEngeries SE utilized Core's GoTrace™ technology in a recompletion project in the Barnett Shale. By deploying GoTrace™  TotalEnergies SE was able to determine whether the new perforation clusters were effectively stimulated. Core's diagnostic analysis of the restimulation treatment confirmed the clusters created with GoTrace™ were effectively stimulated  thus optimizing well performance.Free Cash Flow and DividendDuring the first quarter of 2022  Core continued to generate free cash flow (""FCF"")  with cash from operations of $5 300 000 and capital expenditures of $2 300 000  yielding FCF of $3 000 000. Core's free cash will continue to be returned to its shareholders via the Company's regular quarterly dividend and opportunistic share repurchases  as well as being applied towards reducing long-term debt.On 2 February 2022  Core's Board of Supervisory Directors (""Board"") announced a quarterly cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock  which was paid on 7 March 2022 to shareholders of record on 14 February 2022. Dutch withholding tax was deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.On 27 April 2022  the Board approved a cash dividend of $0.01 per share of common stock payable in the second quarter of 2022. The second quarter dividend will be payable on 31 May 2022  to shareholders of record on 9 May 2022. Dutch withholding tax will be deducted from the dividend at a rate of 15%.Return On Invested CapitalThe Board and the Company's Executive Management continue to focus on strategies that maximize return on invested capital (""ROIC"") and FCF  factors that have high correlation to total shareholder return. Core's commitment to an asset-light business model and disciplined capital stewardship promotes capital efficiency and are designed to produce more predictable and superior long-term ROIC.The Board has established an internal performance metric of demonstrating superior ROIC performance relative to the oilfield service companies listed as Core's Comp Group by Bloomberg  as the Company continues to believe superior ROIC will result in higher total return to shareholders. Bloomberg's calculations using the latest comparable data available indicate that Core Lab's ROIC of 6.7% is one of the highest for all major companies in the oilfield service Comp Group.Industry and Core Lab Outlook and GuidanceAs the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical conflict continues and the sanctions on Russia have expanded  the global crude-oil market continues to tighten  with demand for crude oil approaching pre-COVID-19 levels  resulting in higher crude-oil commodity prices. With consistent elevated crude-oil commodity prices and the tightening of crude-oil supply  the industry is preparing for an increase in activity  driven by demand  resulting in a multi-year cycle. These crude-oil market fundamentals are reflected in the gradual increase in the international rig count  with more oilfield equipment coming under contract and expanded capital spending plans for 2022. Core sees these as leading indicators of a growing international cycle.With Core Lab having more than 70% of its revenue exposed to international activity  both business segments remain active on international projects. As additional field development projects emerge  wells need to be drilled and reservoir rock and fluid sampled before Reservoir Description participates in the cycle. The expansion of international developments  both short and long-cycle projects  provides growth opportunities for both segments into 2022 and beyond  with a particular focus on the South Atlantic Margin  Latin America  and the Middle East.Core's North America revenue is correlated with completion and stimulation events and large-scale reservoir rock and reservoir fluid characterization studies  rather than with immediate changes in rig count. Wells need to be drilled and subsequently completed  stimulated  and cored  or have reservoir fluid samples collected  before Core can realize a revenue event. Core expects to continue benefiting from increased U.S. onshore activity  albeit led by private operators and somewhat moderated by capital discipline for larger publicly-traded operators.For the second quarter of 2022  Core projects its business to improve  primarily from increasing activity levels in the U.S. and moderate improvement in international  offshore and deepwater markets  potentially offset by uncertainties associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Core projects second quarter 2022 revenue to range from $119 000 000 to $125 000 000 and operating income of $9 400 000 to $11 800 000  yielding operating margins of approximately 9%. EPS for the second quarter of 2022 is expected to be $0.12 to $0.16.The Company's second quarter 2022 guidance is based on projections for underlying operations and excludes gains and losses in foreign exchange. Second quarter 2022 guidance also assumes an effective tax rate of 20%.Earnings Call ScheduledThe Company has scheduled a conference call to discuss Core's first quarter 2022 earnings announcement. The call will begin at 7:30 a.m. CDT / 2:30 p.m. CEST on Thursday  28 April 2022.

Over the period  new contract signatures exceeded internal forecasts and revenue was above analysts' expectations. While the performance of Q1 2021 established a high comparison base  the company did not anticipate a particular increase in its activity level and is therefore satisfied with the dynamics observed in the first 3 months of the year.The decrease in revenue compared to Q1 2021 is mainly due to the success of the subscription contracts managed by Axway in the cloud on behalf of its customers  which  unlike subscription contracts managed by the customers themselves  do not result in the early recognition of upfront revenue. As a result  several of the most important subscription deals signed during the period will only have an impact on revenue growth in the coming quarters.On the product side  the company continued to see strong interest in its 4 key offerings:- the Amplify platform has been chosen by several major clients in Latin America  Asia/Pacific and Europe thanks to the relevance of its development roadmap - in addition to the closing of a significant customer managed subscription contract with a TCV of €3.5 million  over the quarter  the MFT solution was reinforced by a new public cloud offering that quickly resulted in several contract signatures - the B2B offering generated the most important Axway managed subscription contract of the quarter thanks to a cloud project with a TCV of €3.1 million - the Digital Finance offer has convinced new key business partners in Europe  including  among others  Accenture.The entire portfolio of offers continues to evolve to always better meet the needs of customers. In addition  during the first quarter of the year  Axway continued to invest in supporting its strategy  particularly in the area of marketing  and observed a growth of nearly 185% in the value of new customers’ contracts compared to Q1 2021.Patrick Donovan  Axway's Chief Executive Officer  said:""We started 2022 with good cadence on all our major projects. By successfully signing major contracts in each of our four regions of operation  we have been able to exceed our internal quarterly forecasts. This dynamic gives us momentum for the second quarter as we continue to evolve our Amplify platform  which marks our differentiation in the market. While the trend towards subscription offerings accelerates and confirms our vision  we continue to offer a very flexible engagement method to our customers to allow them to move at their own pace  according to their needs. In the first quarter we also began the rationalization of our product portfolio  as announced at the time of the publication of our annual results. We will continue our efforts in this area throughout the year  with the objective of focusing on our core offerings to improve our growth and profitability. Finally  it should be noted that during the first three months of the year  the persistent economic and geopolitical uncertainties did not affect the building of our pipeline  which is a good sign for the rest of the year.""Comments on Q1 2022 activityAxway Software: Consolidated revenue 1st Quarter 2022 (€m) Q1 2022 Q1 2021Restated* Q1 2021Reported TotalGrowth Organic Growth Constant CurrencyGrowth Revenue 66.9 68.6 66.3 0.9% -2.4% -2.4% * Revenue at 2022 scope and exchange ratesAxway's revenue for Q1 2022 was €66.9 million  representing total growth of 0.9% and an organic decline of 2.4%. Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of €2.2 million on quarterly revenue  mainly due to the appreciation of the US dollar and the Brazilian real against the euro.Axway Software: Revenue by business line 1st Quarter 2022 (€m) Q1 2022 Q1 2021Restated* Q1 2021Reported TotalGrowth OrganicGrowth License 3.7 4.0 3.8 -3.2% -7.4% Subscription 26.4 24.4 23.7 11.4% 8.2% Maintenance 27.9 30.8 29.8 -6.3% -9.5% Services 9.0 9.3 9.0 -1.0% -4.0% Axway Software 66.9 68.6 66.3 0.9% -2.4% * Revenue at 2022 scope and exchange ratesLicense activity generated revenue of €3.7 million in Q1 2022 (6% of total revenue)  an organic decline of 7.4 % compared to the previous year. Despite heterogeneous regional situations  overall activity was down on the solid commercial performance of Q1 2021. As for more than 2 years  the flexibility of the subscription-based offerings continues to convince a majority of customers. However  Axway anticipates a clear slowdown in License activity revenue decline over the full year compared to 2021.In spite of a very high comparison base due to the recognition of significant upfront revenue in Q1 2021  2022 bookings and deferred revenue from previous quarters enabled the Subscription activity to continue its growth. The latter has continued to develop at a satisfactory pace  with organic growth of 8.2% over the period  reaching €26.4 million in revenue (39% of total revenue). Thanks to several major successes of the MFT and B2B offerings  in the quarter  the annual contract value (ACV) of new subscription contracts signed reached €7.0 million  up 22.3% compared to Q1 2021.Revenue from the Maintenance activity amounted to €27.9 million in Q1 2022 (42% of total revenue)  an organic decrease of 9.5%. In line with previous quarters  the decline in activity is due to lower demand for licenses  which is explained by a confirmed preference of new customers for subscription-based contracts and the accelerated migration of existing customers to these more flexible offerings.In Q1 2022  Axway's ARR  which is a key indicator of the future revenue growth potential  was €182.3 million  up 2.7% compared to Q1 2021. Recurring revenue for the quarter which includes Subscription and Maintenance activities  represented 81% of total revenue or €54.3million  of which €8.2 million of upfront revenue recognized on the signature of customer managed subscription contracts.Services revenue decreased organically by 4.0% in the quarter  to €9.0 million  or 13% of total revenue. This decrease is explained by the continued rise of subscription contracts which generally require a lower level of services.Axway Software: Revenue by geographic area 1st Quarter 2022 (€m) Q1 2022 Q1 2021Restated* Q1 2021Reported TotalGrowth OrganicGrowth France 18.1 18.8 18.8 -3.4% -3.4% Rest of Europe 13.2 16.7 16.7 -20.7% -21.0% Americas 30.3 28.5 26.5 14.3% 6.2% Asia/Pacific 5.3 4.5 4.4 21.0% 16.2% Axway Software 66.9 68.6 66.3 0.9% -2.4% * Revenue at 2022 scope and exchange ratesFrance reported revenue of €18.1 million (27% of total revenue) in Q1 2021  an organic decrease of 3.4%. The growth of the License and Subscription activities in the country was not sufficient to compensate for the decline in Maintenance and Services over the period.With revenue of €13.2 million (20% of total revenue)  the Rest of Europe region experienced an organic decline of 21.0% in Q1 2022. Whereas at the beginning of last year  several significant migrations to subscription-based offerings had been signed  establishing a high comparison base  this year the commercial trend proved more buoyant for Axway managed subscription contracts which  by nature  do not generate upfront revenue recognition.The Americas (USA & Latin America) generated revenue of €30.3 million (45% of total revenue) in Q1 2022  representing organic growth of 6.2%. This good performance reflects the dynamism of the Subscription and License activities  both of which showed significant growth (> 20%) over the first 3 months of the year.The Asia/Pacific region saw its revenues grow by 16.2% organically to reach €5.3 million (8% of total revenue) for the quarter. As in 2021  the region was buoyed by the success of the Subscription activity  which grew by nearly 170% in the quarter.Financial position at March 31  2022At March 31  2022  Axway had cash of €34.6 million and net debt of €27.0 million.Axway highlights that  if necessary  it has access to unutilized financing capacity under its existing revolving credit facility.2022 Targets & OutlookFor 2022  Axway’s objective is to achieve organic revenue growth of between 1% and 3%. The company also aims to improve its profitability  with a margin on operating activities of between 12% and 14% of revenue for the year.In the medium term  Axway's ambition remain:→ to achieve revenue of €500m through organic growth in sales and through acquisitions → to return to operating margin on business activity rates above 15% → to sustainably increase earnings per share to above €1.Financial calendarTuesday  May 24  2022  2:30 p.m. (UTC+2): Annual Shareholders' MeetingTuesday  July 26  2022  after market closing: Publication of 2022 Half-Year ResultsTuesday  July 26  2022  6:30 pm (UTC+2): 2022 Half-Year Results Virtual Analyst ConferenceThursday  October 20  2022  before market opening: Publication of Q3 2022 RevenueGlossary and Alternative Performance MeasuresRestated revenue: Revenue for the prior year  adjusted for the consolidation scope and exchange rates of the current year.Organic growth: Growth in revenue between the period under review and the prior period  restated for consolidation scope and exchange rate impacts.Growth at constant exchange rates: Growth in revenue between the period under review and the prior period restated for exchange rate impacts.ACV: Annual Contract Value – Annual contract value of a subscription agreement.TCV: Total Contract Value – Full contracted value of a subscription agreement over the contract term.Profit on operating activities: Profit from recurring operations adjusted for the non-cash share-based payment expense  as well as the amortization of allocated intangible assets.NPS: Net Promoter Score – Customer satisfaction and recommendation indicator for a company.Employee Engagement Score: Measurement of employee engagement through an independent annual survey.ARR: Annual Recurring Revenue – Expected annual billing amounts from all active maintenance and subscription agreements.DisclaimerThis press release contains forward-looking statements that may be subject to various risks and uncertainties concerning the Axway’s growth and profitability  notably in the event of future acquisitions.

Other brands  such as Sobieski  are making good progress in the on-trade segment. Against the backdrop of a sharp slowdown in sales in the market for under-12-year blended whisky (down 7.0%)  it can be noted a limited drop for William Peel (down 3.7%) in Q1 2022 compared with the same period in 2021  thanks in particular to the listing in the second half of 2021 with a new distribution player  which allowed the brand to solidfy its market share.This positive quarter-on-quarter change in sales for the France cluster should be seen against the highly disruptive background of disruption in the raw material supply chain since the beginning of March  particularly since the outbreak of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict  and the significant price rises (especially for glassware during April)  leading to the risk of allocations based on the volumes available.International clusterThe Q1 2022 Net Sales of the International cluster amounted to €20.7 million  up 6.3% at constant exchange rates compared with Q1 2021.In Western Europe  on top of the end of COVID-related health restrictions  trading in early 2022 continued to reflect a strong recovery in the United Kingdom (after a near complete shutdown for the same period in 2021)  with good gains for the Marie Brizard brand (by value and portfolio weight).In the Middle East  there was good development of the Marie Brizard brand in the syrups category  an activity that is expected to grow.Spain reported a 2% decline in Net Sales  driven by strong growth in on-trade brand sales (particularly for Marie Brizard)  cross-border sales (William Peel)  a proactive pricing policy but also a decrease in sales of the subcontracting activity  mainly due to difficulties in the supply of bottles.Scandinavia (following the lifting of COVID-related restrictions at the end of January) saw its Net Sales increase very significantly from a low volume base.Q1 2022 Net Sales in the Baltic countries were impacted negatively by a mechanical effect of customer overstocking at the end of 2021 in anticipation of the increase in excise duties  the sharp rise in energy prices  as well as the immediate consequences of the war in Ukraine on exports to Russia and Belarus (not significant at overall Group level). These declines were partially compensated by a proactive pricing policy.Bulgaria reported strong growth across its entire brand portfolio of spirits and wines in Q1 2022  both in its domestic market and for export (Greece  Turkey  Hungary  etc.)  together with sustained subcontracting activity for Romania.In Poland  sales of our brands enjoyed significant growth thanks to a fine performance by Cognac Gautier  the development of Marie Brizard liqueurs and stable sales of William Peel.In the United States  Q1 2022 Net Sales were down year on year. Q1 2022 remained marked by a slowdown in Sobieski sales due to the evolution of the Vodka category.These unfavourable effects were only partially offset by the good performance of the Marie Brizard and Cognac Gautier brands.Canada  on the other hand  was the main contributor to the growth in Net Sales of the Direct Export business during the quarter.Brazil experienced a significant decline in Net Sales compared with 2021  for all brands except Marie Brizard. The price increase applied to the entire portfolio helps to limit the decline observed.In the Asia-Pacific region  Q1 2022 Net Sales were driven by good performance in Korea  Taiwan and Japan  despite the absence of sales in the Chinese market.OutlookAs already indicated in the press release on the 2021 annual results (issued on 14 April)  and as described above  MBWS Group  like other players in the wine and spirits sector  is regularly facing supply chain pressures relating to the periodic unavailability of certain raw materials and dry goods  a sequence that started with the easing of Covid restrictions and continued during the first quarter of 2022.Sharp increases in purchasing costs have already been noted at the end of 2021  particularly for glassware following the disorganisation of this sector after the Covid pandemic. The Group therefore already implemented price increases at the beginning of the year.However  since the beginning of April and following the events in Ukraine  the immediate and significant additional increases in raw material prices are potentially higher than the capacity to pass on prices downstream to distribution and customer partners.Combined with the volatile availability of suppliers' production  these impacts could have negative effects on the Group's ability to supply all its customers (in France and internationally)  and on the elasticity of consumer demand  notably given the need for the Group to adapt its commercial policies to this new context.This environment requires the Group to adopt a cautious view about commercial activity in the coming months and perhaps more particularly in the second half if there has not been a satisfactory settlement of the Russian-Ukrainian conflict by then and if its disruptive consequences persist.Financial calendarGeneral Meeting: 30 June 2022H1 2022 revenues: 28 July 2022Investor relations and shareholdersMBWS GroupEmilie Drexleremilie.drexler@mbws.comTél : +33 1 43 91 62 21 MediaImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurence Maurycdoligez@image7.fr – lmaury@image7.frTél : +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a Group of wines and spirits based in Europe and the United States.

Unaudited turnover for the 3 months period ending 31 March 2022 amounted to €1 104m  up 6 9% compared to the same period of the previous year.Unaudited EBITDA for the 9 months period ending 31 March 2022 amounted to €502 9m  up 15 7% compared to the same period of the previous year. Unaudited EBITDA for the 3 months period ending 31 March 2022 amounted to €167 5m  up 37 2% compared to the same period of the previous year.Unaudited EBIT for the 9 months period ending 31 March 2022 amounted to €224 5m  up 41 4% compared to the same period of the previous year . Unaudited EBIT for the 3 months period ending 31 March 2022 amounted to €75 4m  up 137 9% compared to the same period of the previous year.Ramsay Santé has continued in the 3 months to support the fight against the COVID by taking care of COVID patients in both France and Sweden. Activity levels in the Nordics have been solid and driven by specialist care patients post COVID in both Sweden and Denmark  COVID testing  vaccination activities and as well the impact of the acquisitions closed in the last 12 months.Adjusted for perimeter effect and at constant currency exchange rates  organic growth in revenue amounted to 6 6% for the last 9 months ending 31 March 2022 and amounted to 6% for the last 3 months ending 31 March 2022. This growth was mainly realised in Sweden  Denmark and Norway. Revenue growth in France mostly comes from the inclusion in tariffs of the funding for the national Ségur de la Santé initiatives. The growth has been achieved despite a drop in admissions in France due to the fifth Covid wave as well as staff shortages. The group announces in this environment the implementation of a set of social measures  including salaries  designed to strengthen its attractiveness to the medical staff.The French Government has extended the revenue guarantee decree from 1 January 2022 to 30 June 2022. The amount of government subsidies is essentially the same this quarter as in previous quarters. The Group continues to successfully implement its 2025 strategic plan  confirming its position as the leader in integrated digi-physical care in Europe. The group has thus strongly expanded its primary care activity  with 30% more centers at the end of March 2022 compared to June 2021 and 25% more patients cared for over the past nine months.On 7 March 2022  Ramsay Santé  through its Swedish subsidiary Capio Group Services AB (“Capio”)  has announced a recommended public offer to acquire GHP Specialty Care AB (“GHP”)  a Swedish specialty healthcare provider listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. Following the end of the initial acceptance period of the offer  Capio controls 96.6% of the total number of shares and voting rights of GHP. As a result  all conditions required for the completion of the offer have been satisfied and Capio has declared the offer unconditional. Settlement of the Offer will begin on 2 May 2022. Capio intends to initiate a squeeze-out procedure in accordance with Swedish regulations.Ramsay Health Care Ltd is publishing in parallel a trading update at the end of March 2022 which includes some of the information contained in this announcement.Pascal Roché  Chief Executive Officer of Ramsay Santé  says:Story continues« During the last 3 months  Ramsay Santé has continued to manage many Covid patients  while ensuring the resumption of normal activity  penalised for France by difficulties in recruiting medical staff. On the other hand  activity was very strong in all the Nordic countries  and the rollout of our “Yes We Care 2025” strategy is continuing successfully.

First Quarter 2022 and Recent Events and Pipeline UpdatesProduct candidatesNCX 470NCX 470 is a novel nitric oxide (NO)-donating prostaglandin analog currently in a Phase 3 clinical program for the lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.Owing to a better than expected enrollment rate in recent months  over 98% of the patients required to complete the NCX 470 Mont Blanc Phase 3 clinical trial have been enrolled.Patient enrollment is continuing in both the United States (U.S.) and China in the ongoing Denali Phase 3 clinical trial on NCX 470 in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Denali  which also includes a long-term safety extension  has been recruiting patients in the U.S. since November 2020. Approximately 670 patients are expected to be randomized at approximately 60 clinical sites in the U.S. and China  with approximately 80% of the patients to be recruited in the U.S. and the remaining 20% of the patients to be recruited in China. The topline results will not be available by the end of 2023 as previously communicated due to several hurdles (including the COVID-19 pandemic situation in the U.S. and China). The Company will announce a new date for availability of the results when we have more visibility on the overall timelines of the trial.The Chinese National Intellectual Property Administration has granted Nicox a formulation patent for NCX 470 in China to 2039. With the equivalent U.S. and European patents already granted  the formulation is now covered in most major global territories. NCX 470 is also covered by granted composition of matter patents. NCX 4251NCX 4251 is a novel  patented  ophthalmic suspension of fluticasone propionate nanocrystals in clinical development stage for dry eye disease. Following the encouraging post hoc results from the Mississippi Phase 2b clinical trial and a subsequent meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  the future development of NCX 4251 will be focused on dry eye disease. The Mississippi post hoc results  reported on November 30  2021  suggest that once-daily dosed NCX 4251  fluticasone propionate ophthalmic suspension 0.1%  is effective in reducing dry eye symptoms in patients who score more highly for a key sign of dry eye disease. The Company is currently exploring how to best advance the development of NCX 4251 in dry eye disease and will communicate its strategy at a future date.The Japanese Patent Office has granted a new patent expiring in 2040 for NCX 4251. Patent JP.7021301 covers ophthalmic suspensions comprising a specific form of fluticasone propionate nanocrystals and the method for manufacturing the ophthalmic suspensions. It complements the recent granting of a patent from the same family in Europe. Corresponding patent applications are under examination in the U.S.  China and other territories. Commercial Out-licensed ProductsVYZULTA ® (latanoprostene bunod ophthalmic solution)  0.024% U.S. prescriptions 1 increased by 43% in the first quarter of 2022 compared to first quarter 2021  however revenue remained unchanged due to an increased level of rebates. As of December 31  2021  VYZULTA  exclusively licensed worldwide to Bausch + Lomb  was commercialized in 7 territories: United States (2017)  Canada (2019)  Argentina (2020)  Mexico (2020)  Hong Kong (2020)  Taiwan (2021) and Ukraine (2021). VYZULTA is also approved in 9 other countries  namely Brazil  Colombia  Jordan  Qatar  Singapore  South Korea  Thailand  Turkey and United Arab Emirates. VYZULTA is indicated for the reduction of intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.Our partnership with Samil Pharmaceutical concerning ZERVIATE in South Korea has been expanded to include Vietnam.Our Chinese partner Ocumension Therapeutics successfully completed a Phase 3 clinical trial of ZERVIATE (cetirizine ophthalmic solution)  0.24% in Chinese patients with allergic conjunctivitis in which ZERVIATE was compared to emedastine difumarate ophthalmic solution  0.05%  an antihistamine marketed under the brand name EMADINE®. ZERVIATE was found to be non-inferior to emedastine difumarate in the primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in the itching score in the 24 hours prior to the Day 14 visit. ZERVIATE was safe and well-tolerated with no difference in the proportion of patients with adverse events compared to emedastine difumarate. This Phase 3 clinical trial was required for Ocumension to be able to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for approval to commercialize ZERVIATE in China. Other partnershipsThe U.S. FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation for naproxcinod for the treatment of sickle cell disease  which affects an estimated 100 000 Americans. Naproxcinod is a nitric oxide (NO)-donating naproxen combining the cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitory activity of naproxen with that of nitric oxide developed by Nicox and exclusively licensed to Fera in the U.S. Nicox has tested naproxcinod in over 2 700 patients in osteoarthritis  generating a significant package of clinical safety data which is available to support Fera’s development of naproxcinod  and ultimately an NDA submission for sickle cell disease. Management and AdvisorsIn December 2021  we announced the appointment of Doug Hubatsch as Chief Scientific Officer to lead all of the Company’s non-clinical and clinical development activities. Based in Nicox’s U.S. subsidiary Nicox Ophthalmics Inc.  he is responsible for setting the research and development strategy of the Group and is a member of the Nicox Executive Committee.In July 2021  we announced that two internationally recognized experts in glaucoma  Robert N. Weinreb  M.D.  Distinguished Professor and Chair  Ophthalmology and Director  Shiley Eye Institute  University of California San Diego  and Sanjay G. Asrani  M.D.  Professor of Ophthalmology  Duke University  joined the Nicox Glaucoma Clinical Advisory Board.2021 Financial SummaryNet revenue2 for the full year 2021 was €7.2 million (€2.4 million in net royalties  €4.8 million in license payments)  compared to €12.9 million (€2.4 million in net royalties  €10.5 million in license payments) for the full year 2020. The principal difference in revenue is due to an IFRS treatment of a licensing payment received from our partner Ocumension Therapeutics in 2020.Operating expenses for the year 2021 increased to €25.1 million from €19.5 million for the previous year among which €5.2 million comes from non-clinical and development expenses due to the advancement and progress of the Phase 3 trials on NCX 470.Net loss of the Nicox Group for the full year 2021 was €43.8 million against €18.1 million for the full year 2020. However  the 2021 net loss includes €27.8 million of non-recurring  non-cash items due to a reduction in the estimated fair value of ZERVIATE (of €12.7 million) and of NCX 4251 (of €15.1 million) reflecting  respectively  the changes in the allergic conjunctivitis market in the U.S. and the changes in the development plan and timeline for NCX 4251.As of December 31  2021  the Nicox Group had cash and cash equivalents of €42.0 million  as compared with €47.2 million at December 31  2020  and as previously announced  the Company is financed until Q4 2023  assuming the development of NCX 470 alone.As of December 31  2021  the Nicox Group had financial debt of €20.5 million  consisting of €18.5 million in the form of a bond financing agreement with Kreos Capital signed in January 2019 and a €2 million credit agreement guaranteed by the French State  and granted in August 2020 in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.First Quarter 2022 Financial HighlightsAs of March 31  2022  the Nicox Group had cash and cash equivalents of €35.1 million as compared with €42.0 million at December 31  2021.

3845,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/tech-gaming/flutter-approves-bumper-pay-rises-for-top-executives-41596988.html,Flutter approves bumper pay rises for top executives,Paddy Power owner Flutter has approved double-digit pay increases for its CEO and finance chief  despite opposition from two activist investors.,"Paddy Power owner Flutter has approved double-digit pay increases for its CEO and finance chief  despite opposition from two investment advisors.It brings chief executive officer Peter Jackson’s salary to just under £1.2m (€1.4m)  after a 26pc hike  and chief financial officer Jonathan Hill’s pay to £715 000 (€849 000)  a 20pc increase on 2021.The board approved the increase at its annual general meeting in Dublin on Thursday.Read MoreChairman Gary McGann told reporters afterwards that Flutter needed to retain and attract talent  and was still paying executives below its UK and US competitors.He said at least 70pc of shareholders agreed with the pay increase and that it would have “no impact on the share price at all”.Flutter shares are down by almost 50pc year on year as the pandemic boom in at-home gambling wanes.Shares were up 1.04pc to €95.42 in Euronext trading at 13.00  just over an hour after the board meeting ended.“We have to put a package in place that actually is attractive to retain Peter and Jonathan and  in the event they ever leave  to recruit that quality ” Mr McGann said.""This is an incredibly competitive sector. The consumer digital sector is the most competitive sector probably in the world right now.”At the board meeting on Friday  Flutter received pushback from 1000 university students who invested in the firm via the Trinity Student Managed Fund.Trinity students are “not happy” with Flutter’s record on helping problem gamblers - particularly young males - according to Olwyn Patterson  head of environment  social and governance (ESG) and social responsibility at the fund.CEO Peter Jackson said Flutter had done more than its competitors to tackle problem gambling  measuring the percentage of revenue from players with a deposit limit (in Australia) and the percentage of those who self-exclude within the year (in the UK and Ireland).He said the average Flutter user spends just €10 a week.“These are small amounts. Some of our competitors start with much higher average levels of spending. We constantly are leading this race to the top.”Last month  Flutter reported a £288m loss before tax  with adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation of £1 001m  18pc lower than 2020.Flutter recently added Italian online games site Sisal and UK online bingo provider Tombola to its portfolio. The buyouts follow a 2020 merger with the Toronto-listed Stars Group and the 2018 acquisition of US giant FanDuel.Mr Jackson said Flutter was concentrating on recent acquisitions and the US market  and was not looking to make any further acquisitions.“We’ve got arms quite full dealing with all of that at the moment  but also continuing to win in America. That’s where we’ve got to keep our focus.

The third quarter of this financial year covers the period from 1 January to 31 March 2022  corresponding to Q3 of the financial year 2021/22. The first nine months cover the period from 1 July 2021 to 31 March 2022.In the third quarter  GeoJunxion’s business continued to show resilience and good performances. Revenue grew by 76% compared to the same quarter of the previous financial year and order intake showed growth of about 81% again compared to the same period of last year. For the first nine months of 2021/22 (from June to March) the growth on the order intake is of about 57% compared with the same period of the previous year and revenue grew by a very encouraging 63% for the same period. It’s also worth remarking that the cash flow was positive for both the quarter and the accounting year to date  showing clear evidence of the on-going turnaround.The main driver for the growth realized in the current accounting year is coming from the Location Intelligence Services. These have attracted the attention of public and private companies in various industry sectors and resulted in the increased strength of our backlog and opportunity pipeline. It is also worth noticing that order intake continues the positive trend in the diversification across all our product lines and services. We also see a transition from one-off to recurring multi-year business opportunities.FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Q3 (JANUARY - MARCH) 2022 and YTD (JULY 2021 – MARCH 2022) VERSUS THE SAME PERIODS IN THE FINANCIAL YEAR 2020/21Positive Cash Flow for Q3 2021/22 (+€228K).

Based on the orders in hand  we confirm our expectation of revenue growth for the accounting year 2021/22  in the range of 40 to 50% compared to the 12-month period from July 2020 to June 2021. This means our revenue is expected to come in between €2.350 K and €2.550 K for the accounting year ending per 30 June 2022.OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS AND STRATEGY UPDATEStrategy UpdateGeoJunxion’s strategy remains focused on creating “map agnostic” data products: digital geo-localized content  designed to be fully integrated into or overlaid on any commercial or open-source maps  or to be utilised in developing smart solutions for a large variety of use cases  in different industries and market sectors.GeoJunxion’s activities are directed towards establishing long-term relationships with our customers  through the creation of recurring business models rather than one-off opportunities. Although the relationship with clients frequently starts with a proof-of-concept or a custom one-off project  most of the Company’s efforts go into building value-added  dynamic content  requiring continuous and frequent updates to maintain and increase their value over time. This means that most of our proof-of-concept and one-off projects are a launch-pad for establishing a service or license contract  converting the initial activities into a recurring  more predictable and sustainable business model.When executing projects  GeoJunxion typically also retains the Intellectual Property and ownership of the newly developed datasets and solutions  which can be subsequently resold to other customers. Thereby  leveraging the initial investment and creating a virtuous business cycle.Our mission remains focused on improving road safety and contributing to a more sustainable world  reducing the impact on the environment through intelligent solutions enabling more environmentally conscious decisions.Central to GeoJunxion’s strategy are:Cost effective sourcing  production  ingestion  and aggregation of geodata.Flexible licensing models at competitive pricing.Direct delivery of dynamic  up-to-date content via APIs.Highly customised solutions and content creation.Market DevelopmentsDespite the general situation improved significantly  COVID 19 still impacted the mentioned quarter. Most of the companies remained cautious in their investments delaying some scheduled activities. While clear signs of improvement were raising in some industry sectors  the new coming threat of the conflict in Ukraine has brought other concerns and forced existing and potential customers to pay even more attention in their expenditures. At the time of publishing this report  we had no material business exposure to the recent events in Ukraine. There are no active customers  or deliveries due to be received from Ukraine or Russia. GeoJunxion’s pipeline of opportunities has limited exposure towards both countries. GeoJunxion is however exposed to raising inflation rates  as any other Company  due to increased energy and other raw material prices  which may impact the salary & benefit expenses over time.In the Automotive and Autonomous driving sectors  GeoJunxion has issued a number of interesting proposals during this quarter. Some have turned into closed orders.Significant efforts have been put in expanding the existing relations with big Global Tech Companies. We continue to deliver unique data content to be utilized as geo-fences in a wide variety of use cases.Business DevelopmentIn the quarter from January to March 2022  GeoJunxion continued to maintain its attention on the High Alert Zones data suite. In this quarter the focus has been not only on the Eco Alert Zones  which continued to be developed and updated  but also on new algorithms which enabled the development of a new set of specialized Safety Alert Zones: the School Safety Zones  which were launched at the beginning of April.In addition to this new dataset  the Location Intelligence Services have played a primary role in the business development of the period. In fact  in February  we closed contracts for additional three tailor-made Location Intelligence Services with two large global Tech Companies. All the activities are planned to be completed within the mid of Q4 2021/22. Two of these contracts are Proofs of Concept  perfectly aligned with GeoJunxion’s strategy  focused on safety on the road and environmental sustainability. All these activities  in the near future  may lead to very interesting contracts extensions and additional opportunities.At the same time  we completed the renewal of an important annual service agreement with a public administration. This confirms the Company’s attitude to serve and satisfy existing customers at the largest possible extent  while generating recurring income.Our Outdoor Venue Plan and Location Intelligence Services continue receiving interest from existing and prospect customers. This interest comes from local Municipalities  engaged in their path to the digitalization of their services  but also from private organizations with the goal to improve their customers’ experience.Business development during the quarter has been primarily focused on the acquisition of a new significant Location Intelligence contract with an important Navigation and Infotainment Systems supplier in the Automotive industry. The verbal agreement was received  and contract details clarified during this extremely busy Q3 2021/22. The formal contract has been signed in the very first days of April. We embrace this opportunity as a long-term partnership with clear technical and commercial objectives in common with our client and partner and with the intent to establish a solid and fruitful relationship for the years to come.Product DevelopmentProduct development during the third quarter of the fiscal year 2021/22 (January-March ‘22) was focused on the creation of the School Safety Zones.School Safety Zones – the cover of the Product DatasheetThis dynamic dataset perfectly fits GeoJunxion’s mission to foster safety and sustainability through location-aware content. This creates added value to B2B clients operating in the Automotive  Transport & Logistics  Real Estate  Utilities & Services markets  as well as public organizations.The formal product launch was done in the first days of April  but the development has been entirely completed during the past quarter. Three countries have been fully deployed: The Netherlands  Germany  and Italy. Many other countries are scheduled in the product roadmap  starting with Belgium and France.School Safety Zones – over one hundred thousand school zones in three countriesThe School Safety Zones are smart polygons/areas created around the location of Schools and Kindergartens. The zones consider various parameters: the infrastructures in proximity of the schools utilized to commute to and from the school  such as zebra crossing  dangerous intersections  walking and bicycle paths  bus stops and metro stations. In addition  the opening and closing times and the holidays for each type of school. This data has been stored in the metadata to create a dynamic dataset  capable to inform when the areas are more crowded with vulnerable pedestrians. At the end of the quarter  we deployed over one hundred thousand school zones  and we expect at least to double them by the end of the summer.School Safety Zones – an example of areas developed utilizing GeoJunxion’s proprietary algorithmsThe development of the School Safety Zones is also relevant due to the proprietary algorithms and mathematical methods used to create the areas. These are fully customizable  enabling us to build new types of smart polygons around other potentially dangerous areas  such as Hospitals  Playgrounds  Stadiums crowded event areas and many more.ORDER INTAKEThe order intake for the quarter January-March 2022 showed an increase of +81% compare with the same period of the previous year. When we consider the nine months of the current financial year  from June 2021 till March 2022  the growth in the order intake is about +57%  compared with the same period of the previous year.REVENUEThe Q3 2021/22 revenue increased by +76% compared to the same quarter last year. Revenue increased  with +63% in the period June ‘21 - March ’22. GeoJunxion tracks its revenue by product type and by the nature of the underlying contract (recurring versus non-recurring). The main revenue growth has been realized in non-recurring services  but also the recurring revenue from licenses  royalties and recurring services had an increase. The recurring service revenue primarily includes the updating services of our Eco Alert Zones product. The non-recurring service revenue includes the tailor-made collection of data sets and creation of geo-located content.ORGANIZATIONDuring the past quarter  the Operations and R&D have been strengthened by recruiting new hires. This was necessary to serve new and existing customers  but also to develop new IP  content  and services in a more efficient manner. We strongly believe in automation and efficiency in delivering quality products. For this reason  we intend to invest more in advanced research in fields like image detection  deep-learning and  more in general  in artificial intelligence applied to our business.FINANCIAL POSITIONGeoJunxion progresses in turning its business around from a digital map supplier focused on one-off large deals  to a premium location content and location intelligence service provider with a subscription based  recurring “data as a service” revenue model. During the quarter GeoJunxion has continued to invest in product development  in strengthening its R&D and Operations teams. The results reported for Q3 and the first nine months of the 2021/22 financial year are the evidence of this progress. Based on our current outlook  the available cash on hand is estimated to be sufficient to cover our operational requirements for at least the next 12 months.APPOINTMENT OF EXTERNAL AUDITOR – Status updateGeoJunxion is one of 9 actively trading companies  quoted on Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange  that have been unable to present audited financial statements  because of unavailability of a PIE/OOB licensed auditor. The proposed legislation regarding the future of the Dutch Accountancy Sector (voorstel voor de Wet toekomst accountancy sector)  includes a proposed process whereby the NBA (Nederlandse Beroepsorganisatie van Accountants)  at the request of the company  can assign a PIE/OOB licensed auditor and determine a reasonable fee for the auditing activities. The Management Board welcomes and supports this initiative and hopes that this proposal obtains the necessary support to be converted into legislation in a timely way.RISK MANAGEMENTRisk management is an integral managerial task. Our risk management and control procedures take into consideration the size of the company and the character of the business to identify the most significant risks which the company is exposed to. The risks identified are discussed on a periodical basis and mitigated or fully resolved  where possible. Such a system cannot provide absolute certainty that objectives will be realized. Neither can it guarantee prevention of potential cases of material mistakes  damage  fraud  or breaches of statutory laws.The 2020-21 annual report  as published in October 2021  describes the primary strategic  operational  and financial risks. The risks and uncertainties described in the annual report are relevant and are deemed incorporated and repeated by reference in this report. There were no cases of material damage  fraud or breaches of law detected since issuing the Annual Accounts.On the Social aspect  we continue to pay particular attention on preventive actions to limit exposure of our people to Covid-19  encouraging and supporting smart working from home  and establishing clear rules for those that need to be physically present in our offices. Our people are our key assets  and we do whatever we can to keep them safe and healthy.BOARD OF MANAGEMENT STATEMENTThe Board of Management hereby declares that  to the best of its knowledge  the summarized Q3 (January – March 2022) and the nine months period (July 2021– March 2022) interim consolidated financial statements  drawn up in accordance with IAS 34 “Interim financial reporting”  represents a faithful rendering of the assets  liabilities  financial position  profit and cash flow of GeoJunxion NV and its subsidiary as stated in the consolidated financial statements  and that the Board report  as included in this Interim Financial statements  represents a faithful rendering of the information required in relation to item 5:25d subs 8 and 9 of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act.GROUP STRUCTURE SIMPLIFICATIONThe GeoJunxion group structure was significantly simplified in the past quarters:The AND Data India Private Ltd entity liquidation process was completed  with the approval of the NCLT court in Mumbai in November.The two Dutch dormant entities: AND Publishers B.V. and AND Holding B.V. were liquidated.

This strong growth comes with challenging conditions regarding raw materials availability and price  but our companies have clearly shown their ability to adapt to fast changing environments. Our net asset value has been quite resilient  despite the first quarter stock market turmoil  and we opportunistically took advantage of the sizeable discount to NAV to buy back some Wendel shares.We have continued our objective of capital redeployment in line with our roadmap with the acquisition of ACAMS which further enhances the growth profile of our portfolio  following the acquisition of CPI. This transaction was creative  illustrating our team’s ability to carry out complex projects as the buyer of choice.As we look forward  our robust balance sheet with relatively little corporate and portfolio company leverage overall and our long-term perspective should allow us to continue to execute our roadmap capitalizing on acquisition opportunities which will likely result from current volatile circumstances.”Q1 2022 sales of Group companiesQ1 2022 consolidated sales(in millions of euros) Q1 2021 Q1 2022 Δ Organic Δ Bureau Veritas 1 154.7 1 290.1 +11.7% +8.0% Constantia Flexibles 366.7 464.2 +26.6% +17.8% Stahl 210.1 224.9 +7.0% +5.0% Crisis Prevention Institute 15.3 20.8 +35.8% +27.2% ACAMS(1) n.a 7.2 n.a n.a Consolidated net sales(2) 1 746.9 2 007.2 +14.9% +9.9%ACAMS accounts have been consolidated since March 11  2022.

Finally  in Africa and the Middle East (9% of revenue)  business increased by 13.9% on an organic basis  essentially driven by Buildings & Infrastructure and energy projects in the Middle East.The scope effect was a positive 0.5%  reflecting bolt-on acquisitions realized in the past few quarters. Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of 3.2%  mainly due to the appreciation of the USD and pegged currencies against the euro  which was partly offset by the depreciation of some emerging countries' currencies.2022 outlook confirmed:Based on a healthy sales pipeline and the significant growth opportunities related to Sustainability  and assuming there are no severe lockdowns in its main countries of operation due to Covid-19  for the full year 2022  Bureau Veritas still expects to:Achieve strong organic revenue growth; mid-single-digit organic revenue growth;Improve the adjusted operating margin;Generate sustained strong cash flow with a cash conversion5 above 90%.For more information: https://group.bureauveritas.comConstantia Flexibles –Record organic growth of 17.8% mostly driven by price increases  to compensate input cost inflation  as well as robust volume growth(full consolidation)Q1 2022 sales totaled €464.2 million  up 26.6% compared with Q1 2021 (€366.7 million). Constantia’s sales were up by 17.8% organically over the period  driven mostly by waves of price increases to compensate for the inflationary pressure input costs  notably raw materials and energy. It is worth noting that Q1 2022 has marked an encouraging return to organic volume growth  confirming the good momentum instilled by the new management team’s commercial initiatives. However  the market in India remains very challenging and management is reviewing several options for this division in order to address the challenges there.Consumer market revenues grew organically by 20.0% driven by price increases and volume growth  notably in snacks and baked goods. The Pharma division posted +11.5% organic growth driven mainly by prices. Q1 2022 is not completely comparable with Q1 2021  benefiting from the acquisition of Propak in June 2021 (impact of +6.8%).

Growth was tempered by COVID-related delays of onsite programs (which were rescheduled into Q2 2022)  but compared to Q1 2021  the number of affected programs were less  as the previous year’s Q1 experienced more widespread COVID restrictions.CPI continues to enjoy a mix shift toward digital solutions for both new CIs and renewals  with programs retaining the required in-person components.

Revenue was €109 million  up by +66.0% and including +55.7% organic growth compared to the first quarter of 2021. North America is the strongest geographical region thanks to sustained demand and success of the Tarkett range. Backlog remains at a particularly high level.Actions to reduce the cost structure are well underway and Tarkett is forecasting around €30 million of annual structural savings in 2022.The significant increase in oil and energy prices will contribute to the increase in purchasing costs now valued at €250 million compared to 2021 (against an estimated €220 million at the beginning of the year).Tarkett continues to implement selling price increases across all its geographies to offset the effect of increased purchasing costs over the year.

Beyond the substantial human cost  this invasion has triggered another increase in commodity prices  especially energy and food. This crisis is causing repercussions across all regions and sectors. Many importer countries are being particularly affected and are seeing the risk of social unrest increase.In this increasingly uncertain world  Coface has continued to support its clients and to implement its strategic plan.The strong economic growth in 2021 and our solid operating performance led to double-digit growth in trade credit insurance and information services  where we are continuing our proactive investment policy.Coface’s net income increased 17.5% to €66.2m. This figure is all the more impressive given that we booked the remaining cost of the government schemes (€33m  bringing the total to €199m). It corresponds to an annualised return on tangible equity of 13.2%  which is above our mid-cycle targets.Finally  we are pleased to confirm that a dividend per share of €1.50 will be proposed at our next Shareholders’ Meeting  which represents 100% of our 2021 income.”Story continuesKey figures at 31 March 2022The Board of Directors of COFACE SA examined the summary consolidated financial statements for the first three months (non-audited) during its meeting on 28 April 2022.

TurnoverCoface recorded a consolidated turnover of €430.8m  up +12.8% at constant FX and perimeter compared to Q1-21. On a reported basis (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover was up +14.0%.Revenues from insurance activities (including bonding and Single Risk) increased by +14.7% at constant FX and perimeter (and by +15.8% at current FX). Growth benefited from an increase in client activity.The retention rate reached a record level of 94.8%  up +1.0% compared to Q1-21 (and up +0.5% compared to the previous record from Q1-20). New business totalled €35m  down €5m compared to Q1-21 but in line with pre-pandemic levels.The growth in Coface’s client activity had a positive impact of +4.4% during Q1-22. This record increase for a first quarter reflects the scale of the economic recovery and the rise in the cost of commodities. The price effect reversed  coming in at -2.7% in Q1-22 compared to +2.9% in Q1-21. This is largely due to past very low loss experience.Revenues from other activities were up +3.8% compared to Q1-21  with ongoing contrasting trends in the different businesses. Turnover from factoring rose +8.2%  mainly due to the increase in volumes refinanced in Poland. Revenues from information service continued to grow  rising +11.0% (vs. +9.0% in Q1-21). Fee and commission income (collection fees) was impacted by the decline in claims to be recovered and dropped - 38.7%  while commissions were up slightly by +2.4%.Total revenue - in €m(by country of invoicing) Q1-21 Q1-22 % % ex.

ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio  net of reinsurance  stood at 67.3% for Q1-22 (an improvement of 14.5 ppts compared to Q1- 21). Excluding the effect of government schemes  the net combined ratio was 55.3%  an improvement of 5.8 ppts.(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 28.9%  an improvement of 0.6 ppt compared to the previous year. This improvement reflects a lack of major claims  low claims frequency and a limited number of claims related to the crisis in Ukraine so far.The Group’s reserving policy remains unchanged. Strict management of past claims enabled the Group to record 49.1 ppts of recoveries. The loss ratio for the 2022 underwriting year is still high at 75.4%  signalling that Coface anticipates an increase in the number of bankruptcies in the coming quarters.The loss ratio net of reinsurance came out at 40.7%  up by 16.2 ppts compared to Q1-21. Excluding the impact of government schemes  the net loss ratio would have been 30.4%.(ii) Cost ratioCoface is following its strict policy of cost management. In the first quarter of 2022  Coface maintained its discipline  with costs growing by +10.6% at constant FX and perimeter  and +12.2% at current FX. This increase in costs is lower than the growth in turnover  even though Coface continued to invest. The gross reinsurance cost ratio was 31.6%  an improvement of 0.4 ppt year-on-year.The cost ratio  net of reinsurance was 26.6% in Q1-22  an improvement of 1.7 ppt year-on-year.Financial resultNet financial income for Q1-22 was €12.3m  up by €6.6m compared to Q1-21. This figure includes realized capital gains and positive hedging results for €4.4m as well as a currency effect of €2.0m.The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX impact) is €7.2m (compared to €7.9m in Q1-21). The accounting yield4  excluding capital gains and depreciation  stood at 0.4% in Q1-21  and was slightly higher than the previous year (0.3%).Operating income and net incomeOperating income for Q1-22 was €96.1m  up +20.7% compared to the previous year  mainly due to increased growth and a still low loss ratio.The effective tax rate was 27%  compared to 25% for Q1-21.In total  net income (group share) was €66.2m  up +17.5% compared to Q1-21.3. Shareholders’ equityAt 31 March 2022  Group shareholders’ equity stood at €2 135.5m  down €5.6m  or -0.3% (compared to €2 141.0m at 31 December 2021).These changes are mainly due to the positive net income of €66.2m  offset by negative adjustments to the fair value of investments (€77.7m) against a backdrop of rising interest rates.The annualised return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 13.2% in Q1-22.4. OutlookGlobal growth was expected to be strong in 2022  however  Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has hit the economy from all sides. Energy  commodities and food prices have risen further  certain supply chains have been disrupted  and some international trade has been halted due to sanctions on Russia and Russia’s own retaliatory sanctions.In addition  the spread of the Omicron variant in China has led to widespread lockdowns that are also having a negative impact on growth. Finally  in light of inflation  central banks – especially the Fed – have announced that they intend to continue tightening their monetary policy.Faced with these pressures  the global economy has held up well until now  even though leading indicators are pricing in at least a temporary slowdown.While in several countries  the number of bankruptcies has already returned to above pre-pandemic levels  Coface has continued to experience moderate claims levels  which is a testament to the quality of its underwriting in recent years.The government reinsurance schemes cost Coface €33m in the first quarter and €199m since the beginning of 2020. Coface is not anticipating any additional material impact on its accounts.Coface will propose to the Shareholders’ Meeting to be held on 17 May 2022 a dividend per share of €1.50  which represents a pay-out ratio of 100% of 2021 income.Conference call for financial analystsCoface’s results for 3M-2022 will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on 28 April at 18.00 (Paris time).

The Company's technology is based on pioneering research in ""host defense peptides"" – nature's first line of defense towards foreign pathogens. Lytix Biopharma's lead product  LTX-315  is a first-in-class oncolytic molecule representing a new and superior in situ therapeutic vaccination principle to boost anti-cancer immunity  with the potential to be the ideal combination partner with other types of immunotherapies. LTX-315 target cancer cells and disintegrate their cell membranes  causing immunogenic cell death and release of a patient's tumor specific antigens. This mode of action allows cytotoxic T cells to recognize  infiltrate  and attack cancer cells. The Company was listed on Euronext Growth in Oslo in June 2021  following a private placement covered by investors such as PBM Capital  a U.S. based  healthcare-focused investment firm. For more information  visit www.lytixbiopharma.com.About LTX-315LTX-315 is a potential first-in-class oncolytic molecule administered directly into a tumor to induce immunogenic cell death. The technology is based on pioneering research in ""host defense peptides"" – nature's first line of defense towards foreign pathogens. LTX-315 has demonstrated positive tumor-specific immune cell responses in multi-indication Phase I/II oncology trials.About in situ vaccinationIn situ vaccination stimulates a patient's immune system by injecting drugs with the ability to kill cancer cells straight into the tumor environment. Lytix Biopharma has applied this approach with its first-in-class oncolytic molecules  representing an alternative and unique approach to cancer vaccination. Importantly  this approach generates an immune response against a broad antigen repertoire without pre-identifying the antigens  which in turn can save considerable costs and valuable time.This information was brought to you by Cision http://news.cision.comhttps://news.cision.com/lytix-biopharma-as/r/lytix-biopharma-to-present-at-the-american-society-of-clinical-oncology--asco--annual-meeting c3555789SOURCE Lytix Biopharma AS",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.22,0.27,0.52,True,English,"['ASCO) Annual Meeting', 'Lytix Biopharma', 'American Society', 'Clinical Oncology', 'U.S. based, healthcare-focused investment firm', 'multi-indication Phase I/II oncology trials', 'positive tumor-specific immune cell responses', 'metastatic soft tissue sarcoma', 'situ therapeutic vaccination principle', 'SOURCE Lytix Biopharma AS', 'LTX-315 target cancer cells', 'situ vaccination technology platform', 'immunogenic cell death', 'ASCO) Annual Meeting', 'Copenhagen University Hospital', 'Ole Peter Norby', 'class oncolytic molecule', 'ideal combination partner', 'broad antigen repertoire', 'adoptive cell therapy', 'cytotoxic T cells', 'Denmark Poster Session', 'host defense peptides', 'Cancer Immune Therapy', 'clinical-stage biotech company', 'novel cancer immunotherapies', 'tumor specific antigens', 'cell membranes', 'cancer therapy', 'cancer vaccination', 'immune system', 'immune response', 'Clinical Oncology', 'clinical-stage company', 'cancer indications', 'poster presentation', 'American Society', 'tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes', 'Morten Nielsen', 'National Center', 'Øystein Rekdal', 'Investor Relations', 'pioneering research', 'first line', 'foreign pathogens', 'lead product', 'anti-cancer immunity', 'other types', 'Euronext Growth', 'private placement', 'PBM Capital', 'tumor environment', 'considerable costs', 'valuable time', 'The Company', 'unique approach', 'news.cision', 'OSLO', 'Norway', 'April', 'PRNewswire', 'abstract', 'Chicago', 'June', 'Title', 'patients', 'Presenter', 'MD', 'Department', 'Herlev', 'information', 'CEO', 'Telephone', 'mail', 'Head', 'area', 'nature', 'superior', 'potential', 'release', 'mode', 'action', 'investors', 'lytixbiopharma', 'drugs', 'ability', 'alternative', 'turn', 'lytix-biopharma', 'american-society', 'clinical-oncology--asco', 'annual-meeting']",2022-04-28,2022-04-28,prnewswire.com

My name is Bert  and I will be your coordinator for today's events. For the duration of the call your lines will be on listen-only. However  there will be the opportunity to ask questions. [Operator instructions]. I will now hand over to your host Rob Goyens  VP Treasury and Investors Relations to begin today's call. Thank you.Rob GoyensThanks Operator  and welcome everyone to our First Quarter earnings webcast and Conference Call. As always all earnings materials  including this presentation  can be found in the results section of our Investor Relations website. And after this call  as per usual  we will also provide a replay and transcript for those having missed this call. We'll start today with an overview of the main trends and achievements in the quarter that will be presented by John Porter  our CEO. Immediately thereafter  Erik Van den Enden  our CFO  will guide you through our operational and financial results. And finally  after this  we'll open it up for Q&A.Given the number of participants to this call  and in order to allow an equal treatment  we're limiting to two questions each. Any follow-up questions can be directed to the talent Investor Relations team afterwards. Before we start this presentation however  I would like to remind you that certain statements in this earnings presentation contains forward-looking statements. More information on these statements can be found in the Safe Harbor disclaimer at the beginning of our presentation  with that  let me hand now over to John.John PorterThanks  Rob  and good afternoon or morning to all of you. Thanks for joining the call. First of all  delighted that yesterday's AGM approved the appointment of four new directors to our board  of which three are new independent directors. Ms. Lieve Creten  Mr. John Gilbert and Mr. Dirk Van den Berghe have been appointed for a four-year term as new independent directors of the Company and Ms. Madalina Suceveanu as a new non-executive director. At the same time  the director mandates of both Ms. Amy Blair and Ms. Sabrina Pascu have been extended by a similar four-year period.The new Telenet Board of Directors consists of 11 members  including for independent directors  as opposed to nine members and three independent directors previously. A revamp board is well placed to help promote further growth for Telenet  given its wide breadth of experience and background. In addition  Andre Sorence will continue to serve as an independent observer. The new board will have four women embody five different cultures and bring a wide range of expertise  including technology  media  and telecom experience  e-commerce  digital transformation  data platform management  and finance and technology.The mandate of Mr. Bert De Graeve  Chairman of the Board until now  and independent director has come to an end. I would personally like to thank Bert for his great leadership and vision  leveraging his experience in the telecom and media business  inspired the SLT  and supported Telenet's bold expansion into the media sector  and to become a full-fledged fmc operator. I'm pleased that Mr. Diovan [Indiscernible] has accepted to share the Board for a one-year term. He has always been a well valued independent director and Chairman of the audit remuneration committee since 2015. After that one-year term  he will be succeeded by Mr. Dirk Funderburg(ph).Finally  Christiana Frank has stepped down from the Board as Independent Director  as she reached the maximum permitted age as stipulated in our corporate governance charter. Christiana has also been a key contributor to our board for over six years  providing season advice on variety of topics. I hereby also want to thank her for her expertise and engagement. At the end of October last year  we announced that the Board has started a strategic review of our tower business. In five months later  we are entered into a binding agreement with digital bridge regarding the full sale of this business  which owns all of Telenet's passive infrastructure assets. The transaction values are tower business at €745 million  on a debt and cash-free basis. Equivalent to a multiple of just over 25 times on EBITDA after leases basis. We expect this transaction to close in Q2  2022. And as mentioned  we intend to initially hold on to the net proceeds awaiting the outcome of certain transactions  on our leverage profile.As a reminder  we continue to actively target a four times net total leverage structure  which is exactly where we were at the end of March. Having successfully completed the strategic review of our tele -portfolio  remain fully committed to evolve on the Fluvius transaction. Both companies target to enter into final legal agreements by the time we announced our H1 results  which represents a slightly delayed timing from the spring initially. We will reach out to you on a new timing for our Capital Markets Day  to provide more clarity on the growth outlook for both our retail and infrastructure businesses. Unfortunately  we live in unprecedented times with a war ongoing in Europe causing the casualties of many innocent people.The situation in Ukraine has deeply touched us all. Since the outbreak of the war  we have taken our corporate social responsibility to provide free mobile connectivity access to Ukraine refugees in Belgium  allowing them to stay connected with family and friends in the home country. In addition  we support local governments with Internet access in the temporary refugee centers and took many other initiatives to support the Ukrainian people  such as the provision of the Ukraine 24 TV channel. Moving on to our results now  when we look back at our operational performance in the first quarter  we managed to organically grow our business. However  at a slightly slower pace  as we observed less flux in the market.This can also be seen through our annualized Churn rates which remain at historically low levels. We added nearly 23 000 net new FMC subscribers in the quarter  bringing the total to just over 772 000 subscribers at the end of Q1 up 17% year-on-year. We also managed to expand both our broadband and mobile customer basis  with 2 900 and 8 800 net additions respectively. The weighted average data download speed across our broadband subscriber base continue to increase  reaching 241 megabits per second at March 31st  2022  up 12% from 250 megabits per second  in Q1 last year. This underlines our leading network infrastructure position in fixed. I'm also proud about the performance of our mobile network  offering the highest download speed on mobile in Belgium at 93.5 megabits per second  based on the latest BIPT test drive results. And finally  our commercial broadcasting subsidiary  SBS  launched another very successful edition of The Mall  with a record-breaking over one million viewers for the first episode  which equaled a 50% market share. As you all know  we will be participating in a spectrum auction in June  which we are very intensively preparing for.It concerns both the renewal of existing spectrum licenses  which have been temporarily renewed until mid-September of this year  and also new capacity for 5G  as you see in the illustration above. At the end of March 2022  the BIPT informed the participants of the auction  that one new comer had exercised its option to acquire reserves spectrum in the 700 megahertz  900 megahertz  1821 megahertz brands. Also  existing operators have exercised their option to obtain 30 megahertz duplex reserve spectrum  in the 900  1800  and 2100 bands. The remaining non-reserved spectrum lots will be auctioned as of early June 2022  in total  640 megahertz of spectrum will be auctioned. As previously discussed  we continue to question the viability of a potential fourth mobile player in the Belgium B2C market.In light of the high conversion rate of over 60% today  already in the residential segment. And the already very competitive standalone mobile market with many brands  MVNOs  MNOs  and low priced offers. Having completed the first three months of the year  we confirm our full-year 2022 outlook as presented mid-February. In line with our FY 2022 outlook  we anticipate an improved trend in our revenue profile and adjusted EBITDA in the second half of the year  driven by certain price adjustments coming into effect as of mid-June 2022  as announced yesterday  as well as the continued focus on our operating expenses and tight cost control. With that  let me now hand over to Erik.Erik Van den EndenThanks John  and welcome everybody. Let's first take a look at our operational results in the first quarter of this year. We ended nearly 23 000 net fully converged subscribers in the first quarter  which represented a softer growth trend compared to preceding quarters. This reflected seasonality and a less active market environment characterized by less flux and a continued decrease in our annualized Churn. The expansion of our broadband Internet customer base continued  albeit at a slower pace. Over the first three months of the year  we added almost 3 000 net broadband subscribers  which was primarily driven by the business segments. We also added 8 800 net new mobile post-paid subscribers in the quarter  again driven by a softer market dynamic.Our monthly fixed ARPU per customer relationship reached €58.7  representing a decrease of nearly 2% compared to the prior year period when our ARPU was favorably impacted by certain one-offs. At the same time  we continue to see a shift from cable revenue to mobile revenue as a result of our new 1 and 1 Up bundles. This effect  however  should annualize as of the second quarter as we've launched these bundles about a yearago. Let's now have a look at our top line performance in the first quarter. We generated revenue of nearly $645 million in the first quarter  which was broadly flat versus the first quarter of last year  which included certain one-offs in our video revenue. Excluding this impact  our underlying growth would have been around 1%. Turning to the cost side  our operating expenses increased just over 1% year-on-year in the first quarter. This was mainly driven by higher outsourced labor and professional service costs  as a result of certain strategic and digital transformation projects. We also incurred a $1.7 million increase in staff leave expenses  due to the mandatory wage indexation of 3.6% at the beginning of this year.And finally  we recorded higher network operating expenses  reflecting amongst others  a $3.5 million year-on-year increase in our energy costs. Turning to the next slide  you can see that we achieved an adjusted EBITDA of nearly $329 million in the first quarter  which marked a decline of 1.7% versus the first quarter of last year. The decline in our adjusted EBITDA was driven both by a tough comparison base compared to last year because of certain one off effects in Q1. And the impact of higher inflation on both for structuring expenses and network operating costs.In line with our full-year outlook for 2022  we anticipate an improved trend in our adjusted EBITDA in the second half of the year. Driven by certain price adjustments coming into effect as of mid-June  as well as continued focused on our operating expenses and tight cost control. Let's now have look at our accrued capital expenditures. Excluding the recognition of certain football broadcasting rights  mobile spectrum licenses  and certain lease related capital additions. Our Q1 accrued capital expenditures were nearly €140 million  equivalent to approximately 22% of revenue  and representing a more moderate 4% year-on-year increase. In line with our full-year outlook  we expect our investment intensity to pick up in the remaining quarters.Turning to adjusted EBITDA  less property and equipment additions  or operating free cash flow as we used to call it  we yielded an adjusted EBITDA less property and equipment additions of nearly a $189 million  in the first quarter. A 6% year-on-year decrease  mainly driven by the 2% contraction in our adjusted EBITDA  as explained earlier. And secondly  by modestly higher accrued capital expenditure versus the first quarter of last year. In line with our full-year outlook  we expect a further contraction in our adjusted EBITDA  less property and equipment additions for the remainder of the year as higher investments will more than offset to projected recovery in our adjusted EBITDA. Turning to the next slide  you can see that our adjusted free cash flow was €61 million. This represented a 49% year-on-year decrease  which is mainly driven by a different phasing in the payment of our annual cash taxes  which were paid in Q1 of this year  whereas they were paid in Q2 in 2021.We also had a $9 million lower contribution from our vendor financing program compared to last year. Finally  as we already settled our annual cash taxes in the first quarter  we expect a much stronger adjusted free cash flow performance in the second quarter and in the remainder of the year. Turning to the overview of our debt position  we continue to enjoy a very strong liquidity and long-term debt maturity profile. At the end of March  the weighted average maturity of our depths  excluding short-dated commitments under our vendor financing program  was 6.3 years and we faced no depth amortization prior to March 2028. Including our cash balance we have a total undrawn available liquidity of almost €720 million. Moreover  all of our floating debt has been swapped into fixed  limiting the exposure to future interest rate swings.The Board of Directors remains highly committed to deliver on the company's shareholder remuneration policy. As detailed during the December 2018 Capital Markets Day  and as tightened in October 2022. In the absence of any material acquisitions and or significant changes in our business or regulatory environment  we intend to maintain net total leverage around 4.0times  through an attractive and sustainable level of shareholder disbursements. This includes a fixed dividend per share floor of 2.75 Euros per-share. Remainder of our adjusted free cash flow may still be considered for treating acquisitions  extraordinary dividends  incremental share buybacks  deleveraging  or any combination thereof. At the end of March 2022  our net total leverage was at 4.0 times exactly in the middle of our range  and unchanged compared to the end of last year.Having completed the first three months of the year  we reconfirm our full-year outlook as presented mid-February. Relative to the first quarter  we expect an improved trends in both our revenue and adjusted EBITDA in the second half of the year. Driven by certain price adjustments coming into effect as of mid-June  as well as continuous focus  on our operating expenses and tight cost control. Yesterday  the agent approved the proposed final gross dividend of 1.375 per share.The dividend will be paid next week on May the 4th from our existing cash balances  with a Telenet share trading ex dividend on Euronext Brussels as of the 2nd of May. In addition  the AGM approved the cancellation of 1.1 million treasury shares  which we repurchased under the share repurchase program of 2021. As a result  the total number of shares will be lowered by an equivalent amount of shares. As such  Telenet continues to execute against its shareholder remuneration policy as announced in December 2018 and tightened in October 2020. With that  I hand over to the Operator for the Q&A session.Question-and-Answer SessionOperatorThank you. If you would like to ask a question  [Operator instruction]. Please ensure your line is unmuted locally  as you will be advised when to ask your question. And once again  [Operator Instruction] if you'd like to ask a question. And the first question comes from the line of Joshua Mills from BNP Paribas. Please go ahead.Joshua MillsHi  guys. Thank you for the two questions. The first one for me would just be on your guidance and you've talked in the first quarter about the impact to inflation. Since you gave the guidance  the Belgian help in that sense. And you had mentioned it had picked up quite materially. And if I look at your price increase  that's coming through in June on 4.7%  that's still below the 8% inflation rate which we are currently seeing. My question is  what gives you the confidence that despite those bigger cost headwinds you're actually able to deliver 1% EBITDA on gross this year  have you found more customer base with the initial guidance as conservative  just give more detail about what it would take that would be very helpful.And then secondly  John  you touched on the upcoming spectrum option and I think before you've always talked about the limited consumer opportunity given like emergencies. And perhaps this might be more of a B2B focus products  but given that the new entry is reserving spectrum across multiple different bands and since we're looking for a Nationwide's potentially consumer focused offer  what do you think they might be looking at the opportunity here and have your thought prices there is about. You will need to respond to the drop to that change though. Thank you.John PorterOkay. Thanks  Josh. First of all  of the health index relative to the increase  first of all  we're not exposed to the full force of the health index. The major things that impact our P&L are certainly labor  which we've already indicated the increase is 3.6 and we do not need to -- unlike some of our competitors in the industry and other corporates  we do not need to revisit that until 2023. That is probably the biggest impact and I think Eric and his introduction articulated that in Q1 that was $1.7 million impact on our labor.The other -- the second largest impact is energy of course  and we also pointed out that the impact in Q1 was about $3 million and we're anticipating probably a likely case scenario potentially being up to $10 million for the full yea. Beyond that  operating costs are well within the span of our control. We have quite a bit of confidence that we can manage. And the other thing is that when you look at our price increase  it is something that has been developed in the context certainly of the inflationary pressures  but also with extensive quantitative and qualitative research with our customers.Telenet position as having incumbent like market share means we have a very precious I would say relationship with the consumer  and we don't want to abuse that position. Now obviously our competitors have also raised their prices in a range of 5%. That obviously gives us a headroom to go up to where we are  but it was quite clear in the research that we did that there is a bit of a cliff in terms of your NPS or relationship with the consumer. They will ware up to 5%  but it falls off pretty spectacularly after that. The other thing to point out is that a rate increase is not a rate increase or a rate increase  because when you look at these rate increases that others in our industry are proposing  they are either on back book or front book or no front book and no back book or certain segments  a lot of exclusions.I'd say that in the context of the industry announcements on price increases that ours is probably one of the most extensive because  we don't really play the front book  back book game for quite straightforward on our pricing  and what's good for the front book is good for the back book. So when we take a price increase  we're actually taking it against a very broad spectrum of our subscription revenue. The subscription revenue that of our 2.5 billion of total revenue ish  we're applying this rate increase to 1.6 billion of the total revenue  and there's some more specifics on that that we can give you later. But that is quite a broad range of the revenue. So you can see on a full-year basis  it will have a substantial impact. And even on the half-year basis  it will provide against cost a very nice acceleration in our EBITDA. So that's giving us the confidence to say that this is more than enough for us to retain good relationships with our customers  as well as cover the increase in their costs.When it comes to the spectrum auction and the idea of a fourth operator  I mean  obviously  we won't know the full story until well after the auction probably  but I will certainly speak by my thesis that the companies that are behind the purchasing of reserve spectrum are really not in a position to launch an extensive above the line B2C strategy. The return on capital for the B2C strategy given the certain aspects of the legislation  which are what I would call anti-arbitrage provisions of having to get 20% population coverage before you can get a national roaming agreement and other aspects mean that in addition to the $83 million they've already committed  that you're probably talking about at least another $100 million to really get in the game.The profiles of these companies are not really to put themselves in a position to do that. There's nothing about their business model today that suggests they have any experience in B2C. They don't have the cash flow profiles to invest in a long-term payback. I would say that a more likely scenario is that they are basing that providing broader coverage could be an element of their industrial enterprise strategy. They certainly target businesses and the public sector where there are tens of thousands of employees. This might be something a benefit that they would extend to some of their large enterprise customers. The only complete unknown is whether there's a scale international player potentially sitting behind them.But I would suggest to you that there is no reason to believe that going from a standing start in this market  where you have over 50% FMC customers  you have over 60% attachment rate  you have pricing all over the board  you have at least 15 MVNOs including some scale ones in like a mobile and mobile banking’s that have carved out some interesting segments in the market  that there is a real place for a disruptive B2C player to get a real toehold in the market. Even if we would say  this fourth operator could over say three or four years get to the penetration levels of the largest MVNO  which is Mobile Vikings  we like it as the largest  but that includes prepaid. But the largest post-paid MVNO  which is Mobile Vikings with 300 000ish plus a little bit over 300 000 postpaid sims.That's not a disruptive profile in a market where  you have kind of a 90% SIM to Pulp ratio. So that's the short version of why I don't think this is going to be a substantial threat  but we ask  could I be proven wrong? I guess so. But also  there is just no intelligence in the market to suggest that there's any movement on that front. And it would be one of the most well kept secrets in the European Telco industry if there was a major player behind them. So those are the answers to your question  Josh.Joshua MillsGreat. Thanks very much.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Benjamin Lyons from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.Benjamin LyonsThanks for taking my question. If I could just stick on pricing. I was wondering if you were looking to do anything on the mobile side. And as you've seen  one of your peers do a bit of a more-for-more type strategy going through June. So I was wondering if you're still -- what you were looking at that. And if I could also ask on residential broadband  it just seemed like a significant slowdown. You said that Churn was down in the market  and that means you got a bit of a pull forward in broadband anyway. But are you seeing any share loss or is it being compensated on the wholesale side. If you could just give your take on what you're saying from a market share standpoint. Thanks.John PorterI think it's -- Personally  I don't think there's a lot of shift in the share going on. We're experiencing  I think in something we put out already  we said that there's the least amount of flux in the market that we've seen basically. So in other words  our Churn rate is extremely low. So we're  we're probably  obviously we're not going to see all these numbers and we'll see Proximus is  but I don't think this is the biggest issue. I think the bigger although approximates has been aggressive with hardware offers and these kinds of things through the holiday period et cetera. So I'm sure they'll present some decent results  but I don't think it's the -- I think it's the main driver. I think what we're doing  what's happening is we're two things. One is we're coming out of  we're coming out of the pandemic period where  we had real market expansion  we added over 50 000 broadband subs during the pandemic.So it was -- it was a really back to the good old day’s period as  all the operators gains something pretty close to their fair share during that period. I think maybe coming out of that  a lot of that absolute necessity to have fixed broadband everywhere  we aren't seeing the same need for that or if we had the same need for that  it was already satisfied during the heavier days of the lock-downs  etc. Where we saw the weakness it was not in shifting share  it was on the acquisition side. We just didn't see -- there wasn't really a lot of opportunity there. On the mobile front  we are increasing Telenet mobile by the 4.7%. We're not shying away from that. As you know  Telenet mobile is predominantly in an FMC package or at the very least  attached to a 1P or a 2P customer  but not in what we define as an FMC. The market is a bit here and there on the definition of FMC. We define FMC as somebody who's in a data - centric platform agnostic package with a fixed price.And then the price it's not you buy mobile  you buy some to the extent and then we give you free HBO  that's not FMC in our minds. So we think the overall 4.7% will be applied to all of the FMC bundles  and all of the standalone products in Telenet. We're not raising the price on base. Embrace base has been positioned as  as a value product. It's primarily impacting our success in Brussels  and in the south of the country. And the only other thing that we're not raising is our premium entertainment products. And that's it  I mean  pretty much everything else except large enterprise and SME in to be everything else. SOHO is getting raised 4.7% as well  so it's a broad reach on the rate increase.Benjamin LyonsPerfect. Thanks for the color.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Roshan Ranjit from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Roshan RanjitGood afternoon  everyone. Thank you for the questions from me  please. Firstly  on previous more so I appreciate the long and a complex situation. Is it possible just to give us some color on what the reason for these delays are. Is it say the same situation which is just dragging or are there new developments which are causing the situation just to be pushed out? Any details you can give there will be super-helpful please. And secondly  just moving back to the KPIs. If I look at the digital TV split  I think that saw a sharp decline. And I think you've now completed the migration from analog to digital. Are we now seeing the effects of a pretty mature digital TV market which as you have pointed out  there is very limited movement within the market? There isn't this increase in digital TV base or do you think that there is still a bit more to extract there  because again  if we break down within the digital TV ads  I think this was the climate we've seen for the last two years. Again  any details there will be super helpful. Thank you.John PorterWell  just a couple of comments on the TV base. One is  yes. We completed the analog switch off  but I believe that was in the middle of last year. So  we might have expected to see the impact from that  not having the benefit of moving people over in Q3 or Q4. Although potentially it took that long. I think we also are really probably -- I can tell you anecdotally coming from our call center agents and our retail folks  that a lot of calls we're getting we're not -- as I said  we're not seeing much Churn  nobody saying  ""Hey  I'm paying too much to you guys and I'm going to go [Indiscernible] or to Orange or whatever it's about. "" ""I love the service. I love the products the broadband is working great. How can I say these are tough times?How can I save some money? "" And I think the direction of course is potential [Indiscernible] on the basic TV product. So we're seeing that both in retention and to some extent in acquisition  and it's not surprising that it's  well  we couldn't expect to be immune from this phenomenon forever. So  yes  we will see how it goes. We do have some strategies in place to mitigate that and turn that situation  back around more positively. But as more and more D2C services launch  I mean  etc. it's going to get increasingly challenging  so we have to replace that  that revenue  that customer relationship with somebody else. But we still have very high TV penetration compared to  the rest of the Western World's Markets.Erik Van den EndenSo we'd be also an issue in regards to discuss so into boss prior to the analyst which have been dealing this analog switch-off process. There was of course  a very strong migration from basic video to enhanced video  so it's why underlying there was still a positive trend on the video side. Now of course  hedging completed that migration that still is relatively small proportion of basic TV customers left  as we showed into Q4. We will keep 14 definitely decided to no longer split it out because it does not give any particular color  so when you look at the total video churn  which is the most important factor to focus on  is the combination of the basic and the enhanced video.The trends are still relatively similar compared to what we saw previously. So yet they just going a bit more from digital  but that's also because end of migration has not been completed  it's logical that if your base has been fully converted  you've stays relatively the same that you've done  lose those digital subscribers. As to Fluvius saw again  the question was  does it just take longer or do you have your own count of new roadblocks. If it's clearly the fact that we -- I mean  there are no new roadblocks  so it's not that all of a sudden  you know  we entered into a huge issue and that we're stalled there. You didn't need very much the case that the process that we have to go through  which is very detailed and very tedious in terms of producing the carve-out accounts  doing the due diligence  that this take longer.It's incredibly complex a file. And also one that of course  where I can get an agreement which bind till Nextel gets to lead for the next 20 years. So we're taking that very serious. And it does just take more time than we expected. It's also so that there are some elements as well that are not necessarily knowing under our control  nor Fluvius control in terms of the timeline so I mean  to give one example  of course we both want to have full clarity on the tax implications of this carve-out  and these things are still underway. Now  at the same time  we have been making quite a bit of prowess  [Indiscernible] of progress. So we do feel comfortable that we will  at both sides be able to land the file with a final signature by the time we'll be fully buy it  or before the time we publish H1 results. But it is indeed  more time consuming and more lengthy than we anticipated.Roshan RanjitOkay great. That's really helpful  thank you.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Ruben Devos  KBC Securities. Please go ahead.Ruben DevosGood afternoon. Just my first question is on what you said in the outlook. It talks about being a pivotal year with reported strategic projects. You are talking about reviews and a set up mobile towers that apart from these  I was wondering whether you could talk a bit about your commercial strategy in Vilonia. It will likely take the entire year for your competitors before they will be approved  you've been active there on the mobile side  have been experimenting with the dam. Are there some thoughts you could share on what type of possibilities there are now that the landscape is changing in the south  that's the first question?And the second one is just on share buybacks really. You initiated one in October  finalized in February. It was about $1.1 million shares  relative to $110 million shares overall. So relatively small let's say  that consumers hasn't been banking on any buybacks really. But given that you sort of indicated before that you'd like to signal your confidence in the company's prospects in the relatively low valuation. Yes  I was wondering whether more share buybacks could be an interesting way in your view  to use excess cash in the company. Thank you.Erik Van den EndenI will take the question on the buybacks  Ruben. So buybacks has obviously something that we have been using many times in the past. It's true that the last one was relatively small  one that's backing 2019. We did the $300 million share buyback and also before that  it's a tool that we have been using the regularly and is also fully part of our toolbox. I think at this point in time  obviously we are expecting to proceed from the tower sale. Important to understand is that the cash is not yet on our bank account. We expect that to happen by the end of Q2. I think what we have  what the Board has decided for now is to retain that cash until we get more clarity on two important files  it is at the one hand  the spectrum auction and at the other hand the Fluvius transaction.And when there is clarity around those deals  we will apply the shareholder program  as we always do and definitely assess whether a buyback is a good use of proceeds there  but it's been part of our tool -- it will continue to be part of our tool box. It is just that on the short-term and that is probably again  I mean  the auction is going to be in June. We plan to land the deal with Fluvius before we published H1 results with relatively short timeframe  but we want to get the clarity first before we take any decision on biolinks.John PorterAnd then also given  I think we are pleased as the company that yesterday  the shareholders approved to the new share of buyback resolution  which actually states that we can buy back shares over the next five-year periods up to the legal maximum threshold. And as you maybe have seen from the competing notice  the conditions for the buyback have become more flexible. Of course  that does not yet give the company the mandate  that which needs to be granted by the board  as Erik just mentioned. But at least for our shareholder's resolution perspective  we have been able to renew it for another five years  yesterday as part of the AGM. Yeah.And then maybe on Vilonia  there's not much we can say for now  I think we're all aware that the -- I mean  the regulatory process for the VOO transaction is still fully in progress  and it's expected to take probably until the end of the year or maybe longer. That's of course for us difficult to see  but that's a typical timeline for an approval process. In the meantime  I mean  we are active in Vilonia  we always have been  and continue to be with the base brands  and we will continue to be active there. But in terms of further concrete plans  it's not something that -- we can either communicate but also  put together at this stage  we will first have to understand what is the outcome of the regulatory in view.Ruben DevosAlright  thank you.OperatorNext question comes from the line of Nicolas Cote Colisson from HSBC. Please go ahead.Nicolas Cote ColissonThank you  John's. Two questions  please. Just to follow up on the new entrants thing. As an operator yourself  do you think it would take a -- how long it would take sorry  to beat the 20% footprint and start accessing or roaming agreement. And also what would be your appetite to offer such a running agreements to the new entrants. And my second question is on Fluvuis(ph) transaction. So I understand you should get back to us before end of July. Should we then expect to knew about the final Sheldon structure  including the financial parties of these would come at a later stage. Thank you.John PorterNo  I think it's our intention -- one of the reasons that we've delayed Capital Markets Day and the end-to-end discussion of the Fluvius transaction and its implications for our capital allocation going forward is that we want to have a completely comprehensive agreement in place so that there's going to be no outstanding issues  no outstanding discussions other than the fact of probably who's going to be the wholesale access seekers on the network. We know  obviously  that on day one  Orange is going to be on the NetCo  100%. We expect that there is a lot of good reasons for them to follow along with us  but those things won't be finalized until after the agreement's in place.But once we do finalize the outstanding issues on the agreement  and  as Erik said  they're more a matter of administration than commercial discussion  we will share very comprehensively the details of the agreement and the implications. On the new -- on the potential new entrants. Look  it's considering  once again  they're going from a standing start. I would guess that and what we know certainly about ramping up for 5G ourselves  and we have insurance key agreement with Ericsson  Nokia  and Google on the core that yes  it can take it up to a year to even get started  and the supply chain for this stuff is also under pressure. We've had some delays from Ericsson because of the lack of chipsets for transmission equipment  etc. So not an easy thing to get  get off this thing off the ground from a standing start. Although  20% of the population could probably be covered with just a few 100 towers  but it's not like you'd need thousand  but lot to do for a company once again that really isn't in this business.Erik Van den EndenGetting permits is not an easy thing  right? I mean  if they were just to build new towers  of course there will be regulated taxes as well  but then the network means they're on towers. So just getting permits to build new towers in itself is also very lengthy and cumbersome process. And in terms of our own appetite for a roaming agreement  I mean TBD. We need to see what their plans are and what the strategy is  and whether it's compatible with what we're doing. I mean  I think we've pretty much positioned ourselves as an open architecture  as a company that's supportive on the right terms and conditions of an open architecture  both on fixed and mobile. And I think there are a lot of complexities for a new entrant to access the M-wings partnership because they're pretty much already locked and loaded on that. So  we would be a logical person for them to talk to about this  but we'll see when we see the whites in their eyes.Nicolas Cote ColissonOkay. Thank you. Thanks for the positions.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Carl Murdock Smith from Berenberg. Please go ahead.Carl Murdock SmithHi. Thank you for the questions. Firstly  I just wanted to ask on the transition of revenue away from cable towards the mobile  due to the new convergence bundles. You talk through how that will annualize in Q2. I was just wondering  can you provide a bit more color in terms of the annualization. Is it a hard annualization or soft annualization? So basically did impact the entire base all at once in Q2  or is it more soft annualization as people moved on to that  so that impacts of revenue transitioning happens over time  and therefore  as we annualize the trunk we'll  slow down overtime as well.Hopefully that's clear. And then my second question is  obviously yesterday you announced the price increase we've talked about the 4.7% increase  and you've touched on the fact that you're not moving prices up in base  or on the premium entertainment products  but more in the other revenue lines of other business services  to what extent do you feel like you are able to offset the inflationary cost pressures with changing the revenue line and price increases? Thank you.John PorterMaybe I'll take the first question on the annualization. The effect of this growth in our release is  in April of 2021  there was a moment when we launched our ONE and ONE(Up) bundles and they were replacing the WIGO bundles. Now  of course  customers pay an all-in price  and so the portion of the total bundle price that is allocated to fixed versus mobile is slightly different in the ONE and ONE(Up) bundles as it was versus WIGO simply also because the proposition of those two bundles was different. So that is indeed something. So if you think about Q1  it means we did not have yet ONE and ONE(Up). It was a full WIGO basis. And so as we allocated more revenue in ONE and ONE(Up) to mobile versus WIGO  that had an adverse effect on the fixed ARPU. So that effect is going to fade out as of April  essentially.Now  of course  we did not -- people moved over time  although it was a fast transition from WIGO into ONE. So you will be seeing definitely already big shift in the next quarter  but there's going to be some residual effects in the second part of it. But that's essentially what it is. It will play out over the next eight months or nine months  but with the first month up in Q2. So you should see the bulk of it coming through  definitely  in the first part of the year. And on your other question on the other revenues and this is service to revenues and potential impact of the rate increase.The other revenues are primarily in a bucket  including hardware  interconnect  certain transactional fees like Box swaps  upgrading to our IOS platform  installation fees  etc. They are very transactional fees although we will pass through any increases in hardware cost on handsets  obviously in the transaction with our customers. We think we can recover any increases there  but it’s pretty much anything with a chip in it  it’s going up in price. We will pass through where we can  but transactionally  it won't be the 4.7% applied to it.In terms of business services  we do have a strategy in place on the back of our acquisition of Nextel  it's almost through as we go now  to increase our share of wallet on ICT services to our SME and LE customers. That is a business from which we expect a fair bit of growth. The mix of revenue within SME and LE has obviously skewed very heavily towards just connectivity. And we're now focusing much more on ICT services like SDN and cloud  and security. I mean  other business IP switches and these kind of things. So we do hope that the share of wallet will increase  and we've got a reinvigorated management team there at our TB talent business group and so that's where we expect to drive more revenue  in business services.Carl Murdock SmithThanks very much.OperatorNext question comes from the line of Laura Homsy  from MFS. Please go ahead.Laura HomsyThank you so much for taking my question. Maybe a bit premature  but  just in terms of capital structure going forward  given that you obviously planning on sort of firm separating the NetCo business  and bearing in mind that you bonds become callable at the end of this year. Is there anything that you can share in terms of plans of some capital structure going forward  whether you're going to have separate capital structures  and any plans with regards to the bonds given they become callable later this year. Thank you.Erik Van den EndenLaura. I cannot take the question. We will definitely have different capital structures for what we call the ServCo and the NetCo simply because the business and the risk profile is very different. So we do expect a relatively high level  for the leverage on the NetCo to very stable  very long-term wholesale business would is strong Tenants  anchor tenants behind it  being a doughnut cervical. So there will be a higher leverage. And at the same time  the leverage for ServCo is expected to come down. So that is a shift that we expect and that we will implement. The exact mechanics of how we do that  what the mix of financing looks like and whether bonds will be called or not. That is indeed a little bit premature  but definitely it's really important for the medical  for the value creation that sufficient depth can be put on it and also that the cost of capital is really optimized. And that is something that we definitely focus on as we set up these new ventures.Laura HomsyUnderstood. Thanks for the color. I appreciate that.John PorterYou're welcome.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of Martin Jaime Schmidt from Citi. Please go ahead.Unidentified AnalystThanks for taking my questions. Regarding the EBITDA guidance  so when you basically thought about how to guide into 2022  how much of  so that's 4.7% price increase was factored in and maybe more importantly how much of the energy costs were affected in when you issued the guidance. I think because you mentioned a 10 million  is that 10 million based on today's energy prices or on the energy prices the back when you issued the guidance? That's the first question. And the second one is on the fixed ARPU growth. And could you give us some color on what the underlying ARPU growth is for the quarter excluding the one of in last year and also excluding the fixed-to-mobile effect. Thank you very much.Erik Van den EndenMaybe first on the guidance. So obviously the world has moved a lot over the last couple of months  especially given of course the events in Ukraine. So we had certain assumptions when we meet a full-year guidance. Of course  every quarter or almost on a constant basis  we revised that guidance. And so  the fact that we reconfirm it today is really based on the latest insights  both in terms of what we'll be doing on the price increase  and we have confirmed that yesterday it's 4.7%. We're also taking into account the latest use on energy. Just also maybe to remind you that on the unity side  we have a hedging program in place  which means that around 50% of our total energy exposure is hedged  and we did that last year still at favorable rates.Of course for the remaining 50%  we are exposed and already one fourth of the year behind us. So the latest few confirms the fact that the external guidance is still viable and relevant. And then the second question I guess was on the ARPU yeah  sorry. So I mean  indeed  there is a one-off that we have in Q1 in our video revenue. More specifically  you will see if you look at the detailed reporting  that especially the PGO revenue is impact versus last year. If we would not have hit that one-off  the total revenue would have grown actually 0.7% or close to 1%. I do not have the exact evolution here on the ARPU  but it would also have meant that the ARPU on apples-to-apples basis would have slightly grown versus the Q1 of last year. I will send the exact number afterwards. Yeah. We'll do that  Martin.Unidentified AnalystThank you.OperatorThe next question comes from the line of James Ratzer from New Street Research. Please go ahead.James RatzerYes  thanks very much  and good afternoon. I had two questions  please. The first one was just regarding your change of accounting that you've talked about  where you're going to be moving to an EBITDA basis. I was wondering if you could just let us know what your four times leverage that you report now on drive for a 16 will become under the new basis and or else being equal if you could then give us an indication of what it will go to following the tower transaction and taking into account the new lease costs you'll be paying to DigitalBridge.And on the second question  just so that so just sticking on the theme of towers  so could you remind us on under Belgian rules what tower access you would have to give to any new entrants on your mobile towers. Does actually selling the asset now to DigitalBridge make it easier for a new entrant to build out a network and get tower excess space or would you have had to offer space on your towers even if you had not sold those towers to a third-party. Thank you.Rob GoyensOkay. James  Rob here. I'm happy to have a go at it and Erik has agreed to chip in. Yeah. We indicated this morning that as part of the tower transaction which we anticipate to close in the second quarter  so in June more precisely  that we intend to move to EBITDA after this reporting. We think  having spoken to a lot of stakeholders  it's probably a better reflection of how  in financial perspective at least  it should be -- have a better reflection of the impact of the tower transaction and also on the lease cost more generally. This actually means that we will -- the foremost operating leases but also capital leases  we will basically correct for them in our EBITDA results. This will also impact  of course  the leverage because today those leases are still included in that leverage profile. So today  when you look at our net total leverage  yes  leases are included in the depth numbers and they are excluded from the EBITDA.So that will also change. Our intention is to provide  between now and the moment we report our results at the end of July  re-based financials. And apologies again to come up with re-based financials  but the idea of the re-based financials is two-fold. First of all  to give you a like-for-like comparison on the impact of EBITDA to EBITDA of this reporting but secondly also to show the impact of the tower transaction  so that you have a clean comparison base for the FY '21  but also the first quarter of 2022. We are actually doing the loss checks and balances here on these numbers. And then we can share them with you  also so we can update them on our website as well.With regards to the tower transaction and so as I mentioned  we will look to close this in the second quarter  so in June. This will be an important moment of coarse for Telenet. Today  when you look at it on the group reporting  it will have a decrease in leverage of around 0.2  0.3 times. This is arguably assuming that the depths of the -- so we have to recognize the lease until the first break date  and that's communicated  this first tenure period is 15 years. If we were to move to EBITDA after this reporting  the leveraging impact is going to be closer to 0.4 times most likely.And then on the tower access to an essence there is  from our perspective  no deal change here  in the sense that the propagators of the tower companies has been actually judged by the BIPD as part of this tower disposal process  the need to provide access to So that can be existing MNOs  but it can also be other the Open Acres. So biscuit data is a medical excite chatting taking place. So on existing filings  but also new built filings  you basically need to open it up for your competitors. And that goes against regulators prices  which upset to buy the risks and the HYSYS actually in association of the mobile operators. There is like a [Indiscernible] for the [Indiscernible] ensure that the prices are having checks and balances. And as you know  those prices are regulated in Belgium. So that such having mechanism is not changing because the obligation to offer them access was previously only with MVNOs  but as part of the tower transaction it will now also be with tower companies.

3861,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.thetradenews.com/could-data-centre-migrations-leave-participants-subject-to-latency-arbitrage/,Could exchanges’ data centre migrations leave participants subject to latency arbitrage?,1 day ago,With Euronext’s data centre due to migrate from Basildon in the UK to Bergamo in Italy on 6 June it’s opened up for question whether venues’ new data centre locations could leave some participants at a disadvantage.The move will take Euronext 600 miles from its current location and from the London-base concentration of MTF matching engines. According to big xyt data shared exclusively with The TRADE  this will add around six milliseconds to round trip latency between it and other multilateral trading facilities (MTFs).Geographical distance from the London regional data centre is the biggest contributor to differences in European Best Bid Offer (EBBO) between various venues  big xyt found.It goes without saying that those trading firms with the fastest connections have greater opportunities to take advantage of large distances between venues trading the same instrument and this could increase implicit costs when trading those instruments.“Today when executing in names where the primary data centre is dispersed like in Scandinavia or Switzerland i.e.  where the domestic market is operated locally and not in London like the alternative MTFs (and Euronext today)  we do see a degradation in pre and post trade performance ” said Cowen’s head of European market structure  James Baugh.“As an interesting proxy to market fragmentation post-Brexit when UK venues were allowed to restart executing in Swiss names  we did notice an increase in implicit costs when trading Swiss shares  particularly in smaller sizes.”For Baugh  the subsequent increase to implicit costs could see participants opt for alternative execution channels that are less subject to latency arbitrage and distance – aka dark books.“This could drive more business away from those lit markets which are considered more toxic – those very markets Euronext is so keen to protect. Although to be fair  post-Brexit it makes little political sense for Euronext to continue to run their markets from London ” added Baugh.Euronext  alongside other incumbent European exchanges  have been vocal in their preference for lit and transparent markets and this outlook has been effectively translated into recent regulatory updates made by the European Commission and ESMA.Updates including limiting the systematic internaliser (SI) regime and introducing a new blanket double volume cap (DVC) for dark trading – both areas that the UK has been decidedly more flexible on in a bid to foster competition in its markets post-Brexit.However  Euronext disregarded claims their move to Bergamo would increase costs. Instead suggesting that as the venue is moving from a single provider setup to an open model  this would improve cost efficiencies and ensure competitiveness by giving users a “choice in terms of connectivity”.“Using empirical data from a number of market quality providers  it is clear that the market quality of large primary venues whose data centre is located on the continent does not suffer from the geographical distance from London ” the exchange told The TRADE.“As such it is not anticipated that the implicit costs will rise as a result of the Euronext move. In addition  Euronext operates a number of liquidity programmes which can be adjusted to address any deviations in terms of liquidity dynamics.”SIX Swiss Exchange names could be subject to the same fate with both its data centre and Bolsa y Mercados Españole’s (BME)  which it acquired in June 2020.SIX Swiss had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publishing.,negative,0.01,0.4,0.59,negative,0.01,0.12,0.87,True,English,"['data centre migrations', 'latency arbitrage', 'participants', 'new blanket double volume cap', 'systematic internaliser (SI) regime', 'other incumbent European exchanges', 'other multilateral trading facilities', 'new data centre locations', 'European Best Bid Offer', 'London regional data centre', 'SIX Swiss Exchange names', 'MTF matching engines', 'little political sense', 'single provider setup', 'Mercados Españole', 'European market structure', 'primary data centre', 'round trip latency', 'alternative execution channels', 'post trade performance', 'recent regulatory updates', 'market quality providers', 'big xyt data', 'large primary venues', 'European Commission', 'Swiss names', 'empirical data', 'six milliseconds', 'trading firms', 'dark trading', 'large distances', 'domestic market', 'Swiss shares', 'latency arbitrage', 'The TRADE', 'current location', 'London-base concentration', 'biggest contributor', 'various venues', 'fastest connections', 'greater opportunities', 'same instrument', 'alternative MTFs', 'interesting proxy', 'smaller sizes', 'dark books', 'open model', 'cost efficiencies', 'liquidity programmes', 'liquidity dynamics', 'same fate', 'implicit costs', 'Geographical distance', 'subsequent increase', 'James Baugh', 'UK venues', 'transparent markets', 'Euronext move', 'Basildon', 'Bergamo', 'Italy', '6 June', 'question', 'participants', 'disadvantage', 'differences', 'EBBO', 'instruments', 'Scandinavia', 'Switzerland', 'degradation', 'pre', 'Cowen', 'head', 'fragmentation', 'Brexit', 'business', 'outlook', 'ESMA', 'DVC', 'areas', 'competition', 'claims', 'competitiveness', 'users', 'choice', 'terms', 'connectivity', 'number', 'continent', 'result', 'addition', 'deviations', 'Bolsa', 'BME', 'request', 'comment', 'time', 'publishing']",2022-04-28,2022-04-28,thetradenews.com

The ""Document d'Enregistrement Universel"" including the financial report for fiscal year 2021 will be available on the company's website in the coming days.Jean-Philippe Milon  CEO of Quantum Genomics  said:""In an environment still impacted by the pandemic crisis  we continued our research programmes throughout the 2021 fiscal year and signed two new partnership contracts. Our stated ambition is to launch the marketing phase of firibastat for difficult-to-treat or resistant hypertension by the end of 2023. In order to carry out our current projects and to explore new therapeutic indications based on the BAPAIs platform  we have just completed a capital increase  the success of which is a testament to the support and confidence of our historical shareholders  our partner Julphar and new shareholders. We are therefore pursuing our development trajectory with confidence  serenity and determination  and are on track to achieve the first firibastat registration by the end of 2023. This is a fundamental step for Quantum Genomics and its shareholders  and one that has been eagerly awaited by the millions of patients around the world who suffer from resistant or difficult-to-treat hypertension.""A strengthen financial situation after the latest capital raiseFor the full year 2021  Quantum Genomics continued to receive payments due under the partnership contracts announced in 2020.As such  Quantum Genomics invoiced and collected €2.3 million of royalties  corresponding to the upfront payments of the partnership contracts signed in South Korea  Greece and Canada. On top of this amount was the payment of $1 million invoiced in April 2022  corresponding to the first milestone payment following the inclusion of the first South Korean patient in the REFRESH study.At the end of December 2021  operating revenues amounted to €3.2 million compared to €2.3 million a year earlier. Operating income amounted to (€19.2 million)  compared with (€13.9 million) at the end of December 2020. Personnel costs remain under control  with the progress of clinical trials logically meaning an increase of operating expenses.After accounting for the research tax credit of €2.7 million  net income at 31 December 2021 was (€16.6 million). Free cash flow (amount of net disbursements related to operations) was (€16.9 million) over the period.At the end of this fiscal year  the company's shareholders equity amounted to €11.4 million  to which was added €0.2 million of other equity (conditional advances from Bpifrance). At the start of the year  Orient EuroPharma Co. Ltd (OEP) acquired a stake in Quantum Genomics through a €0.9 million reserved capital increase  strengthening the cooperation between the two companies in Southeast Asia and Oceania.At the end of 2021  cash and cash equivalents amounted to €13.5 million compared to €27.2 million on 31 December 2020  while financial debts amounted to €3.0 million. The latter consist of a €1.5 million state-guaranteed loan granted by BNP and a €1.5 million R&D innovation loan obtained from BPIFrance.On 27 April 2022  Quantum Genomics successfully completed a capital increase for an amount of€17.5 million  including €1.9 million from partner Julphar. This transaction covers the company's needs until the second quarter 2023  while securing the research activities of Quantum Genomics in a difficult global context.The company now has a strengthened shareholder structure and the renewed confidence of its historical shareholders  including Otium Capital and Vatel Capital  its partner Julphar and new institutional investors.Summarized financial information as on 31 December 2021:Data in €'000 (French standards) 31/12/2021 31/12/2020 Income 3 162.4 2 261.5 Personnel expenses (2 664.3) (2 328.6) Other operating costs (19 685.1) (13 790.5) Operating income (19 187.0) (13 857.7) Financial result 2.2 (5.0) Current result before tax (19 184.8) (13 862.7) Extraordinary result (32.7) 178.4 Research tax credit 2 661.8 2 147.5 Net result (16 555.7) (11 536.7)Update on the research programmes - ReminderAs indicated in the press release from 26 April  the development programme for firibastat  currently in Phase III for difficult-to-treat and resistant hypertension  is on track. Quantum Genomics is confirming its goal of bringing firibastat  in a single daily dose  to registration by the end of 2023  with this formulation promoting better compliance.The company has prioritized its research activities on this first indication and has assembled a first-rate team to carry out this key stage of its development  as illustrated by the recent appointment of Stéphane Cohen as Director of Global Operations.As such  despite the health restrictions and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic  the last patient of the FRESH study  a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled efficacy study  should be enrolled in the next few days  for results to be published at the end of October 2022. The study is being conducted under the oversight of an independent data review committee (IDMC) and no serious adverse events have been reported that would require a modification of the protocol.The Phase III REFRESH study was launched in the first half of 2021 with the objective of demonstrating the efficacy at 3 months of once-daily firibastat  as well as the long-term safety (6 to 12 months). Based on the interim results of this study  expected in mid-2023  the marketing application for firibastat will be submitted in the third quarter of 2023  in line with the plan.In the heart failure indication  following the results of QUORUM announced in August 2021  the search for a partner to accompany upcoming development activities is continuing  in parallel with the finalizing of the development plan with the Regulatory Authorities.Quantum Genomics is therefore one step closer to its goal of validating a new class of medicinal products based on an innovative mechanism.In addition to its historical activities  Quantum Genomics intends to build on its development expertise to become a reference company in the development of innovative treatments for needs that are currently being unmet. To this end  the company is exploring new therapeutic areas based on the patented technology platform built around BAPAIs.About Quantum GenomicsQuantum Genomics is a biopharmaceutical company specialising in the development of a new class of cardiovascular medicines based on the mechanism of Brain Aminopeptidase A Inhibition (BAPAI).

Quantum Genomics (Euronext Growth - FR0011648971 - ALQGC)  a biopharmaceutical company,28/04/2022 - 18:00Quantum Genomics publishes its results for fiscal 2021and gives an update on its activityQuantum Genomics (Euronext Growth - FR0011648971 - ALQGC)  a biopharmaceutical company specialising in the development of a new class of medicinal products that act directly on the brain in order to address difficult-to-treat/resistant hypertension and heart failure  today reported its full year 2021 results.The annual financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 27 April 2022.Statutory auditor's report is available on the Company's website:www.quantum-genomics.com. The “Document d'Enregistrement Universel” including the financial report for fiscal year 2021 will be available on the company's website in the coming days.Jean-Philippe Milon  CEO of Quantum Genomics  said:“In an environment still impacted by the pandemic crisis  we continued our research programmes throughout the 2021 fiscal year and signed two new partnership contracts. Our stated ambition is to launch the marketing phase of firibastat for difficult-to-treat or resistant hypertension by the end of 2023. In order to carry out our current projects and to explore new therapeutic indications based on the BAPAIs platform  we have just completed a capital increase  the success of which is a testament to the support and confidence of our historical shareholders  our partner Julphar and new shareholders. We are therefore pursuing our development trajectory with confidence  serenity and determination  and are on track to achieve the first firibastat registration by the end of 2023. This is a fundamental step for Quantum Genomics and its shareholders  and one that has been eagerly awaited by the millions of patients around the world who suffer from resistant or difficult-to-treat hypertension.”A strengthen financial situation after the latest capital raiseFor the full year 2021  Quantum Genomics continued to receive payments due under the partnership contracts announced in 2020.As such  Quantum Genomics invoiced and collected €2.3 million of royalties  corresponding to the upfront payments of the partnership contracts signed in South Korea  Greece and Canada. On top of this amount was the payment of $1 million invoiced in April 2022  corresponding to the first milestone payment following the inclusion of the first South Korean patient in the REFRESH study.At the end of December 2021  operating revenues amounted to €3.2 million compared to €2.3 million a year earlier. Operating income amounted to (€19.2 million)  compared with (€13.9 million) at the end of December 2020. Personnel costs remain under control  with the progress of clinical trials logically meaning an increase of operating expenses.After accounting for the research tax credit of €2.7 million  net income at 31 December 2021 was (€16.6 million). Free cash flow (amount of net disbursements related to operations) was (€16.9 million) over the period.At the end of this fiscal year  the company's shareholders equity amounted to €11.4 million  to which was added €0.2 million of other equity (conditional advances from Bpifrance). At the start of the year  Orient EuroPharma Co. Ltd (OEP) acquired a stake in Quantum Genomics through a €0.9 million reserved capital increase  strengthening the cooperation between the two companies in Southeast Asia and Oceania.At the end of 2021  cash and cash equivalents amounted to €13.5 million compared to €27.2 million on 31 December 2020  while financial debts amounted to €3.0 million. The latter consist of a €1.5 million state-guaranteed loan granted by BNP and a €1.5 million R&D innovation loan obtained from BPIFrance.On 27 April 2022  Quantum Genomics successfully completed a capital increase for an amount of€17.5 million  including €1.9 million from partner Julphar. This transaction covers the company's needs until the second quarter 2023  while securing the research activities of Quantum Genomics in a difficult global context.The company now has a strengthened shareholder structure and the renewed confidence of its historical shareholders  including Otium Capital and Vatel Capital  its partner Julphar and new institutional investors.Summarized financial information as on 31 December 2021:Data in €'000 (French standards) 31/12/2021 31/12/2020 Income 3 162.4 2 261.5 Personnel expenses (2 664.3) (2 328.6) Other operating costs (19 685.1) (13 790.5) Operating income (19 187.0) (13 857.7) Financial result 2.2 (5.0) Current result before tax (19 184.8) (13 862.7) Extraordinary result (32.7) 178.4 Research tax credit 2 661.8 2 147.5 Net result (16 555.7) (11 536.7)Update on the research programmes - ReminderAs indicated in the press release from 26 April  the development programme for firibastat  currently in Phase III for difficult-to-treat and resistant hypertension  is on track. Quantum Genomics is confirming its goal of bringing firibastat  in a single daily dose  to registration by the end of 2023  with this formulation promoting better compliance.The company has prioritized its research activities on this first indication and has assembled a first-rate team to carry out this key stage of its development  as illustrated by the recent appointment of Stéphane Cohen as Director of Global Operations.As such  despite the health restrictions and the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic  the last patient of the FRESH study  a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled efficacy study  should be enrolled in the next few days  for results to be published at the end of October 2022. The study is being conducted under the oversight of an independent data review committee (IDMC) and no serious adverse events have been reported that would require a modification of the protocol.The Phase III REFRESH study was launched in the first half of 2021 with the objective of demonstrating the efficacy at 3 months of once-daily firibastat  as well as the long-term safety (6 to 12 months). Based on the interim results of this study  expected in mid-2023  the marketing application for firibastat will be submitted in the third quarter of 2023  in line with the plan.In the heart failure indication  following the results of QUORUM announced in August 2021  the search for a partner to accompany upcoming development activities is continuing  in parallel with the finalizing of the development plan with the Regulatory Authorities.Quantum Genomics is therefore one step closer to its goal of validating a new class of medicinal products based on an innovative mechanism.In addition to its historical activities  Quantum Genomics intends to build on its development expertise to become a reference company in the development of innovative treatments for needs that are currently being unmet.
