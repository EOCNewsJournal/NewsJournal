Share Programme 2022/2025 includes a maximum of approximately 2 000 senior executives and key employees within the Hexagon Group.Participants are offered to be allocated performance awards free of charge that may entitle to Series B shares in the company provided that the performance condition related to the development of Hexagon's earnings per share compared to the target level set by the Board of Directors during the measurement period 1 January 2022 until 31 December 2025 are fulfilled  where the last financial year during the measurement period is compared with the financial year preceding the measurement period  with reservation for any reduction in the number of shares in accordance with the terms of Share Programme 2022/2025.

Compensation for transferred shares can be paid in cash  through an issue in kind or a set-off. Transfers of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only occur at a price within the share price interval registered at that time. Transfer in connection with acquisitions may be made at a market value assessed by the Board of Directors. The purpose of the authorizations is to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value  to enable acquisition opportunities by financing acquisitions with the company's own shares  and to ensure the company's undertakings  due to share-related or share-based incentive programs (other than delivery of shares to participants in incentive programs)  including social security costs.Authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on issues of shares  convertibles and/or warrantsThe AGM resolved to authorize the Board of Directors during the period up until the next AGM to  on one or more occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions  resolve to issue Series B shares  convertibles and/or warrants (with rights to subscribe for or convert into Series B shares). By resolutions in accordance with the authorization  the number of shares may be increased by a number corresponding to a maximum of ten percent of the number of outstanding shares in the company at the time when the Board of Directors first uses the authorization. The purpose of the authorization and the reasons for a potential deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights as set out above  is to ensure financing of acquisitions of companies  part of companies or businesses or to strengthen the company's capital base and equity/assets ratio. Such issues may not require amendment of the Articles of Association applicable from time to time.

For the decision  the following conditions shall otherwise apply.The right to subscribe for the warrants is added  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the subsidiary Zinzino Operations AB  corporate identity number 556655-2658 (""Subsidiary"")  with the right and obligation to transfer the warrants to employees and others as below. Oversubscription is not possible.The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights are to stimulate shareholders in the company through an incentive program whereby the company's management  employees and key persons as well as persons in the external distributor organization can take part in and work for a positive value development of the company during the period covered and that the company should be able to retain and recruit competent and committed staff.The warrants shall be issued free of charge. Subscription of the warrants shall take place within two weeks from the date of the issue decision on a separate subscription list. The Board has the right to extend the subscription period.Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new (1) B share in the company. New subscription of shares with the support of the warrants can take place during the period from and including the Swedish Companies Registration Office's registration of the warrants up to and including 31 May 2027. The subscription price per share shall amount to an amount determined on the day of the meeting according to the following principles: multiplied by a multiple of 1.4. The final price shall be determined by the actor independent of the company who has the task of valuing the warrants in accordance with Black & Scholes' valuation model and rounded off so that the price is even SEK 0.05. The new shares that may be issued upon new subscription are not subject to any reservations.Shares issued after subscription in accordance with these terms and conditions carry the right to a dividend for the first time on the record date for dividends that falls immediately after the shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB. Warrants held by the Subsidiary and which have not been transferred as described below may be canceled by the company following a decision by the board of the company with the consent of the board of the subsidiary. Any cancellation must be reported to the Swedish Companies Registration Office for registration.The Board  or the person appointed by the Board  is authorized to make the minor adjustments and clarifications required for registration of the decision with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.Other terms for the warrants are set out in the complete warrants  which are provided in accordance with what is stated under the heading "" Provision of documents "" below.Approval of transfer of warrantsThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting approve the Subsidiary's transfers of warrants on the following terms. The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall be added to the following categories:Category Maximum number of options / person Maximum number of options / category Key people in the external sales organization(maximum 4 people) 100 000 400 000 Group management and sales management(maximum 20 people) 40 000 350 000 Key employees(maximum 15 people) 10 000 150 000The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall only accrue to those persons who at the end of the application period have not resigned or been terminated.It must also be possible to offer options to future new employees  e.g. in connection with the possible introduction of new positions in the company. These new employees shall not be included in the maximum amounts specified under each job category  however  the maximum number of options per category shall not be affected. For such acquisitions  the conditions shall be the same or equivalent to what is stated in this decision. This means  among other things  that acquisitions must take place at the then current market value.Transfer to participants presupposes that the warrants can be acquired legally and  in the opinion of the Board  that reasonable administrative and financial efforts can be made.Registration and allocationIf warrants within a certain category remain after all registrations within the category have been satisfied  the remaining number must be allocated to participants in another category  whereby the board shall determine the distribution based on category affiliation  staff category and notified number of warrants. However  such a distribution may at most mean that the maximum number of warrants per person within a certain category is exceeded by 50 percent.The company's board decides on the final allotment.Price and payment etc.The warrants shall be transferred on market terms at a price (premium) determined on the basis of an estimated market value of the warrants using the Black & Scholes valuation model calculated by an independent valuation institute. For acquisitions made by new employees after the end of the initial application period  a new market price must be determined in a corresponding manner. A preliminary calculation of the market value of the warrants  taking into account current circumstances  shows a market value per warrant of SEK 2.50.The employees will acquire the warrants at the market value determined. Payment must be made in cash.More information about the warrant programDilutionIn the event of full new subscription with the support of all warrants  900 000 new shares can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 2 percent of the total number of shares and votes in the company  subject to any recalculation according to the terms and conditions.Impact on key figures and costs for the company etc.The company's earnings per share are not affected by the issue of the warrants as the present value of the exercise price of the warrants will exceed the current market value of the share at the time of the transfer to employees.The warrant program will only incur certain limited costs in the form of external consulting fees and administration regarding the warrant program.Preparation of the caseThe principles for the option program have been developed by the company's board. The Board has subsequently decided to present this proposal to the Annual General Meeting. Apart from the salaried employees who prepared the matter in accordance with instructions from the board  no employee who may be covered by the program participated in the drafting of the terms.Other share-related incentive programs etc.In addition to the now proposed incentive program  there are currently three outstanding option programs. All programs are largely aimed at the external distributor organization in the Group  but also with a certain allocation to employees at the company.The first option program comprises 800 000 warrants at an exercise price of SEK 18 per Class B share that expires on 31 May 2024  of which 50 000 have been subscribed for by the Group's management team.

Other warrants in the program have been subscribed for by the company's external distributors. As of the date of this notice  36 033 warrants have already been exercised for share subscription within the framework of this warrants program.A third option program was decided at the company's Annual General Meeting on 20 May 2021 and comprises 800 000 warrants at an exercise price of SEK 140 per Class B share that expires on 31 May 2026. As of the date of this notice  no warrants have been subscribed or exercised for share subscription within the framework of this option program.If all outstanding warrants as above are exercised for new subscription  a total of 2 197 867 Series B shares will be issued  which corresponds to a total dilution of the share capital amounting to a total of approximately 6.5%.Instruction to the boardThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting instruct the Board of Directors of the company to implement the decision as above and to ensure that the Board of Directors of the Subsidiary carries out transfers of warrants in accordance with the above.Decisions according to the above require the assistance of shareholders representing at least 9/10 of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.Item 16 - Decision on private placement with payment by set-off of the claim to Kenneth Koh.The Board of Directors proposes to the Annual General Meeting to resolve to increase the share capital by SEK 9 432 by issuing 94 316 new Class B shares.

Subscription shall take place no later than 15 July 2022. Payment of the consideration  as described above  per warrant  shall be paid in cash no later than 15 July 2022. However  the Board shall have the right to postpone the last day for subscription or payment.It is noted that a decision on how to distribute in the event of oversubscription is not required.The warrants shall be freely transferable  but a condition for granting the ­warrants is that the board members have entered into a special home delivery agreement with the company at the latest at the time of subscription  according to which each board member shall be obliged to offer the Company or the Company directs to acquire the warrants or a certain share of these if the board ­assignment ceases (i) within a certain time  (ii) upon transfer of warrants before 31 May 2027 and (iii) in certain other cases.Allocation of warrants further presupposes that acquisition of warrants can legally take place.Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new share in the company  meaning that the share capital can be increased by SEK 12 000 upon full exercise of the warrants by subscribing for a maximum of 120 000 new shares.The warrants may be exercised for subscription of shares in the company during the period from and including 1 June 2022 to and including 31 May 2027.The subscription price per share shall amount to an amount determined on the day of the meeting in accordance with the following principles: the closing price for the company's share on the day of the meeting  multiplied by a multiple of 1.4. The final price shall be determined by the actor independent of the company who has the task of valuing the warrants in accordance with Black & Scholes' valuation model and rounded off so that the price is even 5 öre.Shares issued after subscription in accordance with these terms and conditions carry the right to a dividend for the first time on the record date for dividends that falls immediately after the shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered in the share register kept by Euroclear Sweden AB.The Board  or the person appointed by the Board  is authorized to make the minor adjustments and clarifications required for registration of the decision with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB.Other terms for the warrants are set out in the complete warrants  which are provided in accordance with what is stated under the heading "" Provision of documents "" below.DilutionIn the event of full new subscription with the support of all warrants  120 000 Series B shares may be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.5 percent of the total number of shares in the company  subject to possible recalculation in accordance with the option terms.Impact on key figures and costs for the company etc.The company's earnings per share are not affected by the issue of the warrants as the present value of the ­exercise price of the warrants will exceed the current market value of the share at the time of the transfer to the Board members.The subscribers will subscribe for the warrants at market value as stated above. Thus  no such benefit value arises  for the participants who subscribe for options  on which the company is obliged to pay social security contributions. The warrant program thus does not entail any increased tax ­cost for the company. The warrant program will otherwise entail certain limited costs in the form of external consulting fees and administration regarding the warrant ­program.Preparation of the caseThe principles for the option program have been developed on behalf of the proposer  who has decided to submit this proposal to the AGM. None of the members who may be covered by the program have participated in the drafting of the terms.Other share-related incentive programs etc.The company's other outstanding share-related incentive programs are set out in the summary under item 15 above.Decisions according to the above require the assistance of shareholders representing at least 9/10 of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. Furthermore  the decision is conditional on the above subscribers being elected as board members by the meeting.NUMBER OF SHARES AND VOTESThe total number of shares in the company amounts to 33 702 278  of which 5 113 392 Series A shares and 28 588 886 Series B shares. The total number of votes in the company amounts to 7 972 280.6. The company does not hold any own shares.SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so requests and the Board considers that this can be done without significant damage to the company  provide information on circumstances that may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda  and circumstances that may affect the assessment of the company's financial situation. The disclosure obligation also refers to the company's relationship with another group company and the consolidated accounts  as well as such matters regarding group companies as referred to above.PROVISION OF DOCUMENTSAccounting documents  auditors' report and other documents to be considered at the meeting will be kept available at the company's office at Hulda Mellgrens Gata 5  421 32 Västra Frölunda  and on its website  www.zinzino.com  no later than three weeks before the meeting.

3886,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.morganlewis.com/pubs/2022/04/update-russia-limits-transactions-with-shares-received-upon-cancellation-of-dr-programs,Update: Russia Limits Transactions with Shares Received Upon Cancellation of DR Programs,1 day ago,LawFlash Update: Russia Limits Transactions with Shares Received Upon Cancellation of DR Programs April 29  2022The delisting of Russian issuers’ depositary receipts could potentially lead to a disproportional increase in sales of underlying shares in the Russian stock market and contribute to its volatility. In response to this challenge  Russia’s Central Bank introduced a limit on transactions with shares received upon cancellation of depositary receipts.Russia’s Federal Law No. 114-FZ of April 16  2022 (the Delisting Law) entered into force on April 27  2022 (the Effective Date). The Delisting Law prohibits Russian issuers from having their shares (Russian shares or underlying shares) traded outside Russia via depositary receipts (DRs) absent government approval.It is anticipated that the process of cancelling the DRs and delivering the underlying Russian shares (also known as the DR conversion) may extend well beyond the Effective Date. At the same time  the Delisting Law clearly states that only those investors who held DRs as of the Effective Date will be entitled to receive the underlying Russian shares. This creates some further practical difficulties for the DR conversion.Obstacles Related to DR ConversionDR holders face a number of practical issues that complicate the DR conversion:International settlement and clearing systems Euroclear and Clearstream blocked or imposed restrictions on accounts with Russia’s National Settlement Depository  and this might result in difficulties (or impossibility) in transferring and converting DRs using these systems.A DR holder might need to instruct a broker or similar institution to surrender the DRs and/or accept the underlying shares  and such broker may be unable to accept or fulfill this instruction in the current geopolitical environment.A DR holder may be restricted from holding Russian shares directly under their investment declarations or applicable legal and sanctions regimes.There are current Russian legal restrictions on disposing of  or repatriating income from  Russian shares owned by investors from the so-called “unfriendly states.”In practice  it appears that for an investor to keep enjoying their rights to the underlying shares as to the previously held DRs  such investor should be the one who can open a shares account directly with a Russian broker or custodian and who is not an unfriendly state resident or controlled by such resident. In view of this  based on market reports  foreign DR holders were increasingly selling the DRs to Russian residents before the Effective Date  including through over-the-counter transactions.Limitation on Transactions with Underlying SharesThe Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has noticed this trend of Russian residents acquiring DRs from nonresidents for their conversion into underlying shares and further sale in Russia. To prevent a disproportionate increase in the offering of shares on the Russian stock market  the CBR introduced restrictions on transactions with underlying shares obtained through the DR conversion.On April 27  2022  the CBR ordered Russian custodians tokeep a special record of the Russian shares received as a result of the DR conversion (the converted shares)  andfor each deponent  limit sales of converted shares during any particular trading day to 0.2% of the total number of the converted shares obtained by the deponent from April 27  2022  to the date preceding the date of sale.The above rules apply for six months unless revoked earlier.Notably  these restrictions apply to both exchange and over-the-counter transactions.These measures do not apply to the converted shares obtained by a Russian resident  provided that such Russian residentacquired the DRs before March 1  2022  orreceived an approval of the Government Commission on Control over Foreign Investments (the FDI Commission) in order to acquire the DRs.Important ConsiderationsThe Delisting Law implies that any DR holder who has purchased DRs after the Effective Date would not be able to exercise the conversion rights. In practice  this restricts the possibility of a DR holder to sell the DRs after the Effective Date  although in theory it should still be possible to sell the beneficial interest in the DRs after the Effective Date as long as the legal title to the DRs (and  following the conversion  to the underlying Russian shares) remains with the seller who held the DRs on the Effective Date.At the same time  any DR holder who successfully completes the conversion will not be able to freely sell the converted shares. Due to the limit on the number of shares that can be sold  the sale of the converted shares may take several months. The sale of converted shares to Russian purchasers by persons from “unfriendly states” or controlled by such persons is generally prohibited absent approval from the FDI Commission. This also impacts the timing and possibility to sell.Ukraine Conflict: How to Maintain Global Business ContinuityOur lawyers have long been trusted advisers to clients navigating the complex and quickly changing global framework of international sanctions.

3904,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.etfstream.com/news/etf-wrap-bitcoin-and-gold-a-match-made-in-heaven/,ETF Wrap: Bitcoin and gold – a match made in heaven?,1 day ago,ETF Wrap: Bitcoin and gold – a match made in heaven?There was another world first in the land of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs) this week after 21Shares launched a bitcoin and gold ETP which is set to spin the head of the “bitcoin is the new gold” brigade.The 21Shares ByteTree BOLD ETP (BOLD) does not quite offer bitcoin parity with the precious metal quite yet though  with an 18.5% weighting to bitcoin and 81.5% to gold  the assets are weighted in inverse proportion to their risk.BOLD – developed alongside UK specialist provider of alternative investment strategies ByteTree – attempts to deliver protection against inflation via optimised risk-adjusted exposure.While both bitcoin and gold are widely available within an ETP wrapper separately  Charlie Morris  CIO at ByteTree Asset Management  has claimed backtesting ETPs has improved returns by 7-8 percentage points a year – impressive if true.Often compared to gold  bitcoin is thought to have many similarities including the finite amount of both  a low correlation to equities  they are both seen as a hedge against inflation and are a store of value.Despite holding predominantly gold  BOLD is priced as a crypto ETP with a total expense ratio (TER) of 1.49%  compared to the cheapest gold ETPs which are priced at around 0.12%.At the very least the product could quieten the bitcoin-gold debate  for now  it will be interesting to see how the risk-adjust exposure could develop over time.Pensions turn passiveIt was a big week for pension funds turning to passive after Aegon invested £3bn into a new range of BlackRock ESG index funds.The move comes following growing demand from pension savers for more ethical investments. Savers in Aegon’s growth fund pathway will see their ESG exposure double from 30% to 60% as a result of the switch.In another eye-catching move  Finnish pension company Varma seeded a new Nomura Asset Management (NAM) ETF with €300m.The Next Funds Solactive Japan ESG Core Index ETF  listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange  will also have a sustainable screen based on “market standards” such as the United Nations Global Compact.The move is also significant for Japan’s ETF market and highlights the wider adoption of the ETF wrapper globally.Going nuclearIt was also the week ETFs in Europe went nuclear with the launch of not one but two uranium ETFs.The Global X Uranium UCITS ETF (URNU) listed on the Deutsche Boerse and London Stock Exchange (LSE) while the Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF (URNM)  issued via white-label ETF issuer HANetf  is set to list on the LSE in May.URNM will seek exposure to companies involved in the mining  exploration  development and production of uranium and will also be able to invest in entities that hold physical uranium  uranium royalties and other non-mining assets.Sprott Asset Management also has a significant pedigree in the sector as it runs a physical uranium trust with $3bn in assets under management (AUM).Meanwhile  URNU tracks the Solactive Global Uranium & Nuclear Components V2 index which comprises of around 50 companies from the energy  industrial and basic materials sectors.ETF Wrap is a weekly digest of the top stories on ETF StreamRelated articles,neutral,0.15,0.83,0.02,mixed,0.21,0.31,0.47,True,English,"['ETF Wrap', 'Bitcoin', 'gold', 'match', 'heaven', 'The Next Funds Solactive Japan ESG Core Index ETF', 'The Global X Uranium UCITS ETF', 'Sprott Uranium Miners UCITS ETF', 'BlackRock ESG index funds', 'The 21Shares ByteTree BOLD ETP', 'United Nations Global Compact', 'Nuclear Components V2 index', 'ETF Stream Related articles', 'Finnish pension company Varma', 'Solactive Global Uranium', 'new Nomura Asset Management', 'Sprott Asset Management', 'white-label ETF issuer', 'ByteTree Asset Management', 'UK specialist provider', 'alternative investment strategies', '7-8 percentage points', 'total expense ratio', 'growth fund pathway', 'Tokyo Stock Exchange', 'London Stock Exchange', 'basic materials sectors', 'two uranium ETFs', 'physical uranium trust', 'crypto exchange-traded products', 'other non-mining assets', 'pension funds', 'new gold” brigade', 'ESG exposure', 'cheapest gold ETPs', 'ETF Wrap', 'NAM) ETF', 'ETF market', 'crypto ETP', 'uranium royalties', 'new range', 'ETP wrapper', 'week ETFs', 'pension savers', 'precious metal', 'inverse proportion', 'Charlie Morris', 'backtesting ETPs', 'many similarities', 'finite amount', 'low correlation', 'bitcoin-gold debate', 'big week', 'growing demand', 'ethical investments', 'sustainable screen', 'market standards', 'wider adoption', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'significant pedigree', 'weekly digest', 'top stories', 'risk-adjusted exposure', 'risk-adjust exposure', 'eye-catching move', 'bitcoin parity', 'match', 'heaven', 'land', 'head', 'weighting', 'protection', 'inflation', 'returns', 'equities', 'hedge', 'store', 'value', 'time', 'Pensions', 'Aegon', 'result', 'switch', 'Europe', 'launch', 'URNU', 'LSE', 'URNM', 'HANetf', 'May', 'companies', 'exploration', 'development', 'production', 'entities', 'AUM', 'industrial', '18.']",2022-04-29,2022-04-30,etfstream.com

Our team is currently focused on delivering the above milestones for our stakeholders and we believe 2022 will be an exciting year for the company.”Clinical Pipeline Update and Upcoming MilestonesIn 2022  we announced a number of updates for our lead and other projects:- Our ALS-4 (a first in-class anti-virulence based small molecule drug targeting infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus  including  but not limited to Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (“MRSA”)) Phase 1 clinical trial is completed. Dosing and clinical evaluations of the Single Ascending Dose studies (“SAD”) and Multiple Ascending Dose studies (“MAD”) have been completed for a total of 72 healthy subjects  no subjects were dropped from the studies and no serious adverse events observed. With the encouraging safety data  we are on track to submit an IND application to the United States Food and Drug Administration (“US FDA”) this year seeking to initiate a Phase 2 clinical study to assess the safety and efficacy of ALS-4 in patients.- Our SACT-1 (a repurposed small molecule drug targeting Neuroblastoma and potentially other cancer types) Phase 1 clinical trial for assessing relative bioavailability and food effect has been completed with no serious adverse events observed. Our first patent on SACT-1 has been granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office and the US FDA has also granted an Orphan Drug Designation for SACT-1 for the treatment of neuroblastoma. We plan to hold an end of Phase 1 meeting and submit a clinical protocol to the US FDA this year to initiate a Phase 1b/2a clinical study to assess the safety and efficacy of SACT-1 in patients.- Our first patent on the molecular based rapid pathogen diagnostics liquid biopsy technology (“RPIDD”) has been granted by the US Patent and Trademark Office. We started the clinical validation of our RPIDD for the diagnosis of pathogens including viruses  bacteria  fungi and parasites. We have been enrolling patients with febrile neutropenia and sepsis for our clinical validation.. Various bacteria and viruses have been detected in these patient samples  including Escherichia coli  Klebsiella pneumoniae and Herpesviridae. The data have been cross-validated by standard of care diagnostics results such as blood culture technology. RPIDD achieved high analytical sensitivity and specificity of the clinical samples respectively at both low depth (60 000 reads) and high depth (1 million reads) sequencing and further clinical validation is ongoing.- We launched our oncology and autoimmune discovery and development platform. The platform will initially focus on non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) and autoimmune diseases such as lupus  rheumatoid arthritis  inflammatory bowel diseases  etc. We are currently conducting optimization for selected candidates as part of its small molecule library for major targets including  but not limited to EGFR  ALK  KRAS  p53 mutations.Fiscal Year End Financial ResultsAptorum Group reported a net loss of $27.1 million in 2021  as compared to net income of $4.9 million in 2020. The net income in 2020 was mainly driven by the gain on investments in marketable securities  net of $25.2 million  while there was a loss on investments in marketable securities  net of $8.0 million in 2021.Research and development expenses were $10.9 million in 2021 as compared to $11.6 million in 2020. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2021 was primarily due to less sponsored research to universities in 2021  partly offset by the increase in contracted research organizations services and consultation due to the development progress of our lead projects.General and administrative fees were $5.4 million in 2021 as compared to $4.9 million in 2020. The increase in general and administration fees was mainly due to increase in bonus expenses to our directors  employees  external consultants and advisors. The increase is partly offset by a significant decrease in travelling expenses due to the outbreak of COVID-19.Legal and professional fees were $2.6 million in 2021 as compared to $2.9 million in 2020. The decrease in legal and professional fees was mainly due to less one-off professional services engaged during 2021.Aptorum Group reported $8.3 million of cash and restricted cash as of December 31  2021 compared to $3.6 million as of December 31  2020. The increase in cash and restricted cash was mainly the result of the proceeds from sales of investment securities of $20.1 million and proceeds from issuance of Class A Ordinary Shares of $4.0 million in 2021  partly offset by the cash used in operating activities of $14.7 million  net repayment of loan from related parties of $2.0 million  and loan to a related party of $3.4 million in 2021.About Aptorum GroupAptorum Group Limited (Nasdaq: APM  Euronext Paris: APM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic assets to treat diseases with unmet medical needs  particularly in oncology (including orphan oncology indications) and infectious diseases.

3931,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220428006062/en/Innate-Pharma-First-Patient-Dosed-in-Monalizumab-Phase-3-Lung-Cancer-Clinical-Trial-Triggers-50M-Payment-From-AstraZeneca,Innate Pharma: First Patient Dosed in Monalizumab Phase 3 Lung Cancer Clinical Trial Triggers $50M Payment From AstraZeneca,MARSEILLE  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News: Innate Pharma SA (Euronext Paris: IPH; Nasdaq: IPHA) (“Innate” or the “Company”) today announced that AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) has now dosed the first patient in its Phase 3 clinical trial  PACIFIC…,"MARSEILLE  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Innate Pharma SA (Euronext Paris: IPH; Nasdaq: IPHA) (“Innate” or the “Company”) today announced that AstraZeneca (LSE/STO/Nasdaq: AZN) has now dosed the first patient in its Phase 3 clinical trial  PACIFIC-9  evaluating durvalumab (PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab (NKG2A) or AstraZeneca’s oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable  Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT).The purpose of the study  which is sponsored by AstraZeneca  is to determine if the addition of monalizumab or oleclumab to standard-of-care durvalumab improves outcomes for patients in this setting.Monalizumab  Innate’s lead partnered asset  is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor-infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.Dosing of the first patient in this trial has triggered a $50 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca to Innate.“We are very pleased that our key late-stage asset  monalizumab  has progressed into a second Phase 3 trial with our partner  AstraZeneca. The launch of PACIFIC-9 represents an important financial milestone for Innate  as it triggers a $50 million milestone payment that reinforces our cash position ” said Mondher Mahjoubi  Chief Executive Officer of Innate Pharma. “Based on the recent COAST clinical trial results  we are excited about the potential of extending the clinical benefit of durvalumab with the addition of monalizumab in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC.”Detailed results from the randomized COAST Phase 2 trial were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology on April 22  2022. AstraZeneca initially presented the results during the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2021 in September 2021 (see AstraZeneca press release). The results of the interim analysis showed monalizumab in combination with durvalumab increased objective response rate (ORR) and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus durvalumab alone in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC who had not progressed after CRT. The Journal of Clinical Oncology publication now includes exploratory subgroup analysis.“Durvalumab has transformed the treatment of patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC  and we’re excited by the promise of extending its benefit through novel combinations with two potential first-in-class monoclonal antibodies demonstrating strong clinical activity. Based on the stand-out results from COAST  we are pleased that the Phase 3 trial is underway  which we hope will bring new treatment options to patients and further increase the potential for long-term survival benefit in this setting ” said Susan Galbraith  Executive Vice President  Oncology R&D  AstraZeneca.About PACIFIC-9:PACIFIC-9 is a Phase 3  randomised  double-blind  multicenter global study to determine the efficacy and safety of durvalumab alone or in combination with oleclumab or monalizumab+ in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC who have not progressed on definitive  platinum-based CRT.​The first patient has been dosed in April 2022. The PACIFIC-9 Phase 3 trial is now looking to recruit patients across more than 200 centers in the coming months. ​Stage III NSCLC:In 2020  an estimated 2.2 million people were diagnosed with lung cancer worldwide1. Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer  with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.2 3 4 Stage III NSCLC represents approximately one quarter of NSCLC incidence5.Stage III (locally advanced) NSCLC is commonly divided into three subcategories (IIIA  IIIB and IIIC)  defined by how much the cancer has spread locally. In contrast to Stage IV  when cancer has spread (metastasised)  the majority of Stage III patients are currently treated with curative intent2 6.The majority of Stage III NSCLC patients are diagnosed with unresectable tumours2 5.About Monalizumab:Monalizumab is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.NKG2A is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor for HLA-E. By expressing HLA-E  cancer cells can protect themselves from killing by NKG2A+ immune cells. HLA-E is frequently overexpressed in the cancer cells of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Monalizumab may reestablish a broad anti-tumor response mediated by NK and T cells  and may enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies7.The ongoing development for monalizumab is focused on investigating monalizumab in various combination strategies in different malignancies  including the Phase 2 NeoCOAST trial in the neoadjuvant early-stage setting.About the Innate-AstraZeneca monalizumab agreement:In October 2018  AstraZeneca obtained full oncology rights to monalizumab by exercising its option under the co-development and commercialization agreement initiated in 2015.The financial terms of the agreement include potential cash payments up to $1.275 billion to Innate Pharma. Including the $50 million payment triggered by dosing the first patient in the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 clinical trial  Innate Pharma has received $450 million to date.For any commercialized oncology indication  AstraZeneca will book all sales revenue and will pay Innate low double-digit to mid-teen percentage royalties on net sales worldwide except in Europe where Innate Pharma will receive 50% share of the profits and losses in the territory. Innate will co-fund 30% of the costs of the Phase 3 development program of monalizumab with a pre-agreed limitation of Innate’s financial commitment.About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma’s broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of natural killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens  as well as antibody engineering. This innovative approach has resulted in a diversified proprietary portfolio and major alliances with leaders in the biopharmaceutical industry including Bristol-Myers Squibb  Novo Nordisk A/S  Sanofi  and a multi-products collaboration with AstraZeneca.Headquartered in Marseille  France with a US office in Rockville  MD  Innate Pharma is listed on Euronext Paris and Nasdaq in the US.Learn more about Innate Pharma at www.innate-pharma.com.Information about Innate Pharma shares:ISIN code FR0010331421 Ticker code Euronext: IPH Nasdaq: IPHA LEI 9695002Y8420ZB8HJE29Disclaimer on forward-looking information and risk factors:This press release contains certain forward-looking statements  including those within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The audit procedures are currently being finalized and the reports will be issued on May 6  2022.Consolidated earnings - IFRS (€’000) 2021 2020 Change Revenues 6 572 6 432 +2.2% Adjusted gross margin1% of revenues 4 07262% 3 05847.5% +32.3%+14.5 pts Staff costs (9 707) (6 953) -39.6% Adjusted EBITDA2 (6 093) (4 579) -33.1% EBIT (9 511) (7 316) -30.0% Financial income (expense) (284) (294) +3.4% Income from ordinary operations before tax (9 795) (7 609) -28.7% Consolidated net income (9 878) (7 551) -30.8%Christian Guillemot  co-founder and CEO of AMA: “AMA passed a major milestone in 2021 with its initial public offering on Euronext Growth Paris. The capital increase carried out for a gross total of €38.2m  with the founding shareholders  Guillemot Brothers  investing €14m  has made it possible to further strengthen AMA’s organization in order to prepare for growth in 2022 and the following years. The launch of version 6.6 of XpertEye at the start of April represents a crucial step forward as we look to gain new market shares for the digitalization of frontline workers  in addition to accelerating our growth over the second half of 2022”.2021 earningsAMA recorded €6.6m of consolidated full-year revenues in 2021  up from €6.4m in 2020  with year-on-year growth of 2.2% at current exchange rates (+4% at constant exchange rates). At end-December 2021  AMA had 490 clients  including 160 new accounts  while establishing new technological and commercial partnerships  several of which are currently being finalized.Story continuesThe Group’s gross margin came to €4.1m at end-2021  with a margin rate of 62%  a 14.5-point improvement thanks to strong growth in software sales (+163%)  which represent 37% of the Group’s revenues for the period (versus 15% in 2020). This trend  resulting from the deferral of commercial deployments  is nevertheless positive for the product mix  while making it possible to limit the level of cash consumption and the operating loss recorded. Although staff costs are up +39.6%  operating expenditure increased by just +30% from €(7.3)m in 2020 to €(9.5)m in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA came to €(6.1)m  compared with €(4.6)m in 2020. After factoring in €(0.3)m of financial income and expenses  the AMA Group recorded €(9.9)m of consolidated net income (Group share) in 2021  compared with €(7.6)m at December 31  2020.2022 first-quarter revenuesFor the first quarter of 2022  AMA is reporting unaudited consolidated revenues of €1.1m (-50% from Q1 2021 and -20% versus Q4 2021). As announced in October 2021  AMA has faced technological challenges relating to the integration and interoperability of its new applications within its clients’ information systems  as well as the inclusion of additional technological features.The R&D teams have been structured  with more than one third of the R&D staff  totaling 70 people to date  focused on developing integration solutions (APIs).XpertEye 6.6 launched at the start of AprilLaunched on April 4  2022  version 6.6 of XpertEye concerns all of the Group’s assisted reality solutions (Lite  Advanced  Essential)  and includes:The possibility to work remotely on several video streams simultaneously. All the members of a conference can now benefit from different viewpoints and interact on each stream (zooming in and out  drawing  pointing  etc.). For instance  an expert or surgeon could share a contextual viewpoint with other professionals (operating theater or machine several meters long) from a motorized pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) panoramic camera  or their own view with connected glasses and a video stream from an endoscopic camera  with the possibility for each participant to take control of each video source.The availability of XpertEye on the next-generation connected glasses with RealWear Navigator 500. Their innovative design  with removable camera and batteries  as well as a powerful camera with video stabilization and its outstanding performance capabilities in low-light situations  make them ideally suited to industrial environments.The integration of a multi-parameter medical monitor that measures and shares health indicators  such as temperature  blood pressure  heart rate and oxygen saturation  and includes a blood glucose monitor.The integration of wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) monitors  enabling live cardiology consultations to be carried out remotely.Interoperability has been further strengthened through a series of improvements  including XpertEye’s dynamic links with third-party applications  easier interaction with XpertEye Schedule and XpertEye Proceed  and the creation of components making it possible to structure the data generated by XpertEye with a view to their integration in the vast majority of client information systems (CRM  ERP).The rollout of solutions in Hindi (the world’s third most spoken language) and Thai  taking the number of languages supported by XpertEye Lite and XpertEye Advanced up to 20.Alongside the ramping up of its capacity for innovation  ISO 9001 and ISO 27001 certification has been secured for all of the AMA Group business units3 covering technological links with clients. These international standards confirm the quality of the procedures  as well as the security and reliability of the information security management system (ISMS).These new features and these certifications will help drive the large-scale integration of AMA solutions with key accounts and the deployment of new commercial partnerships.Commercial deploymentThe new partnerships established  and the commercial operations set up  including most recently with the smart glasses manufacturer RealWear  represent a major driving force for accelerating the deployment of XpertEye solutions.The Group  present in 10 countries  has continued to further strengthen its international footprint  with the creation of its Tokyo-based subsidiary AMA XpertEye K.K and the recruitment of its commercial director at the start of the year  alongside a project manager who was already in place.Sound financial positionFollowing its IPO  AMA had €18m of positive net cash at end-2021  compared with -€2.5m at December 31  2020  as well as €17.5m of undrawn bank lines to date. It therefore has the financial resources in place enabling it to finance its development.CSR: materiality and mapping of stakeholdersAMA is continuing to roll out its CSR strategy  launching a consultation process with all of its internal and external stakeholders (employees  clients  suppliers  community  etc.) in order to draw up its materiality matrix and identify the most relevant stakes to meet their expectations  support shared value creation and further strengthen the Group’s overall performance.2022 objectivesAMA expects to see a return to sustained growth from the second half of 2022  driven by the industrial-scale deployment of its solutions and the ramping up of its commercial partnerships and network.Financial calendar2022 second-quarter revenues: July 29  2022 (before start of trading)2022 first-half earnings and third-quarter revenues: October 31  2022 (before start of trading)DisclaimerThis press release contains certain non-factual elements  including but not restricted to certain statements concerning its future results and other future events.

We are happy to report that all of our people are safe  and we were proud to see the very strong engagement from our colleagues and the Signify Foundation in supporting the people and communities so desperately affected by the war. Investments in Russia were stopped and all new business was paused since February 25th. We were also impacted by the return of lockdowns in China towards the end of the quarter. Throughout these challenging conditions  Signify continued to see strong momentum in the professional channel in the US and in most of the other geographies. We grew by 6.4% in the first quarter and maintained a strong double-digit adjusted EBITA margin. Global supply chain disruptions  which brought longer supplier lead times and higher levels of inventory  have negatively affected our cash flow. We expect this to positively readjust as the year progresses ” said CEO  Eric Rondolat.“Given the world’s growing need for sustainable  connected and energy efficient lighting  we remain more focused than ever on our strategic priorities. For the remainder of the year  we anticipate a lower performance from our consumer-focused business due to inflationary headwinds. At the same time  we still expect strong demand for our professional business  driven by ongoing investments in the energy transition. Moving forward  our guidance for the year remains within reach  assuming the Chinese market and global supply chain dynamics do not deteriorate further.”Story continuesBrighter Lives  Better World 2025In the first quarter of the year  Signify was on track for most of its Brighter Lives  Better World 2025 sustainability program commitments that contribute to doubling its positive impact on the environment and society.Double the pace of the Paris Agreement:Cumulative carbon reduction over the value chain is on track. This is mainly due to the accelerated shift to energy efficient and connected LED lighting  which decreases carbon emissions in the use phase  and Signify's ongoing efforts to decarbonize its supply chain.Double our Circular revenues to 32%:Circular revenues increased to 30%  well on track to reach the target. This positive trend is attributable to the recent upgrade of a family of luminaires  which are now serviceable  and to the further expansion of the serviceable portfolio in outdoor luminaires.Double our Brighter lives revenues to 32%:Brighter lives revenues were 27%  on track to reach the target. The main contributions come from the consumer well-being portfolio  as well as UV-C disinfection and emergency lighting.Double the percentage of women in leadership positions to 34%:The percentage of women in leadership positions was 26%  slightly off track  yet Signify expects to see further progress during the year. In Q1  Signify conducted the first all-employee session of the Powering Inclusion Series with more than 5 000 participants across the company  and celebrated International Women's Day with its global #BreakTheBias campaign. Signify participated in the UN Global Compact’s Target Gender Equality event to share its mentoring practices for improving diverse representation in its organization.OutlookFollowing the solid performance in the first quarter  the strong order intake and the continued momentum in the professional segment  Signify maintains its guidance for 2022. This assumes that the Chinese market and global supply chain dynamics do not deteriorate further.Comparable sales growth in the range of 3-6%Continued Adjusted EBITA margin improvement of up to 50 bpsFree cash flow in excess of 8% of salesFinancial reviewFirst quarter in millions of EUR  except percentages 2021 2022 change Comparable sales growth 6.4% Effects of currency movements 5.2% Consolidation and other changes 0.2% Sales 1 599 1 788 11.8% Adjusted gross margin 637 684 7.5% Adj. gross margin (as % of sales) 39.8 % 38.3 % Adj.

Nominal sales growth included a positive currency effect of 5.2%  mainly attributable to the appreciation of the USD  and a positive impact from consolidation and other changes of 0.2%. LED-based sales increased from 82% in Q1 21 to 84% in Q1 2022.During the quarter  energy prices increased significantly. Together with higher transportation costs  the increase in energy costs impacted the adjusted gross margin  mainly in Conventional Products due to its energy intensive production processes. As a result of these cost increases  the Adjusted gross margin decreased by 150 bps to 38.3%  yet on the back of a high comparison base in Q1 2021. The company is implementing further price increases to compensate for these effects.Adjusted indirect costs as a percentage of sales decreased by 150 bps to 29.5%  driven by operating leverage and structural cost savings.Adjusted EBITA increased by 8.6% to EUR 187 million. The Adjusted EBITA margin was 10.5%  remaining above 10% for the second consecutive year. The Adjusted EBITA margin decline of 30 bps reflects the high comparison base of the previous year  a negative currency effect of 130 bps and higher COGS  which were partly compensated by price increases  positive sales mix and operating leverage.Restructuring costs were EUR 4 million  acquisition-related charges were EUR 7 million and incidental items were EUR 29 million  largely attributable to impairments related to Signify's operations in Russia and Ukraine.Net income increased by EUR 27 million to EUR 87 million  mainly reflecting higher income from operations and lower net financial expenses  partly reduced by impairments related to our operations in Russia and Ukraine.¹ This press release contains certain non-IFRS financial measures and ratios  such as comparable sales growth  EBITA  adjusted EBITA and free cash flow  and related ratios  which are not recognized measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS.

In 2021 revenue and other income are comprised essentially of a Research Tax Credit (CIR) in the amount of €1.6 million and €0.8 million for contractual indemnities paid by Second Sight Medical Product Inc. (SSMP). These indemnities were paid following the unilateral termination of the MOU between the two companies concluded on 5 January 2021 by SSMP.Story continuesOperating expenses amounted to €12.9 million  compared to €10.5 million in 2020. Operating expenses increased by 22.7% for €2.4 million of which €1.1 million in research and development and €1.3 million in general and administrative expenses.Research and Development expenses totalled €7.3 million  compared to €6.2 million the previous year. In 2021  Pixium Vision strengthened its clinical team and opened several clinical centers in Europe as part of its PRIMAvera pivotal study. In addition  the Group continued to develop and manufacture its Prima bionic vision system to ensure the progress of its ongoing clinical studies.General and administrative expenses totaled €5.6 million compared to €4 4 million in 2020. The increase is mainly linked to the costs incurred by the Company for legal services in preparation for its business combination with Second Sight Medical Product.Operating income (loss) for 2021 was a loss of €10.3 million  compared to a €8.4 million operating loss in 2020.Net income (loss) was a loss of €10.9 million (compared to a loss of €9.1 million in 2020). In 2021  the Group recognised interest results of €0.7 million (compared €0.7 million in 2020). The Group did not recognize corporate income tax expense for 2021. The loss per share was €0.23 and €0.27 per share in 2021 and 2020  respectively.Net cash flows from operating activities increased in 2021 to €8.8 million in outflow  compared to €6.9 million in 2020. The increase in net cash outflow reflects the initiation of the PRIMAvera study  the continuation of the US feasibility study  as well as the spending associated with the preparation of the business combination with Second Sight Medical Products  Inc.Net cash flows from investment activities amounted to €0.1 million and mainly correspond to IT equipment.Net cash flows from financing activities totalled €12.8 million in inflow in 2021. They reflect mainly a capital increase of approximately €8.0 million in gross proceeds and the drawdown of 5 ORNAN tranches for a total of €6.25 million in gross proceeds under its agreement with ESGO. Following the drawdown of the last tranche on 12 May 2021  there is no longer any outstanding warrants as the entire 10 million financing has been drawn.Pixium Vision ended 2021 with a net cash position of €14.5 million  compared to €10.5 million at the end of 2020.Audit differences have been included in the financial statements 2021. Under IAS 32 certain warrants granted to investors in July 2021 (BSA 2021 US) are to be valued at fair market value which created an interest income of €0.1 million for the financial year 2021 leading to a decrease of Net Loss compared to the unaudited report.ContactsPixium VisionOffer NonhoffChief Financial Officer investors@pixium-vision.com Media RelationsLifeSci AdvisorsSophie Baumontsophie@lifesciadvisors.com+33 6 27 74 74 49 Investor RelationsLifeSci AdvisorsGuillaume van Renterghemgvanrenterghem@lifesciadvisors.com+41 76 735 01 31ABOUT PIXIUM VISIONPixium Vision is creating a world of bionic vision for those who have lost their sight  enabling them to regain visual perception and greater autonomy.

Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:“Besi posted strong results in Q1-22 with revenue of € 202.4 million and net income of € 67.5 million at the high end of guidance despite a challenging semiconductor equipment environment. Revenue grew 17.9% versus Q4-21 and 41.3% versus Q1-21 given continued strength for high performance computing applications including data center  advanced logic and hybrid bonding and in automotive end-user markets. We exceeded anticipated quarterly shipment levels amidst supply chain disruptions through strategic inventory and production planning. Of note  shipments of hybrid bonding systems increased in the quarter as Besi overcame flood related challenges in Q4-21 and met customer qualifications necessary to further ramp production.Orders for Q1-22 were € 204.8 million  an increase of 1.1%  versus Q4-21 due to increased demand for high performance computing applications including follow-on orders from two customers for hybrid bonding systems. As compared to Q1-21  orders decreased by 37.4% primarily due to significantly lower bookings for high-end mobile applications post new model introductions launched in 2021. In addition  it reflected decreased demand from Chinese subcontractors for both smartphone and mainstream electronics applications continuing a trend which began in the second half of 2021.Besi’s adjusted net income reached € 75.5 million in Q1-22 representing increases of 13.9% and 59.3%  respectively  versus Q4-21 and Q1-21. Further  our adjusted net margin of 37.3% rose significantly versus the 33.1% achieved in the prior year period. Profit efficiency has remained at elevated levels over the past four quarters due to relatively stable gross margin and baseline opex development. This was achieved by increasing prices as necessary to offset inflationary input costs and successfully limiting overhead growth even despite significantly increased spending for wafer level assembly activities.Besi’s liquidity position continues to expand with cash and deposits of € 696.6 million at the end of Q1-22 growing 3.6% versus year end 2021 and 15.0% versus Q1-21. Similarly  net cash of € 407.0 million increased 9.9% versus Q4-21 and 88.3% versus Q1-21 due to strong cash flow generation and the conversion into equity of a portion of our 2023 and 2024 Convertible Notes. Given projected cash flow generation and current market uncertainties  we intend to accelerate share repurchases from € 15 to € 25 million per quarter under the current program. Post quarter end  we issued € 175 million of 1.875% Convertible Notes due 2029  the net proceeds from which will be used to help fund the expansion of our wafer level assembly portfolio  share buybacks and general corporate purposes  including acquisitions.At present  the assembly equipment industry is faced with many cross currents and limited visibility. We see continued strength in the first half of 2022 from advanced computing  automotive and hybrid bonding applications. In addition  industry growth is further supported by customer capex roadmaps and the anticipated construction of 47 new wafer fabs over the next three years. Many of such new fabs are for advanced packaging and wafer level assembly applications. In contrast  Besi’s order development in 2022 has been limited by a number of headwinds including lower demand for high-end smartphones following the 2021 new product cycle  weakness in Chinese markets  global GDP uncertainties  disruptions to global supply chains and geo-political conflict.Our strategic priorities for 2022 focus on satisfying customer delivery schedules  navigating global supply chain and pandemic related challenges and building out Besi’s development  support and production capabilities to scale hybrid bonding and other wafer level assembly activities. For Q2-22  we estimate that revenue will increase by 10% (+/- 5%) versus Q1-22 with gross margin levels staying in the 59-61% range. Operating expenses are anticipated to decrease by 0-5% as lower share-based compensation expense is partially offset by increased spending for development and service/support activities.Longer term  we are encouraged by the favorable drivers for Besi’s business as we advance further into the digital society including the proliferation of AI and industrial automation  cloud computing  5G network expansion  data analytics  vehicle electrification and increased enterprise demand as employees begin returning to the office.”First Quarter Results of Operations€ millions Q1-2022 Q4-2021 Δ Q1-2021 Δ Revenue 202.4 171.7 +17.9% 143.2 +41.3% Orders 204.8 202.6 +1.1% 327.1 -37.4% Book to Bill Ratio 1.0x 1.2x -0.2 2.3x -1.3Q1-22 revenue of € 202.4 million increased by 17.9% versus Q4-21 due primarily to increased shipments for high performance computing (“HPC”) end markets  particularly data center  advanced logic and hybrid bonding applications.

3948,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4110229.html,First-quarter 2022 revenue of €701 million up 85% like-for-like,Sébastien Bazin  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Accor  said: “Accor's performance in the first quarter of 2022 confirms the clear upturn in business across all regions and the renewed momentum in tourism  food services and entertainment. These result…,"Sébastien Bazin  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Accor  said: ""Accor's performance in the first quarter of 2022 confirms the clear upturn in business across all regions and the renewed momentum in tourism  food services and entertainment. These results are notably driven by our market dynamics in Europe  the Middle East and the Americas as well as the strong demand for our Luxury and Lifestyle hotels  and domestic travel. Such underlying trends  combined with borders reopening give us confidence that our performance will continue to improve month after month  with prices already above 2019 level. Our brands are attractive  ideally positioned  and the augmented hospitality ecosystem we have built over the past years is attracting an increasing number of guests and owners. In the coming months  we will continue to focus our efforts on accelerating the development of our network  promoting our brands as well as attracting and retaining more and more customers.""Accor’s business has rebounded sequentially every quarter since Q2 2021. The outbreak of the Omicron variant caused only a brief hiccup in January  and the recovery seen in February gained further momentum in March. This rebound reflects both the sustained increase in the number of business and leisure domestic guests  and border reopenings which accelerated the return of international travelers. It was accompanied by a sharp increase in prices  which are now above 2019 levels for the last 4 months in a row across the Group  driven by demand and exacerbated by inflation.During the first quarter of 2022  Accor opened 26 hotels  representing about 3 700 rooms  for net growth in the network of 2.5% over the twelve-month period. At end-March 2022  the Group had a portfolio of 777 849 rooms (5 304 hotels) and a pipeline of about 212 000 rooms (1 212 hotels).For 2022  the Group is confirming its forecast of net growth in the network of 3.5%.Consolidated revenueThe Group reported first-quarter 2022 revenue of €701 million  up 85% like-for-like (LFL) versus Q1 2021. By activity  this growth breaks down into a 105% increase for HotelServices and 52% for Hotel Assets & Other. To provide a comparison with the 25% decline in RevPAR (presented as the change versus FY 2019 throughout this release)  the like-for-like decline in revenue versus Q1 2019 is 23%.Changes in the scope of consolidation (acquisitions and disposals) contributed a positive€13 million  largely due to the integration of the companies which are now part of Ennismore over 2021.Currency effects had a positive impact of €18 million  mainly due to the US dollar (+7%).Source: AccorHotelServices revenueHotelServices  which includes fees from Management & Franchise (M&F) and Services to Owners  reported €507 million in revenue  up 105% like-for-like versus Q1 2021 (down 25% like-for-like versus Q1 2019).Revenue in Management & Franchise (M&F) stood at €158 million  up 106% like-for-like versus Q1 2021 (down 33% like-for-like versus Q1 2019)  with regional performances correlated to the business recovery in the countries considered. In general  the sharper decline in M&F revenue compared with RevPAR (down 25% versus Q1 2019) can be attributed to the larger decrease in incentive fees based on the hotel operating margin generated from management contracts.Source: AccorConsolidated RevPAR more than doubled in Q1 2022 (up 108% as reported) compared with Q1 2021 but was still down 25% versus Q1 2019. Compared with the same period last year  the Group was better able to optimize its pricing policy thanks to the increased visibility provided by earlier bookings.Overall  Europe was the region the most impacted by the Omicron variant. But this impact was short-lived and remained limited to January: in March 2022  occupancy rates already exceeded their Q4 2021 levels.South Europe reported a 21% decline in RevPAR in Q1 2022 compared with Q1 2019 i.e. a 4-percentage-point sequential decline compared with Q4.In France   RevPAR was down 20% from Q1 2019. As was the case in 2021  regional cities remained the most dynamic markets while the Paris region lagged. However  the performance gap between regional cities and the Paris region began to narrow due to the return of international business travelers.  RevPAR was down 20% from Q1 2019.

In Spain  RevPAR was down 26% compared with Q1 2019.North Europe showed RevPAR down 38% versus Q1 2019  or a sequential decline of -1 percentage point vs. Q4 2021.In the United Kingdom   RevPAR was down 15% compared with Q1 2019. Similar to France  the recovery was driven by regional cities  which were almost back to their 2019 activity levels. The performance gap with London also started to close due to the pick-up in international visitors.  RevPAR was down 15% compared with Q1 2019. Similar to France  the recovery was driven by regional cities  which were almost back to their 2019 activity levels. The performance gap with London also started to close due to the pick-up in international visitors. In Germany  where health restrictions were tougher and longer than in neighboring countries  RevPAR was down 62% compared with Q1 2019. Nevertheless  these restrictions are now lifted since early April and an improvement is now visible.RevPAR improved sequentially in Asia-Pacific (+5 percentage points between Q4 2021 and Q1 2022)  driven by the Pacific region. RevPAR fell by 43% versus Q1 2019.The Pacific region benefited from the reopening of internal borders during the full quarter.

Southeast Asia’s RevPAR was stable at -55% but the situation is improving. Destinations such as Singapore  Bali  Vietnam and Thailand have reopened their borders with limited restrictions. The region nevertheless continues to rely heavily on international visitors (thus depending on air flight traffic capacity recovery) and some Asian countries are not yet permitted to travel to these destinations.In the India  Africa  Middle East & Turkey region  activity continued to improve with RevPAR now above the Q1 2019 level (+8%). The United Arab Emirates benefited from demand related to the World Expo in Dubai  which has been open since October 1  2021. The World Cup of Soccer in Qatar in Q4 2022 will help drive this recovery. In Saudi Arabia  the broader reopening of the holy cities for pilgrimages has led to a sharp rebound in activity. The Ramadan period in April and the pilgrims authorized to join the Hajj in July should confirm this rebound in the coming quarters.In the Americas  RevPAR was down 14% compared with Q1 2019 with average prices now above their 2019 levels.North/Central America and the Caribbean reported a 22% decline in RevPARcompared with Q1 2019.

In South America  RevPAR was up 5% versus Q1 2019. This strong performance can be attributed to renewed demand from business travelers.Services to Owners revenue  which includes the Sales  Marketing  Distribution and Loyalty division  as well as shared services and the reimbursement of hotel staff costs  came to €349 million in the first quarter of 2022  up 104% compared with 2021. This increase reflects the pick-up in activity compared with last year.Hotel Assets & Other revenueRevenue in the “Hotel Assets & Other” segment was up 52% like-for-like versus Q1 2021 and down 19% like-for-like versus Q1 2019. This segment  which is closely linked to business in Australia  notably benefited from a pick-up in leisure tourism demand on the northeastern coast of the country where most of the Group’s Strata activities are located (i.e. room and apartment distribution activities and managed properties).Since early 2021  this segment has included concierge services  luxury home rentals  private sales of hotel stays and digital services for hotel owners. These activities continue to be affected in different ways  ranging from businesses directly related to the Travel segment  such as onefinestay’s private home rentals  to the digital businesses  such as D-EDGE.At end-March 2022  this segment  which includes owned and leased hotels  represented 116 hotels and 23 166 rooms.OutlookBased on current reservation and price increase trends  RevPAR will continue to improve in the coming quarters.Domestic demand is expected to return to levels comparable to 2019 by the end of the year. Recovery in international demand is catching up even if Asia lags.Net growth in the network is forecast at 3.5% for 2022  as announced with the release of the 2021 annual results  with openings expected to accelerate as of the second quarter.Events since January 1st  2022Decision made by the Board of DirectorsAt its meeting on February 23  2022  and based on the recommendations of the Appointments  Compensation and CSR Committee  the Board of Directors resolved to propose the renewal of Mrs. Qionger Jiang  Mrs. Isabelle Simon  Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy and Mr. Sarmad Zok as Directors of the Company for a three-year duration.The Board also decided to propose  in addition to the appointment of Mrs. Hélène Auriol Potier  which was already announced  the appointments of Mrs. Asma Abdulrahman Al-Khulaifi and Mr. Ugo Arzani as Directors  for the same period of three years.Upcoming events in 2022May 20th: Annual General AssemblySource: AccorSource: AccorAbout AccorAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of more than 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

(NYSE: GTLS) today reported results for the first quarter ended March 31  2022. Further details can be found in the supplemental presentation accompanying this release and published in the investor relations section of our website.First quarter 2022 all-time record orders of $636.8 million  our fourth record order quarter out of the past five quarters  contributed to our sixth consecutive record backlog quarter ($1 477.0 million); First quarter 2022 orders included $228.4 million of Big LNG export terminal releasesFirst quarter 2022 sales of $354.1 million were our highest first quarter sales in our history and increased 22.7% when compared to the first quarter of 2021 (an increase of 27.0% excluding Big LNG in both periods)First quarter reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 23.6% (adjusted 26.1%) was the highest in a year and in-line with the expected trend of increasing sequential gross margin and operating income as a percent of sales improvement for the remainder of 2022Executed a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) with Greenstone Renewables for Chart to be their exclusive technology and equipment supplier for their 100% renewable solar hydrogen liquefaction project expected to proceed to Final Investment Decision (“FID”) in 2022First quarter reported non-diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) of $0.28; adjusted non-diluted EPS of $0.65 excluding Mark-to-Market (“MTM”) from investment activity and other one-time costsUpdated 2022 full-year revenue outlook of $1.725 billion to $1.85 billion and associated full-year adjusted non-diluted EPS guidance of $5.35 to $6.50Energy independence  resiliency  security and sustainability are key drivers of record orders ($636.8 million) and backlog ($1 477.0 million); accelerating activity in both Liquefied Natural Gas (“LNG”) and Specialty Products.The first quarter 2022 was our highest order quarter in our history  with $636.8 million of new orders booked  including $228.4 million related to Big LNG export terminals. This is our second consecutive record order quarter and four out of our last five quarters set new order quarter records. This resulted in our sixth consecutive quarter of record backlog ($1 477.0 million); backlog is 58.1% higher than one year ago. Also in the first quarter 2022  we booked 65 orders that each were over $1 million (more than twice as many as the first quarter 2021) along with 84 new customers and 28 first-of-a-kind (“FOAK”) orders including a first Earthly Lab’s CiCi Elm unit sale to new customer Troeg’s Brewery  with continued broad-based demand in Specialty Products across a variety of applications.In addition to the broad-based demand we experienced exiting 2021 and to start 2022  demand for our products  in particular LNG and other energy alternative solutions and equipment  accelerated as the result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict that began February 24  2022. We have seen an increase in actual orders as well as inquiries from both public and private sector entities surrounding the need for infrastructure to access molecules to support energy security  access  independence and resiliency  all with the backdrop of the requirement for alternative sources of supply and continued focus on sustainability. For example  the United Kingdom as part of their revised energy strategy  has doubled its 2030 hydrogen target. What is critical to note is that this recent activity has spotlighted the need for construction and action now to address these topics.Story continuesSpecific examples of new orders received reflecting the acceleration of energy activity following the initiation of the Ukraine-Russia conflict include:Combined  the three pillars of our LNG business are the most active in our history; (1) Big LNG export terminals  (2) small-scale LNG (“ssLNG”) globally and (3) LNG infrastructure. We booked three Big LNG project orders in the first quarter 2022:$135.5 million order with Full Notice to Proceed (“FNTP”) brazed aluminum heat exchanger assemblies and corresponding cold boxes for Venture Global Plaquemines Phase 1 (10 MTPA).$47.5 million order for Limited Notice to Proceed (“LNTP”) for Cheniere’s Corpus Christi Stage Three terminal. We anticipate this project moves to FNTP in 2022.$45.4 million order for six of the eighteen BAHX assemblies and cold boxes for Venture Global’s Plaquemines Phase 2 export terminal project.We closed 2021 with four small-scale liquefaction projects booked the last week of the year. In the first quarter of 2022  the trend of ssLNG projects continued  with our order from New Fortress Energy (“NFE”) for their FastLNG2 project. Continuing this trend into the second quarter 2022 was our receipt of a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) from NFE for FastLNG3.Shell publicly announced its intent to build LNG fueling stations for long-haul transportation in India. We have continued to see global LNG station demand including 14 stations booked in the first quarter 2022  three of which were with an international oil company.And while not in our guidance  we continue to expect additional progress from other LNG export terminal operators to FID with the potential for additional Big LNG as well as ssLNG orders with Chart releases in 2022.Specialty Products orders continued to demonstrate consistency and strength  with the first quarter 2022 being our fifth consecutive quarter of Specialty Products orders above $100 million. We are also seeing numerous synergy sales opportunities across our Nexus of Clean™ newly acquired companies – ranging from cross-selling water treatment solutions to food and beverage customers to cross selling carbon capture processes to water customers. Two examples from the first quarter 2022:We are partnering with Simmons Foods for our third installation at the state-of-the-art industrial wastewater treatment site and processing facility in Southwest City  MO by providing super-oxygenation technology for their efficient wastewater treatment.We are working with International Flavors & Fragrances (“IFF”) in a unique application for odor reduction and efficient wastewater treatment at the Jacksonville  FL flavor and fragrances site. Removal of all surface aerators was made possible by providing super-oxygenation technology for their efficient wastewater treatment. This same customer is doing an engineering study with our Sustainable Energy Solutions’ (“SES”) cryogenic carbon capture technology.Gas By Rail™  carbon capture and space exploration orders each grew over 20% when compared to the first quarter of 2021  while water treatment grew over 500%. Food & beverage orders grew 14% for that same period  driven by first quarter 2022 new restaurant starts and distributor activity significantly (20%) over plan. While the first quarter of any given year in food and beverage orders typically can be slow due to weather  this year we did not see slowdown. Additionally  Chick-Fil-A started an upgrade program with our tanks  and we are proud to provide our nitrogen dosers to a major beverage company for their newly released  first of a kind  nitrogen-infused cola. Our expectation is that demand for our food & beverage products will continue to increase throughout 2022. As we expected  we did not book any hydrogen or helium liquefier orders in the first quarter  yet demand for our hydrogen equipment continued  with $30 million of hydrogen-related equipment orders. What is also noteworthy in hydrogen is the increase in the variety of customers as well as the broader geographic locations of these orders; for example  in the past six months  we have increased the number of individual hydrogen customers that have placed orders with us by 70% and we received our first orders from Nikola and expanded our customer set to South Korea  including SK Korea.Delivering on our record backlog is supported by our organic investment in capacity and automation as well as strategic sourcing actions. We recognized our highest first quarter sales in our history in the first quarter of 2022 ($354.1 million).To open the second quarter 2022  we received a tens of millions order from a European government organization for mobile equipment. This order is one of many that supports increasing and strong volume for our in-flight capital project of capacity expansion in our Goch  Germany trailer manufacturing facility. This order builds upon our record trailer order year in 2021 and a very strong first quarter of 2022  with 140 trailers ordered globally.As we continue to anticipate growing sales across our solutions offerings  our capacity expansion capital plan combined with our automation activities remains on schedule. In the first quarter 2022 we completed the implementation of our vacuum insulated pipe (“VIP”) line in Lery  France  and we expect our additional brazed aluminum heat exchanger (“BAHX”) line to be operating in Tulsa  Oklahoma by the first quarter of 2023. Our SriCity  India tank capacity expansion is already partially in operation this month and expected to be fully complete by July 2022.Our sales in the first quarter 2022 were $354.1 million  our highest first quarter sales in our history  driven by a combination of sequential order growth in Cryo Tank Solutions as well as timing and record backlog heading into the year. Sales increased 22.7% when compared to the first quarter of 2021 (27.0% when excluding Big LNG from both periods) and reflected record sales in water treatment  carbon capture  Heat Transfer Systems (“HTS”) project work  and Repair Service and Leasing (“RSL”) parts  repair  service as well as fans aftermarket.Throughout 2021  we strategically decided to increase our on-hand inventory balance as the result of increases in material costs and the frequently discussed availability challenges of materials. This decision resulted in lower than typical free cash flow in 2021. We entered 2022 with higher than typical inventory levels  yet at the time anticipated that free cash flow for 2022 would reflect the tempering of these challenges as the year progressed. Given the uncertain supply chain and material cost environment that worsened as the result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict  we have chosen to continue to strategically build safety stock of key raw material inputs  including carbon steel  stainless steel and aluminum  especially given our ability to source these globally while attempting to procure them at lower cost points in the market. This continued strategic safety stock inventory build resulted in lower than typical free cash flow for the first quarter 2022 yet allows us to meet our customers’ ongoing delivery timelines and record demand levels  thereby continuing to secure additional business. Even with these challenges and this strategic decision  our net cash used by operating activities was only ($22) million  and when adjusted for unusual items  was $8 million. This included an increase to our inventory of $35 million in the first quarter of 2022  driven by the strategic sourcing decisions we made to add safety stock (+$19 million)  the increases in material costs and the purchasing of material for our larger projects that were booked in the fourth quarter of 2021 and the first quarter of 2022. Even considering the inventory headwinds  we continue to anticipate that with the payment schedules for Big LNG project work in backlog that our full year 2022 adjusted free cash flow will be in the range of $175 million to $225 million.Continued progress on pricing and cost actions are reflected in our first quarter 2022 reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 23.6% (adjusted gross margin as a percent of sales of 26.1% when excluding restructuring and organic startup capacity costs)  demonstrating our progress in incremental and sequential quarterly improvement in our margin profile.As 2022 began  we continued to take further pricing and cost reduction actions to progress faster against our lagging cost to price backlog. During the first quarter  we took additional steps than what was originally anticipated after seeing the material availability and cost impacts after the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. We implemented additional price increases in the first quarter 2022 and increased our temporary surcharges yet again and combined with our 2021 actions are expected to cover our additional costs on new orders. We have made additional progress in the first quarter on addressing the continuing inflationary and unique macro challenges as well as bringing new capacity online. Examples include (details can be found on slides 11 through 18 of the supplemental presentation):Availability of material is improving particularly in the United States following a very challenging month of March 2022 globally  yet we continue to generate alternative  localized as well as global sources of supply while reviewing alternative component sources. Additionally  we were faced with Force Majeure on our nitrogen gas supply in the Southeast United States from our gas suppliers throughout the first quarter 2022. This has since been lifted yet we are now under Force Majeure for helium supply in various regions of the United States indefinitely  causing additional cost and inefficiencies. We continue to find new alternative supply and when possible  we also have utilized one of our trailers from our leasing fleet to transport our own gas.Logistic costs  including availability of drivers and trucks remained a challenge. As we previously described  additional logistics costs had a net negative margin impact of $1.4 million in the fourth quarter 2021. This meaningfully improved to a net negative margin impact of $0.6 million in the first quarter 2022 and we took even further steps by product type to ensure this continues to sequentially improve to a net zero impact (which is anticipated no later than the third quarter 2022). Additionally  generally we did not miss shipments as the result of the logistics situation.January and February 2022 were our two highest months of COVID-19 absences globally since the start of the pandemic/endemic in March 2020. We had 295 team members out with COVID in January 2022 and 109 in February 2022  yet we have become more agile in adapting to these types of challenges and taking advantage of our flexible manufacturing options. Therefore  it did not meaningfully impact our sales in the first quarter 2022. We actually had nine shops with 100% on-time delivery in the first quarter 2022 (up from eight in the fourth quarter 2021) as well as 17 facilities with over 95% on-time delivery in the first quarter 2022.While we lost an entire week of production at our Chart China facility in the month of March 2022 due to government COVID-19 lockdowns  our team members managed to ship to our forecast. Nice job  Chart China team!Our CryoDiffusion vacuum insulated pipe manufacturing line is complete and running as of the first quarter 2022 and we anticipate our SriCity  India capacity expansion project to be fully operational by the third quarter 2022.The steps taken in the second half of 2021 as well as the first quarter of 2022 resulted in our improving reported gross margin as a percent of sales of 23.6%  a sequential increase of 190 basis points over the fourth quarter of 2021. While this still lagged behind first quarter 2021 gross margin percentage given the timing differences between raw material cost increases and our corresponding pricing actions  as discussed elsewhere  we expect this timing gap to narrow as the year progresses. When adjusted for one-time items including primarily restructuring and organic startup capacity costs  gross margin as a percent of sales in the first quarter 2022 was 26.1%  which was not adjusted for first quarter impacts such as our highest four week stretch of COVID-19 absences  inefficiencies from Force Majeures issued by our gas suppliers to our factories  higher transport and logistics costs  additional team member retention payments as well as other labor inefficiencies.Our first quarter 2022 reported non-diluted EPS of $0.28 included a negative impact of $0.14 ($0.11 net of tax) from the quarter’s mark-to-market of our inorganic investments as well as operational one-time costs related to restructuring  startup/capacity and deal and integration totaling $0.26 net of tax. When adjusting for these items  adjusted non-diluted EPS was $0.65. Sequentially when compared to the fourth quarter 2021  our addbacks to earnings per share  excluding the mark-to-market gains and losses of our inorganic investments net of FX  are down 42%  which demonstrates our expectation that we will continue to have fewer adjustments to EPS as the result of acquisition integrations completing after year one of ownership  not anticipating any debt or refinance costs in 2022 and the timing of new organic capacity and product lines coming online throughout the year.“We are pleased with our pricing and cost reduction progress  reflected in our improving gross margin as a percent of sales and expected to continue throughout the remainder of the year ” stated Jill Evanko  Chart’s President and CEO. “In addition  we continue to hit key milestones of one-year acquisition integrations on schedule while completing capacity and productivity projects throughout 2021 and 2022. These activities also support our ability to deliver our solutions on-time to our customers as we continue to see record demand  including the first quarter of 2022 being our sixth consecutive quarter of setting a new historical backlog record and our highest order quarter ever.”Additional Partnerships Executed in Q1 2022.In the first quarter 2022  we continued to build upon our industry partnerships via investment  collaborations  LOIs  and MOUs. We are pleased to share the following partnerships that were executed this quarter:Executed a LOI with Greenstone Renewables for Chart to be their exclusive liquefaction technology and equipment supplier for their 100% renewable solar hydrogen production project expected to proceed to Final Investment Decision (“FID”) in 2022.Signed an agreement with an industrial gas customer to be their tank and heat exchanger supplier for their global hydrogen projects.Joined Cemvita Factory as a founding member of their Gold Hydrogen technology.Funded Hy24’s first hydrogen investment  one year after our decision to be an anchor partner in the world’s first hydrogen pure play investment fund (originally “FiveT Hydrogen Fund”).Announced our collaboration with Calgon Carbon Corporation (“Calgon Carbon”)  a wholly owned subsidiary of Kuraray Co.  Ltd. (TYO: 3405) (“Kuraray”) and ChartWater™. We will partner in offering PFAS water treatment systems using granular activated carbon (GAC) media enabling ChartWater™ and Calgon to combine their capabilities for solutions that will cost-effectively provide safe drinking water to small community water systems and under-resourced rural communities across the United States.Completed our AdEdge (ChartWater™) joint venture with AdEdge India  allowing us regional capabilities to sell our water treatment solutions across India.Update 2022 Outlook With Increased Confidence in Higher 2023 and 2024 Outlooks.Our anticipated 2022 full year sales outlook is in the range of $1.725 billion to $1.85 billion with associated non-diluted adjusted EPS of $5.35 to $6.50  both revised from our prior guidance. There are a few noteworthy items in our current outlook:(1) Our current sales outlook includes approximately $25 to $40 million of Big LNG related revenue in the year from orders booked in the first quarter 2022. We reiterate that our sales timing is expected to sequentially increase throughout the year  with the Big LNG revenue primarily in the latter part 2022. (2) Recently  key customers for our HLNG vehicle tank products lowered their 2022 purchasing forecasts (timing shift is anticipated to 2023) as the result of the macroeconomic challenges in the vehicle industry. This primarily impacts our second quarter 2022. (3) We consider uncertainty around shutdowns and logistics in China in the near-term in this outlook. (4) The higher-end of the range requires specific larger opportunities in our commercial pipeline to be booked as orders in the coming few months. (5) Our assumed weighted shares outstanding in the current outlook are 35.83 million  an increase from our prior guidance of 35.6 million shares. (6) We are assuming a 19% effective tax rate (unchanged from prior guidance). (7) As we said previously  we anticipate the first half of 2022 will include a margin drag from historical levels from the ongoing macro challenges but increasingly be offset as the year progresses by the positive impact from actions we have taken to date. (8) Also  important to note is that prior to the first quarter 2022  there was immaterial Big LNG in our backlog for 2022 and beyond. Now with Big LNG orders booked and anticipating additional Big LNG orders later this year  our 2023 through 2025 outlooks all increase meaningfully.FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSCertain statements made in this press release are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

The total contract value for the three contracts is approximately $404 million  inclusive of mobilization revenue.When the three contracts start  Seadrill will operate seven units directly and have a further three units on a bareboat charter in the Middle East. The company added that it had a long successful track record in the Middle East  providing safe and efficient operations since 2013.“With our imminent re-listing in Oslo  news of this award confirms Seadrill’s status as a preferred partner in a rapidly recovering rig market ” Simon Johnson  Seadrill Chief Executive Officer  stated.“Upon commencement of operations early next year  these rigs will add to Seadrill’s strong market share in the Middle East  leading to significant economies of scale by clustering rigs of similar design in a market segment where we see strong signs of recovery and long-term demand ” he said.Neither of the three rigs has been used for a while. The first rig is stationed in the UAE while the West Cressida and West Leda are located in Malaysia.It is worth noting that Seadrill yesterday started trading its common shares on Euronext Expand. The company is expected to uplist to the main market of the Oslo Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange later this year. The relisting of the shares was done some two months after Seadrill emerged from Chapter 11.This is the third time this week the company won deals for its rig. Earlier this week the company announced deals for the West Neptune drillship and the Sevan Louisiana semi-submersible.The West Neptune was awarded a four-well extension with two one-well options with LLOG in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The firm term will begin in direct continuation of the existing contract  has an estimated duration of 200 days  and is expected to keep the rig busy until August 2023.The deal for the Sevan Louisiana is a three-well extension with Talos  also in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The extension has a minimum duration of 105 days and is an extension to the existing contract with Talos  which is set to start in August 2022. The total value of the deals for the West Neptune and the Sevan Louisiana is $105 million.A day before those deals were announced  a joint venture between Seadrill and Angola’s Sonangol – Sonadrill – secured a ten-well deal in Angola for the West Gemini drillship. The contract could go on for even more wells as it has options for up to 8 additional wells.To contact the author  email bojan.lepic@rigzone.com,neutral,0.04,0.81,0.15,mixed,0.25,0.46,0.29,True,English,"['$404 Mn Deal', 'Three Rigs', 'Seadrill', 'West Leda offshore jack-up drilling rigs', 'long successful track record', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'Offshore driller Seadrill Limited', 'Seadrill Chief Executive Officer', 'Oslo Stock Exchange', 'U.S. Gulf', 'West Gemini drillship', 'West Neptune drillship', 'The West Neptune', 'strong market share', 'two one-well options', 'recovering rig market', 'total contract value', 'total value', 'West Ariel', 'West Cressida', 'market segment', 'strong signs', 'main market', 'Middle East', 'leading operator', 'firm term', 'three years', 'second quarter', 'mobilization revenue', 'seven units', 'three units', 'bareboat charter', 'imminent re-listing', 'preferred partner', 'Simon Johnson', 'significant economies', 'similar design', 'long-term demand', 'three rigs', 'Euronext Expand', 'Sevan Louisiana', 'direct continuation', 'joint venture', 'existing contract', 'efficient operations', 'common shares', 'four-well extension', 'three-well extension', 'minimum duration', 'ten-well deal', '8 additional wells', 'three contracts', 'undisclosed company', 'first rig', 'work', 'customer', 'start', 'safe', 'news', 'award', 'status', 'commencement', 'scale', 'recovery', 'UAE', 'Malaysia', 'relisting', 'Chapter', 'third', 'deals', 'LLOG', 'Mexico', '200 days', 'August', 'Talos', '105 days', 'Angola', 'Sonangol', 'Sonadrill', 'author', 'bojan', 'lepic', 'rigzone']",2022-04-29,2022-04-30,rigzone.com

While not included in our formal 2022 expense guidance range of $617 to $625 million   we believe the pending acquisitions of ErisX and NEO now have the potential to add an incremental $30 to $35 million of expenses in 2022  contingent on the timing of closings which are subject to customary closing conditions. We continue to anticipate a potential revenue offset for more than half of the expenses in year one  with an expectation that the additions are EBITDA positive on a combined basis in year two.Reaffirmed depreciation and amortization expense for 2022  which is included in adjusted operating expenses above  is expected to be in the range of $40 to $44 million   excluding the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets.to   excluding the expected amortization of acquired intangible assets.

The company believes that there is uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to certain of its GAAP measures  primarily related to acquisition-related revenues and expenses that would be required to reconcile to GAAP revenues less costs of revenues  GAAP operating expenses and GAAP effective tax rate  which preclude the company from providing accurate guidance on certain forward-looking GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliations. The company believes that providing estimates of the amounts that would be required to reconcile the range of the company's organic growth  adjusted operating expenses and the effective tax rate on adjusted earnings would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors for the reasons identified above.Capital ManagementAt March 31  2022  the company had adjusted cash1 of $660.0 million.

These measures are not in accordance with  or a substitute for  GAAP  and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. The non-GAAP measures provided in this press release include net transaction and clearing fees  adjusted operating expenses  adjusted operating income  organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  adjusted operating margin  adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share  effective tax rate on adjusted earnings  adjusted cash  EBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin.Management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this press release  including adjusted operating income  organic net revenue and adjusted operating expenses  provide additional and comparative information to assess trends in our core operations and a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by management are provided as additional information to investors in order to provide them with an alternative method for assessing our financial condition and operating results.Organic net revenue  inorganic net revenue  organic non-transaction revenue and organic net revenue guidance: These are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for the impact of our acquisitions for the period or guidance  as applicable. Management believes the organic net revenue growth and guidance measures provide users with supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing and future potential revenue performances and trends by presenting revenue growth and guidance excluding the impact of the acquisitions. Revenues from acquisitions that have been owned for at least one year are considered organic and are no longer excluded from organic net revenue from either period for comparative purposes.Amortization expense of acquired intangible assets: We amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Amortization of intangible assets is inconsistent in amount and frequency and is significantly affected by the timing and size of our acquisitions. As such  if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures  it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses  the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods and the earnings power of the company. Therefore  we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide investors with an additional basis for comparison across accounting periods.Acquisition-related expenses: From time to time  we have pursued acquisitions  which have resulted in expenses which would not otherwise have been incurred in the normal course of the company's business operations. These expenses include integration costs  as well as legal  due diligence and other third-party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size  timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly  we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide an additional analysis of Cboe's ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Cboe's performance between periods.The tables below show the reconciliation of each financial measure from GAAP to non-GAAP. The non-GAAP financial measures exclude the impact of those items detailed below and are referred to as adjusted financial measures.Organic Net Revenue ReconciliationTable 3Three Months Ended(in millions)March 31 Reconciliation of Revenue Less Cost of Revenue to Organic Net Revenue20222021Revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue)$ 418.1$ 365.5Less acquisitions:Acquisition revenue less cost of revenues (inorganic net revenue)$ (8.4)$ —Organic net revenue$ 409.7$ 365.5Reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP InformationThree Months EndedTable 4March 31 (in millions  except per share amounts)20222021Reconciliation of Net Income Allocated to Common Stockholders to Non-GAAP (As shown on Table 1)Net income allocated to common stockholders$ 109.2$ 136.8Non-GAAP adjustmentsAcquisition-related expenses (1)2.03.4Investment establishment costs (2)3.0—Amortization of acquired intangible assets (3)30.632.9Total Non-GAAP adjustments35.636.3Income tax expense related to the items above(8.7)(8.2)Tax reserves (4)48.5—Net income allocated to participating securities - effect on reconciling items(0.3)(0.1)Adjusted net income allocated to common stockholders$ 184.3$ 164.8Reconciliation of Diluted EPS to Non-GAAPDiluted earnings per common share$ 1.02$ 1.27Per share impact of non-GAAP adjustments noted above0.710.26Adjusted diluted earnings per common share$ 1.73$ 1.53Reconciliation of Operating Margin to Non-GAAPRevenue less cost of revenue$ 418.1$ 365.5Non-GAAP adjustments noted above——Adjusted revenue less cost of revenue$ 418.1$ 365.5Operating expenses (5)$ 178.4$ 160.9Non-GAAP adjustments noted above32.636.3Adjusted operating expenses$ 145.8$ 124.6Operating income$ 239.7$ 204.6Non-GAAP adjustments noted above32.636.3Adjusted operating income$ 272.3$ 240.9Adjusted operating margin (6)65.1 %65.9 %Reconciliation of Income Tax Rate to Non-GAAPIncome before income taxes224.9192.9Non-GAAP adjustments noted above35.636.3Adjusted income before income taxes$ 260.5$ 229.2Income tax expense115.355.7Non-GAAP adjustments noted above(39.8)8.2Adjusted income tax expense$ 75.5$ 63.9Adjusted income tax rate29.0 %27.9 %(1) This amount includes professional fees and outside services and impairment charges related to the company's acquisitions.

(5) The company sponsors deferred compensation plans held in a trust. The expenses or income related to the deferred compensation plans are included in ""Compensation and benefits"" ($0.6 million and $0.4 million in expense for the three months ended March 31  2022 and 2021  respectively)  and are directly offset by deferred compensation income  expenses and dividends included within ""Other income  net"" ($0.6 million and $0.4 million in income  expense and dividends in the three months ended March 31  2022 and 2021  respectively  on the condensed consolidated statements of income. The deferred compensation plans' expenses are not excluded from ""adjusted operating expenses"" and do not have an impact on ""Income before income taxes."" (6) Adjusted operating margin represents adjusted operating income divided by adjusted revenue less cost of revenue.EBITDA ReconciliationsEBITDA (earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization) and Adjusted EBITDA are widely used non-GAAP financial measures of operating performance. EBITDA margin represents EBITDA divided by revenues less cost of revenues (net revenue). It is presented as supplemental information that the company believes is useful to investors to evaluate its results because it excludes certain items that are not directly related to the company's core operating performance. EBITDA is calculated by adding back to net income interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back to EBITDA acquisition-related expenses and investment establishment costs. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as substitutes either for net income  as an indicator of the company's operating performance  or for cash flow  as a measure of the company's liquidity. In addition  because EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not be calculated identically by all companies  the presentation here may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.

The funds raised through this operation will help us effectively deploy our unique and global solution in spine surgery  i-kontrol  which combines precise planning  customized execution and analytic monitoring of patient data over time. In 2022  we are intending to significantly accelerate our commercial development  notably in North America thanks to NuVasive’s support  and to make full use of the immense potential of our KEOPS database and our tailor-made surgical technologies in order to pave the way for the gradual automation of spine surgery procedures”.2021 annual resultsSimplified income statement (€ millions) 2021 2020 Sales 2.1 1.1 EBITDA (2.3) (2.0) Operating profit / (loss) (3.3) (2.5) Current profit / (loss) before tax (3.4) (2.5) Net profit / (loss) (3.1) (2.2)Annual sales totaled €2.1 million in 2021  an increase of +73% compared with the previous year (€1.2 million) that had been affected by the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although the public health situation improved in 2021  the Company continued to suffer the consequences of the crisis with the impossibility of accessing certain key markets such as the United States and United Kingdom  travel restrictions having only been lifted at the end of the year. Sales therefore remained concentrated in France (60% of activity)  although the first export distribution contracts signed in 2020 have begun to bear fruit  underpinned at the end of 2021 by a distribution agreement for the Australian market.From the second half of 2021  the Company began to market its patient-specific K-rods with around a hundred surgical procedures performed  primarily in France. Marketing authorization requests were filed with the FDA to obtain approval to market these tailor-made implants in the United States  a market that strongly values technological innovations.The margin on implant sales improved from 53% in 2020 to 55% in 2021  thanks to better procurement conditions negotiated in 2021 with a second qualified subcontractor. Nevertheless  sales via distributors  which now account for close to 40% of total sales and generate lower margins than direct sales  weighed on the general improvement in margins  which should see a significant increase once the Company is in a position to develop its sales in the United States.Other operating expenses  primarily comprising external costs and wages and social security contributions  increased in line with the development of sales activity  the intensification of R&D efforts  legal restructuring operations undertaken prior to the IPO and staff taken on in the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021. The total payroll increased by approximately 27% on the previous year  but its proportion of total operating expenses fell (to 44% in 2021 from 49% in 2020).Depreciation and provisions totaled €1.1 million  versus €0.6 million the previous year. This increase was a result of the rise in R&D spending and thus the amortization of corresponding capitalized costs  the supplying to health facilities of a growing volume of sets of instruments amortized over 5 years and the taking into account of the low consumption level of inventories of implants of extreme sizes.Incorporating the elements detailed above  the 2021 operating loss was €3.3 million  compared with a loss of €2.5 million in 2020  the increase in operating expenses primarily associated with the increase in the payroll and with development projects not yet being sufficiently offset by the mark-ups generated by the growth in sales.Strengthened financial structureSMAIO’s cash and cash equivalents (€574 thousand at end-2021) were strengthened at the end of the first quarter of 2022 by the €8 million in net proceeds generated by the capital increase undertaken at the time of the Company’s IPO on the Euronext Growth market in Paris. SMAIO’s current cash position will allow it to finance the Company’s development in accordance with the strategy presented at the time of its IPO.Implementation of the value-creating partnership with NuVasiveSharing a similar vision of the importance of spinal realignment planning and implant placement to achieve favorable  repeatable and long-lasting results  in the first quarter of 2022 NuVasive  a global leader in spine technology innovation  and SMAIO signed a partnership and licensing agreement to further develop SMAIO’s surgical planning solutions and to support the innovation pipeline and commercialization efforts.As part of this collaboration  NuVasive has pledged to invest a total of $10 million (€9m2) in the Company  of which $5 million (approximately €4.5 million) has already been invested within the framework of SMAIO’s IPO in early April. The balance will consist of milestone payments made when the Company receives FDA 510(k) clearance for two software solutions interfacing with the American group’s technological platforms.NuVasive has exclusivity regarding the planning tool development partnerships implemented by SMAIO for a three-year period from the date on which the second software solution is approved.Moreover  within the framework of this partnership  the Company will put in place an image analysis and planning assistance service for NuVasive’s clients  which will be billed and will thus generate recurring payments proportional to the number of analyses performed.Strategy and outlookIn 2022  and in accordance with the strategy announced at the time of its IPO  the Company will pursue three key objectives:1. The implementation and ramping up of the partnership with NuVasive  focusing on the development of a customized version of the i-plan platform for NuVasive (including the KEOPS  Balance Analyzer 3D and SPIDER Plan software and related services) and  at the same time  an image analysis service offer.2. The development of the i-kontrol solution’s marketing activity in Europe  the United States and Australia. To achieve this  the Company will build on its own sales force  its partner NuVasive for the commercialization of its surgery planning services in the United States and a network of distributors and agents in Europe  Australia and the United States.3. The development of innovative R&D projects aimed at improving the accuracy  speed and reliability of spine surgery  with morphologically adapted guides 3D-printed from scans of the vertebrae to be operated upon enabling implants to be accurately positioned in the pedicles  or morphologically adapted trackers allowing vertebrae to be detected in space in order to steer them or guide a robotic arm.Upcoming financial events:Shareholders’ AGM: June 20  2022June 20  2022 Publication of H1 2022 sales: July 12  2022  after marketAbout SMAIOA precursor in the use of clinical data and imaging of the spine  SMAIO designs global solutions for spine surgery specialists.

The proposer considers that the program may have a positive impact on the Company’s continued development to the benefit of the Company and its shareholders.Resolutions in accordance with items 14a and 14b below shall be made as one resolution and are therefore conditional on each other. A resolution in accordance with this item 14 is valid where supported by shareholders representing at least nine tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting.A description of other incentive programs  the preparation of the proposal  costs for the program and effect on important key figures etc. is presented below.Item 14.a: Resolution regarding issue of warrantsLexor Group S.A. proposes that the annual general meeting of the Company resolves to issue a maximum of 1 280 000 warrants  which may result in a maximum increase in the Company's share capital of SEK 486 683.2354 .

The calculated subscription price shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.01   where SEK 0.005 shall be rounded upwards to SEK 0.01 . The subscription price may not amount to less than the quota value of the company's shares. Upon subscription of shares  the part of the subscription price that exceeds the quotient value of the previous shares shall be allocated to the non-restricted share premium fund.A new share subscribed for by exercise of a warrant has a right to dividends as of the first record day for dividends following registration of the new share issue with the Companies Registration Office and after the share has been registered in the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB .The purpose of the issuance and the deviation from the shareholders preferential rights is to implement the Incentive program directors 2022/2026.The complete terms and conditions for the warrants  including conditions regarding re-calculation  in certain cases  of the subscription price and the number of shares a warrant entitles to  will be available at the Company no later than three weeks before the annual general meeting.The board of directors or a person nominated by it  shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments as may be required in connection with registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and  if applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB .Item 14.b: Resolution regarding approval of transfer of warrantsLexor Group S.A. proposes that the annual general meeting of the Company resolves to approve that the Company may transfer 1 280 000 warrants of series 2022/2026  to certain directors of the board  or in any other matter dispose of the warrants to fulfill the obligations under Incentive program directors 2022/2026.The following terms shall apply to transfers:Right to acquire warrants from the Company shall be attributed to the directors who are elected by the annual general meeting  who each – personally or through a wholly-owned company – shall be entitled to acquire a maximum of 360 000 warrants. The chairman of the board of directors – personally or through a wholly-owned company – shall be entitled to acquire a maximum of 560 000 warrants.

Transfer to the participants shall take place as soon as possible after the end of the notification period  subject to the participant at the time of the acquisition is a member of the board of directors of the Company.Transfer of the warrants shall be made at a price equal to the warrant's market value at the time of transfer  which shall be calculated according to the Black & Scholes valuation model or other generally accepted valuation model. Valuation of the options shall be performed by an independent appraiser  audit firm or valuation expert.Payment for warrants to be acquired shall be made no later than 31 August 2022 .Preparations of the proposals etc.Incentive program 2022/2025 has been prepared by the board of directors and external advisors. Incentive program directors 2022/2026 has been prepared by shareholders and externa advisors.Incentive program 2022/2025Subscription (except by the Company and participants outside Sweden ) and transfer of the warrants shall be made at a price equal to the warrant's fair market value. The warrants fair market value  according to a preliminary valuation based on the market value of the underlying share of SEK 0.75   SEK 0.22 per warrant  assuming an exercise price of SEK 1.04 per share. The Black & Scholes valuation model has been used for the valuation  assuming a risk free interest rate of 1.22 percent and a volatility of 55 percent  with assumption that no dividends and other distributions to shareholders are expected during the period of the program.In order to encourage participation in Incentive Program 2022/2025 for participants in Sweden   it is the board of director's intention that the eligible participants who chose to participate in the program shall receive a premium subsidy. The subsidy is in the form of extra salary in the form of a gross salary payment from the Company totaling an amount corresponding to the amount which the participant have paid for the warrants.The senior executives  employees and key persons in the Company and company group outside Sweden have the right to subscribe for warrants without any consideration paid.The total cost for the Company for Incentive Program 2022/2025 is thereby expected to amount to approximately SEK 1.6 million   while the cash flow effect is expected to amount to approximately SEK 0.2 million . The costs for implementation and administration of Incentive program 2022/2025 is expected to be limited.Incentive program directors 2022/2026Transfer of the warrants shall be made at a price equal to the warrant's fair market value  which means no social fees should arise for the company group in connection with the subscription and transfer of warrants. The warrants fair market value  according to a preliminary valuation based on the market value of the underlying share of SEK 0.75   SEK 0.27 per warrant  assuming an exercise price of SEK 1.04 per share. The Black & Scholes valuation model has been used for the valuation  assuming a risk free interest rate of 1.34 percent and a volatility of 55 percent  with assumption that no dividends and other distributions to shareholders are expected during the period of the program.As the warrants are subscribed for and transferred at fair market value  it is the Company´s assessment that there will be no social fees for the Company as a result of the subscriptions and transfers. The costs will therefore consist only of minimal costs for the implementation and administration of Incentive program 2022/2025 and Incentive program directors 2022/2026 plus SEK 1.6 million in costs for Incentive program 2022/2025.It shall be noted that all calculations above are preliminary  based on assumptions and are only intended to provide an illustration of what costs of the Incentive Program 2022/2025 and Incentive program directors 2022/2026 may include. Actual costs may therefore deviate from what has been stated above.Other outstanding share based incentive programsThe Company has previously established four incentive programs  series 2019/2022 (""Incentive program 2019/2022:1"")  series 2019/2022 (""Incentive program 2019/2022:2"")  series 2021/2024 (""Incentive program 2021/2024"") and series 2021/2024 (""Incentive program 2021/2025"").There are 945 000 outstanding warrants under the Incentive program 2019/2022:1.

The maximum dilution of Incentive program 2022/2025 and Incentive program directors 2022/2026 is estimated to be a maximum of approximately 0.85 percent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company (calculated on the number of existing shares the Company)  assuming full subscription and exercise of all warrants offered.

The Board of Directors changed the proposal to the Annual General Meeting regarding the dividend payment  cutting the total dividend payable to shareholders by EUR 106 million to fund the new capacity. Nokian Tyres will update this page as necessary as the situation evolves. April 28  2022 WAR IN UKRAINE OVERSHADOWED Q1 - OPERATING ENVIRONMENT REMAINS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN Nokian Tyres held its Annual General Meeting on April 28  2022. The company published its Q1 results on April 27  2022. Jukka Moisio  President and CEO: ""For the past two months  we have witnessed shocking events in Ukraine. We have followed the situation with great sadness and we  along with the whole international community  unequivocally condemn the war  which has caused unspeakable suffering to so many. The war in Ukraine started to impact our operating environment in late February. However  the year began with good tire demand and in January−March  our net sales with comparable currencies increased by 21.9% and segments operating profit improved. The result was driven by price increases that we implemented in a wide range of markets and products to offset high raw material and other cost inflation. At these difficult times  our first priority has been to help our Ukrainian colleagues and their families stay safe  and support all Nokian Tyres employees. To secure supply of our products  we immediately activated contingency plans in February  including shipping tires closer to our customers  securing the raw material supply  and transferring production of selected key product lines from Russia to our other factories. To reduce reliance on the Russian production and to diversify our manufacturing footprint  we have continued to increase capacity at our factories in Finland and in the US  and we are expediting our plans to invest in new capacity in Europe. The war in Ukraine will significantly impact our financial results in 2022  especially starting from the third quarter. Due to high uncertainty and dynamic environment  it is impossible to estimate the ultimate impact on our overall performance at the moment. The sanctions have a significant impact on our ability to manufacture tires in Russia  and thus our ability to sell tires in Russia and in Central Europe. Our short-term focus will be on adapting to the fast-changing  highly uncertain operating environment  maintaining control of our operations in Russia and securing cash flow. We have a strong product portfolio  and although there will be difficulties in the short term  we will do our utmost to ensure supply of our products to customers. In the mid-term  adding new supply capability to Europe will be one of our key priorities. At the same time  the Board is evaluating long-term strategic paths in the changing operating environment. I would especially like to thank all Nokian Tyres employees for their perseverance and resilience during this difficult time."" War in Ukraine - Summary of Nokian Tyres' actions On February 24  Russia started the war in Ukraine  which has caused high uncertainty related to Nokian Tyres' operating environment and manufacturing capacity. On April 8  the EU announced new sanctions against Russia  which impact Nokian Tyres' business. The sanctions prohibit the import of tires from Russia to the EU  prohibit the export of certain raw materials from the EU to Russia  and limit transportation from and to Russia. The sanctions have a significant impact on Nokian Tyres' ability to manufacture tires in Russia  and ability to sell tires both in Russia and in the EU  specifically in Central Europe. In 2021  Russia represented approximately 20% of Nokian Tyres' net sales  and approximately 80% of Nokian Tyres passenger car tires were produced in Russia. Of raw materials for tires produced in Russia  approximately half came from outside of Russia. Raw material availability and its logistics will have a significant impact on the company's capability to continue production in Russia. Nokian Tyres is expediting its plans to invest in new production capacity in Europe  and continues to increase production capacity at its factories in Nokia  Finland and Dayton  US. According to the plan  in the future all tires sold in the Nordic countries will be produced in Nokia  and all tires sold in North America will be produced in Dayton and in Nokia. The Heavy Tyres business of Nokian Tyres plc is not impacted by the ban to import tires from Russia to the EU  as all Nokian Tyres' heavy tires are produced in Finland. Sales and distribution of heavy tires to Russia were stopped due to the war. Nokian Tyres has never sold tires to the Russian army  and the Russian Federation is not a customer of Nokian Tyres. Nokian Tyres has taken active measures  such as below  to manage the impacts of the war in Ukraine to its personnel and business: Health and safety actions Continuously communicating about the situation in the organization and providing support to Nokian Tyres' employeesBeing in daily contact with the Ukrainian colleagues to help them and their families stay safeDonating to humanitarian efforts in Ukraine Operational response actions Ensuring compliance with applicable sanctions regimeEstablishing a crisis management team and activating contingency plans to limit the operational and financial impacts  including shipping tires closer to customers  securing the raw material supply to the factories  and transferring production of selected key product lines from Russia to Finland and the USTaking care of the personnel and management in Ukraine and RussiaSecuring control of the asset base in Russia (March 31  2022: EUR 476.1 million)Stopping investments into the Russian production  and stopping all heavy tire sales and distribution to RussiaExpediting plans to diversify manufacturing footprint by investing in new production capacity in Europe and continuing to increase passenger car tire capacity in the Finnish and US factoriesImplementing cost measures by cutting and delaying activities and reducing discretionary spending Financial response actions On March 30  the Board of Directors decided to change its dividend proposal to the Annual General Meeting to be held on April 28  2022 from EUR 1.32/share to EUR 0.55/share (2021: EUR 1.20).

April 9  2022 NOKIAN TYRES PLC: EU BANNING TIRE IMPORTS FROM RUSSIA TO THE EU Nokian Tyres plc Company Release April 9  2022  at 7:45 a.m. Nokian Tyres plc has received information that the EU has announced new sanctions against Russia  including a ban on tire imports from Russia to the EU.

We continue to increase production capacity at our factories in Nokia  Finland and Dayton  USA. The Heavy Tyres business of Nokian Tyres plc is not impacted by the ban to import tires from Russia to the EU  as all Nokian Tyres' heavy tires are produced in Finland. April 8  2022 DIVERSIFYING NOKIAN TYRES' MANUFACTURING CAPACITY - THE BOARD'S NEW DIVIDEND PROPOSAL FUNDS NEW PRODUCTION IN EUROPE BY EUR 106 MILLION Last week Nokian Tyres announced that the company starts to expedite its plans to invest in new production capacity in Europe. Therefore  the Board of Directors changed the proposal to the Annual General Meeting regarding the dividend payment  cutting the total dividend payable to shareholders by EUR 106 million to fund the new capacity.

We are in daily contact with our Ukrainian team  and we have helped and continue to help our employees and their families to stay safe. Over half of our Ukrainian employees are male and cannot leave the country  but we assist them in any way possible given the current situation. In addition  Nokian Tyres has made a donation to UNICEF to help the children in the war zone in Ukraine. We use all possibilities to accelerate the increase of capacity in our factories in Finland and in the US. According to the plan  all tires sold in the Nordic countries in the future will be produced in Nokia  Finland  and all tires sold in North America in the future will be produced in Dayton  US and in Nokia  Finland.

All Nokian Tyres' heavy tires are designed and manufactured in Finland. Tires for trucks and buses are designed in Finland and produced in the EU. We don't accept orders for heavy tires from Russia. By continuing to operate the passenger car tire factory in Russia we want to make sure that the factory is operated and controlled by Nokian Tyres also in the future. We no longer invest into the Russian production. We do not want to speculate on how the situation in general will evolve. We will announce any material direct impacts to Nokian Tyres as appropriate and in a timely manner. We continue to assess the situation and are prepared for rapid responses when needed. On Sunday Nokian Tyres was on the spotlight in the media regarding an analyst call. Certain statements were referred to as they would have been Nokian Tyres' statements. Correction to the media have been made. March 8  2022 NOKIAN TYRES' UPDATE As a company  Nokian Tyres has followed the situation in Ukraine with great sadness and we hope for a quick diplomatic solution to this tragedy. A crisis management team meets daily  and we are prepared for different scenarios. We are also monitoring closely the development of sanctions and potential counter-sanctions. We have activated our contingency plans to mitigate the financial and operational impacts to our business. For example  we are shipping tires closer to our customers  securing the raw material supply to our factories  transferring production of selected key product lines from Russia to Finland and to the US  and securing transport capacity from Russia with existing and new service providers. We continue to increase production in Finland and in the US. All Nokian Tyres' heavy tires are designed and manufactured in Finland. Tires for trucks and buses are designed in Finland and produced in the EU. Currently  our Russian operations are impacted by transportation capacity availability  and lead-times to our customers have increased. The operations can be further impacted by raw material supply. We have been able to fulfill the customer orders despite the supply chain challenges  and continue to do our best to serve our customers and to deliver as agreed with them. Our compliance with current sanctions requires that some of our customers and suppliers in Russia need to change their bank. In cross-border transactions  there are delays and volume is small  as the currency trading is not working normally. For us the safety of our employees is number one priority. We will do everything we can to support our Nokian Tyres team in this situation. We have been operating in Ukraine since 2006  and during those years have built many long-lasting relationships with Ukrainian colleagues and customers. We have some 20 employees in Ukraine. We are in daily contact with our Ukrainian team  and as a first priority  we have taken measures to secure their and their families' safety as best as we can and we will continue our help to them  both on a personal level and as an employer. In addition  Nokian Tyres has donated EUR 100 000 to UNICEF to help the children in the war zone in Ukraine. We do not want to speculate on how the situation in general will evolve. We will announce any material direct impacts to Nokian Tyres as appropriate and in a timely manner. February 28  2022 NOKIAN TYRES PLC WITHDRAWS FINANCIAL GUIDANCE FOR 2022 Nokian Tyres plc  Inside information  February 28  2022 at 12:00 a.m. The Russian military actions in Ukraine and the consequent sanctions have caused significant uncertainty related to Russia  to the functionality of the Russian financial and payment system  and to the Russian ruble exchange rate. Therefore the Board of Directors of Nokian Tyres plc has decided to withdraw the Company's financial guidance for 2022 published on February 8  2022.

3981,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://ehsdailyadvisor.blr.com/2022/04/why-healthcare-companies-must-navigate-muddy-waters-of-esg-requirements/,Why Healthcare Companies Must Navigate Muddy Waters of ESG Requirements,1 day ago,The need for more corporate responsibility has evolved for today’s corporations and the next generation of business leaders in the form of environmental  social  and governance (ESG) initiatives. Investors  activists  and regulators are now requiring proactive  community-structured commitment and accountability that is designed to step above shareholder returns.Today’s global capital markets aren’t interested in more marketing from companies in every industry. Instead  they are demanding sustainability and eco-friendly business practices as well as a reasonable return. Global healthcare companies and their executives are now hearing this call  and the industry is being more proactive in this movement.Why are ESG standards needed?Although ESG metrics are still trying to find their proper place in today’s standardized financial reporting  that hasn’t stopped healthcare companies and other industry institutions from making promises and illustrating the proactive nature of their ESG standards.What’s needed at this critical step is the ability for companies across all industries to truly quantify their company’s present position relative to investor objectives of integration  values  and impact in the areas of governance over environmental and social contexts. American stakeholders AND shareholders aren’t interested in window dressing and empty promises only for the benefit of a feel-good investor report. They want to know that companies are holding themselves accountable to the promises and commitments they’re making in these key areas.Proxy advisors create unfair pressureMany healthcare companies  specifically  have felt their fair share of pressure into adopting more ESG-forward practices. Whether through a reduction of plastic carrier bag usage or gender pay gap reporting  shareholders have certainly brought pressure on a large number of healthcare companies over their supply chain strategies  environmental and sustainability impacts  and certainly gender-diverse practices. This focus has led to a significant overhaul of many business processes alongside the appointment of a new addition to the C-Suite: the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO). Other companies inside and out of healthcare continuously look at leaders in this movement and have started to replicate their operational changes.However  making promises about ESG commitments and holding true to them are apparently two different stories for some. Many companies are being pushed into making ESG improvements and commitments  especially through institutional investors and oversight organizations such as Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS).This has led some to wonder if these proxy advisors have become too focused on ESG issues  have conflicted  and have broadly too much power over the operation of America’s largest healthcare companies.ISS hypocrisy over ESG requirementsAs an example  ISS talks a big game on the issue of diversity and inclusion. ISS demanded publicly traded companies disclose the ethnicity of each and every member of their board of directors. More recently  ISS has been accused of refusing to recommend voting for board slates that they allege do not contain enough “diverse” representation.However  it appears that ISS lacks representation from even a single person of color. Moreover  it does not appear that ISS’s two corporate owners—Genstar Capital and Deutsche Boerse—have even a single person of color on their executive teams. This is troubling given the fact that they have claimed diversity  equity  and inclusion is a priority and have asked publicly traded companies and healthcare companies to make commitments towards those ends. Standards are not only needed  but they must also be adhered to at all levels.Healthcare companies have a chance to serve as modelsDespite the hypocrisy demonstrated by organizations such as ISS  healthcare companies have the opportunity to truly bring about change—not just in their marketing but in the way they go about doing business. In fact  as business models have had to adapt to this new landscape and changed customer behaviors  there has been evidence of the incorporation of ESG elements across the healthcare industry.These moves recognize it is not solely about making money and preserving the bottom line  but that healthcare companies have been working toward having a positive societal impact. There is no doubt that these newly implemented strategies have the potential to drive increased valuations  which pushes up the appetite of investors  but that they also attract more qualified people into healthcare companies who are extremely committed to the corporate cause.As more healthcare companies focus on staying committed to their ESG promises  everyone will win in the end  including customers  stakeholders  investors  the environment  and certainly employees. These companies will truly serve as models of operation in the future. But we must move beyond just promises and commitments  a new set of ESG standards must be developed to level the playing field of reporting.Rashida Salahuddin is the President and CEO of The Corporate Citizenship Project.

CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE IN 2021In summary  Group revenue and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased by $2.1 million or 18.5% and $1.6 million or 68.8%  respectively. Consolidated Profit for the period is $289 thousand  an improvement of $2.2 million or 114.8% as compared with 2020 results.A. EBITDA1: Peru property EBITDA fell by $78 thousand while Nicaragua property EBITDA increased by $1.56 million  both through December 31  2021  as compared to the same period in 2020. Corporate Expense was reduced by $70 thousand in 2021 as compared to 2020. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $1.6 million or by 68.8% through December 31  2021  as compared to through December 31  2020.B. Profit / (Loss): The Group's Loss improved by approximately $2.2 million to a profit of $289 thousand for the period as compared to 2020. This improvement was the result of increased revenue of $2.1 million partially offset by increased expenses of $505 thousand in 2021 as compared to 2020.C. Net Debt: Net debt as of December 31  2021  increased to $16.1 million as compared to $15.8 million as of December 31  2020. Due to a change in accounting policy as required by IFRS 16  the Group is required to account for the net present value of real estate operating lease contracts as Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts. Approximately $4.7 million of our net debt is comprised of Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts.2. MANAGEMENT TO MITIGATE THE RISKS OF COVID-19In terms of demand  Covid-19 hit the Group's markets harder than in much of the world. Hotels  in general  remained largely empty  office leases were commonly terminated or materially renegotiated and gaming facilities  like with restaurants in other parts  were often seen as greater contagion risks as compared to other businesses. Moreover  unlike in the developed markets  there were few fiscal tools and policies available to support businesses and to stimulate demand in the Group's markets.Having said that  in 2021 and through date of 2022  Management stabilized its operations and cash management as compared to 2020  and feel reasonably confident that the Group is able to carry on with the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions. To be prudent  however  the Group has updated its Management Statement on Going Concern as compared to the last update in its 2021 Half-year Report. See more about Group's progress directly below.3. MATERIAL PROGRESS TOWARD SHAREHOLDER MANDATEThe Group continues to pursue decisions that will support the best interest of shareholders according to the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions  the status of which is summarized below in relation to the Group's key remaining assets:A. Peru Hotel Real Estate Converted to Apartment Units: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group has converted its 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru  into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel into 66 individually titled apartment units; ii) Procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals; iii) Restructured approximately $4.5 million of senior debt based on the change of use  enabling the Group to sell units and accelerate debt payment with each sale; and iv) Executed preliminary sales agreements for approximately 40 apartment units with estimated sales value of approximately $6 million. Final bank approvals were received in April 2022  and the Group is now actively signing final sales agreements for contracted units and pursuing the sales of remaining units with a projection to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  with possible completion of this transaction during 2022.B. Peru Office Real Estate Performance Improving: The Group also has approximately 6 703 m2 of rentable-sellable office space  and 158 underground parking spaces. Office occupancies have improved materially in Q1 2022  rising from less than 60% occupancy in the depths of the covid crisis to approximately 80% as of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report. While leases are not generating the same revenue per square meter than achieved pre-covid  the Group's typical 2- to 5-year lease renewal schedule should help to recover lost revenue per meter as leases come up for renewal.C. Nicaragua Gaming and Real Estate Assets: As of the publication date of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group continued to own a 56% interest in a Nicaraguan holding company that owns the following assets: i) Gaming: Three full casinos and three slot parlors with a combined approximately 630 gaming positions; and ii) Real Estate: Approximately 4 562 m2 of land divided among 5 parcels as more fully detailed on page 14. While not precisely segmented herein  Nicaragua EBITDA has experienced material recovery from the 2nd half of 2021 through Q1 2022.D. Costa Rica Real Estate Asset: As of the publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group continues to own a 50% interest in a Costa Rican entity that owns the 11.6-hectare real estate property known as ""Tres Rios."" Tres Rios  with its own  dedicated off ramp  is located close to the country's 2nd largest mall on the highway between the capital city of San Jose and the commuter city of Cartago.The Group will continue to pursue decisions that will support the best interest of shareholders according to the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions.Salomon GuggenheimChief Executive Officer and PresidentApril 30  20221. ""EBITDA"" is not an accounting term under IFRS  and refers to earnings before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  equity in earnings of affiliates  minority interests  development costs  other gains and losses  and discontinued operations. ""Property EBITDA"" is equal to EBITDA at the country level(s). ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is equal to property EBITDA less ""Corporate expenses "" which are the expenses of operating the parent company and its non-operating subsidiaries and affiliates.GROUP OVERVIEWThe Group's consolidated profit / (loss) summary for the twelve months ended December 31  2021  as compared with the same period of 2020 is contained in the Group's Annual Report for year ending December 31  2021  located at www.thunderbirdresorts.com. In summary  Group revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.1 million or 18.5% and $1.6 million or 68.8%  respectively. Consolidated Profit for the period is $289 thousand  an improvement of $2.2 million or 114.8% as compared with 2020 results.RISK MANAGEMENTFor more detail on Risk Factors  see Chapter 8 of the Annual Report.MANAGEMENT STATEMENT ON ""GOING CONCERN""Management has reviewed their plan with the Directors and has collectively formed a judgment about the going concern of the Group. In arriving at this judgment  Management has prepared the cash flow projections of the Group. The Group has suffered recurring losses over the past years. In response to the recurring losses of the previous years  Management has taken actions which will be described in the following paragraphs.Directors have reviewed this information provided by Management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate  the Group's existing commitments and the financial resources available to the Group. Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group's businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (viii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows:Special Resolution: On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.Corporate Expense and Cash Flow: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  and continues to decrease  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.Liquidity and Working Capital: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group forecasts operating with lower levels of reserves and working capital until such time as liquidity events might occur. Selling assets will be critical to creating a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period.While the below events or lack thereof may create uncertainty and cast doubt on going concern  the Group believes that it is in a stronger position to sustain going concern as of the publication date of this 2021 Annual Report as compared to recent years during the covid crisis.Peru Real Estate Sales: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group has converted its 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel into 66 individually titled apartment units; ii) Procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals; iii) Restructured approximately $4.5 million of senior debt based on the change of use  enabling the Group to sell units and accelerate debt payment with each sale; and iv) Executed preliminary sales agreements for approximately 40 apartment units with estimated sales value of over $6 million. Final bank approvals were received in April 2022  and the Group is now actively signing final sales agreements for contracted units and pursuing the sales of remaining units with a projection to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  with possible completion of this transaction during 2022. If for whatever reason the Group is not able to complete the sales of sufficient units to pay down its senior secured lender and related government supported debt in Peru (combined of approximately $5M) and to partially pay down its remaining unsecured debt  this could harm the Group's ability to remain as a going concern in 2024.Other liquidity events: If the Group is not able to create other liquidity events from its remaining Peru  Costa Rica and Nicaragua assets in 2023-2024  it is reasonable to expect that unsecured lenders may pursue years of litigation against the Group at that time  though as to whether or not this would have an impact on Going Concern at that time is hard to assess.Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to mitigate the uncertainty and that the Group is able to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors have therefore prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC.

First of all  our successful IPO in July 2021 allowed us to list on Euronext Growth Paris  one of the most dynamic markets for biotechs and medtechs. This major milestone will help us to accelerate our development efforts aimed at becoming a global reference company in fully automated oncology molecular diagnostics. In parallel with the implementation of our commercial programs  as evidenced by the recruitment of two Sales Directors for the United States and France  we also strengthened our Ikoniscope20 technology platform through targeted R&D investments. In particular we are advancing in the very promising sector of CTC for early cancer detection and treatment monitoring. Moreover  we are integrating artificial intelligence into our platform in order to constantly improve performance and are pursuing technological excellence through best-in class partnerships with universities and laboratories. In conclusion 2021 and early 2022 represented a fundamental phase for Ikonisys. We laid the foundations for the future and we will capitalize on all these efforts in the years to come.”Full Year results 2021 Simplified income statement and update on cash positionEuros 31/12/2021 31/12/2020 Revenues 464 242 485 167 Cost of Goods Sold 70 642 8 183 Operating expenses 805 877 272 281 Operating Income / (Loss) (412 277) 204 703 Interest expenses 5 107 1 770 667 Income / (Loss) before Tax (417 384) (1 565 964) Extraordinary result (151 954) - Taxes 1 931 6 299 Net Income / (Loss) (571 269) (1 572 263) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year 1 516 526 37 596Details of the main changes in the consolidated financial statementsThe net result for 2021 shows a significant improvement compared to previous year’s  in particular due to the reduction in debt and associated interest charges following the restructuring that took place in 2021.As expected  in 2021 Operating Expenses increased with respect to the previous year  both because of the new commercial structure that is being put in place and because of the additional expenses related to the listing  but  following the implementation of its sales and marketing organization after the IPO  the company started the commercialization of the Ikoniscope20 and was able to succeed in selling its first unit to an important reference laboratory.Following the restructuring that took place  and the initial public offering of Ikonisys SA in July 2021  shareholders' equity improved significantly and was increased to €20 013 576 (consolidated shareholders' equity)  compared to €5 699 142. last year (combined pro forma equity).External consolidated debt (excluding related parties) remains stable  slightly reduced at the end of the 2021 financial year (-€52 735).Consolidated cash and cash equivalents at the end of the 2021 financial year amount to €1 516 526  compared to €37 596 last year.FY 2021 and post-closing highlightsSuccessful IPO of Ikonisys at Euronext Growth® ParisThe IPO resulted in a capital increase of 4.0 million euros via the issue of 700 000 new ordinary shares.The initial results of a study demonstrate the capability of the Ikoniscope20 rare cell detection platform to enumerate specific populations of CD8 T cellsUsing Ikoniscope20 platform’s high-speed scan  80 extremely rare antigen-specific CD8 T cells from over a million blood cells were identified. Antigen-specific T cells play a central role in immunity against cancers and infectious agents through their ability to kill malignant cells after recognition by the T cell receptor. This is a further demonstration  in collaboration with the University of Connecticut (USA) School of Medicine  of the potential of Ikonisys' technology in immuno-oncology through its ability to detect rare cells in general  and circulating tumor cells in particular.Recruitment of Manny Iglesias as Sales Director for the US market and Gabriel Plan as France Sales DirectorOn the one hand  Manny Iglesias will be responsible for accelerating Ikoniscope20 sales in the US by strengthening the Company's presence in new geographical areas of the United States while optimizing the marketing and sales strategy. Manny's business leadership and extensive experience in building strong customer relationships will support Ikonisys' accelerated growth.On the other hand  Gabriel Plan brings over ten years of sales and marketing experience to Ikonisys. Gabriel’s responsibilities will encompass accelerating Ikoniscope20 sales in France and other French speaking parts of Europe by acquiring new customers  prominent KOLs (Key Opinion Leaders) and additional reference labs.Successful installation of the Ikoniscope20 at Tomalab  one of the largest genetic laboratories in ItalyThe Ikoniscope20 has been successfully installed at Toma Advanced Biomedical Assays and is being used for daily workflow for the patient care. TomaLab will act as a Reference Laboratory for Ikonisys  boosting R&D and commercialization opportunities. Future applications for novel tests are under evaluation  to further exploit the capabilities of the instrument to automate laboratory workflow and analyze samples otherwise impossible to investigate manually.The Ikoniscope20 preliminary results obtained with University of Connecticut School of Medicine (Neag Cancer Center of UConn) in detecting rare cells surpass the standards of test in immuno-oncologyThe Ikoniscope20 performs immune monitoring functions more effectively  easily and competitively than conventional flow cytometers (the standard tool used for such detection). The Ikoniscope20 detects rare cells at a superior rate to that provided by flow cytometers  also providing detailed morphology information thanks to its high-quality images. Monitoring of immune responses in cancer patients is an increasing need because of newly approved immunotherapy treatments. Those results pave the way for new opportunities for commercialization of the Ikoniscope20  as a better alternative than the flow cytometer.Strategy and outlookThe company intends to continue its development and commercialization strategy.

CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE IN 2021In summary  Group revenue and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased by $2.1 million or 18.5% and $1.6 million or 68.8%  respectively. Consolidated Profit for the period is $289 thousand  an improvement of $2.2 million or 114.8% as compared with 2020 results.A. EBITDA1: Peru property EBITDA fell by $78 thousand while Nicaragua property EBITDA increased by $1.56 million  both through December 31  2021  as compared to the same period in 2020. Corporate Expense was reduced by $70 thousand in 2021 as compared to 2020. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $1.6 million or by 68.8% through December 31  2021  as compared to through December 31  2020.Story continuesB. Profit / (Loss): The Group's Loss improved by approximately $2.2 million to a profit of $289 thousand for the period as compared to 2020. This improvement was the result of increased revenue of $2.1 million partially offset by increased expenses of $505 thousand in 2021 as compared to 2020.C. Net Debt: Net debt as of December 31  2021  increased to $16.1 million as compared to $15.8 million as of December 31  2020. Due to a change in accounting policy as required by IFRS 16  the Group is required to account for the net present value of real estate operating lease contracts as Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts. Approximately $4.7 million of our net debt is comprised of Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts.2. MANAGEMENT TO MITIGATE THE RISKS OF COVID-19In terms of demand  Covid-19 hit the Group's markets harder than in much of the world. Hotels  in general  remained largely empty  office leases were commonly terminated or materially renegotiated and gaming facilities  like with restaurants in other parts  were often seen as greater contagion risks as compared to other businesses. Moreover  unlike in the developed markets  there were few fiscal tools and policies available to support businesses and to stimulate demand in the Group's markets.Having said that  in 2021 and through date of 2022  Management stabilized its operations and cash management as compared to 2020  and feel reasonably confident that the Group is able to carry on with the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions. To be prudent  however  the Group has updated its Management Statement on Going Concern as compared to the last update in its 2021 Half-year Report. See more about Group's progress directly below.3. MATERIAL PROGRESS TOWARD SHAREHOLDER MANDATEThe Group continues to pursue decisions that will support the best interest of shareholders according to the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions  the status of which is summarized below in relation to the Group's key remaining assets:A. Peru Hotel Real Estate Converted to Apartment Units: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group has converted its 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru  into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel into 66 individually titled apartment units; ii) Procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals; iii) Restructured approximately $4.5 million of senior debt based on the change of use  enabling the Group to sell units and accelerate debt payment with each sale; and iv) Executed preliminary sales agreements for approximately 40 apartment units with estimated sales value of approximately $6 million. Final bank approvals were received in April 2022  and the Group is now actively signing final sales agreements for contracted units and pursuing the sales of remaining units with a projection to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  with possible completion of this transaction during 2022.B. Peru Office Real Estate Performance Improving: The Group also has approximately 6 703 m2 of rentable-sellable office space  and 158 underground parking spaces. Office occupancies have improved materially in Q1 2022  rising from less than 60% occupancy in the depths of the covid crisis to approximately 80% as of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report. While leases are not generating the same revenue per square meter than achieved pre-covid  the Group's typical 2- to 5-year lease renewal schedule should help to recover lost revenue per meter as leases come up for renewal.C. Nicaragua Gaming and Real Estate Assets: As of the publication date of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group continued to own a 56% interest in a Nicaraguan holding company that owns the following assets: i) Gaming: Three full casinos and three slot parlors with a combined approximately 630 gaming positions; and ii) Real Estate: Approximately 4 562 m2 of land divided among 5 parcels as more fully detailed on page 14. While not precisely segmented herein  Nicaragua EBITDA has experienced material recovery from the 2nd half of 2021 through Q1 2022.D. Costa Rica Real Estate Asset: As of the publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group continues to own a 50% interest in a Costa Rican entity that owns the 11.6-hectare real estate property known as ""Tres Rios."" Tres Rios  with its own  dedicated off ramp  is located close to the country's 2nd largest mall on the highway between the capital city of San Jose and the commuter city of Cartago.The Group will continue to pursue decisions that will support the best interest of shareholders according to the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions.Salomon GuggenheimChief Executive Officer and PresidentApril 30  20221. ""EBITDA"" is not an accounting term under IFRS  and refers to earnings before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  equity in earnings of affiliates  minority interests  development costs  other gains and losses  and discontinued operations. ""Property EBITDA"" is equal to EBITDA at the country level(s). ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is equal to property EBITDA less ""Corporate expenses "" which are the expenses of operating the parent company and its non-operating subsidiaries and affiliates.GROUP OVERVIEWThe Group's consolidated profit / (loss) summary for the twelve months ended December 31  2021  as compared with the same period of 2020 is contained in the Group's Annual Report for year ending December 31  2021  located at www.thunderbirdresorts.com. In summary  Group revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.1 million or 18.5% and $1.6 million or 68.8%  respectively. Consolidated Profit for the period is $289 thousand  an improvement of $2.2 million or 114.8% as compared with 2020 results.RISK MANAGEMENTFor more detail on Risk Factors  see Chapter 8 of the Annual Report.MANAGEMENT STATEMENT ON ""GOING CONCERN""Management has reviewed their plan with the Directors and has collectively formed a judgment about the going concern of the Group. In arriving at this judgment  Management has prepared the cash flow projections of the Group. The Group has suffered recurring losses over the past years. In response to the recurring losses of the previous years  Management has taken actions which will be described in the following paragraphs.Directors have reviewed this information provided by Management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate  the Group's existing commitments and the financial resources available to the Group. Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group's businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (viii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows:Special Resolution: On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.Corporate Expense and Cash Flow: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  and continues to decrease  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.Liquidity and Working Capital: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group forecasts operating with lower levels of reserves and working capital until such time as liquidity events might occur. Selling assets will be critical to creating a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period.While the below events or lack thereof may create uncertainty and cast doubt on going concern  the Group believes that it is in a stronger position to sustain going concern as of the publication date of this 2021 Annual Report as compared to recent years during the covid crisis.Peru Real Estate Sales: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group has converted its 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel into 66 individually titled apartment units; ii) Procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals; iii) Restructured approximately $4.5 million of senior debt based on the change of use  enabling the Group to sell units and accelerate debt payment with each sale; and iv) Executed preliminary sales agreements for approximately 40 apartment units with estimated sales value of over $6 million. Final bank approvals were received in April 2022  and the Group is now actively signing final sales agreements for contracted units and pursuing the sales of remaining units with a projection to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  with possible completion of this transaction during 2022. If for whatever reason the Group is not able to complete the sales of sufficient units to pay down its senior secured lender and related government supported debt in Peru (combined of approximately $5M) and to partially pay down its remaining unsecured debt  this could harm the Group's ability to remain as a going concern in 2024.Other liquidity events: If the Group is not able to create other liquidity events from its remaining Peru  Costa Rica and Nicaragua assets in 2023-2024  it is reasonable to expect that unsecured lenders may pursue years of litigation against the Group at that time  though as to whether or not this would have an impact on Going Concern at that time is hard to assess.Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to mitigate the uncertainty and that the Group is able to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors have therefore prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC.
