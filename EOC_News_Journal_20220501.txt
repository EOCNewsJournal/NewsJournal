Copies are also available on SEDAR at www.SEDAR.com.Below are certain material excerpts from the full 2021 Annual Report  the entirety of which can be found on our website at www.thunderbirdresorts.com.LETTER FROM CEODear Shareholders and Investors:The below summarizes the Group's performance through December 31  2021.1. CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE IN 2021In summary  Group revenue and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased by $2.1 million or 18.5% and $1.6 million or 68.8%  respectively. Consolidated Profit for the period is $289 thousand  an improvement of $2.2 million or 114.8% as compared with 2020 results.A. EBITDA1: Peru property EBITDA fell by $78 thousand while Nicaragua property EBITDA increased by $1.56 million  both through December 31  2021  as compared to the same period in 2020. Corporate Expense was reduced by $70 thousand in 2021 as compared to 2020. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $1.6 million or by 68.8% through December 31  2021  as compared to through December 31  2020.B. Profit / (Loss): The Group's Loss improved by approximately $2.2 million to a profit of $289 thousand for the period as compared to 2020. This improvement was the result of increased revenue of $2.1 million partially offset by increased expenses of $505 thousand in 2021 as compared to 2020.C. Net Debt: Net debt as of December 31  2021  increased to $16.1 million as compared to $15.8 million as of December 31  2020. Due to a change in accounting policy as required by IFRS 16  the Group is required to account for the net present value of real estate operating lease contracts as Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts. Approximately $4.7 million of our net debt is comprised of Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts.2. MANAGEMENT TO MITIGATE THE RISKS OF COVID-19In terms of demand  Covid-19 hit the Group's markets harder than in much of the world. Hotels  in general  remained largely empty  office leases were commonly terminated or materially renegotiated and gaming facilities  like with restaurants in other parts  were often seen as greater contagion risks as compared to other businesses. Moreover  unlike in the developed markets  there were few fiscal tools and policies available to support businesses and to stimulate demand in the Group's markets.Having said that  in 2021 and through date of 2022  Management stabilized its operations and cash management as compared to 2020  and feel reasonably confident that the Group is able to carry on with the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions. To be prudent  however  the Group has updated its Management Statement on Going Concern as compared to the last update in its 2021 Half-year Report. See more about Group's progress directly below.3. MATERIAL PROGRESS TOWARD SHAREHOLDER MANDATEThe Group continues to pursue decisions that will support the best interest of shareholders according to the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions  the status of which is summarized below in relation to the Group's key remaining assets:A. Peru Hotel Real Estate Converted to Apartment Units: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group has converted its 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru  into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel into 66 individually titled apartment units; ii) Procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals; iii) Restructured approximately $4.5 million of senior debt based on the change of use  enabling the Group to sell units and accelerate debt payment with each sale; and iv) Executed preliminary sales agreements for approximately 40 apartment units with estimated sales value of approximately $6 million. Final bank approvals were received in April 2022  and the Group is now actively signing final sales agreements for contracted units and pursuing the sales of remaining units with a projection to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  with possible completion of this transaction during 2022.B. Peru Office Real Estate Performance Improving: The Group also has approximately 6 703 m2 of rentable-sellable office space  and 158 underground parking spaces. Office occupancies have improved materially in Q1 2022  rising from less than 60% occupancy in the depths of the covid crisis to approximately 80% as of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report. While leases are not generating the same revenue per square meter than achieved pre-covid  the Group's typical 2- to 5-year lease renewal schedule should help to recover lost revenue per meter as leases come up for renewal.C. Nicaragua Gaming and Real Estate Assets: As of the publication date of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group continued to own a 56% interest in a Nicaraguan holding company that owns the following assets: i) Gaming: Three full casinos and three slot parlors with a combined approximately 630 gaming positions; and ii) Real Estate: Approximately 4 562 m2 of land divided among 5 parcels as more fully detailed on page 14.

""EBITDA"" is not an accounting term under IFRS  and refers to earnings before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  equity in earnings of affiliates  minority interests  development costs  other gains and losses  and discontinued operations.

""Adjusted EBITDA"" is equal to property EBITDA less ""Corporate expenses "" which are the expenses of operating the parent company and its non-operating subsidiaries and affiliates.GROUP OVERVIEWThe Group's consolidated profit / (loss) summary for the twelve months ended December 31  2021  as compared with the same period of 2020 is contained in the Group's Annual Report for year ending December 31  2021  located at www.thunderbirdresorts.com. In summary  Group revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.1 million or 18.5% and $1.6 million or 68.8%  respectively. Consolidated Profit for the period is $289 thousand  an improvement of $2.2 million or 114.8% as compared with 2020 results.RISK MANAGEMENTFor more detail on Risk Factors  see Chapter 8 of the Annual Report.MANAGEMENT STATEMENT ON ""GOING CONCERN""Management has reviewed their plan with the Directors and has collectively formed a judgment about the going concern of the Group. In arriving at this judgment  Management has prepared the cash flow projections of the Group. The Group has suffered recurring losses over the past years. In response to the recurring losses of the previous years  Management has taken actions which will be described in the following paragraphs.Directors have reviewed this information provided by Management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate  the Group's existing commitments and the financial resources available to the Group. Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group's businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (viii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows:Special Resolution: On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.Corporate Expense and Cash Flow: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  and continues to decrease  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.Liquidity and Working Capital: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group forecasts operating with lower levels of reserves and working capital until such time as liquidity events might occur. Selling assets will be critical to creating a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period.While the below events or lack thereof may create uncertainty and cast doubt on going concern  the Group believes that it is in a stronger position to sustain going concern as of the publication date of this 2021 Annual Report as compared to recent years during the covid crisis.Peru Real Estate Sales: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group has converted its 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel into 66 individually titled apartment units; ii) Procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals; iii) Restructured approximately $4.5 million of senior debt based on the change of use  enabling the Group to sell units and accelerate debt payment with each sale; and iv) Executed preliminary sales agreements for approximately 40 apartment units with estimated sales value of over $6 million. Final bank approvals were received in April 2022  and the Group is now actively signing final sales agreements for contracted units and pursuing the sales of remaining units with a projection to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  with possible completion of this transaction during 2022. If for whatever reason the Group is not able to complete the sales of sufficient units to pay down its senior secured lender and related government supported debt in Peru (combined of approximately $5M) and to partially pay down its remaining unsecured debt  this could harm the Group's ability to remain as a going concern in 2024.Other liquidity events: If the Group is not able to create other liquidity events from its remaining Peru  Costa Rica and Nicaragua assets in 2023-2024  it is reasonable to expect that unsecured lenders may pursue years of litigation against the Group at that time  though as to whether or not this would have an impact on Going Concern at that time is hard to assess.Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to mitigate the uncertainty and that the Group is able to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors have therefore prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC.

CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE IN 2021In summary  Group revenue and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased by $2.1 million or 18.5% and $1.6 million or 68.8%  respectively. Consolidated Profit for the period is $289 thousand  an improvement of $2.2 million or 114.8% as compared with 2020 results.A. EBITDA1: Peru property EBITDA fell by $78 thousand while Nicaragua property EBITDA increased by $1.56 million  both through December 31  2021  as compared to the same period in 2020. Corporate Expense was reduced by $70 thousand in 2021 as compared to 2020. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $1.6 million or by 68.8% through December 31  2021  as compared to through December 31  2020.Story continuesB. Profit / (Loss): The Group's Loss improved by approximately $2.2 million to a profit of $289 thousand for the period as compared to 2020. This improvement was the result of increased revenue of $2.1 million partially offset by increased expenses of $505 thousand in 2021 as compared to 2020.C. Net Debt: Net debt as of December 31  2021  increased to $16.1 million as compared to $15.8 million as of December 31  2020. Due to a change in accounting policy as required by IFRS 16  the Group is required to account for the net present value of real estate operating lease contracts as Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts. Approximately $4.7 million of our net debt is comprised of Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts.2. MANAGEMENT TO MITIGATE THE RISKS OF COVID-19In terms of demand  Covid-19 hit the Group's markets harder than in much of the world. Hotels  in general  remained largely empty  office leases were commonly terminated or materially renegotiated and gaming facilities  like with restaurants in other parts  were often seen as greater contagion risks as compared to other businesses. Moreover  unlike in the developed markets  there were few fiscal tools and policies available to support businesses and to stimulate demand in the Group's markets.Having said that  in 2021 and through date of 2022  Management stabilized its operations and cash management as compared to 2020  and feel reasonably confident that the Group is able to carry on with the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions. To be prudent  however  the Group has updated its Management Statement on Going Concern as compared to the last update in its 2021 Half-year Report. See more about Group's progress directly below.3. MATERIAL PROGRESS TOWARD SHAREHOLDER MANDATEThe Group continues to pursue decisions that will support the best interest of shareholders according to the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions  the status of which is summarized below in relation to the Group's key remaining assets:A. Peru Hotel Real Estate Converted to Apartment Units: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group has converted its 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru  into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel into 66 individually titled apartment units; ii) Procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals; iii) Restructured approximately $4.5 million of senior debt based on the change of use  enabling the Group to sell units and accelerate debt payment with each sale; and iv) Executed preliminary sales agreements for approximately 40 apartment units with estimated sales value of approximately $6 million. Final bank approvals were received in April 2022  and the Group is now actively signing final sales agreements for contracted units and pursuing the sales of remaining units with a projection to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  with possible completion of this transaction during 2022.B. Peru Office Real Estate Performance Improving: The Group also has approximately 6 703 m2 of rentable-sellable office space  and 158 underground parking spaces. Office occupancies have improved materially in Q1 2022  rising from less than 60% occupancy in the depths of the covid crisis to approximately 80% as of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report. While leases are not generating the same revenue per square meter than achieved pre-covid  the Group's typical 2- to 5-year lease renewal schedule should help to recover lost revenue per meter as leases come up for renewal.C. Nicaragua Gaming and Real Estate Assets: As of the publication date of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group continued to own a 56% interest in a Nicaraguan holding company that owns the following assets: i) Gaming: Three full casinos and three slot parlors with a combined approximately 630 gaming positions; and ii) Real Estate: Approximately 4 562 m2 of land divided among 5 parcels as more fully detailed on page 14. While not precisely segmented herein  Nicaragua EBITDA has experienced material recovery from the 2nd half of 2021 through Q1 2022.D. Costa Rica Real Estate Asset: As of the publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group continues to own a 50% interest in a Costa Rican entity that owns the 11.6-hectare real estate property known as ""Tres Rios."" Tres Rios  with its own  dedicated off ramp  is located close to the country's 2nd largest mall on the highway between the capital city of San Jose and the commuter city of Cartago.The Group will continue to pursue decisions that will support the best interest of shareholders according to the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions.Salomon GuggenheimChief Executive Officer and PresidentApril 30  20221. ""EBITDA"" is not an accounting term under IFRS  and refers to earnings before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  equity in earnings of affiliates  minority interests  development costs  other gains and losses  and discontinued operations. ""Property EBITDA"" is equal to EBITDA at the country level(s). ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is equal to property EBITDA less ""Corporate expenses "" which are the expenses of operating the parent company and its non-operating subsidiaries and affiliates.GROUP OVERVIEWThe Group's consolidated profit / (loss) summary for the twelve months ended December 31  2021  as compared with the same period of 2020 is contained in the Group's Annual Report for year ending December 31  2021  located at www.thunderbirdresorts.com. In summary  Group revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.1 million or 18.5% and $1.6 million or 68.8%  respectively. Consolidated Profit for the period is $289 thousand  an improvement of $2.2 million or 114.8% as compared with 2020 results.RISK MANAGEMENTFor more detail on Risk Factors  see Chapter 8 of the Annual Report.MANAGEMENT STATEMENT ON ""GOING CONCERN""Management has reviewed their plan with the Directors and has collectively formed a judgment about the going concern of the Group. In arriving at this judgment  Management has prepared the cash flow projections of the Group. The Group has suffered recurring losses over the past years. In response to the recurring losses of the previous years  Management has taken actions which will be described in the following paragraphs.Directors have reviewed this information provided by Management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate  the Group's existing commitments and the financial resources available to the Group. Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group's businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (viii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows:Special Resolution: On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.Corporate Expense and Cash Flow: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  and continues to decrease  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.Liquidity and Working Capital: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group forecasts operating with lower levels of reserves and working capital until such time as liquidity events might occur. Selling assets will be critical to creating a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period.While the below events or lack thereof may create uncertainty and cast doubt on going concern  the Group believes that it is in a stronger position to sustain going concern as of the publication date of this 2021 Annual Report as compared to recent years during the covid crisis.Peru Real Estate Sales: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group has converted its 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel into 66 individually titled apartment units; ii) Procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals; iii) Restructured approximately $4.5 million of senior debt based on the change of use  enabling the Group to sell units and accelerate debt payment with each sale; and iv) Executed preliminary sales agreements for approximately 40 apartment units with estimated sales value of over $6 million. Final bank approvals were received in April 2022  and the Group is now actively signing final sales agreements for contracted units and pursuing the sales of remaining units with a projection to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  with possible completion of this transaction during 2022. If for whatever reason the Group is not able to complete the sales of sufficient units to pay down its senior secured lender and related government supported debt in Peru (combined of approximately $5M) and to partially pay down its remaining unsecured debt  this could harm the Group's ability to remain as a going concern in 2024.Other liquidity events: If the Group is not able to create other liquidity events from its remaining Peru  Costa Rica and Nicaragua assets in 2023-2024  it is reasonable to expect that unsecured lenders may pursue years of litigation against the Group at that time  though as to whether or not this would have an impact on Going Concern at that time is hard to assess.Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to mitigate the uncertainty and that the Group is able to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors have therefore prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC.

In response to the recurring losses of the previous years  Management has taken actions which will be described in the following paragraphs.Directors have reviewed this information provided by Management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate  the Group‚Äôs existing commitments and the financial resources available to the Group. Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group‚Äôs businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (viii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows:Special Resolution: On September 21  2016  the Group‚Äôs shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ‚Äúany or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors.‚Äù This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.Corporate Expense and Cash Flow: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  and continues to decrease  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.Liquidity and Working Capital: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group forecasts operating with lower levels of reserves and working capital until such time as liquidity events might occur. Selling assets will be critical to creating a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period.While the below events or lack thereof may create uncertainty and cast doubt on going concern  the Group believes that it is in a stronger position to sustain going concern as of the publication date of this 2021 Annual Report as compared to recent years during the covid crisis.Peru Real Estate Sales: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group has converted its 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel into 66 individually titled apartment units; ii) Procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals; iii) Restructured approximately $4.5 million of senior debt based on the change of use  enabling the Group to sell units and accelerate debt payment with each sale; and iv) Executed preliminary sales agreements for approximately 40 apartment units with estimated sales value of over $6 million. Final bank approvals were received in April 2022  and the Group is now actively signing final sales agreements for contracted units and pursuing the sales of remaining units with a projection to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  with possible completion of this transaction during 2022. If for whatever reason the Group is not able to complete the sales of sufficient units to pay down its senior secured lender and related government supported debt in Peru (combined of approximately $5M) and to partially pay down its remaining unsecured debt  this could harm the Group‚Äôs ability to remain as a going concern in 2024.Other liquidity events: If the Group is not able to create other liquidity events from its remaining Peru  Costa Rica and Nicaragua assets in 2023-2024  it is reasonable to expect that unsecured lenders may pursue years of litigation against the Group at that time  though as to whether or not this would have an impact on Going Concern at that time is hard to assess.Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to mitigate the uncertainty and that the Group is able to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors have therefore prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC.

The launch of PACIFIC-9 represents an important financial milestone for Innate  as it triggers a $50 million milestone payment that reinforces our cash position ‚Äù said Mondher Mahjoubi  Chief Executive Officer of Innate Pharma. ‚ÄúBased on the recent COAST clinical trial results  we are excited about the potential of extending the clinical benefit of durvalumab with the addition of monalizumab in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC.‚ÄùDetailed results from the randomized COAST Phase 2 trial were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncologyon April 22  2022. AstraZeneca initially presented the results during the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2021 in September 2021 (see AstraZeneca press release). The results of the interim analysis showed monalizumab in combination with durvalumab increased objective response rate (ORR) and prolonged progression-free survival (PFS) versus durvalumab alone in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC who had not progressed after CRT. The Journal of Clinical Oncology publication now includes exploratory subgroup analysis.‚ÄúDurvalumab has transformed the treatment of patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC  and we‚Äôre excited by the promise of extending its benefit through novel combinations with two potential first-in-class monoclonal antibodies demonstrating strong clinical activity. Based on the stand-out results from COAST  we are pleased that the Phase 3 trial is underway  which we hope will bring new treatment options to patients and further increase the potential for long-term survival benefit in this setting ‚Äù said Susan Galbraith  Executive Vice President  Oncology R&D  AstraZeneca.About PACIFIC-9:PACIFIC-9 is a Phase 3  randomised  double-blind  multicenter global study to determine the efficacy and safety of durvalumab alone or in combination with oleclumab or monalizumab+ in patients with unresectable  Stage III NSCLC who have not progressed on definitive  platinum-based CRT.‚ÄãThe first patient has been dosed in April 2022. The PACIFIC-9 Phase 3 trial is now looking to recruit patients across more than 200 centers in the coming months. ‚ÄãStage III NSCLC:In 2020  an estimated 2.2 million people were diagnosed with lung cancer worldwide1. Lung cancer is broadly split into NSCLC and small cell lung cancer  with 80-85% classified as NSCLC.2 3 4 Stage III NSCLC represents approximately one quarter of NSCLC incidence5.Stage III (locally advanced) NSCLC is commonly divided into three subcategories (IIIA  IIIB and IIIC)  defined by how much the cancer has spread locally. In contrast to Stage IV  when cancer has spread (metastasised)  the majority of Stage III patients are currently treated with curative intent2 6.The majority of Stage III NSCLC patients are diagnosed with unresectable tumours2 5.About Monalizumab:Monalizumab is a potentially first-in-class immune checkpoint inhibitor targeting NKG2A receptors expressed on tumor infiltrating cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and NK cells.NKG2A is an inhibitory checkpoint receptor for HLA-E. By expressing HLA-E  cancer cells can protect themselves from killing by NKG2A+ immune cells. HLA-E is frequently overexpressed in the cancer cells of many solid tumors and hematological malignancies. Monalizumab may reestablish a broad anti-tumor response mediated by NK and T cells  and may enhance the cytotoxic potential of other therapeutic antibodies7.The ongoing development for monalizumab is focused on investigating monalizumab in various combination strategies in different malignancies  including the Phase 2 NeoCOAST trial in the neoadjuvant early-stage setting.About the Innate-AstraZeneca monalizumab agreement:In October 2018  AstraZeneca obtained full oncology rights to monalizumab by exercising its option under the co-development and commercialization agreement initiated in 2015.The financial terms of the agreement include potential cash payments up to $1.275 billion to Innate Pharma. Including the $50 million payment triggered by dosing the first patient in the Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 clinical trial  Innate Pharma has received $450 million to date.For any commercialized oncology indication  AstraZeneca will book all sales revenue and will pay Innate low double-digit to mid-teen percentage royalties on net sales worldwide except in Europe where Innate Pharma will receive 50% share of the profits and losses in the territory. Innate will co-fund 30% of the costs of the Phase 3 development program of monalizumab with a pre-agreed limitation of Innate‚Äôs financial commitment.About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma‚Äôs broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of natural killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens  as well as antibody engineering. This innovative approach has resulted in a diversified proprietary portfolio and major alliances with leaders in the biopharmaceutical industry including Bristol-Myers Squibb  Novo Nordisk A/S  Sanofi  and a multi-products collaboration with AstraZeneca.Headquartered in Marseille  France with a US office in Rockville  MD  Innate Pharma is listed on Euronext Paris and Nasdaq in the US.Learn more about Innate Pharma at www.innate-pharma.com.1 World Health Organization.

4021,EuroNext,Google API,https://www.ipe.com/esg/investors-sceptical-on-tokyo-equity-market-reforms/10059535.article,Investors sceptical on Tokyo equity market reforms,8 hours ago,In April  the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) implemented its biggest overhaul in over 60 years in an attempt to attract foreign investors. However  many industry experts see the move as largely symbolic and believe more needs to be done to create a roster of high-quality companies with strong corporate governance practices.Before the shake-up  the Japanese bourse had four sections  many of which overlapped  largely due to the merger between the Tokyo and Osaka (OSE) stock exchanges in 2013. This created a group with four different divisions and boards ‚Äì 1st and 2nd Sections  Mothers and JASDAQ.As Daiji Ozawa  CIO for Japan equity value portfolios at Invesco  points out: ‚ÄúThe 1st Section consisted of a vast number of companies ‚Äì 2 000-plus ‚Äì including illiquid micro-cap stocks for the historical reason that the TSE used the 1st Section to attract IPOs [initial public offerings] on its start-up market Mothers when the TSE competed with the OSE.‚ÄùHe adds: ‚ÄúEventually  the Japan Exchange Group was formed  absorbing the TSE and the OSE. However  the legacy markets for start-ups ‚Äì the Mothers and the JASDAQ ‚Äì remained  and the number of TSE 1st Section listing companies swelled.‚ÄùMasahiro Ichikawa  chief market strategist  Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management also notes that some market participants feel that the TSE Stock Price index (TOPIX) lacked functionality as a benchmark because it was composed entirely of stocks on the First Section  which had a relatively loose set of criteria for stock inclusion. ‚ÄúThis meant it eventually included stocks which could be less attractive from a liquidity perspective  as well as other factors such as market capitalisation and corporate governance ‚Äù he adds.As of February  TSE‚Äôs market capitalisation of domestic shares was $6.17trn (‚Ç¨5.7trn). This is only a quarter of the market cap of the New York Stock Exchange  the world‚Äôs largest  and the TSE trails NASDAQ  the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Euronext.‚ÄúIt is essential to establish new futures contracts for the three indices if they are to be actively used by foreign investors in particular‚Äù Masahiro IchikawaThis is reflected in the share prices of some of the country‚Äôs biggest household names. For example  Toyota Motor Corporation  the world‚Äôs largest automaker by volume  had its market cap briefly top ¬•40trn (around $330bn) for the first time in January  ahead of other global names in Japan like Sony and SoftBank. However  it was still far behind Apple that became the world‚Äôs first company to hit $3trn in January or US electric carmaker Tesla valued at over $1 trn.The restructuring aims to boost investor appeal by streamlining the divisions and bolstering corporate governance. There are now three sections: the Prime Market showcasing selected companies demonstrating good governance and disclosure practices; the Growth Market incubating high-growth companies even in the matured economy; and the Standard Market for the rest  according to Ozawa.Although it is early days  few believe the reforms will enhance the exchange‚Äôs allure. Japan feels that foreign investors do not respect its market enough  according to Travis Lundy  a Hong Kong-based analyst with Quiddity Advisors. ‚ÄúThe goal was to make Japan governance more prominent  to show the top tier of TSE-listed companies as being blue chip. All this would attract more foreign portfolio investment  but change will basically do little or nothing to attract increased foreign investors.‚ÄùOne of the biggest drawbacks is that the Prime Section is still too top-heavy. ‚ÄúThe fact that over 80% of the TSE 1st section companies  or more than 1 800 companies  have listed on Prime is disappointing ‚Äù says Shoichi Mizusawa  head of Japan Equities at JP Morgan Asset Management. ‚ÄúIn other words  the difference between TSE 1st section and Prime is marginal. This is because the bar for Prime listing has been set too low.‚ÄùTechnically  companies only qualify if they have a market cap of at least ¬•10bn ($79m). However  there are about 300 that do not meet the grade and have been allowed to join by submitting an open-ended plan to meet the standards at some unspecified point in the future. The Japan Exchange Group is reportedly to decide on how to handle these stocks within the year.Another sticking point is that the three new indices based on the three market segments are not being calculated in real time  with closing prices only published once a day after 15.30  according to Ichikawa. ‚ÄúIn other words  they do not have the opening  high  low and close prices that are calculated for regular indices  nor are they calculated retrospectively  so there is no long-term data ‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúOn top of this  it is essential to establish new futures contracts for the three indices if they are to be actively used by foreign investors in particular.‚Äù‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not in favour of companies owning shares of other companies  a practice known as cross shareholding. It is unfortunate that the pace of unwinding cross shareholding has been incredibly slow‚Äù Shoichi MizusawaMarket participants have also been disappointed by the lacklustre corporate governance reforms. One reason for this disappointment  as Lundy points  out is that qualified independent directors or management well versed in financial markets are thin on the ground. However  change will also require a significant cultural shift.‚ÄúOne of the Prime requirements is that the board is at least one third independent ‚Äù says Mizusawa. ‚ÄúThis is too low  in our opinion  and we would like boards to be majority independent and diverse. We‚Äôre also not in favour of companies owning shares of other companies  a practice known as cross shareholding. It is unfortunate that the pace of unwinding cross shareholding has been incredibly slow  and the TSE reform alone is unlikely to accelerate the process. The majority of 1 800-plus companies listed on Prime are small by global standards and are not liquid.‚ÄùTravis adds: ‚ÄúJapanese companies have to show they are acting in the interests of shareholders in terms of capital allocation and capital activity.‚Äù He recommends that cross holdings should be eliminated for holdings of less than 5% and that the METI Fair M&A Guidelines  which were introduced in June 2019  could be followed more strictly. They were developed by the Ministry for Economy  Trade and Industry to address conflicts of interest and recognise minority shareholders‚Äô interests but are not binding and considered too soft.Hideyuki Ishiguro  senior strategist at Nomura Asset Management also believes more work needs to be done in developing a practical index akin to the S&P 500 and creating a framework that aims to incorporate it into the index. ‚ÄúThis will lead to improved return on equity [ROE] and PBR [price to book ratio] for Japanese stocks ‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThere are many major companies in Japan that are globally competitive and whose business continues to expand. I believe that the globalisation of Japanese stocks will advance if such highly competitive companies are included in the index and a mechanism to promote metabolism is developed.‚ÄùOzawa is also in favour of constructing a new benchmark index to offset the current shortfall and overcome the challenges. He notes that institutional investors want an index of selected companies with sufficient liquidity  good governance and sound earnings prospects allowing them to track leading Japanese companies‚Äô business performance regardless of the TSE market segments  like the S&P 500 or FTSE 100.‚ÄúThe index can include companies listed on the Growth Market as well if they satisfy certain market-cap  liquidity  governance and disclosure criteria  in our opinion ‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúThe Growth Market can be like Nasdaq  which is not a stepping stone to the Prime Market but a showcase of leading growth names in Japan.‚Äù,negative,0.07,0.47,0.47,negative,0.02,0.14,0.84,True,English,"['Tokyo equity market reforms', 'Investors', 'Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management', 'JP Morgan Asset Management', 'IPOs [initial public offerings', 'US electric carmaker Tesla', 'Japan equity value portfolios', 'TSE 1st Section listing companies', 'TSE Stock Price index', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'The Japan Exchange Group', 'strong corporate governance practices', 'TSE 1st section companies', 'new futures contracts', 'Shanghai Stock Exchange', 'many industry experts', 'Toyota Motor Corporation', 'Hong Kong-based analyst', 'opening, high, low', 'biggest household names', 'Tokyo Stock Exchange', 'other global names', 'foreign portfolio investment', 'chief market strategist', 'unwinding cross shareholding', 'three new indices', 'three market segments', 'four different divisions', 'illiquid micro-cap stocks', 'start-up market Mothers', 'stock inclusion', 'Prime listing', 'disclosure practices', 'First Section', 'Japan governance', 'three indices', 'four sections', 'Prime Section', 'Japan Equities', 'three sections', 'good governance', 'biggest overhaul', 'biggest drawbacks', 'TSE trails', 'other companies', 'regular indices', 'other factors', 'other words', 'foreign investors', 'market participants', 'market capitalisation', 'Growth Market', 'Standard Market', 'high-quality companies', 'selected companies', 'high-growth companies', 'TSE-listed companies', 'Japanese bourse', '2nd Sections', 'historical reason', 'legacy markets', 'loose set', 'liquidity perspective', 'share prices', 'largest automaker', 'first time', 'first company', 'investor appeal', 'early days', 'Travis Lundy', 'Quiddity Advisors', 'blue chip', 'Shoichi Mizusawa', 'open-ended plan', 'unspecified point', 'sticking point', 'real time', 'closing prices', 'close prices', 'long-term data', 'Prime Market', 'Masahiro Ichikawa', 'Daiji Ozawa', 'vast number', 'domestic shares', 'top tier', '1,800 companies', 'April', '60 years', 'attempt', 'move', 'needs', 'roster', 'shake-up', 'merger', 'Osaka', 'boards', 'JASDAQ', 'CIO', 'Invesco', 'OSE.', 'start-ups', 'TOPIX', 'functionality', 'benchmark', 'criteria', 'February', 'quarter', 'world', 'NASDAQ', 'Euronext', 'country', 'example', 'volume', 'January', 'Sony', 'SoftBank', 'Apple', 'restructuring', 'economy', 'reforms', 'allure', 'goal', 'head', 'difference', 'bar', 'grade', 'standards', 'favour', 'pace']",2022-05-01,2022-05-01,ipe.com

(""Thunderbird"") 4TR is pleased to announce that its 2021 Annual Report and Audited Consolidated Financial Statements have been filed with the Euronext (""Euronext Amsterdam"") and the Netherlands Authority for Financial Markets (""AFM"").

Copies in the English language are available at no cost at the Group's operational office in Panama and at the offices of our local paying agent ING Commercial Banking  Paying Agency Services  Location Code TRC 01.013  Foppingadreef 7  1102 BD Amsterdam  the Netherlands (tel: +31 20 563 6619  fax: +31 20 563 6959  email: iss.pas@ing.nl). Copies are also available on SEDAR at www.SEDAR.com.Below are certain material excerpts from the full 2021 Annual Report  the entirety of which can be found on our website at www.thunderbirdresorts.com.LETTER FROM CEODear Shareholders and Investors:The below summarizes the Group's performance through December 31  2021.1. CHANGES IN PERFORMANCE IN 2021In summary  Group revenue and adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations increased by $2.1 million or 18.5% and $1.6 million or 68.8%  respectively. Consolidated Profit for the period is $289 thousand  an improvement of $2.2 million or 114.8% as compared with 2020 results.A. EBITDA1: Peru property EBITDA fell by $78 thousand while Nicaragua property EBITDA increased by $1.56 million  both through December 31  2021  as compared to the same period in 2020. Corporate Expense was reduced by $70 thousand in 2021 as compared to 2020. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $1.6 million or by 68.8% through December 31  2021  as compared to through December 31  2020.B. Profit / (Loss): The Group's Loss improved by approximately $2.2 million to a profit of $289 thousand for the period as compared to 2020. This improvement was the result of increased revenue of $2.1 million partially offset by increased expenses of $505 thousand in 2021 as compared to 2020.C. Net Debt: Net debt as of December 31  2021  increased to $16.1 million as compared to $15.8 million as of December 31  2020. Due to a change in accounting policy as required by IFRS 16  the Group is required to account for the net present value of real estate operating lease contracts as Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts. Approximately $4.7 million of our net debt is comprised of Obligations under leases and hire purchase contracts.2. MANAGEMENT TO MITIGATE THE RISKS OF COVID-19In terms of demand  Covid-19 hit the Group's markets harder than in much of the world. Hotels  in general  remained largely empty  office leases were commonly terminated or materially renegotiated and gaming facilities  like with restaurants in other parts  were often seen as greater contagion risks as compared to other businesses. Moreover  unlike in the developed markets  there were few fiscal tools and policies available to support businesses and to stimulate demand in the Group's markets.Having said that  in 2021 and through date of 2022  Management stabilized its operations and cash management as compared to 2020  and feel reasonably confident that the Group is able to carry on with the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions. To be prudent  however  the Group has updated its Management Statement on Going Concern as compared to the last update in its 2021 Half-year Report. See more about Group's progress directly below.3. MATERIAL PROGRESS TOWARD SHAREHOLDER MANDATEThe Group continues to pursue decisions that will support the best interest of shareholders according to the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions  the status of which is summarized below in relation to the Group's key remaining assets:A. Peru Hotel Real Estate Converted to Apartment Units: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group has converted its 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru  into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel into 66 individually titled apartment units; ii) Procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals; iii) Restructured approximately $4.5 million of senior debt based on the change of use  enabling the Group to sell units and accelerate debt payment with each sale; and iv) Executed preliminary sales agreements for approximately 40 apartment units with estimated sales value of approximately $6 million. Final bank approvals were received in April 2022  and the Group is now actively signing final sales agreements for contracted units and pursuing the sales of remaining units with a projection to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  with possible completion of this transaction during 2022.B. Peru Office Real Estate Performance Improving: The Group also has approximately 6 703 m2 of rentable-sellable office space  and 158 underground parking spaces. Office occupancies have improved materially in Q1 2022  rising from less than 60% occupancy in the depths of the covid crisis to approximately 80% as of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report. While leases are not generating the same revenue per square meter than achieved pre-covid  the Group's typical 2- to 5-year lease renewal schedule should help to recover lost revenue per meter as leases come up for renewal.C. Nicaragua Gaming and Real Estate Assets: As of the publication date of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group continued to own a 56% interest in a Nicaraguan holding company that owns the following assets: i) Gaming: Three full casinos and three slot parlors with a combined approximately 630 gaming positions; and ii) Real Estate: Approximately 4 562 m2 of land divided among 5 parcels as more fully detailed on page 14. While not precisely segmented herein  Nicaragua EBITDA has experienced material recovery from the 2nd half of 2021 through Q1 2022.D. Costa Rica Real Estate Asset: As of the publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group continues to own a 50% interest in a Costa Rican entity that owns the 11.6-hectare real estate property known as ""Tres Rios."" Tres Rios  with its own  dedicated off ramp  is located close to the country's 2nd largest mall on the highway between the capital city of San Jose and the commuter city of Cartago.The Group will continue to pursue decisions that will support the best interest of shareholders according to the shareholder mandate set forth in the September 21  2016  Special Resolutions.Salomon GuggenheimChief Executive Officer and PresidentApril 30  20221. ""EBITDA"" is not an accounting term under IFRS  and refers to earnings before net interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  equity in earnings of affiliates  minority interests  development costs  other gains and losses  and discontinued operations. ""Property EBITDA"" is equal to EBITDA at the country level(s). ""Adjusted EBITDA"" is equal to property EBITDA less ""Corporate expenses "" which are the expenses of operating the parent company and its non-operating subsidiaries and affiliates.GROUP OVERVIEWThe Group's consolidated profit / (loss) summary for the twelve months ended December 31  2021  as compared with the same period of 2020 is contained in the Group's Annual Report for year ending December 31  2021  located at www.thunderbirdresorts.com. In summary  Group revenue and adjusted EBITDA increased by $2.1 million or 18.5% and $1.6 million or 68.8%  respectively. Consolidated Profit for the period is $289 thousand  an improvement of $2.2 million or 114.8% as compared with 2020 results.RISK MANAGEMENTFor more detail on Risk Factors  see Chapter 8 of the Annual Report.MANAGEMENT STATEMENT ON ""GOING CONCERN""Management has reviewed their plan with the Directors and has collectively formed a judgment about the going concern of the Group. In arriving at this judgment  Management has prepared the cash flow projections of the Group. The Group has suffered recurring losses over the past years. In response to the recurring losses of the previous years  Management has taken actions which will be described in the following paragraphs.Directors have reviewed this information provided by Management and have considered the information in relation to the financing uncertainties in the current economic climate  the Group's existing commitments and the financial resources available to the Group. Specifically  Directors have considered: (i) there are probably no sources of new financing available to the Group; (ii) the Group has limited trading exposures to our local suppliers and retail customers; (iii) other risks to which the Group is exposed  the most significant of which is considered to be regulatory risk; (iv) sources of Group income  including management fees charged to and income distributed from its various operations; (v) cash generation and debt amortization levels; (vi) fundamental trends of the Group's businesses; (vii) ability to re-amortize and unsecured lenders; and (viii) level of interest of third parties in the acquisition of certain operating assets  and status of genuine progress and probability of closing within the Going Concern period. The Directors have also considered certain critical factors that might affect continuing operations  as follows:Special Resolution: On September 21  2016  the Group's shareholders approved a special resolution that  among other items  authorized the Board of Directors of the Corporate to sell ""any or all remaining assets of the Corporation in such amounts and at such times as determined by the Board of Directors."" This resolution facilitates the sale of any one or any combination of assets required to support maintaining of a going concern by the Group.Corporate Expense and Cash Flow: Corporate expense has decreased materially in recent years  and continues to decrease  but still must accommodate for compliance as a public company.Liquidity and Working Capital: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group forecasts operating with lower levels of reserves and working capital until such time as liquidity events might occur. Selling assets will be critical to creating a healthy level of working capital reserves for periods beyond the Going Concern period.While the below events or lack thereof may create uncertainty and cast doubt on going concern  the Group believes that it is in a stronger position to sustain going concern as of the publication date of this 2021 Annual Report as compared to recent years during the covid crisis.Peru Real Estate Sales: As of the date of publication of this 2021 Annual Report  the Group has converted its 66-suite hotel in Lima  Peru into a 66-unit condominium apartment complex. The Group has: i) Legally sub-divided the former hotel into 66 individually titled apartment units; ii) Procured all change of use and other regulatory approvals; iii) Restructured approximately $4.5 million of senior debt based on the change of use  enabling the Group to sell units and accelerate debt payment with each sale; and iv) Executed preliminary sales agreements for approximately 40 apartment units with estimated sales value of over $6 million. Final bank approvals were received in April 2022  and the Group is now actively signing final sales agreements for contracted units and pursuing the sales of remaining units with a projection to generate in excess of $10 million from all unit sales  with possible completion of this transaction during 2022. If for whatever reason the Group is not able to complete the sales of sufficient units to pay down its senior secured lender and related government supported debt in Peru (combined of approximately $5M) and to partially pay down its remaining unsecured debt  this could harm the Group's ability to remain as a going concern in 2024.Other liquidity events: If the Group is not able to create other liquidity events from its remaining Peru  Costa Rica and Nicaragua assets in 2023-2024  it is reasonable to expect that unsecured lenders may pursue years of litigation against the Group at that time  though as to whether or not this would have an impact on Going Concern at that time is hard to assess.Considering the above  Management and Directors are satisfied that the consolidated Group has adequate resources to mitigate the uncertainty and that the Group is able to continue as a going concern for at least the 12 months following the filing date of this report. For these reasons  Management and Directors have therefore prepared the consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis.THUNDERBIRD RESORTS  INC.
