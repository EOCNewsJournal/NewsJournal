We will also highlight the design of our ongoing pivotal phase III study evaluating NBTXR3 as a single agent for frail  elderly patients with head and neck cancer.”The accepted abstracts include:Abstract #18041: PEP503 (NBTXR3)  a Radioenhancer  in Combination with Concurrent Chemoradiation (CCRT) in Locally Advanced or Recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC): Dose-Finding of a Phase 1b/2 TrialAbstract #3603: A Phase 1b/2 Study of Radioenhancer  PEP503 (NBTXR3)  in Combination with Concurrent Chemoradiation in Locally Advanced or Unresectable Rectal CancerAbstract #TPS6110: A Phase III Pivotal Study of NBTXR3 Activated by Investigator’s Choice of Radiotherapy Alone or Radiotherapy in Combination with Cetuximab for Platinum-based Chemotherapy-ineligible Elderly Patients with Locally Advanced Head & Neck Squamous Cell CarcinomaAbout NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product  composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physics-based mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering an adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly  with immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company sponsored phase I clinical study  evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC and for patients with lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy  either naïve or resistant to prior PD-1 (either primary or secondary as per SITC criteria).Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in strategic collaborations to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2021  the Company entered into an additional strategic collaboration agreement with LianBio to support its global phase III study in Asia along with four future registrational studies.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

In application of Article 15 of the Law of May 2  2007 on the disclosure of major shareholdings in issuers whose shares are admitted for trading on a regulated market  VGP publishes  by means of a press release and on its website  the total share capital  the total number of securities with voting rights and the total number of voting rights at the latest at the end of each month in which any of these numbers has changed.Situation as at 30 April 2022Total share capital: EUR 108 873 366.06 Total number of securities with voting right: 21 833 050 Total number of securities with double voting right: 11 658 636 Total number of voting rights (= denominator): 33 491 686This situation (the denominator) serves as a basis for the notification of major shareholdings by shareholders.In accordance with Article 7:53 of the Code on companies and associations and Article 29 of the Articles of Association  fully paid-up registered shares that have been registered in the share register in the name of the same shareholder for at least two consecutive years grant double voting rights. Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.Story continuesABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European developer  manager and owner of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

The aim is to jointly develop future terminal infrastructure projects that will facilitate the necessary imports of hydrogen into Northwest Europe via Dutch and German ports. Both parties have been working together in the Gate LNG-terminal in the Port of Rotterdam that came into operation in 2011.Alongside domestic production of hydrogen  large-scale import of green hydrogen will become essential for reaching the European Green Deal and the Fit for 55 targets. Import initiatives are developing rapidly: the first import streams to Germany and the Netherlands are expected by 2025. Global supply chains and logistics infrastructure need to be developed and operated to facilitate the import of green hydrogen required for the energy and feedstock transition.The cooperation agreement includes import projects for hydrogen through green ammonia  liquid organic hydrogen carriers  and liquid hydrogen technologies. To safely and reliably handle products like hydrogen and ammonia  high quality infrastructure and operations are needed. Vopak and Gasunie will focus on developing import infrastructure related to storage that enables further distribution of hydrogen to end users (e.g. by means of pipeline  vessels  road and rail) and contributes to the security of supply in Northwest Europe. Both parties have a long track record in developing infrastructure and safely storing and handling these types of products.As independent infrastructure companies Gasunie and Vopak will focus solely on the development as well as safe and reliable operation of open access infrastructure. Open access logistics infrastructure that is available to all market parties is most effective  both from a cost and environmental footprint perspective. It can further accelerate the import and use of green energy to a wide range of end markets. On 11 April 2022  Gasunie  Vopak and HES International announced that they joined forces to develop an import terminal for a hydrogen carrier in the port of Rotterdam  named ACE Terminal.Ulco Vermeulen  Director Business Development Gasunie: “With this agreement  Vopak and Gasunie continue their many years of successful co-operation. Hydrogen is an essential component of the sustainable energy mix of the future. Our joint goal is to enable the international hydrogen value chain by providing the necessary import infrastructure. As a renewable energy infrastructure company  we already function as a linking pin for the energy transition in various public private partnerships in the Netherlands. With this agreement  Vopak and Gasunie can play a role in the transport  storage and import as part of the international hydrogen value chain.”Frits Eulderink  Executive Board Member and COO of Royal Vopak comments: “We are delighted to extend our partnership with Gasunie beyond our successful Gate LNG terminal operations in the Port of Rotterdam and jointly develop vital infrastructure supporting the energy transition. We are looking forward to working together with Gasunie in the development of new infrastructure for the future vital products.""Profile GasunieGasunie is a European energy-infrastructure company.

The appointment comes amidst a global  post pandemic 'talent crunch'  requiring a greater focus on building more meaningful and long-lasting relationships with talent.Randstad and Monster LogoThe appointment spans both the Randstad brand itself  which will be led by Havas London  and subsidiary Monster  which will be led by Havas' Arnold Worldwide in Boston.Randstad  the global leader in HR services  offers a seamless talent experience powered by digital and enhanced by access to personal consultants around the globe. Monster  a global online employment solution for people seeking jobs and employers who need great people  is a wholly online experience. While both brands share the same strategic vision and overarching ambitions  their brand positioning and promise are very different. As such  Havas will develop distinct campaigns for each brand.For Randstad  Havas has been tasked with elevating Randstad's 'human forward' brand promise  geared toward talent  as well as raising both awareness and understanding of its services. For Monster  which invented the online job category 25 years ago  Arnold has been tasked with reclaiming the brand's early fame to introduce it to a younger job-seeking audience.Joanna Irwin  Global Chief Marketing Officer at Randstad says: ""Talent scarcity and mismatches in the labor market remain the biggest challenges for our clients – which is why we are focused on building relationships with talent  who are looking for trusted allies to help realize their potential throughout their careers. Havas impressed us with their strategic thinking and creativity  demonstrating an understanding of our industry and the important role we play in supporting people and organizations in realizing their true potential. This partnership will allow us to accelerate our brand strategy as we continue to deliver on our ambition to become the world's most valued 'working life partner'.""Story continuesXavier Rees  CEO at Havas London says: ""Over the past two years  the world of work has been turned on its head. Talent – in high demand  and short supply – now holds the power  while where and how we work have become two of the fundamental post-pandemic questions. The opportunity to shape that debate alongside the world's largest recruitment firm is one of the most urgent  meaningful and exciting briefs out there.""Elliott Seaborn  Global Chief Marketing Officer at Monster says: ""We are at a pivotal moment in history where employees are more in control of their careers than they ever have been before. And Monster is in the incredible position to have the power to help people find the jobs they want to do  not the job they have to. We're already working hand-in-hand with the Arnold team to create an approach that is smart  fun and compelling around the world. We're looking forward to launching this work next month.""Sean McBride  Chief Creative Officer at Arnold Worldwide says: ""Monster is the original disrupter in the employment space  with a long history of making unforgettable creative. And right now is exactly the kind of moment the Monster brand was built for – a time of massive change and even greater opportunity. So  we're incredibly excited to be working with this brand at this moment  and we can't wait to make the next great Monster campaign together. On top of that  we're always looking for more chances to partner with our cronies at Havas London. They see the advertising world the same way we do.

4067,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/primex-finance-making-trading-on-blockchain-mainstream-8443581.html,Primex Finance: Making Trading on Blockchain Mainstream,Some of the biggest issues in traditional finance and those that linger in DeFi are resolved with Primex Finance.,Finance is a deeply established market with sprawling regulations and a diverse product range. There are many layers and facets to traditional finance  with a highly segmented framework based on national jurisdictions  like the NYSE or EuroNext. The systems of the old-guard have been ripped up with the coming of crypto; no more insularity  segmentation  or oligopolies. Crypto promises markets that act on financial logic  cross national borders  and are fully decentralized.The problem with traditional financeIn traditional financial structures  power sits with centralized governing bodies  which can be inefficient and inaccurate – the overrating of CDOs in the run up the 2007-8 crash is a recent example of this. The same power can be exercised differently across nations  leading to mismatched and wrongly valued assets. Added to this  centralized institutions rest power in few hands so there is a chokepoint that can cause catastrophic failure.Market players have an incentive to protect their money and power  so a system of layers has arisen that means a layperson isn’t able to directly trade their assets – if they’re allowed to trade an asset at all. Maintaining distance between people and their assets gives governments an opportunity to seize traded assets and also produces strong oligopolies that charge huge fees for market access. The introduction of Neo Brokers has gone some way to negate this  but not far enough.Is DeFi the answer?Are the issues with traditional finance big enough to need a whole new paradigm to solve them?Distributed finance (DeFi) - truly decentalized  peer-to-peer financial products - flows power back to the masses with democracy and decentralization as key tenets of the system. There is no network of powerful regulators  rather anyone with an internet connection can be involved no matter where they are from  what their ideas about finance are  or who they are.The issue of a few points of potential failure is solved with a distributed system. Think of DeFi as the email protocol rather than the email server; a server or node on the network can crash but the whole system is still intact.Assets are traded directly by the people who own them on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This means no potential for assets to be seized and no potential for oligopolies – prime brokerages become moot. Pure market forces are restored in DeFi; there is no need for regulation outside of the system so “zero trust” is introduced.Does DeFi have drawbacks?DeFi isn’t a complete solution to all the flaws of traditional finance; it isn’t mature enough as a system yet. Without prime brokerages  there is now margin trading or automated trade execution  which are both vital. Anonymity is highly valued by people who use DeFi and this holds back lenders who can’t be sure who is using their assets as leverage.The backends of brokerages have tools to trigger automated trades. As it stands  DeFi has no equivalent so stop-loss and limit orders aren’t available. Even being able to trade across different DEXs can be troublesome since not all DEXs work well together.Finally  widespread adoption of DeFi is hindered because it’s not user-friendly. The people who develop the tech of DeFi tend to be wrapped up in the process and there is little attention paid to the design element or user experience. To the uninitiated  DeFi can feel daunting.The changes Primex Finance introducesSome of the biggest issues in traditional finance and those that linger in DeFi are resolved with Primex Finance.Margin trading is enabled in DeFi through Primex’s liquidity pools  known as credit buckets. Here  lenders add their assets to a risk-scored bucket so traders can borrow and leverage trades on different exchanges  with profits earning interest for lenders. Each trader has an up-to-date score which means KYC isn’t needed – lenders can work within their risk parameters based on trader performance.Keeper Nodes in the protocol also allow for the automated trading that is lacking in traditional finance. Meanwhile  on the frontend  Primex’s design looks and feels like a normal trading terminal  inviting in people previously wary of complicated-looking tools.Built on DeFi  Primex has all the benefits of the system and resolves some of the biggest issues still outstanding in the space – bringing in risk-assessed margin trading  automated trades  and a user-friendly interface to work with.Is DeFi the new face of finance?Moneycontrol journalists were not involved in the creation of the articleFinancial markets are increasingly becoming decentralized  distributed  and borderless  but this isn’t the end of traditional finance  yet. Institutions like central banks will be around for a long while  allowing DeFi to evolve and increase democracy in finance and make money digitally native. Primex will be central to the evolution of DeFi  with margin trading  risk management  automations  and cross-DEX trading.Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox  investments  taxes,neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,mixed,0.07,0.12,0.81,True,English,"['Primex Finance', 'Trading', 'Blockchain', 'diverse product range', 'centralized governing bodies', 'peer financial products', 'normal trading terminal', 'automated trade execution', 'Pure market forces', 'traditional financial structures', 'risk-assessed margin trading', 'automated trading', 'financial logic', 'cross-DEX trading', 'sprawling regulations', 'national jurisdictions', 'national borders', '2007-8 crash', 'recent example', 'centralized institutions', 'catastrophic failure', 'Market players', 'Maintaining distance', 'huge fees', 'market access', 'Neo Brokers', 'new paradigm', 'key tenets', 'powerful regulators', 'internet connection', 'decentralized exchanges', 'zero trust', 'complete solution', 'limit orders', 'widespread adoption', 'little attention', 'user experience', 'liquidity pools', 'credit buckets', 'risk-scored bucket', 'different exchanges', 'date score', 'risk parameters', 'Keeper Nodes', 'user-friendly interface', 'new face', 'Moneycontrol journalists', 'Financial markets', 'central banks', 'risk management', 'automated trades', 'traditional finance', 'Distributed finance', 'prime brokerages', 'biggest issues', 'many layers', 'Crypto promises', 'email protocol', 'email server', 'design element', 'trader performance', 'complicated-looking tools', 'strong oligopolies', 'potential failure', 'different DEXs', 'money calendar', 'same power', 'distributed system', 'Primex Finance', 'facets', 'segmented', 'framework', 'NYSE', 'EuroNext', 'systems', 'old-guard', 'coming', 'insularity', 'segmentation', 'problem', 'overrating', 'CDOs', 'run', 'nations', 'assets', 'hands', 'chokepoint', 'incentive', 'layperson', 'people', 'governments', 'opportunity', 'introduction', 'way', 'DeFi', 'answer', 'masses', 'democracy', 'decentralization', 'network', 'ideas', 'points', 'need', 'drawbacks', 'flaws', 'Anonymity', 'lenders', 'leverage', 'backends', 'equivalent', 'stop-loss', 'tech', 'process', 'traders', 'profits', 'interest', 'KYC', 'frontend', 'benefits', 'space', 'creation', 'article', 'long', 'evolution', 'automations', 'dates', 'moneybox', 'investments', 'taxes']",2022-05-02,2022-05-02,moneycontrol.com

The food service business activity continued its strong growth  helped by a favorable comparison base (2nd wave Covid the previous year). Similarly  the fresh food business activity also benefited from the recovery of the food service sector during the quarter. Overall  the third quarter saw a normalization of the activities by distribution channel in Europe.Non-Europe ZoneThe revenue of the non-Europe zone  representing 53.9% of the group's revenues over the first 9 months of this financial  was up +0.7% on reported figures and -2.1% on like for like basis*.In North America  the long-life operating segment (canned and frozen) benefited from the acceleration of the food service sector on a favorable basis of comparison  while the retail activity declined slightly on like for like basis* as expected.Unsurprisingly  the fresh segment activities in this zone showed a decline in volume linked to the strategy to improve the profitability of this activity. Price increases negotiated with the business clients to offset inflation confirmed the positive trend in profitability over the second half of the financial year.In the Eurasia region  the business activities continued to grow in line with previous quarters in both canned and frozen products. In Ukraine  the activity  representing a very limited part of the group's revenue  and totally stopped following the invasion of the country  is experiencing a slight recovery.HighlightsBonduelle's position on Ukraine and RussiaThe Bonduelle Group considers that it is its duty to ensure that people have access to essential foodstuffs and to do all it can to avoid contributing to food shortages. As part of its mission  the Bonduelle Group therefore ensures the continuity of its activities in Russia to feed not only the 145 million Russians but also the 90 million inhabitants in the surrounding countries supplied by the group's Russian factories.Yet the current context calls for exceptional measures.The Bonduelle Group therefore decided on March 17  with the unanimous support of its controlling shareholders  its Board of Directors  and its Supervisory Board  to allocate all profits from sales in Russia during the period of conflict to the future reconstruction of infrastructure and agricultural and food ecosystems damaged by the conflict in Ukraine.2021-2022 OutlooksGiven the business activity trend observed over the first nine months of the financial year  the necessary changes in price negotiated or to be negotiated as a result of cost inflation  and despite an uncertain health  geopolitical and consumer environment  the group confirms its guidance of 3.-% growth in business activity and targets a stable current operating margin compared to the previous financial year  at 3.6% of revenue at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation.* at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as followsFor businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.Alternative performance indicators : the group presents in its financial notices performance indicators not defined by accounting standards.

The appointment comes amidst a global  post pandemic 'talent crunch'  requiring a greater focus on building more meaningful and long-lasting relationships with talent.The appointment spans both the Randstad brand itself  which will be led by Havas London  and subsidiary Monster  which will be led by Havas' Arnold Worldwide in Boston.Randstad  the global leader in HR services  offers a seamless talent experience powered by digital and enhanced by access to personal consultants around the globe. Monster  a global online employment solution for people seeking jobs and employers who need great people  is a wholly online experience. While both brands share the same strategic vision and overarching ambitions  their brand positioning and promise are very different. As such  Havas will develop distinct campaigns for each brand.For Randstad  Havas has been tasked with elevating Randstad's 'human forward' brand promise  geared toward talent  as well as raising both awareness and understanding of its services. For Monster  which invented the online job category 25 years ago  Arnold has been tasked with reclaiming the brand's early fame to introduce it to a younger job-seeking audience.Joanna Irwin  Global Chief Marketing Officer at Randstad says: ""Talent scarcity and mismatches in the labor market remain the biggest challenges for our clients – which is why we are focused on building relationships with talent  who are looking for trusted allies to help realize their potential throughout their careers. Havas impressed us with their strategic thinking and creativity  demonstrating an understanding of our industry and the important role we play in supporting people and organizations in realizing their true potential. This partnership will allow us to accelerate our brand strategy as we continue to deliver on our ambition to become the world's most valued 'working life partner'.""Xavier Rees  CEO at Havas London says: ""Over the past two years  the world of work has been turned on its head. Talent – in high demand  and short supply – now holds the power  while where and how we work have become two of the fundamental post-pandemic questions. The opportunity to shape that debate alongside the world's largest recruitment firm is one of the most urgent  meaningful and exciting briefs out there.""Elliott Seaborn  Global Chief Marketing Officer at Monster says: ""We are at a pivotal moment in history where employees are more in control of their careers than they ever have been before. And Monster is in the incredible position to have the power to help people find the jobs they want to do  not the job they have to. We're already working hand-in-hand with the Arnold team to create an approach that is smart  fun and compelling around the world. We're looking forward to launching this work next month.""Sean McBride  Chief Creative Officer at Arnold Worldwide says: ""Monster is the original disrupter in the employment space  with a long history of making unforgettable creative. And right now is exactly the kind of moment the Monster brand was built for – a time of massive change and even greater opportunity. So  we're incredibly excited to be working with this brand at this moment  and we can't wait to make the next great Monster campaign together. On top of that  we're always looking for more chances to partner with our cronies at Havas London. They see the advertising world the same way we do. Better yet  they sound 15% smarter because of the accents.""About RandstadRandstad is the world's largest HR services provider and is driven to become the world's most valued 'working life partner'  supporting as many people as possible in realizing their true potential throughout their working life.

Patients taking FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day experienced an estimated mean difference in the reduction of drop seizure frequency by 19.9% from placebo (P=.001). The median percent reduction in the frequency of drop seizures in the 0.7 mg/kg/day group was 26.5%  compared with 14.2% in the 0.2 mg/kg/day group  and 7.6% in patients taking placebo (P=.09). In key secondary outcomes  the trial demonstrated that a greater proportion of patients taking FINTEPLA experienced a 50% or greater reduction in drop seizure frequency  compared with patients in the placebo group.""Our trial data and the clinical evidence demonstrates the safety and efficacy of FINTEPLA in LGS and especially for patients where generalized tonic-clonic seizures are the predominant seizure type  where there is a greater risk of mortality "" said Kelly Knupp  M.D.  MSCS  FAES  Associate Professor  Children's Hospital Colorado  Principal Investigator of the study. ""LGS is a highly treatment-resistant developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and we need differentiated treatment options  such as FINTEPLA  which has a unique mechanism of action different from and complementary to current anti-seizure medications.""The study also included a seizure-type subgroup analyses that demonstrated that FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day was highly effective in reducing the frequency of GTCs in nearly 50% of patients. During the maintenance and titration period  patients experienced a decrease in frequency of 45.7% in the FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day group  a decrease in frequency of 58.2% in the 0.2 mg/kg/day FINTEPLA group  compared with an increase in frequency of 3.7% in the placebo group (P=.001 and P<.001 respectively). The percentage reduction in tonic or atonic seizure frequency was 46.7% in the FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day group  compared with 6.8% in the placebo group (P=.046).1The reason these data are compelling is because GTCs are commonly observed in patients with LGS.9 Moreover  GTCs may result in bodily injury.10 11 Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major concern for people living with LGS  and patients with a history of GTCs have an estimated 10-fold greater risk of SUDEP.4FINTEPLA was generally well-tolerated in this study. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included decreased appetite  somnolence  and fatigue. The FINTEPLA safety database includes long-term cardiovascular safety data for patients treated for up to 3 years in Dravet syndrome (DS) and LGS.5""This study further validates the importance of FINTEPLA as a new treatment option for seizures associated with LGS  including generalized tonic-clonic seizures "" said Mike Davis  Global Head of Epilepsy  UCB. ""Through our close connection with the LGS community  we know the challenges they face go beyond treatment resistant seizures to include difficulty with behavior and cognition  and we hope that FINTEPLA can help people living with LGS.""Site investigators and caregivers also rated patients as significantly much or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scale (investigators 26% vs. 20% vs. 6% and caregivers 34% vs. 27% vs. 5% for 0.7 mg/kg vs. 0.2 mg/kg vs. placebo  respectively).1FINTEPLA was approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of LGS in patients 2 years and older in March 2022 and was also approved for the treatment of DS in patients 2 years and older in June 2020. UCB acquired Zogenix  Inc. and FINTEPLA on March 7  2022. The acquisition is consistent with UCB's sustainable patient value strategy and continued commitment to providing world-leading patient value to all people living with epilepsy  with an increasing focus on creating value and new solutions that address the unmet needs of people with certain specialized or rare types of epilepsy  where few or no options exist.Study DesignThe multi-center  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  randomized Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted from 27 November 2017 to 25 October 2019  and had a 20-week trial duration. Patients were enrolled at 65 study sites in North America  Europe  and Australia.A total of 263 patients were randomly assigned to receive either FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day (n=87) or FINTEPLA 0.2 mg/kg/day (n=89) or placebo (n=87). After titration (2-week period)  patients were maintained on their randomized dose for 12 additional weeks. The median age was 13 years of age.Children and adults  aged 2 to 35 years  with a confirmed LGS diagnosis who were using stable anti-seizure medication (ASM) regimens (≥1 and ≤4 concomitant ASMs) were eligible for enrollment if these criteria were met: onset of seizures at age 11 years or younger; multiple seizure types  including tonic and tonic or atonic seizures; stable 4-week seizure baseline with 2 of more drop seizures per week of GTC  or secondary GTC (i.e.  focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures)  tonic  atonic  or tonic or atonic seizure; abnormal cognitive development; and medical history showing electroencephalogram evidence of abnormal background activity with slow spike-and-wave pattern (<2.5Hz). Key exclusion criteria were degenerative neurological disease  history of hemiclonic seizures in the first year of life  only drop seizure clusters  previous or current exclusionary cardiovascular or cardiopulmonary abnormality or concomitant cannabidiol use (not FDA approved at time of study).This study was funded by Zogenix  Inc.  now part of UCB.About FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) C-IVFINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) oral solution is a prescription medication approved in the U.S. and Europe  and under regulatory review in Japan  for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older.12 13 FINTEPLA is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.5 Application for treatment of seizures associated with LGS has also been submitted and is currently under assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).14In the U.S.  FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS program. FINTEPLA is available in Europe under a controlled access program requested by the EMA to prevent off-label use for weight management and to confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking FINTEPLA. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.INDICATIONS AND USAGEFINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5–HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSAdministration to patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact Zogenix Inc. at 1-866-964-3649 (1-866-Zogenix) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.9414[email protected]Corporate CommunicationsErica Puntel  U.S. Media RelationsT +404 938 5359[email protected]Laurent Schots  Media RelationsT+32.2.559.9264[email protected]Nick FrancisT +44 7769 307745[email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB' efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products.

The Phase 1 clinical trial of SACT-1 was an open-label  randomized  3-period  3-sequence  single-dose crossover bioavailability and food effect study of SACT-1 (oral suspension) in healthy adult volunteers. The primary objective of this study was to assess the relative bioavailability of 150 mg of SACT-1 (oral suspension) under fasted and fed conditions. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety  tolerability and any potential QT prolongation after a single oral administration of 150mg of the studied drug under fasted and fed conditions in healthy adult subjects. The study treatments were well tolerated and no subjects were discontinued from study participation because of adverse events. No serious adverse events were reported during the study. The phase 1 clinical data also suggested that any QT interval after oral administration of SACT-1 at 150mg was well within clinically acceptable limits. Regarding the relative bioavailability under the Fed vs Fasted condition  the AUC 0-tlast   AUC 0-∞ and C max ratio of SACT-1 were determined to be 189.87%  189.43%  and 205.25% respectively.Dr. Clark Cheng  Chief Medical Officer and Executive Director of Aptorum Group  commented: “Further to our previous announcements  we are very encouraged by the impressive safety data even at a relatively high dosage. The relative bioavailability data also enabled us to estimate the starting dose for pediatric neuroblastoma patients via PK modeling. We are planning to meet with the US FDA for an end of Phase 1 meeting as soon as possible and are targeting for submission for a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in neuroblastoma patients.”About SACT-1SACT-1 is an orally administered repurposed small molecule drug to target neuroblastoma. SACT-1’s mechanism has been investigated in our preclinical studies to enhance tumor cell death and suppress MYCN expression (a common clinical diagnosis in high-risk or relapsed neuroblastoma patients where an amplification of MYCN is usually observed). SACT-1 is designed to be used especially in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy.About Aptorum GroupAptorum Group Limited (Nasdaq: APM  Euronext Paris: APM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic assets to treat diseases with unmet medical needs  particularly in oncology (including orphan oncology indications) and infectious diseases.

""We are aiming to significantly improve outcomes for patients with cancer through NBTXR3  and to do so we must validate the safety and efficacy of our innovation across solid tumor indications and in combination with existing treatment modalities "" said Laurent Levy  co-founder and chief executive officer of Nanobiotix. ""Taken together with data we have previously reported on NBTXR3 as a single agent and in combination with checkpoint inhibitors  we expect the findings that will be presented at ASCO this year to add a new dimension to the story of NBTXR3 as we observe the radioenhancer's performance in combination with chemotherapy. We will also highlight the design of our ongoing pivotal phase III study evaluating NBTXR3 as a single agent for frail  elderly patients with head and neck cancer."" The accepted abstracts include: Abstract #18041: PEP503 (NBTXR3)  a Radioenhancer  in Combination with Concurrent Chemoradiation (CCRT) in Locally Advanced or Recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC): Dose-Finding of a Phase 1b/2 TrialAbstract #3603: A Phase 1b/2 Study of Radioenhancer  PEP503 (NBTXR3)  in Combination with Concurrent Chemoradiation in Locally Advanced or Unresectable Rectal CancerAbstract #TPS6110: A Phase III Pivotal Study of NBTXR3 Activated by Investigator's Choice of Radiotherapy Alone or Radiotherapy in Combination with Cetuximab for Platinum-based Chemotherapy-ineligible Elderly Patients with Locally Advanced Head & Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product  composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate's physics-based mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering an adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly  with immune checkpoint inhibitors. NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program-beginning with a Company sponsored phase I clinical study  evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC and for patients with lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy  either naïve or resistant to prior PD-1 (either primary or secondary as per SITC criteria). Given the Company's focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in strategic collaborations to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2021  the Company entered into an additional strategic collaboration agreement with LianBio to support its global phase III study in Asia along with four future registrational studies.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

The median percent reduction in the frequency of drop seizures in the 0.7 mg/kg/day group was 26.5%  compared with 14.2% in the 0.2 mg/kg/day group  and 7.6% in patients taking placebo (P=.09). In key secondary outcomes  the trial demonstrated that a greater proportion of patients taking FINTEPLA experienced a 50% or greater reduction in drop seizure frequency  compared with patients in the placebo group.""Our trial data and the clinical evidence demonstrates the safety and efficacy of FINTEPLA in LGS and especially for patients where generalized tonic-clonic seizures are the predominant seizure type  where there is a greater risk of mortality "" said Kelly Knupp  M.D.  MSCS  FAES  Associate Professor  Children's Hospital Colorado  Principal Investigator of the study. ""LGS is a highly treatment-resistant developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and we need differentiated treatment options  such as FINTEPLA  which has a unique mechanism of action different from and complementary to current anti-seizure medications.""The study also included a seizure-type subgroup analyses that demonstrated that FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day was highly effective in reducing the frequency of GTCs in nearly 50% of patients. During the maintenance and titration period  patients experienced a decrease in frequency of 45.7% in the FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day group  a decrease in frequency of 58.2% in the 0.2 mg/kg/day FINTEPLA group  compared with an increase in frequency of 3.7% in the placebo group (P=.001 and P<.001 respectively). The percentage reduction in tonic or atonic seizure frequency was 46.7% in the FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day group  compared with 6.8% in the placebo group (P=.046).1The reason these data are compelling is because GTCs are commonly observed in patients with LGS.9 Moreover  GTCs may result in bodily injury.10 11 Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major concern for people living with LGS  and patients with a history of GTCs have an estimated 10-fold greater risk of SUDEP.4FINTEPLA was generally well-tolerated in this study. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included decreased appetite  somnolence  and fatigue. The FINTEPLA safety database includes long-term cardiovascular safety data for patients treated for up to 3 years in Dravet syndrome (DS) and LGS.5""This study further validates the importance of FINTEPLA as a new treatment option for seizures associated with LGS  including generalized tonic-clonic seizures "" said Mike Davis  Global Head of Epilepsy  UCB. ""Through our close connection with the LGS community  we know the challenges they face go beyond treatment resistant seizures to include difficulty with behavior and cognition  and we hope that FINTEPLA can help people living with LGS.""Site investigators and caregivers also rated patients as significantly much or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scale (investigators 26% vs. 20% vs. 6% and caregivers 34% vs. 27% vs. 5% for 0.7 mg/kg vs. 0.2 mg/kg vs. placebo  respectively).1FINTEPLA was approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of LGS in patients 2 years and older in March 2022 and was also approved for the treatment of DS in patients 2 years and older in June 2020. UCB acquired Zogenix  Inc. and FINTEPLA on March 7  2022. The acquisition is consistent with UCB's sustainable patient value strategy and continued commitment to providing world-leading patient value to all people living with epilepsy  with an increasing focus on creating value and new solutions that address the unmet needs of people with certain specialized or rare types of epilepsy  where few or no options exist.Study DesignThe multi-center  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  randomized Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted from 27 November 2017 to 25 October 2019  and had a 20-week trial duration. Patients were enrolled at 65 study sites in North America  Europe  and Australia.A total of 263 patients were randomly assigned to receive either FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day (n=87) or FINTEPLA 0.2 mg/kg/day (n=89) or placebo (n=87). After titration (2-week period)  patients were maintained on their randomized dose for 12 additional weeks. The median age was 13 years of age.Children and adults  aged 2 to 35 years  with a confirmed LGS diagnosis who were using stable anti-seizure medication (ASM) regimens (≥1 and ≤4 concomitant ASMs) were eligible for enrollment if these criteria were met: onset of seizures at age 11 years or younger; multiple seizure types  including tonic and tonic or atonic seizures; stable 4-week seizure baseline with 2 of more drop seizures per week of GTC  or secondary GTC (i.e.  focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures)  tonic  atonic  or tonic or atonic seizure; abnormal cognitive development; and medical history showing electroencephalogram evidence of abnormal background activity with slow spike-and-wave pattern (<2.5Hz). Key exclusion criteria were degenerative neurological disease  history of hemiclonic seizures in the first year of life  only drop seizure clusters  previous or current exclusionary cardiovascular or cardiopulmonary abnormality or concomitant cannabidiol use (not FDA approved at time of study).This study was funded by Zogenix  Inc.  now part of UCB.About FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) C-IVFINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) oral solution is a prescription medication approved in the U.S. and Europe  and under regulatory review in Japan  for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older.12 13 FINTEPLA is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.5 Application for treatment of seizures associated with LGS has also been submitted and is currently under assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).14In the U.S.  FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS program. FINTEPLA is available in Europe under a controlled access program requested by the EMA to prevent off-label use for weight management and to confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking FINTEPLA. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.INDICATIONS AND USAGEFINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5–HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSAdministration to patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact Zogenix Inc. at 1-866-964-3649 (1-866-Zogenix) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.9414antje.witte@ucb.comCorporate CommunicationsErica Puntel  U.S. Media RelationsT +404 938 5359Erica.puntel@ucb.comLaurent Schots  Media RelationsT+32.2.559.9264Laurent.schots@ucb.comNick FrancisT +44 7769 307745Nick.francis@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB' efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

This highly regulated  insular world was ripped up with the coming of crypto oligarchic ...,ET SpotlightFinance is one of the oldest industries that has evolved into a diversified market with many products and services. It has developed layers of control to protect money and power and has segmented into national jurisdictions with centralised trading hubs  such as the NYSE or EuroNext.This highly regulated  insular world was ripped up with the coming of crypto oligarchic corporations that have been replaced by a truly globalised  decentralised  free market.In traditional financial markets  there are gatekeepers such as banks  stock exchanges  clearinghouses  brokers  etc.  who are interested in controlling who can and can’t trade and even what assets can be traded. Get on the wrong side of your government  and you can quickly lose access to your money when assets are held centrally. Even crypto centralised exchanges (CEXs) have the same issue  maintaining and clearing balances off a central database.The layers of control in markets also lead to inaccuracies and inefficiencies. The overrating of the creditworthiness of CDOs directly led to the 2007-8 global crash  for example. With few nodes in the system  one failure point can become catastrophic  and the concentrated power can cause the price divergence and inefficiencies when regulators take opposing stances.These traditional financial structures have also led to oligopolies – vast institutions begin to gatekeep market access with significant fees charged to access the market. The advent of Neo Brokers is somewhat changing this  but not fast enough.Many of these issues are resolved through decentralised finance (DeFi). Using the power of blockchain technology  many barriers to entry in traditional markets have been broken – anyone can trade crypto without concern for their nationality or status; they just need an internet connection. Assets remain in the hands of the owner within DeFi  meaning what you own can’t be seized following a change in regulation  for example.The pure economic incentive is the market driver rather than national regulators. Without brokers  there are no gatekeepers  and there are no bottlenecks of control – even if an exchange were to fail  for example  the whole infrastructure of DeFi would remain and keep the system together. Power is inherently unable to be concentrated in one place  meaning there is less chance of a significant failure  and oligopolies are no longer possible.No market can be perfect  and there are indeed flaws in DeFi that need to be resolved. Two of the primary functions of a prime brokerage are margin trading and automated trade execution. A desire from traders to remain anonymous coupled with a highly volatile crypto market is a disincentive for lenders to offer capital for margin trading.Automated actions like stop-loss and or limit orders need new triggers in DeFi; they traditionally are generated by the backend of prime broker systems. Another limitation with DeFi technology is the lack of interoperability between some decentralised exchanges (DEXs).Functionality on the frontend also causes friction with DeFi tools. Developers in the space tend to focus on the performance and pay less attention to the overall user interface and experience. This is an intangible barrier to entry for many people.To fully replicate the positive elements of traditional finance in the DeFi space  a new tool is needed  and it comes in the form of Primex Finance. The game-changing aspect of the protocol is the introduction of margin trading for risk-assessed traders.Borrowers can access funds through lending pools  known in the system as credit buckets  and trade across a range of DEXs. The lenders who fund these credit buckets can choose one that suits their risk profile and earn interest from trading profits  knowing that they will liquidate overly risky trader positions to secure their assets. The anonymity demanded by traders is no longer an issue when their risk profile is regularly scored. Primex also uses Keeper Nodes which allow for automated trading – these two innovations together negate the need for prime brokers.Allowing for cross-DEX trading with the protocol also removes that issue from the conversation. A trader can borrow assets through a credit bucket  open a position on one DEX  and close it on another.A digital-native  truly democratic financial system that’s decentralised  borderless  and distributed is the direct route of travel. While traditional financial institutions aren’t going anywhere soon  there will be more space taken up by DeFi solutions.By introducing margin trading  risk management  and DEX-agnosticism  Primex is at the forefront of the move to the mainstream for DeFi.,neutral,0.04,0.91,0.05,negative,0.02,0.11,0.87,True,English,"['Primex Finance', 'trading barriers', 'blockchain', 'globalised, decentralised, free market', 'regulated, insular world', '2007-8 global crash', 'pure economic incentive', 'overall user interface', 'traditional financial structures', 'crypto oligarchic corporations', 'automated trade execution', 'prime broker systems', 'centralised trading hubs', 'traditional financial institutions', 'risky trader positions', 'crypto centralised exchanges', 'one failure point', 'volatile crypto market', 'traditional financial markets', 'democratic financial system', 'decentralised exchanges', 'traditional markets', 'vast institutions', 'significant failure', 'automated trading', 'decentralised finance', 'traditional finance', 'stock exchanges', 'one place', 'prime brokerage', 'Automated actions', 'one DEX', 'diversified market', 'market driver', 'margin trading', 'trading profits', 'DEX trading', 'oldest industries', 'many products', 'national jurisdictions', 'wrong side', 'central database', 'price divergence', 'opposing stances', 'significant fees', 'blockchain technology', 'many barriers', 'internet connection', 'less chance', 'primary functions', 'limit orders', 'new triggers', 'less attention', 'intangible barrier', 'many people', 'positive elements', 'new tool', 'game-changing aspect', 'lending pools', 'credit buckets', 'risk profile', 'two innovations', 'direct route', 'risk management', 'prime brokers', 'market access', 'Neo Brokers', 'national regulators', 'Keeper Nodes', 'DeFi technology', 'DeFi tools', 'DeFi solutions', 'same issue', 'risk-assessed traders', 'concentrated power', 'Primex Finance', 'DeFi space', 'Spotlight', 'services', 'layers', 'control', 'money', 'NYSE', 'EuroNext', 'coming', 'gatekeepers', 'banks', 'clearinghouses', 'assets', 'government', 'CEXs', 'balances', 'inaccuracies', 'inefficiencies', 'overrating', 'creditworthiness', 'CDOs', 'example', 'oligopolies', 'advent', 'issues', 'entry', 'concern', 'nationality', 'status', 'hands', 'owner', 'regulation', 'bottlenecks', 'infrastructure', 'flaws', 'desire', 'disincentive', 'lenders', 'capital', 'stop-loss', 'backend', 'limitation', 'lack', 'interoperability', 'DEXs', 'Functionality', 'frontend', 'friction', 'Developers', 'performance', 'experience', 'protocol', 'introduction', 'Borrowers', 'funds', 'range', 'interest', 'anonymity', 'need', 'cross', 'conversation', 'travel', 'DEX-agnosticism', 'forefront', 'move', 'mainstream']",2022-05-02,2022-05-02,economictimes.indiatimes.com
