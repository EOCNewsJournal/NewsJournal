We will also highlight the design of our ongoing pivotal phase III study evaluating NBTXR3 as a single agent for frail  elderly patients with head and neck cancer.”The accepted abstracts include:Abstract #18041: PEP503 (NBTXR3)  a Radioenhancer  in Combination with Concurrent Chemoradiation (CCRT) in Locally Advanced or Recurrent Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC): Dose-Finding of a Phase 1b/2 TrialAbstract #3603: A Phase 1b/2 Study of Radioenhancer  PEP503 (NBTXR3)  in Combination with Concurrent Chemoradiation in Locally Advanced or Unresectable Rectal CancerAbstract #TPS6110: A Phase III Pivotal Study of NBTXR3 Activated by Investigator’s Choice of Radiotherapy Alone or Radiotherapy in Combination with Cetuximab for Platinum-based Chemotherapy-ineligible Elderly Patients with Locally Advanced Head & Neck Squamous Cell CarcinomaAbout NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product  composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. The product candidate’s physics-based mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering an adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly  with immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company sponsored phase I clinical study  evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC and for patients with lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy  either naïve or resistant to prior PD-1 (either primary or secondary as per SITC criteria).Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in strategic collaborations to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2021  the Company entered into an additional strategic collaboration agreement with LianBio to support its global phase III study in Asia along with four future registrational studies.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

In application of Article 15 of the Law of May 2  2007 on the disclosure of major shareholdings in issuers whose shares are admitted for trading on a regulated market  VGP publishes  by means of a press release and on its website  the total share capital  the total number of securities with voting rights and the total number of voting rights at the latest at the end of each month in which any of these numbers has changed.Situation as at 30 April 2022Total share capital: EUR 108 873 366.06 Total number of securities with voting right: 21 833 050 Total number of securities with double voting right: 11 658 636 Total number of voting rights (= denominator): 33 491 686This situation (the denominator) serves as a basis for the notification of major shareholdings by shareholders.In accordance with Article 7:53 of the Code on companies and associations and Article 29 of the Articles of Association  fully paid-up registered shares that have been registered in the share register in the name of the same shareholder for at least two consecutive years grant double voting rights. Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.Story continuesABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European developer  manager and owner of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

The aim is to jointly develop future terminal infrastructure projects that will facilitate the necessary imports of hydrogen into Northwest Europe via Dutch and German ports. Both parties have been working together in the Gate LNG-terminal in the Port of Rotterdam that came into operation in 2011.Alongside domestic production of hydrogen  large-scale import of green hydrogen will become essential for reaching the European Green Deal and the Fit for 55 targets. Import initiatives are developing rapidly: the first import streams to Germany and the Netherlands are expected by 2025. Global supply chains and logistics infrastructure need to be developed and operated to facilitate the import of green hydrogen required for the energy and feedstock transition.The cooperation agreement includes import projects for hydrogen through green ammonia  liquid organic hydrogen carriers  and liquid hydrogen technologies. To safely and reliably handle products like hydrogen and ammonia  high quality infrastructure and operations are needed. Vopak and Gasunie will focus on developing import infrastructure related to storage that enables further distribution of hydrogen to end users (e.g. by means of pipeline  vessels  road and rail) and contributes to the security of supply in Northwest Europe. Both parties have a long track record in developing infrastructure and safely storing and handling these types of products.As independent infrastructure companies Gasunie and Vopak will focus solely on the development as well as safe and reliable operation of open access infrastructure. Open access logistics infrastructure that is available to all market parties is most effective  both from a cost and environmental footprint perspective. It can further accelerate the import and use of green energy to a wide range of end markets. On 11 April 2022  Gasunie  Vopak and HES International announced that they joined forces to develop an import terminal for a hydrogen carrier in the port of Rotterdam  named ACE Terminal.Ulco Vermeulen  Director Business Development Gasunie: “With this agreement  Vopak and Gasunie continue their many years of successful co-operation. Hydrogen is an essential component of the sustainable energy mix of the future. Our joint goal is to enable the international hydrogen value chain by providing the necessary import infrastructure. As a renewable energy infrastructure company  we already function as a linking pin for the energy transition in various public private partnerships in the Netherlands. With this agreement  Vopak and Gasunie can play a role in the transport  storage and import as part of the international hydrogen value chain.”Frits Eulderink  Executive Board Member and COO of Royal Vopak comments: “We are delighted to extend our partnership with Gasunie beyond our successful Gate LNG terminal operations in the Port of Rotterdam and jointly develop vital infrastructure supporting the energy transition. We are looking forward to working together with Gasunie in the development of new infrastructure for the future vital products.""Profile GasunieGasunie is a European energy-infrastructure company.

The appointment comes amidst a global  post pandemic 'talent crunch'  requiring a greater focus on building more meaningful and long-lasting relationships with talent.Randstad and Monster LogoThe appointment spans both the Randstad brand itself  which will be led by Havas London  and subsidiary Monster  which will be led by Havas' Arnold Worldwide in Boston.Randstad  the global leader in HR services  offers a seamless talent experience powered by digital and enhanced by access to personal consultants around the globe. Monster  a global online employment solution for people seeking jobs and employers who need great people  is a wholly online experience. While both brands share the same strategic vision and overarching ambitions  their brand positioning and promise are very different. As such  Havas will develop distinct campaigns for each brand.For Randstad  Havas has been tasked with elevating Randstad's 'human forward' brand promise  geared toward talent  as well as raising both awareness and understanding of its services. For Monster  which invented the online job category 25 years ago  Arnold has been tasked with reclaiming the brand's early fame to introduce it to a younger job-seeking audience.Joanna Irwin  Global Chief Marketing Officer at Randstad says: ""Talent scarcity and mismatches in the labor market remain the biggest challenges for our clients – which is why we are focused on building relationships with talent  who are looking for trusted allies to help realize their potential throughout their careers. Havas impressed us with their strategic thinking and creativity  demonstrating an understanding of our industry and the important role we play in supporting people and organizations in realizing their true potential. This partnership will allow us to accelerate our brand strategy as we continue to deliver on our ambition to become the world's most valued 'working life partner'.""Story continuesXavier Rees  CEO at Havas London says: ""Over the past two years  the world of work has been turned on its head. Talent – in high demand  and short supply – now holds the power  while where and how we work have become two of the fundamental post-pandemic questions. The opportunity to shape that debate alongside the world's largest recruitment firm is one of the most urgent  meaningful and exciting briefs out there.""Elliott Seaborn  Global Chief Marketing Officer at Monster says: ""We are at a pivotal moment in history where employees are more in control of their careers than they ever have been before. And Monster is in the incredible position to have the power to help people find the jobs they want to do  not the job they have to. We're already working hand-in-hand with the Arnold team to create an approach that is smart  fun and compelling around the world. We're looking forward to launching this work next month.""Sean McBride  Chief Creative Officer at Arnold Worldwide says: ""Monster is the original disrupter in the employment space  with a long history of making unforgettable creative. And right now is exactly the kind of moment the Monster brand was built for – a time of massive change and even greater opportunity. So  we're incredibly excited to be working with this brand at this moment  and we can't wait to make the next great Monster campaign together. On top of that  we're always looking for more chances to partner with our cronies at Havas London. They see the advertising world the same way we do.

4067,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/trends/features/primex-finance-making-trading-on-blockchain-mainstream-8443581.html,Primex Finance: Making Trading on Blockchain Mainstream,Some of the biggest issues in traditional finance and those that linger in DeFi are resolved with Primex Finance.,Finance is a deeply established market with sprawling regulations and a diverse product range. There are many layers and facets to traditional finance  with a highly segmented framework based on national jurisdictions  like the NYSE or EuroNext. The systems of the old-guard have been ripped up with the coming of crypto; no more insularity  segmentation  or oligopolies. Crypto promises markets that act on financial logic  cross national borders  and are fully decentralized.The problem with traditional financeIn traditional financial structures  power sits with centralized governing bodies  which can be inefficient and inaccurate – the overrating of CDOs in the run up the 2007-8 crash is a recent example of this. The same power can be exercised differently across nations  leading to mismatched and wrongly valued assets. Added to this  centralized institutions rest power in few hands so there is a chokepoint that can cause catastrophic failure.Market players have an incentive to protect their money and power  so a system of layers has arisen that means a layperson isn’t able to directly trade their assets – if they’re allowed to trade an asset at all. Maintaining distance between people and their assets gives governments an opportunity to seize traded assets and also produces strong oligopolies that charge huge fees for market access. The introduction of Neo Brokers has gone some way to negate this  but not far enough.Is DeFi the answer?Are the issues with traditional finance big enough to need a whole new paradigm to solve them?Distributed finance (DeFi) - truly decentalized  peer-to-peer financial products - flows power back to the masses with democracy and decentralization as key tenets of the system. There is no network of powerful regulators  rather anyone with an internet connection can be involved no matter where they are from  what their ideas about finance are  or who they are.The issue of a few points of potential failure is solved with a distributed system. Think of DeFi as the email protocol rather than the email server; a server or node on the network can crash but the whole system is still intact.Assets are traded directly by the people who own them on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This means no potential for assets to be seized and no potential for oligopolies – prime brokerages become moot. Pure market forces are restored in DeFi; there is no need for regulation outside of the system so “zero trust” is introduced.Does DeFi have drawbacks?DeFi isn’t a complete solution to all the flaws of traditional finance; it isn’t mature enough as a system yet. Without prime brokerages  there is now margin trading or automated trade execution  which are both vital. Anonymity is highly valued by people who use DeFi and this holds back lenders who can’t be sure who is using their assets as leverage.The backends of brokerages have tools to trigger automated trades. As it stands  DeFi has no equivalent so stop-loss and limit orders aren’t available. Even being able to trade across different DEXs can be troublesome since not all DEXs work well together.Finally  widespread adoption of DeFi is hindered because it’s not user-friendly. The people who develop the tech of DeFi tend to be wrapped up in the process and there is little attention paid to the design element or user experience. To the uninitiated  DeFi can feel daunting.The changes Primex Finance introducesSome of the biggest issues in traditional finance and those that linger in DeFi are resolved with Primex Finance.Margin trading is enabled in DeFi through Primex’s liquidity pools  known as credit buckets. Here  lenders add their assets to a risk-scored bucket so traders can borrow and leverage trades on different exchanges  with profits earning interest for lenders. Each trader has an up-to-date score which means KYC isn’t needed – lenders can work within their risk parameters based on trader performance.Keeper Nodes in the protocol also allow for the automated trading that is lacking in traditional finance. Meanwhile  on the frontend  Primex’s design looks and feels like a normal trading terminal  inviting in people previously wary of complicated-looking tools.Built on DeFi  Primex has all the benefits of the system and resolves some of the biggest issues still outstanding in the space – bringing in risk-assessed margin trading  automated trades  and a user-friendly interface to work with.Is DeFi the new face of finance?Moneycontrol journalists were not involved in the creation of the articleFinancial markets are increasingly becoming decentralized  distributed  and borderless  but this isn’t the end of traditional finance  yet. Institutions like central banks will be around for a long while  allowing DeFi to evolve and increase democracy in finance and make money digitally native. Primex will be central to the evolution of DeFi  with margin trading  risk management  automations  and cross-DEX trading.Download your money calendar for 2022-23 here and keep your dates with your moneybox  investments  taxes,neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,mixed,0.07,0.12,0.81,True,English,"['Primex Finance', 'Trading', 'Blockchain', 'diverse product range', 'centralized governing bodies', 'peer financial products', 'normal trading terminal', 'automated trade execution', 'Pure market forces', 'traditional financial structures', 'risk-assessed margin trading', 'automated trading', 'financial logic', 'cross-DEX trading', 'sprawling regulations', 'national jurisdictions', 'national borders', '2007-8 crash', 'recent example', 'centralized institutions', 'catastrophic failure', 'Market players', 'Maintaining distance', 'huge fees', 'market access', 'Neo Brokers', 'new paradigm', 'key tenets', 'powerful regulators', 'internet connection', 'decentralized exchanges', 'zero trust', 'complete solution', 'limit orders', 'widespread adoption', 'little attention', 'user experience', 'liquidity pools', 'credit buckets', 'risk-scored bucket', 'different exchanges', 'date score', 'risk parameters', 'Keeper Nodes', 'user-friendly interface', 'new face', 'Moneycontrol journalists', 'Financial markets', 'central banks', 'risk management', 'automated trades', 'traditional finance', 'Distributed finance', 'prime brokerages', 'biggest issues', 'many layers', 'Crypto promises', 'email protocol', 'email server', 'design element', 'trader performance', 'complicated-looking tools', 'strong oligopolies', 'potential failure', 'different DEXs', 'money calendar', 'same power', 'distributed system', 'Primex Finance', 'facets', 'segmented', 'framework', 'NYSE', 'EuroNext', 'systems', 'old-guard', 'coming', 'insularity', 'segmentation', 'problem', 'overrating', 'CDOs', 'run', 'nations', 'assets', 'hands', 'chokepoint', 'incentive', 'layperson', 'people', 'governments', 'opportunity', 'introduction', 'way', 'DeFi', 'answer', 'masses', 'democracy', 'decentralization', 'network', 'ideas', 'points', 'need', 'drawbacks', 'flaws', 'Anonymity', 'lenders', 'leverage', 'backends', 'equivalent', 'stop-loss', 'tech', 'process', 'traders', 'profits', 'interest', 'KYC', 'frontend', 'benefits', 'space', 'creation', 'article', 'long', 'evolution', 'automations', 'dates', 'moneybox', 'investments', 'taxes']",2022-05-02,2022-05-03,moneycontrol.com

The food service business activity continued its strong growth  helped by a favorable comparison base (2nd wave Covid the previous year). Similarly  the fresh food business activity also benefited from the recovery of the food service sector during the quarter. Overall  the third quarter saw a normalization of the activities by distribution channel in Europe.Non-Europe ZoneThe revenue of the non-Europe zone  representing 53.9% of the group's revenues over the first 9 months of this financial  was up +0.7% on reported figures and -2.1% on like for like basis*.In North America  the long-life operating segment (canned and frozen) benefited from the acceleration of the food service sector on a favorable basis of comparison  while the retail activity declined slightly on like for like basis* as expected.Unsurprisingly  the fresh segment activities in this zone showed a decline in volume linked to the strategy to improve the profitability of this activity. Price increases negotiated with the business clients to offset inflation confirmed the positive trend in profitability over the second half of the financial year.In the Eurasia region  the business activities continued to grow in line with previous quarters in both canned and frozen products. In Ukraine  the activity  representing a very limited part of the group's revenue  and totally stopped following the invasion of the country  is experiencing a slight recovery.HighlightsBonduelle's position on Ukraine and RussiaThe Bonduelle Group considers that it is its duty to ensure that people have access to essential foodstuffs and to do all it can to avoid contributing to food shortages. As part of its mission  the Bonduelle Group therefore ensures the continuity of its activities in Russia to feed not only the 145 million Russians but also the 90 million inhabitants in the surrounding countries supplied by the group's Russian factories.Yet the current context calls for exceptional measures.The Bonduelle Group therefore decided on March 17  with the unanimous support of its controlling shareholders  its Board of Directors  and its Supervisory Board  to allocate all profits from sales in Russia during the period of conflict to the future reconstruction of infrastructure and agricultural and food ecosystems damaged by the conflict in Ukraine.2021-2022 OutlooksGiven the business activity trend observed over the first nine months of the financial year  the necessary changes in price negotiated or to be negotiated as a result of cost inflation  and despite an uncertain health  geopolitical and consumer environment  the group confirms its guidance of 3.-% growth in business activity and targets a stable current operating margin compared to the previous financial year  at 3.6% of revenue at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation.* at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis. The revenues in foreign currency over the given period are translated into the rate of exchange for the comparable period. The impact of business acquisitions (or gain of control) and divestments is restated as followsFor businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the current period  revenue generated since the acquisition date is excluded from the organic growth calculation;For businesses acquired (or gain of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated during the current period up until the first anniversary date of the acquisition is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the prior fiscal year  revenue generated in the comparative period of the prior fiscal year until the divestment date is excluded;For businesses divested (or loss of control) during the current fiscal year  revenue generated in the period commencing 12 months before the divestment date up to the end of the comparative period of the prior fiscal year is excluded.Alternative performance indicators : the group presents in its financial notices performance indicators not defined by accounting standards.

The appointment comes amidst a global  post pandemic 'talent crunch'  requiring a greater focus on building more meaningful and long-lasting relationships with talent.The appointment spans both the Randstad brand itself  which will be led by Havas London  and subsidiary Monster  which will be led by Havas' Arnold Worldwide in Boston.Randstad  the global leader in HR services  offers a seamless talent experience powered by digital and enhanced by access to personal consultants around the globe. Monster  a global online employment solution for people seeking jobs and employers who need great people  is a wholly online experience. While both brands share the same strategic vision and overarching ambitions  their brand positioning and promise are very different. As such  Havas will develop distinct campaigns for each brand.For Randstad  Havas has been tasked with elevating Randstad's 'human forward' brand promise  geared toward talent  as well as raising both awareness and understanding of its services. For Monster  which invented the online job category 25 years ago  Arnold has been tasked with reclaiming the brand's early fame to introduce it to a younger job-seeking audience.Joanna Irwin  Global Chief Marketing Officer at Randstad says: ""Talent scarcity and mismatches in the labor market remain the biggest challenges for our clients – which is why we are focused on building relationships with talent  who are looking for trusted allies to help realize their potential throughout their careers. Havas impressed us with their strategic thinking and creativity  demonstrating an understanding of our industry and the important role we play in supporting people and organizations in realizing their true potential. This partnership will allow us to accelerate our brand strategy as we continue to deliver on our ambition to become the world's most valued 'working life partner'.""Xavier Rees  CEO at Havas London says: ""Over the past two years  the world of work has been turned on its head. Talent – in high demand  and short supply – now holds the power  while where and how we work have become two of the fundamental post-pandemic questions. The opportunity to shape that debate alongside the world's largest recruitment firm is one of the most urgent  meaningful and exciting briefs out there.""Elliott Seaborn  Global Chief Marketing Officer at Monster says: ""We are at a pivotal moment in history where employees are more in control of their careers than they ever have been before. And Monster is in the incredible position to have the power to help people find the jobs they want to do  not the job they have to. We're already working hand-in-hand with the Arnold team to create an approach that is smart  fun and compelling around the world. We're looking forward to launching this work next month.""Sean McBride  Chief Creative Officer at Arnold Worldwide says: ""Monster is the original disrupter in the employment space  with a long history of making unforgettable creative. And right now is exactly the kind of moment the Monster brand was built for – a time of massive change and even greater opportunity. So  we're incredibly excited to be working with this brand at this moment  and we can't wait to make the next great Monster campaign together. On top of that  we're always looking for more chances to partner with our cronies at Havas London. They see the advertising world the same way we do. Better yet  they sound 15% smarter because of the accents.""About RandstadRandstad is the world's largest HR services provider and is driven to become the world's most valued 'working life partner'  supporting as many people as possible in realizing their true potential throughout their working life.

Patients taking FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day experienced an estimated mean difference in the reduction of drop seizure frequency by 19.9% from placebo (P=.001). The median percent reduction in the frequency of drop seizures in the 0.7 mg/kg/day group was 26.5%  compared with 14.2% in the 0.2 mg/kg/day group  and 7.6% in patients taking placebo (P=.09). In key secondary outcomes  the trial demonstrated that a greater proportion of patients taking FINTEPLA experienced a 50% or greater reduction in drop seizure frequency  compared with patients in the placebo group.""Our trial data and the clinical evidence demonstrates the safety and efficacy of FINTEPLA in LGS and especially for patients where generalized tonic-clonic seizures are the predominant seizure type  where there is a greater risk of mortality "" said Kelly Knupp  M.D.  MSCS  FAES  Associate Professor  Children's Hospital Colorado  Principal Investigator of the study. ""LGS is a highly treatment-resistant developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and we need differentiated treatment options  such as FINTEPLA  which has a unique mechanism of action different from and complementary to current anti-seizure medications.""The study also included a seizure-type subgroup analyses that demonstrated that FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day was highly effective in reducing the frequency of GTCs in nearly 50% of patients. During the maintenance and titration period  patients experienced a decrease in frequency of 45.7% in the FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day group  a decrease in frequency of 58.2% in the 0.2 mg/kg/day FINTEPLA group  compared with an increase in frequency of 3.7% in the placebo group (P=.001 and P<.001 respectively). The percentage reduction in tonic or atonic seizure frequency was 46.7% in the FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day group  compared with 6.8% in the placebo group (P=.046).1The reason these data are compelling is because GTCs are commonly observed in patients with LGS.9 Moreover  GTCs may result in bodily injury.10 11 Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a major concern for people living with LGS  and patients with a history of GTCs have an estimated 10-fold greater risk of SUDEP.4FINTEPLA was generally well-tolerated in this study. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events included decreased appetite  somnolence  and fatigue. The FINTEPLA safety database includes long-term cardiovascular safety data for patients treated for up to 3 years in Dravet syndrome (DS) and LGS.5""This study further validates the importance of FINTEPLA as a new treatment option for seizures associated with LGS  including generalized tonic-clonic seizures "" said Mike Davis  Global Head of Epilepsy  UCB. ""Through our close connection with the LGS community  we know the challenges they face go beyond treatment resistant seizures to include difficulty with behavior and cognition  and we hope that FINTEPLA can help people living with LGS.""Site investigators and caregivers also rated patients as significantly much or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I) scale (investigators 26% vs. 20% vs. 6% and caregivers 34% vs. 27% vs. 5% for 0.7 mg/kg vs. 0.2 mg/kg vs. placebo  respectively).1FINTEPLA was approved by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of LGS in patients 2 years and older in March 2022 and was also approved for the treatment of DS in patients 2 years and older in June 2020. UCB acquired Zogenix  Inc. and FINTEPLA on March 7  2022. The acquisition is consistent with UCB's sustainable patient value strategy and continued commitment to providing world-leading patient value to all people living with epilepsy  with an increasing focus on creating value and new solutions that address the unmet needs of people with certain specialized or rare types of epilepsy  where few or no options exist.Study DesignThe multi-center  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  randomized Phase 3 clinical trial was conducted from 27 November 2017 to 25 October 2019  and had a 20-week trial duration. Patients were enrolled at 65 study sites in North America  Europe  and Australia.A total of 263 patients were randomly assigned to receive either FINTEPLA 0.7 mg/kg/day (n=87) or FINTEPLA 0.2 mg/kg/day (n=89) or placebo (n=87). After titration (2-week period)  patients were maintained on their randomized dose for 12 additional weeks. The median age was 13 years of age.Children and adults  aged 2 to 35 years  with a confirmed LGS diagnosis who were using stable anti-seizure medication (ASM) regimens (≥1 and ≤4 concomitant ASMs) were eligible for enrollment if these criteria were met: onset of seizures at age 11 years or younger; multiple seizure types  including tonic and tonic or atonic seizures; stable 4-week seizure baseline with 2 of more drop seizures per week of GTC  or secondary GTC (i.e.  focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizures)  tonic  atonic  or tonic or atonic seizure; abnormal cognitive development; and medical history showing electroencephalogram evidence of abnormal background activity with slow spike-and-wave pattern (<2.5Hz). Key exclusion criteria were degenerative neurological disease  history of hemiclonic seizures in the first year of life  only drop seizure clusters  previous or current exclusionary cardiovascular or cardiopulmonary abnormality or concomitant cannabidiol use (not FDA approved at time of study).This study was funded by Zogenix  Inc.  now part of UCB.About FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) C-IVFINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) oral solution is a prescription medication approved in the U.S. and Europe  and under regulatory review in Japan  for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome in patients two years of age and older.12 13 FINTEPLA is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.5 Application for treatment of seizures associated with LGS has also been submitted and is currently under assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA).14In the U.S.  FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA REMS program. FINTEPLA is available in Europe under a controlled access program requested by the EMA to prevent off-label use for weight management and to confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking FINTEPLA. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.INDICATIONS AND USAGEFINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5–HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  how to recognize signs and symptoms of valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSAdministration to patients with hepatic impairment is not recommended.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact Zogenix Inc. at 1-866-964-3649 (1-866-Zogenix) or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional important information on FINTEPLA.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.9414[email protected]Corporate CommunicationsErica Puntel  U.S. Media RelationsT +404 938 5359[email protected]Laurent Schots  Media RelationsT+32.2.559.9264[email protected]Nick FrancisT +44 7769 307745[email protected]About UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

These forward-looking statements are based on current plans  estimates and beliefs of management. All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including but not limited to  the ability of UCB to successfully integrate the operations of Zogenix as planned or at all  estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB' efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

The Phase 1 clinical trial of SACT-1 was an open-label  randomized  3-period  3-sequence  single-dose crossover bioavailability and food effect study of SACT-1 (oral suspension) in healthy adult volunteers. The primary objective of this study was to assess the relative bioavailability of 150 mg of SACT-1 (oral suspension) under fasted and fed conditions. The secondary objectives were to evaluate the safety  tolerability and any potential QT prolongation after a single oral administration of 150mg of the studied drug under fasted and fed conditions in healthy adult subjects. The study treatments were well tolerated and no subjects were discontinued from study participation because of adverse events. No serious adverse events were reported during the study. The phase 1 clinical data also suggested that any QT interval after oral administration of SACT-1 at 150mg was well within clinically acceptable limits. Regarding the relative bioavailability under the Fed vs Fasted condition  the AUC 0-tlast   AUC 0-∞ and C max ratio of SACT-1 were determined to be 189.87%  189.43%  and 205.25% respectively.Dr. Clark Cheng  Chief Medical Officer and Executive Director of Aptorum Group  commented: “Further to our previous announcements  we are very encouraged by the impressive safety data even at a relatively high dosage. The relative bioavailability data also enabled us to estimate the starting dose for pediatric neuroblastoma patients via PK modeling. We are planning to meet with the US FDA for an end of Phase 1 meeting as soon as possible and are targeting for submission for a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in neuroblastoma patients.”About SACT-1SACT-1 is an orally administered repurposed small molecule drug to target neuroblastoma. SACT-1’s mechanism has been investigated in our preclinical studies to enhance tumor cell death and suppress MYCN expression (a common clinical diagnosis in high-risk or relapsed neuroblastoma patients where an amplification of MYCN is usually observed). SACT-1 is designed to be used especially in combination with standard-of-care chemotherapy.About Aptorum GroupAptorum Group Limited (Nasdaq: APM  Euronext Paris: APM) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic assets to treat diseases with unmet medical needs  particularly in oncology (including orphan oncology indications) and infectious diseases.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 has triggered a severe response from the international community that has further exacerbated the market tightness and the profound effects of this crisis are likely to be long lasting as consumers and producers alike reshape their thinking around access to resources and security of supply. Brent prices averaged over USD 100 per barrel during the first quarter of 2022  well in excess of fourth quarter 2021 Brent oil prices that averaged USD 80 per barrel.In Canada  first quarter 2022 Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude price differentials averaged below USD 15 per barrel and forward markets into 2022 and 2023 are pricing the WCS differential at below USD 14 per barrel. Completion and placement into service of Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as the positive construction progress on the TransMountain pipeline expansion project are providing a much more constructive outlook for Canadian oil market egress relative to the tightness we have witnessed over the past several years. IPC has positioned itself well to benefit from this fundamental improvement in market conditions and has hedged approximately two thirds of our WCS differential exposure at around USD 13 per barrel for the remainder of 2022. No other oil hedges are in place providing full exposure to the strength we are seeing in both the Brent and West Texas Intermediate benchmarks.Gas markets have also strengthened driven by a combination of increasing demand and a longer period of cold weather in the United States reducing storage levels. In Canada storage levels are 40% below the average level seen in the past ten years. First quarter average Empress prices were CAD 4.96 per Mcf and forward prices are the strongest IPC has witnessed at above CAD 5.00 per Mcf for the remainder of 2022. IPC has hedged AECO gas prices  33 000 Mcf per day at CAD 3.60 per Mcf in Q2 and Q3 2022.IPC benefits from a well balanced mix of production comprising approximately 50% Canadian Crude  33% Canadian Natural Gas and 17% Brent weighted oil. With synchronized strength in pricing across the entire energy complex  combined with delivering operational excellence above the high end of our first quarter forecast  IPC has again been able to deliver our best ever quarterly financial performance since our launch in 2017.We were very pleased to complete IPC’s first USD 300 million bond issuance on February 1  2022  accessing the debt capital markets at a favourable time. We used a portion of the proceeds of the bond to fully repay and cancel our existing reserve-based lending facilities. We strongly believe that the winners in the next phase of the energy transition in the upstream oil and gas industry will be the companies able to access diverse sources of funding. Whilst we do not have an imminent acquisition  we believe that being able to demonstrate to sellers that IPC has the financial strength on its balance sheet  will enable IPC to access a greater universe of opportunities whilst differentiating us from our peers in terms of certainty of being able to close transactions.We have created significant value from acquisition for all of our stakeholders having concluded four acquisitions in the past four years and will remain opportunistic in our approach with respect to further M&A activity focusing on securing additional high quality resources  as well as maturing our significant contingent resource base in excess of 1.4 billion barrels.First Quarter 2022 HighlightsDuring the first quarter of 2022  our assets delivered average net production of 45 800 boepd  above our high end guidance. This was made possible by the very high uptime performance across all our assets as well as higher than forecast gas production at Suffield in Canada due to the milder winter conditions reducing the impact of freeze offs. Full year 2022 production guidance of 46 000 to 48 000 boepd is retained.Our operating costs per boe for the first quarter of 2022 was USD 17.7  USD 0.5 per boe above guidance and largely driven by higher gas prices for our Onion Lake thermal project and higher energy costs. The fact that we produce more than three times the volume of gas than we consume means that the positive revenue impact is more than three times the negative cost impact of higher gas prices. We are increasing our full year operating cost guidance from USD 15.2 per boe to USD 16 to 17 per boe to account for the increase we have seen in gas and energy prices.Operating cash flow (OCF) generation for the first quarter of 2022 was USD 145 million  a record high for IPC. Full year 2022 OCF guidance is being increased from USD 360 to 635 million to USD 430 to 635 million assuming average Brent oil prices of USD 70 to 100 per barrel for the remainder of 2022.Capital and decommissioning expenditure for the first quarter of 2022 was USD 40 million. Full year 2022 capital and decommissioning expenditure guidance is retained at USD 127 million.Free cash flow (FCF) generation was exceptionally strong at USD 96 million during the first quarter of 2022  a record quarterly result for IPC. Full year 2022 FCF guidance is being increased from USD 205 to 480 million to USD 275 to 480 million assuming average Brent oil prices of USD 70 to 100 per barrel for the remainder of 2022. This represents between 19% and 33% of IPC’s current market capitalization.(4)Net debt has reduced to USD 42 million by the end of the first quarter of 2022. During April 2022  IPC moved into a net cash position.IPC forecasts cumulative FCF for 2022 to 2026 of approximately USD 900 to 1 800 million (based on forecast Brent oil prices of USD 65 to 95 per barrel) generating estimated average annual FCF yield over the five year period of between 12% and 24%.(4)Capital Allocation PlansWe were also pleased to announce IPC’s 2022 capital allocation plans at our 2022 CMD. IPC plans to distribute to shareholders up to 40% of the FCF generated by IPC above achieved average Brent oil prices of USD 55 per barrel  provided that IPC’s net debt to EBITDA ratio is at or below 1 time.Share Repurchase ProgramsNormal Course Issuer BidIPC implemented the current share repurchase program/normal course issuer bid (NCIB) in December 2021. This program permits IPC to buy-back up to approximately 11.1 million shares  or approximately 7% of the total outstanding IPC shares at the time of launch  over the 12-month period up to December 2022. To date  IPC has purchased and cancelled approximately 4.4 million IPC shares under the program  or approximately 40% of the annual NCIB limit  at a total purchase cost of approximately USD 29 million. The average price of IPC shares purchased to date is approximately SEK 60 per share.Substantial Issuer BidGiven the strong operational delivery during the first quarter of 2022 and robust financial outlook  IPC intends to accelerate share repurchases above the limits of the NCIB. IPC is pleased to announce that IPC intends to commence a substantial issuer bid (SIB) under which the Corporation plans to offer to purchase for cancellation from shareholders up to CAD 128 million  or approximately USD 100 million or SEK 980 million  of IPC’s outstanding common shares. IPC believes that the SIB represents an effective use of IPC’s capital and that share repurchases continue to be an efficient way to return value to IPC’s shareholders.The SIB is expected to be conducted by way of a “modified Dutch auction” which will permit shareholders to choose  within the pricing range determined by IPC  the number of shares and the price at which they wish to tender such shares  with the purchase price for all tendering shareholders being the lowest purchase price per share that will enable IPC to purchase the maximum number of shares properly tendered to the offer  up to CAD 128 million. The pricing range for the SIB is expected to be set at between CAD 12.00 to 14.00 per share  or approximately SEK 92 to 107 per share based on current foreign exchange rates  representing a range of approximately 3% discount to 13% premium over the Corporation’s volume-weighted average price on the Toronto Stock Exchange over the 10 trading days prior to May 2  2022. The offer to purchase under the SIB is expected to be open for 35 calendar days from commencement of the SIB  unless varied  extended or withdrawn by IPC. IPC intends to suspend share repurchases under the NCIB until after the expiration of the SIB.At the minimum and maximum purchase price of the expected pricing range of CAD 12.00 to CAD 14.00  the offer to purchase under the SIB would be for up to between 10.7 million common shares (approximately 7.1% of shares currently outstanding) and 9.1 million common shares (approximately 6.1% of shares currently outstanding)  respectively. As of May 3  2022  150 966 013 common shares of IPC are issued and outstanding and IPC holds no common shares in treasury.Further details relating to the SIB  including instructions for tendering shares  will be provided by IPC at the time of commencement of the SIB and will be included in the formal offer to purchase and issuer bid circular  letter of transmittal for registered shareholders  notice of guaranteed delivery for registered shareholders  tender form for shareholders holding shares through Euroclear Sweden and other related documents which will be mailed and/or made available to shareholders  and which may be filed with applicable securities regulatory authorities and made available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the Corporation’s website at www.international-petroleum.com.(5)Environmental  Social and Governance (“ESG“) PerformanceResponsible operatorship and ensuring that we adhere to the highest principles of business conduct have been an integral part of how we do business since the creation of IPC in 2017. Over the past five years  IPC has rapidly grown our business with the completion of three acquisitions in Canada  an acquisition in Malaysia in addition to significant organic investments into those businesses. In parallel  we have made a concerted effort to further develop and improve our sustainability strategy. As previously announced  IPC targets a reduction of our net GHG emissions intensity by the end of 2025 to 50% of the IPC’s 2019 baseline and the Corporation is on track to achieving that target.During the first quarter of 2022  IPC recorded no material safety or environmental incidents.”Notes:(1) See “Supplemental Information regarding Product Types” in “Disclosure of Oil and Gas Information” below.

The information was submitted for publication  through the contact persons set out above  at 07:30 CEST on May 3  2022. The Corporation's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements (Financial Statements) and management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) for the three months ended March 31  2022 have been filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and are also available on the Corporation's website (www.international-petroleum.com).Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains statements and information which constitute ""forward-looking statements"" or ""forward-looking information"" (within the meaning of applicable securities legislation). Such statements and information (together  ""forward-looking statements"") relate to future events  including the Corporation's future performance  business prospects or opportunities. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release  unless otherwise indicated. IPC does not intend  and does not assume any obligation  to update these forward-looking statements  except as required by applicable laws.The Covid-19 virus and the restrictions and disruptions related to it had a material effect on the world demand for  and prices of  oil and gas as well as the market price of the shares of oil and gas companies generally. Although demand  commodity prices and share prices have recovered  there can be no assurance that these effects will not resume or that commodity prices will not decrease or remain volatile in the future. These factors are beyond the control of the Corporation and it is difficult to assess how these  and other factors  will continue to affect the Corporation and the market price of IPC’s common shares. In light of the current situation  as at the date of this press release  the Corporation continues to review and assess its business plans and assumptions regarding the business environment  as well as its estimates of future production  cash flows  operating costs and capital expenditures.All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions  expectations  beliefs  plans  projections  forecasts  guidance  budgets  objectives  assumptions or future events or performance (often  but not always  using words or phrases such as ""seek""  ""anticipate""  ""plan""  ""continue""  ""estimate""  ""expect""  ""may""  ""will""  ""project""  “forecast”  ""predict""  ""potential""  ""targeting""  ""intend""  ""could""  ""might""  ""should""  ""believe""  ""budget"" and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be ""forward-looking statements"".Forward-looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements with respect to:IPC’s ability to maximize liquidity and financial flexibility in connection with the current and any future Covid-19 outbreaks;the potential for an improved future economic environment  including resulting from a lack of capital investment and drilling in the oil and gas industry;2022 production range  operating costs and capital and decommissioning expenditure estimates;estimates of future production  cash flows  operating costs and capital expenditures that are based on IPC’s current business plans and assumptions regarding the business environment  which are subject to change;IPC’s financial and operational flexibility to continue to react to recent events and navigate the Corporation through periods of volatile commodity prices;IPC’s continued access to its credit facilities  including current financial headroom  on terms acceptable to the Corporation;the ability to fully fund future expenditures and share repurchases from cash flows and current borrowing capacity;IPC’s ability to maintain operations  production and business in light of the current and any future Covid-19 outbreaks and the restrictions and disruptions related thereto  including risks related to production delays and interruptions  changes in laws and regulations and reliance on third-party operators and infrastructure;IPC’s intention and ability to continue to implement our strategies to build long-term shareholder value;the ability of IPC’s portfolio of assets to provide a solid foundation for organic and inorganic growth;the continued facility uptime and reservoir performance in IPC’s areas of operation;future development potential of the Suffield and Ferguson operations in Canada  including the timing and success of future oil and gas drilling and optimization programs;development of the Blackrod project in Canada  including estimates of resource volumes  future production  timing  breakeven prices and net present value;current and future drilling pad production and timing and success of facility upgrades  tie-in work and infill drilling at Onion Lake Thermal;the potential improvement in the Canadian oil egress situation and IPC’s ability to benefit from any such improvements;the timing and success of the future development projects and other organic growth opportunities in France;the ability to maintain current and forecast production in France;the timing and success of the Villeperdue West development project in France;the ability of IPC to achieve and maintain current and forecast production in Malaysia;the success of the drilling of the A15 sidetrack well and of the production well pump rate optimization project in Malaysia;the commencement  timing  completion and results of the substantial issuer bid (SIB);the ability of IPC to acquire common shares under the SIB or further common shares under the NCIB  including the timing of any such purchases;the return of value to IPC’s shareholders as a result of the SIB or the NCIB;the ability of IPC to implement future shareholder distributions in addition to the SIB and the NCIB;IPC’s ability to implement its GHG emissions intensity and climate strategies and to achieve its net GHG emissions intensity reduction targets;estimates of reserves and contingent resources;the ability to generate free cash flows and use that cash to repay debt;IPC’s ability to identify and complete future acquisitions; andfuture drilling and other exploration and development activities.Statements relating to ""reserves"" and ""contingent resources"" are also deemed to be forward-looking statements  as they involve the implied assessment  based on certain estimates and assumptions  that the reserves and resources described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and that the reserves and resources can be profitably produced in the future. Ultimate recovery of reserves or resources is based on forecasts of future results  estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management.The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by IPC  including expectations and assumptions concerning: prevailing commodity prices and currency exchange rates; applicable royalty rates and tax laws; interest rates; future well production rates and reserve and contingent resource volumes; operating costs; the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals; the performance of existing wells; the success obtained in drilling new wells; anticipated timing and results of capital expenditures; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities; the timing  location and extent of future drilling operations; the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions; the benefits of acquisitions; the state of the economy and the exploration and production business in the jurisdictions in which IPC operates and globally; the availability and cost of financing  labour and services; and the ability to market crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids successfully.Although IPC believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are based are reasonable  undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because IPC can give no assurances that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions  by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks.These include  but are not limited to:the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development  exploration and production;delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures;the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to reserves  resources  production  revenues  costs and expenses;health  safety and environmental risks;commodity price fluctuations;interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations;marketing and transportation;loss of markets;environmental and climate-related risks;competition;incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions;failure to complete or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or dispositions;the ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources;failure to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; andchanges in legislation  including but not limited to tax laws  royalties  environmental and abandonment regulations.Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.Additional information on these and other factors that could affect IPC  or its operations or financial results  are included in the MD&A (See ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" and “Reserves and Resources Advisory” therein)  the Corporation's Annual Information Form (AIF) for the year ended December 31  2021 (See ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information""  ""Reserves and Resources Advisory"" and "" Risk Factors"" therein) and other reports on file with applicable securities regulatory authorities  including previous financial reports  management’s discussion and analysis and material change reports  which may be accessed through the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com) or IPC's website (www.international-petroleum.com).The current and any future Covid-19 outbreaks may increase IPC’s exposure to  and magnitude of  each of the risks and uncertainties identified above that result from a reduction in demand for oil and gas consumption  lower commodity prices  reliance on third parties  operational risks and costs and changes in government regulation. The extent to which Covid-19 impacts IPC’s business  results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments  which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict  including  but not limited to  the duration and spread of the current and any future Covid-19 outbreaks  their severity  the actions taken to contain such outbreaks or treat their impact  and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume and their impacts to IPC’s business  results of operations and financial condition which could be more significant in upcoming periods as compared with previous periods. Even after the Covid-19 outbreaks have subsided  IPC may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to IPC’s business as a result of the global economic impact.Non-IFRS MeasuresReferences are made in this press release to ""operating cash flow"" (OCF)  “free cash flow” (FCF)  ""Earnings Before Interest  Tax  Depreciation and Amortization"" (EBITDA)  ""operating costs"" and ""net debt""/”net cash”  which are not generally accepted accounting measures under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and  therefore  may not be comparable with similar measures presented by other public companies. Non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.The Corporation uses non-IFRS measures to provide investors with supplemental measures to assess the cash generated by and the financial performance and position of the Corporation. Management also uses non-IFRS measures internally in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period  prepare annual operating budgets and assess the Corporation’s ability to meet its future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes these non-IFRS measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they highlight trends in the core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management believes such measures allow for assessment of the Corporation’s operating performance and financial condition on a basis that is more consistent and comparable between reporting periods. The Corporation also believes that securities analysts  investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of presenting information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future and readers are cautioned that such statements may not be appropriate for other purposes.The definition and reconciliation of each non-IFRS measure is presented in IPC's MD&A (See ""Non-IFRS Measures"" therein).Estimated free cash flow generation is based on IPC’s current business plans over the period of 2022 to 2026. Assumptions include average net production of approximately 47 Mboepd  average Brent oil prices of USD 65 to 95 per boe escalating by 2% per year  average gas prices of CAD 3.00 per thousand cubic feet  and average Brent to Western Canadian Select differentials as estimated by IPC’s independent reserves evaluator and as further described in the AIF. IPC’s current business plans and assumptions  and the business environment  are subject to change. Actual results may differ materially from forward-looking estimates and forecasts.Disclosure of Oil and Gas InformationThis press release contains references to estimates of gross and net reserves and resources attributed to the Corporation's oil and gas assets. Gross reserves / resources are the working interest (operating or non-operating) share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty interests. Net reserves / resources are the working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of royalty obligations  plus royalty interests in reserves/resources  and in respect of PSCs in Malaysia  adjusted for cost and profit oil. Unless otherwise indicated  reserves / resource volumes are presented on a gross basis.Reserve estimates  contingent resource estimates and estimates of future net revenue in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in Canada are effective as of December 31  2021  and are included in the reports prepared by Sproule Associates Limited (Sproule)  an independent qualified reserves evaluator  in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (NI 51-101) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (the COGE Handbook) and using Sproule’s December 31  2021 price forecasts.Reserve estimates  contingent resource estimates and estimates of future net revenue in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in France and Malaysia are effective as of December 31  2021  and are included in the report prepared by ERC Equipoise Ltd. (ERCE)  an independent qualified reserves auditor  in accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE Handbook  and using Sproule’s December 31  2021 price forecasts.The price forecasts used in the Sproule and ERCE reports are available on the website of Sproule (sproule.com) and are contained in the AIF. These price forecasts are as at December 31  2021 and may not be reflective of current and future forecast commodity prices.The reserves life index (RLI) is calculated by dividing the 2P reserves of 270 MMboe as at December 31  2021  by the mid-point of the 2022 production guidance of 46 000 to 48 000 boepd.The product types comprising the 2P reserves and contingent resources described in this press release are contained in the AIF. See also “Supplemental Information regarding Product Types” below. Light  medium and heavy crude oil reserves/resources disclosed in this press release include solution gas and other by-products.""2P reserves"" means proved plus probable reserves. ""Proved reserves"" are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves. ""Probable reserves"" are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.Each of the reserves categories reported (proved and probable) may be divided into developed and undeveloped categories. “Developed reserves” are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells and installed facilities or  if facilities have not been installed  that would involve a low expenditure (for example  when compared to the cost of drilling a well) to put the reserves on production. The developed category may be subdivided into producing and non-producing. “Developed producing reserves” are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate. These reserves may be currently producing or  if shut-in  they must have previously been on production  and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty. “Developed non-producing reserves” are those reserves that either have not been on production  or have previously been on production  but are shut-in  and the date of resumption of production is unknown. “Undeveloped reserves” are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure (for example  when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves classification (proved  probable) to which they are assigned.Contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated  as of a given date  to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development  but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. Contingencies are conditions that must be satisfied for a portion of contingent resources to be classified as reserves that are: (a) specific to the project being evaluated; and (b) expected to be resolved within a reasonable timeframe. Contingencies may include factors such as economic  legal  environmental  political  and regulatory matters  or a lack of markets. It is also appropriate to classify as contingent resources the estimated discovered recoverable quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage. Contingent resources are further classified in accordance with the level of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub-classified based on a project maturity and/or characterized by their economic status.There are three classifications of contingent resources: low estimate  best estimate and high estimate. Best estimate is a classification of estimated resources described in the COGE Handbook as the best estimate of the quantity that will be actually recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If probabilistic methods are used  there should be at least a 50% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.Contingent resources are further classified based on project maturity. The project maturity subclasses include development pending  development on hold  development unclarified and development not viable. All of the Corporation’s contingent resources are classified as either development on hold or development unclarified. Development on hold is defined as a contingent resource where there is a reasonable chance of development  but there are major non-technical contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the control of the operator. Development unclarified is defined as a contingent resource that requires further appraisal to clarify the potential for development and has been assigned a lower chance of development until commercial considerations can be clearly defined. Chance of development is the probability of a project being commercially viable.References to ""unrisked"" contingent resources volumes means that the reported volumes of contingent resources have not been risked (or adjusted) based on chance of commerciality. In accordance with the COGE Handbook guidance for contingent resources  the chance of commerciality is solely based on the chance of development associated with resolution of all contingencies required for the re-classification of the contingent resources as reserves being resolved. Reported unrisked volumes of contingent resources do not reflect the risking (or adjustment) of such volumes based on the chance of development of such resources.The contingent resources reported in this press release are estimates only. The estimates are based upon a number of factors and assumptions each of which contains estimation error which could result in future revisions of the estimates as more technical and commercial information becomes available. The estimation factors include  but are not limited to  the mapped extent of the oil and gas accumulations  geologic characteristics of the reservoirs  and dynamic reservoir performance. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with recovery of such resources  including many factors beyond the Corporation’s control. There is uncertainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources referred to in this press release. References to “contingent resources” do not constitute  and should be distinguished from  references to “reserves”.2P reserves and contingent resources included in the reports prepared by Sproule and ERCE in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in Canada  France and Malaysia have been aggregated by IPC. Estimates of reserves  resources and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves  resources and future net revenue for all properties  due to the effects of aggregation. This press release contains estimates of the net present value of the future net revenue from IPC's reserves and contingent resources. The estimated values of future net revenue disclosed in this press release do not represent fair market value. There is no assurance that the forecast prices and cost assumptions used in the reserve and resources evaluations will be attained and variances could be material.BOEs may be misleading  particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per 1 barrel (bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1  utilizing a 6:1 conversion basis may be misleading as an indication of value.Supplemental Information regarding Product TypesThe following table is intended to provide supplemental information about the product type composition of IPC’s net average daily production figures provided in this document:Heavy Crude Oil(Mbopd) Light and Medium Crude Oil(Mbopd) Conventional Natural Gas(per day) Total(Mboepd) Three months ended March 31  2022 22.2 8.0 93.6 MMcf(15.6 Mboe) 45.8 March 31  2021 19.4 8.1 97.2 MMcf(16.2 Mboe) 43.7 Year ended December 31  2021 20.4 8.4 99.9 MMcf(16.7 Mboe) 45.5This press release also makes reference to IPC’s forecast total average daily production of 46 000 to 48 000 boepd for 2022.

4106,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/stamp-taxes-shares-manual/stsm999999,Stamp Taxes on Shares Manual,Guidance on Stamp Taxes on Shares and other Securities - Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT),The following is an alphabetical list of some of the legal terms that commonly occur in the financial securities industry and to Stamp Duty and SDRT. This edition draws on and encompasses the earlier Stamp Duty and SDRT Glossaries detailed in the Stamp Office Manual and incorporates new words and phrases that have emerged in the stock markets or have significance to SDRT.Some of the terms used in the financial world have precise meanings for some people but are generic for other individuals. This glossary should therefore be seen as a guide but not as authority. The glossary does not pretend to be comprehensive  given the huge vocabulary of the financial sector  but is intended as an aide memoir to assist with understanding.Where acronyms and other initials are used in this Glossary  they are listed in their strict alphabetical order rather than under their full name. Thus  for example  AIM will be found between ‘Agreement’ and ‘Allotment’.Suggestions for future insertions will be gratefully received and forwarded to:HMRC Stamp TaxesSDRT Technical Adviser100 Parliament StreetLondonSW1A 2BQA B C D E F G H I J L M N O P Q R S T U V W XAABSOLUTE INTERESTA full and complete right or title to  or estate in stocks and shares combining both the legal and beneficial interests.ACCOUNTABLE PERSONThe person who has statutory responsibility for the payment of SDRT to the HM Revenue & Customs.

When the document is stamped with the duty assessed upon it a further stamp is impressed which denotes that it is then ‘Adjudged duly stamped’ or ‘Adjudged Not Chargeable with any duty’. The impression of the adjudication stamp on a document is conclusive and precludes any future question being raised by Stamp Taxes or a third party as the correctness of the stamping.The adjudication process is compulsory for various claims to stamp exemption and/or relief. This includes  share purchases undertaken by recognised charities  sales of securities to intermediaries  stock lending arrangements  company acquisitions and transactions between associated companies.ADRAn American Depositary Receipt (ADR) allows US investors to own shares in non-US companies.

When a security is transformed from one ISIN code to another  CREST will automatically transform open bargains in order to create new replacement transactions in the new ISIN(s) by centrally deleting the open transaction and replacing it with a new transaction.The replacement transaction is centrally generated by CREST with Transaction Stamp Status value ‘N’ (no SDRT liability  result of automatic transformation).

Full year 2022 operating costs guidance revised at between USD 16 to 17 per boe from USD 15.2 per boe. (3)Record high operating cash flow (OCF) generation for IPC for the first quarter 2022 amounted to MUSD 145.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 has triggered a severe response from the international community that has further exacerbated the market tightness and the profound effects of this crisis are likely to be long lasting as consumers and producers alike reshape their thinking around access to resources and security of supply. Brent prices averaged over USD 100 per barrel during the first quarter of 2022  well in excess of fourth quarter 2021 Brent oil prices that averaged USD 80 per barrel.In Canada  first quarter 2022 Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude price differentials averaged below USD 15 per barrel and forward markets into 2022 and 2023 are pricing the WCS differential at below USD 14 per barrel. Completion and placement into service of Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as the positive construction progress on the TransMountain pipeline expansion project are providing a much more constructive outlook for Canadian oil market egress relative to the tightness we have witnessed over the past several years. IPC has positioned itself well to benefit from this fundamental improvement in market conditions and has hedged approximately two thirds of our WCS differential exposure at around USD 13 per barrel for the remainder of 2022. No other oil hedges are in place providing full exposure to the strength we are seeing in both the Brent and West Texas Intermediate benchmarks.Gas markets have also strengthened driven by a combination of increasing demand and a longer period of cold weather in the United States reducing storage levels. In Canada storage levels are 40% below the average level seen in the past ten years. First quarter average Empress prices were CAD 4.96 per Mcf and forward prices are the strongest IPC has witnessed at above CAD 5.00 per Mcf for the remainder of 2022. IPC has hedged AECO gas prices  33 000 Mcf per day at CAD 3.60 per Mcf in Q2 and Q3 2022.IPC benefits from a well balanced mix of production comprising approximately 50% Canadian Crude  33% Canadian Natural Gas and 17% Brent weighted oil. With synchronized strength in pricing across the entire energy complex  combined with delivering operational excellence above the high end of our first quarter forecast  IPC has again been able to deliver our best ever quarterly financial performance since our launch in 2017.We were very pleased to complete IPC’s first USD 300 million bond issuance on February 1  2022  accessing the debt capital markets at a favourable time. We used a portion of the proceeds of the bond to fully repay and cancel our existing reserve-based lending facilities. We strongly believe that the winners in the next phase of the energy transition in the upstream oil and gas industry will be the companies able to access diverse sources of funding. Whilst we do not have an imminent acquisition  we believe that being able to demonstrate to sellers that IPC has the financial strength on its balance sheet  will enable IPC to access a greater universe of opportunities whilst differentiating us from our peers in terms of certainty of being able to close transactions.We have created significant value from acquisition for all of our stakeholders having concluded four acquisitions in the past four years and will remain opportunistic in our approach with respect to further M&A activity focusing on securing additional high quality resources  as well as maturing our significant contingent resource base in excess of 1.4 billion barrels.First Quarter 2022 HighlightsDuring the first quarter of 2022  our assets delivered average net production of 45 800 boepd  above our high end guidance. This was made possible by the very high uptime performance across all our assets as well as higher than forecast gas production at Suffield in Canada due to the milder winter conditions reducing the impact of freeze offs. Full year 2022 production guidance of 46 000 to 48 000 boepd is retained.Our operating costs per boe for the first quarter of 2022 was USD 17.7  USD 0.5 per boe above guidance and largely driven by higher gas prices for our Onion Lake thermal project and higher energy costs. The fact that we produce more than three times the volume of gas than we consume means that the positive revenue impact is more than three times the negative cost impact of higher gas prices. We are increasing our full year operating cost guidance from USD 15.2 per boe to USD 16 to 17 per boe to account for the increase we have seen in gas and energy prices.Operating cash flow (OCF) generation for the first quarter of 2022 was USD 145 million  a record high for IPC. Full year 2022 OCF guidance is being increased from USD 360 to 635 million to USD 430 to 635 million assuming average Brent oil prices of USD 70 to 100 per barrel for the remainder of 2022.Capital and decommissioning expenditure for the first quarter of 2022 was USD 40 million. Full year 2022 capital and decommissioning expenditure guidance is retained at USD 127 million.Free cash flow (FCF) generation was exceptionally strong at USD 96 million during the first quarter of 2022  a record quarterly result for IPC. Full year 2022 FCF guidance is being increased from USD 205 to 480 million to USD 275 to 480 million assuming average Brent oil prices of USD 70 to 100 per barrel for the remainder of 2022. This represents between 19% and 33% of IPC’s current market capitalization.(4)Net debt has reduced to USD 42 million by the end of the first quarter of 2022. During April 2022  IPC moved into a net cash position.IPC forecasts cumulative FCF for 2022 to 2026 of approximately USD 900 to 1 800 million (based on forecast Brent oil prices of USD 65 to 95 per barrel) generating estimated average annual FCF yield over the five year period of between 12% and 24%.(4)Capital Allocation PlansWe were also pleased to announce IPC’s 2022 capital allocation plans at our 2022 CMD. IPC plans to distribute to shareholders up to 40% of the FCF generated by IPC above achieved average Brent oil prices of USD 55 per barrel  provided that IPC’s net debt to EBITDA ratio is at or below 1 time.Share Repurchase ProgramsNormal Course Issuer BidIPC implemented the current share repurchase program/normal course issuer bid (NCIB) in December 2021. This program permits IPC to buy-back up to approximately 11.1 million shares  or approximately 7% of the total outstanding IPC shares at the time of launch  over the 12-month period up to December 2022. To date  IPC has purchased and cancelled approximately 4.4 million IPC shares under the program  or approximately 40% of the annual NCIB limit  at a total purchase cost of approximately USD 29 million. The average price of IPC shares purchased to date is approximately SEK 60 per share.Substantial Issuer BidGiven the strong operational delivery during the first quarter of 2022 and robust financial outlook  IPC intends to accelerate share repurchases above the limits of the NCIB. IPC is pleased to announce that IPC intends to commence a substantial issuer bid (SIB) under which the Corporation plans to offer to purchase for cancellation from shareholders up to CAD 128 million  or approximately USD 100 million or SEK 980 million  of IPC’s outstanding common shares. IPC believes that the SIB represents an effective use of IPC’s capital and that share repurchases continue to be an efficient way to return value to IPC’s shareholders.The SIB is expected to be conducted by way of a “modified Dutch auction” which will permit shareholders to choose  within the pricing range determined by IPC  the number of shares and the price at which they wish to tender such shares  with the purchase price for all tendering shareholders being the lowest purchase price per share that will enable IPC to purchase the maximum number of shares properly tendered to the offer  up to CAD 128 million. The pricing range for the SIB is expected to be set at between CAD 12.00 to 14.00 per share  or approximately SEK 92 to 107 per share based on current foreign exchange rates  representing a range of approximately 3% discount to 13% premium over the Corporation’s volume-weighted average price on the Toronto Stock Exchange over the 10 trading days prior to May 2  2022. The offer to purchase under the SIB is expected to be open for 35 calendar days from commencement of the SIB  unless varied  extended or withdrawn by IPC. IPC intends to suspend share repurchases under the NCIB until after the expiration of the SIB.At the minimum and maximum purchase price of the expected pricing range of CAD 12.00 to CAD 14.00  the offer to purchase under the SIB would be for up to between 10.7 million common shares (approximately 7.1% of shares currently outstanding) and 9.1 million common shares (approximately 6.1% of shares currently outstanding)  respectively. As of May 3  2022  150 966 013 common shares of IPC are issued and outstanding and IPC holds no common shares in treasury.Further details relating to the SIB  including instructions for tendering shares  will be provided by IPC at the time of commencement of the SIB and will be included in the formal offer to purchase and issuer bid circular  letter of transmittal for registered shareholders  notice of guaranteed delivery for registered shareholders  tender form for shareholders holding shares through Euroclear Sweden and other related documents which will be mailed and/or made available to shareholders  and which may be filed with applicable securities regulatory authorities and made available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the Corporation’s website at www.international-petroleum.com.(5)Environmental  Social and Governance (“ESG“) PerformanceResponsible operatorship and ensuring that we adhere to the highest principles of business conduct have been an integral part of how we do business since the creation of IPC in 2017. Over the past five years  IPC has rapidly grown our business with the completion of three acquisitions in Canada  an acquisition in Malaysia in addition to significant organic investments into those businesses. In parallel  we have made a concerted effort to further develop and improve our sustainability strategy. As previously announced  IPC targets a reduction of our net GHG emissions intensity by the end of 2025 to 50% of the IPC’s 2019 baseline and the Corporation is on track to achieving that target.During the first quarter of 2022  IPC recorded no material safety or environmental incidents.”Notes:(1) See “Supplemental Information regarding Product Types” in “Disclosure of Oil and Gas Information” below.

The information was submitted for publication  through the contact persons set out above  at 07:30 CET on May 3  2022. The Corporation's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements (Financial Statements) and management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) for the three months ended March 31  2022 have been filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and are also available on the Corporation's website (www.international-petroleum.com).Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains statements and information which constitute ""forward-looking statements"" or ""forward-looking information"" (within the meaning of applicable securities legislation). Such statements and information (together  ""forward-looking statements"") relate to future events  including the Corporation's future performance  business prospects or opportunities. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release  unless otherwise indicated. IPC does not intend  and does not assume any obligation  to update these forward-looking statements  except as required by applicable laws.The Covid-19 virus and the restrictions and disruptions related to it had a material effect on the world demand for  and prices of  oil and gas as well as the market price of the shares of oil and gas companies generally. Although demand  commodity prices and share prices have recovered  there can be no assurance that these effects will not resume or that commodity prices will not decrease or remain volatile in the future. These factors are beyond the control of the Corporation and it is difficult to assess how these  and other factors  will continue to affect the Corporation and the market price of IPC’s common shares. In light of the current situation  as at the date of this press release  the Corporation continues to review and assess its business plans and assumptions regarding the business environment  as well as its estimates of future production  cash flows  operating costs and capital expenditures.All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions  expectations  beliefs  plans  projections  forecasts  guidance  budgets  objectives  assumptions or future events or performance (often  but not always  using words or phrases such as ""seek""  ""anticipate""  ""plan""  ""continue""  ""estimate""  ""expect""  ""may""  ""will""  ""project""  “forecast”  ""predict""  ""potential""  ""targeting""  ""intend""  ""could""  ""might""  ""should""  ""believe""  ""budget"" and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be ""forward-looking statements"".Forward-looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements with respect to:IPC’s ability to maximize liquidity and financial flexibility in connection with the current and any future Covid-19 outbreaks;the potential for an improved future economic environment  including resulting from a lack of capital investment and drilling in the oil and gas industry;2022 production range  operating costs and capital and decommissioning expenditure estimates;estimates of future production  cash flows  operating costs and capital expenditures that are based on IPC’s current business plans and assumptions regarding the business environment  which are subject to change;IPC’s financial and operational flexibility to continue to react to recent events and navigate the Corporation through periods of volatile commodity prices;IPC’s continued access to its credit facilities  including current financial headroom  on terms acceptable to the Corporation;the ability to fully fund future expenditures and share repurchases from cash flows and current borrowing capacity;IPC’s ability to maintain operations  production and business in light of the current and any future Covid-19 outbreaks and the restrictions and disruptions related thereto  including risks related to production delays and interruptions  changes in laws and regulations and reliance on third-party operators and infrastructure;IPC’s intention and ability to continue to implement our strategies to build long-term shareholder value;the ability of IPC’s portfolio of assets to provide a solid foundation for organic and inorganic growth;the continued facility uptime and reservoir performance in IPC’s areas of operation;future development potential of the Suffield and Ferguson operations in Canada  including the timing and success of future oil and gas drilling and optimization programs;development of the Blackrod project in Canada  including estimates of resource volumes  future production  timing  breakeven prices and net present value;current and future drilling pad production and timing and success of facility upgrades  tie-in work and infill drilling at Onion Lake Thermal;the potential improvement in the Canadian oil egress situation and IPC’s ability to benefit from any such improvements;the timing and success of the future development projects and other organic growth opportunities in France;the ability to maintain current and forecast production in France;the timing and success of the Villeperdue West development project in France;the ability of IPC to achieve and maintain current and forecast production in Malaysia;the success of the drilling of the A15 sidetrack well and of the production well pump rate optimization project in Malaysia;the commencement  timing  completion and results of the substantial issuer bid (SIB);the ability of IPC to acquire common shares under the SIB or further common shares under the NCIB  including the timing of any such purchases;the return of value to IPC’s shareholders as a result of the SIB or the NCIB;the ability of IPC to implement future shareholder distributions in addition to the SIB and the NCIB;IPC’s ability to implement its GHG emissions intensity and climate strategies and to achieve its net GHG emissions intensity reduction targets;estimates of reserves and contingent resources;the ability to generate free cash flows and use that cash to repay debt;IPC’s ability to identify and complete future acquisitions; andfuture drilling and other exploration and development activities.Statements relating to ""reserves"" and ""contingent resources"" are also deemed to be forward-looking statements  as they involve the implied assessment  based on certain estimates and assumptions  that the reserves and resources described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and that the reserves and resources can be profitably produced in the future. Ultimate recovery of reserves or resources is based on forecasts of future results  estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management.The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by IPC  including expectations and assumptions concerning: prevailing commodity prices and currency exchange rates; applicable royalty rates and tax laws; interest rates; future well production rates and reserve and contingent resource volumes; operating costs; the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals; the performance of existing wells; the success obtained in drilling new wells; anticipated timing and results of capital expenditures; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities; the timing  location and extent of future drilling operations; the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions; the benefits of acquisitions; the state of the economy and the exploration and production business in the jurisdictions in which IPC operates and globally; the availability and cost of financing  labour and services; and the ability to market crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids successfully.Although IPC believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are based are reasonable  undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because IPC can give no assurances that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions  by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks.These include  but are not limited to:the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development  exploration and production;delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures;the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to reserves  resources  production  revenues  costs and expenses;health  safety and environmental risks;commodity price fluctuations;interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations;marketing and transportation;loss of markets;environmental and climate-related risks;competition;incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions;failure to complete or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or dispositions;the ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources;failure to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; andchanges in legislation  including but not limited to tax laws  royalties  environmental and abandonment regulations.Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.Additional information on these and other factors that could affect IPC  or its operations or financial results  are included in the MD&A (See ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" and “Reserves and Resources Advisory” therein)  the Corporation's Annual Information Form (AIF) for the year ended December 31  2021 (See ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information""  ""Reserves and Resources Advisory"" and "" Risk Factors"" therein) and other reports on file with applicable securities regulatory authorities  including previous financial reports  management’s discussion and analysis and material change reports  which may be accessed through the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com) or IPC's website (www.international-petroleum.com).The current and any future Covid-19 outbreaks may increase IPC’s exposure to  and magnitude of  each of the risks and uncertainties identified above that result from a reduction in demand for oil and gas consumption  lower commodity prices  reliance on third parties  operational risks and costs and changes in government regulation. The extent to which Covid-19 impacts IPC’s business  results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments  which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict  including  but not limited to  the duration and spread of the current and any future Covid-19 outbreaks  their severity  the actions taken to contain such outbreaks or treat their impact  and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume and their impacts to IPC’s business  results of operations and financial condition which could be more significant in upcoming periods as compared with previous periods. Even after the Covid-19 outbreaks have subsided  IPC may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to IPC’s business as a result of the global economic impact.Non-IFRS MeasuresReferences are made in this press release to ""operating cash flow"" (OCF)  “free cash flow” (FCF)  ""Earnings Before Interest  Tax  Depreciation and Amortization"" (EBITDA)  ""operating costs"" and ""net debt""/”net cash”  which are not generally accepted accounting measures under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and  therefore  may not be comparable with similar measures presented by other public companies. Non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.The Corporation uses non-IFRS measures to provide investors with supplemental measures to assess the cash generated by and the financial performance and position of the Corporation. Management also uses non-IFRS measures internally in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period  prepare annual operating budgets and assess the Corporation’s ability to meet its future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes these non-IFRS measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they highlight trends in the core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management believes such measures allow for assessment of the Corporation’s operating performance and financial condition on a basis that is more consistent and comparable between reporting periods. The Corporation also believes that securities analysts  investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of presenting information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future and readers are cautioned that such statements may not be appropriate for other purposes.The definition and reconciliation of each non-IFRS measure is presented in IPC's MD&A (See ""Non-IFRS Measures"" therein).Estimated free cash flow generation is based on IPC’s current business plans over the period of 2022 to 2026. Assumptions include average net production of approximately 47 Mboepd  average Brent oil prices of USD 65 to 95 per boe escalating by 2% per year  average gas prices of CAD 3.00 per thousand cubic feet  and average Brent to Western Canadian Select differentials as estimated by IPC’s independent reserves evaluator and as further described in the AIF. IPC’s current business plans and assumptions  and the business environment  are subject to change. Actual results may differ materially from forward-looking estimates and forecasts.Disclosure of Oil and Gas InformationThis press release contains references to estimates of gross and net reserves and resources attributed to the Corporation's oil and gas assets. Gross reserves / resources are the working interest (operating or non-operating) share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty interests. Net reserves / resources are the working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of royalty obligations  plus royalty interests in reserves/resources  and in respect of PSCs in Malaysia  adjusted for cost and profit oil. Unless otherwise indicated  reserves / resource volumes are presented on a gross basis.Reserve estimates  contingent resource estimates and estimates of future net revenue in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in Canada are effective as of December 31  2021  and are included in the reports prepared by Sproule Associates Limited (Sproule)  an independent qualified reserves evaluator  in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (NI 51-101) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (the COGE Handbook) and using Sproule’s December 31  2021 price forecasts.Reserve estimates  contingent resource estimates and estimates of future net revenue in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in France and Malaysia are effective as of December 31  2021  and are included in the report prepared by ERC Equipoise Ltd. (ERCE)  an independent qualified reserves auditor  in accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE Handbook  and using Sproule’s December 31  2021 price forecasts.The price forecasts used in the Sproule and ERCE reports are available on the website of Sproule (sproule.com) and are contained in the AIF. These price forecasts are as at December 31  2021 and may not be reflective of current and future forecast commodity prices.The reserves life index (RLI) is calculated by dividing the 2P reserves of 270 MMboe as at December 31  2021  by the mid-point of the 2022 production guidance of 46 000 to 48 000 boepd.The product types comprising the 2P reserves and contingent resources described in this press release are contained in the AIF. See also “Supplemental Information regarding Product Types” below. Light  medium and heavy crude oil reserves/resources disclosed in this press release include solution gas and other by-products.""2P reserves"" means proved plus probable reserves. ""Proved reserves"" are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves. ""Probable reserves"" are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.Each of the reserves categories reported (proved and probable) may be divided into developed and undeveloped categories. “Developed reserves” are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells and installed facilities or  if facilities have not been installed  that would involve a low expenditure (for example  when compared to the cost of drilling a well) to put the reserves on production. The developed category may be subdivided into producing and non-producing. “Developed producing reserves” are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate. These reserves may be currently producing or  if shut-in  they must have previously been on production  and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty. “Developed non-producing reserves” are those reserves that either have not been on production  or have previously been on production  but are shut-in  and the date of resumption of production is unknown. “Undeveloped reserves” are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure (for example  when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves classification (proved  probable) to which they are assigned.Contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated  as of a given date  to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development  but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. Contingencies are conditions that must be satisfied for a portion of contingent resources to be classified as reserves that are: (a) specific to the project being evaluated; and (b) expected to be resolved within a reasonable timeframe. Contingencies may include factors such as economic  legal  environmental  political  and regulatory matters  or a lack of markets. It is also appropriate to classify as contingent resources the estimated discovered recoverable quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage. Contingent resources are further classified in accordance with the level of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub-classified based on a project maturity and/or characterized by their economic status.There are three classifications of contingent resources: low estimate  best estimate and high estimate. Best estimate is a classification of estimated resources described in the COGE Handbook as the best estimate of the quantity that will be actually recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If probabilistic methods are used  there should be at least a 50% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.Contingent resources are further classified based on project maturity. The project maturity subclasses include development pending  development on hold  development unclarified and development not viable. All of the Corporation’s contingent resources are classified as either development on hold or development unclarified. Development on hold is defined as a contingent resource where there is a reasonable chance of development  but there are major non-technical contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the control of the operator. Development unclarified is defined as a contingent resource that requires further appraisal to clarify the potential for development and has been assigned a lower chance of development until commercial considerations can be clearly defined. Chance of development is the probability of a project being commercially viable.References to ""unrisked"" contingent resources volumes means that the reported volumes of contingent resources have not been risked (or adjusted) based on chance of commerciality. In accordance with the COGE Handbook guidance for contingent resources  the chance of commerciality is solely based on the chance of development associated with resolution of all contingencies required for the re-classification of the contingent resources as reserves being resolved. Reported unrisked volumes of contingent resources do not reflect the risking (or adjustment) of such volumes based on the chance of development of such resources.The contingent resources reported in this press release are estimates only. The estimates are based upon a number of factors and assumptions each of which contains estimation error which could result in future revisions of the estimates as more technical and commercial information becomes available. The estimation factors include  but are not limited to  the mapped extent of the oil and gas accumulations  geologic characteristics of the reservoirs  and dynamic reservoir performance. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with recovery of such resources  including many factors beyond the Corporation’s control. There is uncertainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources referred to in this press release. References to “contingent resources” do not constitute  and should be distinguished from  references to “reserves”.2P reserves and contingent resources included in the reports prepared by Sproule and ERCE in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in Canada  France and Malaysia have been aggregated by IPC. Estimates of reserves  resources and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves  resources and future net revenue for all properties  due to the effects of aggregation. This press release contains estimates of the net present value of the future net revenue from IPC's reserves and contingent resources. The estimated values of future net revenue disclosed in this press release do not represent fair market value. There is no assurance that the forecast prices and cost assumptions used in the reserve and resources evaluations will be attained and variances could be material.BOEs may be misleading  particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per 1 barrel (bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1  utilizing a 6:1 conversion basis may be misleading as an indication of value.Supplemental Information regarding Product TypesThe following table is intended to provide supplemental information about the product type composition of IPC’s net average daily production figures provided in this document:Heavy Crude Oil(Mbopd) Light and Medium CrudeOil (Mbopd) Conventional Natural Gas(per day) Total(Mboepd) Three months ended March 31  2022 22.2 8.0 93.6 MMcf(15.6 Mboe) 45.8 March 31  2021 19.4 8.1 97.2 MMcf(16.2 Mboe) 43.7 Year ended December 31  2021 20.4 8.4 99.9 MMcf(16.7 Mboe) 45.5This press release also makes reference to IPC’s forecast total average daily production of 46 000 to 48 000 boepd for 2022. IPC estimates that approximately 46% of that production will be comprised of heavy oil  approximately 21% will be comprised of light and medium crude oil and approximately 33% will be comprised of conventional natural gas.CurrencyAll dollar amounts in this press release are expressed in United States dollars  except where otherwise noted.

More than 75 officers are taking part in the action  he said.Morgan Stanley confirmed that its premises were targeted and said the investigation relates to a “historic activity” and that the bank is “continuing to cooperate with the German authorities.”Prosecutors in Cologne are probing about 1 500 people from the financial industry and are ramping up the pressure on international banks. They raided Barclays Plc’s Frankfurt offices in March days after Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch premises were hit.Cum-Ex was a trading strategy that siphoned off at least 10 billion euros ($10.5 billion) in government revenue. Named for the Latin term for “With-Without ” the deals took advantage of German tax laws that seemed to allow multiple investors to claim refunds of a tax on dividends that was paid only once. The nation moved to abolish the practice in 2012.While dating back to more than a decade ago  the Cum-Ex scandal is still roiling the industry. Deutsche Bank AG is another major lender facing its repercussions. An influential advisory firm recommended over the weekend that company shareholders shouldn’t sign off on management’s actions for the past year  citing Cum-Ex as one of the reasons.Germany’s top court last week backed the retroactive application of laws to make sure the government can seize funds banks and other players involved in the scandal pocketed in the trades.Story continuesMorgan Stanley  next to a long list of other global investment banks  was mentioned as an alleged short seller in these deals in a search warrant Cologne prosecutors obtained in 2019 to raid Deutsche Boerse AG’s Clearstream unit.In the first indictment issued by Cologne prosecutors in the probe the same year  the bank is mentioned as a possible lender of shares needed to do the trades.(Updates with Morgan Stanley possble role in last paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.02,0.12,0.86,mixed,0.05,0.15,0.79,True,English,"['Tax Fraud Investigation', 'Morgan Stanley', 'Frankfurt', 'other global investment banks', 'influential advisory firm', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'Merrill Lynch premises', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Deutsche Bank AG', 'controversial Cum-Ex scandal', 'German tax laws', 'other players', 'international banks', 'funds banks', 'German prosecutors', 'Frankfurt offices', 'Morgan Stanley', 'tax payers', 'two suspects', 'related strategies', 'historic activity', 'Barclays Plc', 'March days', 'America Corp.', 'trading strategy', 'Latin term', 'multiple investors', 'major lender', 'company shareholders', 'past year', 'top court', 'retroactive application', 'long list', 'short seller', 'search warrant', 'Clearstream unit', 'first indictment', 'possible lender', 'possble role', 'last paragraph', 'German authorities', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Cologne prosecutors', 'financial industry', '10 billion euros', 'government revenue', 'wider probe', 'raid', 'part', 'billions', 'homes', 'spokesman', 'More', '75 officers', 'action', 'investigation', '1,500 people', 'pressure', 'deals', 'advantage', 'refunds', 'dividends', 'practice', 'repercussions', 'weekend', 'management', 'reasons', 'Germany', 'trades', 'Story', 'shares', 'Updates']",2022-05-03,2022-05-03,finance.yahoo.com

Using the on/off switch  the Jolt Switch provides amplification when it is needed in real time or bypasses amplification when a TV channel does not need it. When in use  the Jolt Switch increases TV signals to deliver clearer picture and sound  and can even broaden access to channels beyond the antenna’s standard range.This new version of the USB in-line amplifier has a higher gain of 18 dB  is compatible with most TV antennas  and later this year will be included with several other Antennas Direct and Mohu antenna models.One of the antennas to include the Jolt Switch is the new ClearStream HORIZON antenna. This amplified indoor HDTV antenna is engineered to receive TV signals 60 miles away from broadcast towers. The ClearStream HORIZON offers a minimalistic design and installs like a soundbar  either mounted on a wall or placed on a flat surface using its included kickstand. It costs $79.99 and is available for purchase today from Antennas Direct. This product will become more widely available on other ecommerce platforms next month.“The cord-cutting movement isn’t letting up as Americans ditch their cable packages in droves for more affordable  user-friendly options.

More than 75 officers are taking part in the action  he said.Morgan Stanley confirmed that its premises were targeted and said the investigation relates to a “historic activity” and that the bank is “continuing to cooperate with the German authorities.”Prosecutors in Cologne are probing about 1 500 people from the financial industry and are ramping up the pressure on international banks. They raided Barclays Plc’s Frankfurt offices in March days after Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch premises were hit.Cum-Ex was a trading strategy that siphoned off at least 10 billion euros ($10.5 billion) in government revenue. Named for the Latin term for “With-Without ” the deals took advantage of German tax laws that seemed to allow multiple investors to claim refunds of a tax on dividends that was paid only once. The nation moved to abolish the practice in 2012.While dating back to more than a decade ago  the Cum-Ex scandal is still roiling the industry. Deutsche Bank AG is another major lender facing its repercussions. An influential advisory firm recommended over the weekend that company shareholders shouldn’t sign off on management’s actions for the past year  citing Cum-Ex as one of the reasons.Germany’s top court last week backed the retroactive application of laws to make sure the government can seize funds banks and other players involved in the scandal pocketed in the trades.Story continuesMorgan Stanley  next to a long list of other global investment banks  was mentioned as an alleged short seller in these deals in a search warrant Cologne prosecutors obtained in 2019 to raid Deutsche Boerse AG’s Clearstream unit.In the first indictment issued by Cologne prosecutors in the probe the same year  the bank is mentioned as a possible lender of shares needed to do the trades.(Updates with Morgan Stanley possble role in last paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.02,0.12,0.86,mixed,0.05,0.15,0.79,True,English,"['Tax Fraud Investigation', 'Morgan Stanley', 'Frankfurt', 'other global investment banks', 'influential advisory firm', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'Merrill Lynch premises', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Deutsche Bank AG', 'controversial Cum-Ex scandal', 'German tax laws', 'other players', 'international banks', 'funds banks', 'German prosecutors', 'Frankfurt offices', 'Morgan Stanley', 'tax payers', 'two suspects', 'related strategies', 'historic activity', 'Barclays Plc', 'March days', 'America Corp.', 'trading strategy', 'Latin term', 'multiple investors', 'major lender', 'company shareholders', 'past year', 'top court', 'retroactive application', 'long list', 'short seller', 'search warrant', 'Clearstream unit', 'first indictment', 'possible lender', 'possble role', 'last paragraph', 'German authorities', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Cologne prosecutors', 'financial industry', '10 billion euros', 'government revenue', 'wider probe', 'raid', 'part', 'billions', 'homes', 'spokesman', 'More', '75 officers', 'action', 'investigation', '1,500 people', 'pressure', 'deals', 'advantage', 'refunds', 'dividends', 'practice', 'repercussions', 'weekend', 'management', 'reasons', 'Germany', 'trades', 'Story', 'shares', 'Updates']",2022-05-03,2022-05-03,finance.yahoo.com

4130,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/221061/etf-april-round-up-natural-gas-funds-dominate.aspx,ETF April Round-up: Natural Gas Funds Dominate,10 hours ago,The best performing exchange traded product (ETP) in April was the WisdomTree Natural Gas ETC (NGAS)  which gained more than 34 percentage points for the month. The European gas market is in turmoil after Moscow decided to cut off supplies to Bulgaria and Poland  pushing up prices strongly.As pointed out by Morningstar Germany editor Antje Schiffer  Europe's gas storage facilities were emptier than usual this winter given the time of year  even before the Russian attack on Ukraine. Fear has ruled the market since February 24. Investors are anxious that Europe will add gas to its list of sanctions  or that Russia will simply turn off the gas supply across the continent.Another direct consequence of the war is the rise in the prices of agricultural commodities  particularly soybeans  of which Russia is a major producer. Sanctions on Russia are playing a role in several harvesting regions  including major producers as Argentina  Brazil and Paraguay  where a shortage of diesel is impacting harvesting and truck transport between the fields and the ports. Only five months ago the US Department of Agriculture was still forecasting that global soybean producers would grow a surplus of 5 million tons. Now  this has been revised to a deficit of 2 million tons.Finally  among the best performers of the month there were two trackers of the VIX index  also known as the “fear gauge”. This tracks the S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll Index  a benchmark that offers exposure to the expected implied volatility of the S&P 500  and that it is typically used by investors to measure market risk  fear and stress.The LaggardsETFs exposed to digital assets  as blockchain or cryptocurrencies suffered heavily in April. 21Shares Fantom ETP (AFTM) was the biggest detractor within the ETFs universe  shedding 35%. This fund  launched on March 16  is designed to give investors a way to invest in the Fantom token that powers the Fantom blockchain  a platform for DeFi (decentralised finance)  dApps (decentralised apps) and enterprise applications.April was a difficult month for the crypto world  with sell-offs across the board. Ignoring stablecoins  the token that fell the least in April was BNB (Binance coin). The crypto  which is used as both BNB Chain’s native currency and as an exchange coin on Binance  fell almost 13% for the month.ETFs exposed to e-commerce and Chinese equity also suffered.Russian equity ETFs are suspended from trading until further notice  although this decision was not taken simultaneously by all European stock exchanges. The SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich  for example  froze them on March 8  four days later than Euronext  Borsa Italiana  Deutsche Boerse and the London Stock Exchange.While waiting to find out the fate of these strategies  this puts the question of greater harmonisation of the European ETF market back on the table. Issuers themselves may even decide to stop offering them through a liquidation – many institutional and private clients might no longer want to hold Russia  either from an ESG perspective or to comply with sanctions.The Biggest ETFsBelow is a overview of the biggest European-domiciled ETPs in terms of assets  which could be more appropriate to consider among core holdings.

Targeting RGD-binding integrins is known to affect multiple disease hallmarks such as vascular leakage  inflammation  angiogenesis and fibrosis. The preclinical study investigated the therapeutic potential of THR-687  a potent pan-RGD integrin antagonist  in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes rat model.Following STZ-induced diabetes  different doses of THR-687 (6.7  16.7 or 75 µg/eye) or its vehicle were administered via 3 consecutive intravitreal injections in both eyes (with 1-week interval  n=7 rats/group). Untreated  non-diabetic rats served as controls (n=5 rats). At 4 weeks after diabetes-induction  the effect of THR-687 was investigated by histological analysis for retinal vascular leakage (using the tracer FITC-BSA)  for inflammatory cell activation (Iba1 immunoreactivity) and Müller cell gliosis (vimentin immunoreactivity). Statistical analysis was performed with a one-way analysis of variance using a Bonferroni multiple comparison test.Story continuesThe updated data shows:THR-687 reduced diabetes-induced increases in retinal permeability versus vehicle in a dose-dependent manner. The highest dose (75 µg/eye) completely prevented vascular leakage (p<0.001) while the mid dose (16.7 µg/eye) significantly decreased this pathology by 34 ± 21% (p<0.05) and the low dose (6.7 µg/eye) had no effect.All doses of THR-687 also significantly reduced the number of inflammatory cells  as compared to vehicle. Indeed  a reduction of 57 ± 12% was seen after administration of the highest dose (p<0.01)  a decrease of 43 ± 19% for the mid dose (p<0.05) and the low dose induced a reduction of 51 ± 13% (p<0.05).The highest dose of THR-687 also reduced the diabetes-induced increase in vimentin expression within the Müller cells back to baseline (p<0.05 versus vehicle)  whereas no significant differences following injections of the mid or low dose were observed.RGD-integrin antagonism using THR-687 potently inhibits vascular permeability  inflammation and gliosis induced by STZ in the diabetic rat retina. Given its broad mode of action  THR-687 is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of vision-threatening retinal pathologies and is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial in DME patients (INTEGRAL - NCT05063734).A copy of the ARVO presentation is available under Conferences and Events within the Investors section of the Company’s website.Oxurion is currently evaluating THR-687 in a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial (“INTEGRAL”) in patients with DME. Part A dose optimization data from the INTEGRAL trial is anticipated this quarter. If successful  the efficacy and safety of THR-687 versus aflibercept (the current standard of care) will be evaluated in Part B of the INTEGRAL Phase 2 clinical trial in both treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients with DME with data expected in the second half of 2023.About OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is a biopharmaceutical company developing next generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies  which are designed to better improve and preserve vision in patients with retinal vascular disorders including diabetic macular edema (DME)  the leading cause of vision loss in diabetic patients worldwide as well as other conditions  including wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (ME-RVO). Oxurion is aiming to build a leading global franchise in the treatment of retinal vascular disorders based on the successful development of its two novel therapeutics. THR-149 is a potent plasma kallikrein inhibitor being developed as a potential new standard of care for the up to 50% of DME patients showing suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy. THR-687 is a highly selective pan-RGD integrin antagonist that is being developed as a potential first line therapy for DME patients as well as wet AMD and potentially ME-RVO. Oxurion is headquartered in Leuven  Belgium  with corporate operations in Boston  MA.

This approval is the first of its kind in Europe for this uncommon condition  with limited treatment options currently available should patients progress after prior use of systemic therapy.Jaume Capdevila  M.D. PhD  Medical Oncologist at the Vall d´Hebron University Hospital and Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO)  Barcelona  and a trial investigator  said  “ The nature of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer means that this condition does not respond to the most commonly used standard of care for differentiated thyroid cancer. As a result  people living with this form of the disease have had limited treatment options should their disease progress. I am pleased to see the entrance of a new innovative treatment in Cabometyx  following limited progress for patients in this area for such a significant amount of time and I look forward to sharing more positive conversations with my patients on the number of options available to them.”The EC approval was based on results from the pivotal COSMIC-311 Phase III trial  which at a planned interim analysis  confirmed that the trial had met the primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS)  demonstrating a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by 78% versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.22; 96% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.36; P<0.0001) at a median follow-up of 6.2 months.1 The other primary endpoint  the objective response rate  also favored Cabometyx with 15% vs. 0% for placebo (p=0.028) at a median follow-up of 8.9 months  but did not meet the criteria for statistical significance.1 Given the efficacy and safety demonstrated within this analysis  the independent data monitoring committee recommended to stop enrolment and unblind sites and patients. The final results  at a median follow-up of 10.1 months  were then presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2021  whereby Cabometyx continued to demonstrate superior median PFS of 11.0 months versus 1.9 months with placebo and a maintained reduction in the risk of disease progression or death of 78% versus placebo ([HR]: 0.22  96% [CI]: 0.15-0.32; p<0.0001). These new analyses also demonstrated that superior efficacy was maintained with Cabometyx irrespective of previous vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-targeted therapy  supporting flexible sequencing decisions for physicians. The safety profile identified in the COSMIC-311 trial across the two analyses was consistent with that previously observed for Cabometyx and adverse events were managed with dose modifications.1 2Steven Hildemann  M.D. PhD  Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Head of Global Medical Affairs and Global Patient Safety at Ipsen  said  “ Confirmation of the approval of Cabometyx for this difficult-to-treat cancer is welcome news for patients and treating physicians. We are delighted that the European Commission has recognized the strength of the COSMIC-311 data and the possibilities that Cabometyx can deliver for people living with radioactive-iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. We are committed to researching areas of oncology with high unmet medical needs and this decision exemplifies our ambition to bring meaningful new treatments that have the potential to make tangible differences to people’s lives.”This EC approval follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval announced by Exelixis in September 2021 of Cabometyx for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic DTC that has progressed following prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible.Ipsen wishes to thank the patients and investigators involved in the COSMIC-311 clinical trial.About radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAI-R DTC)In 2020  over 580 000 new cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed worldwide.3 Thyroid cancer is the ninth most commonly occurring cancer globally and incidence is three times higher in women than in men  with the disease representing 1 in every 20 cancers diagnosed among women.4 While cancerous thyroid tumors include differentiated  medullary and anaplastic forms  differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) makes up about 90 to 95% of cases.5 6 These include papillary  follicular and Hürthle cell cancer.3 4 DTC is typically treated with surgery  followed by ablation of the remaining thyroid tissue with radioactive iodine (RAI)  but approximately 5 to 15% of cases are resistant to RAI treatment.7 Patients who develop RAI-R DTC have a poor prognosis with an average estimated survival of three to five years.8About the COSMIC-311 trialCOSMIC-311 is a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial that enrolled 258 patients at 164 sites globally.1 2 Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Cabometyx 60 mg or placebo once-daily.1 The primary endpoints were progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population as well as objective response rate in the first 100 randomly assigned patients (objective response rate intention-to-treat [OITT] population)  both evaluated by a blinded independent radiology committee. Additional endpoints include safety  overall survival and quality of life.1 Exelixis is the sponsor of the COSMIC-311 trial  and Ipsen is co-funding the trial.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ""believes""  ""anticipates"" and ""expects"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons and also taking into consideration assessment delays of certain clinical trials in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances  new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

This collaboration has been reinforced with their mutual involvement in the DesCartes program led by the CNRS in Singapore  the CREATE-ID international research chair  and through the ESI - ENSAM virtual engineering laboratory.This open-source approach has many advantages. First  it allows the community to use the software in an optimal and fast way  thus  enabling the scientific community to benefit from new functionalities adapted to the requirements of each user  as well as from security improvements. Secondly  through its approach  ESI Group wishes to offer an opportunity to benefit from a software whose reliability has been proven over the years by its customers in various industries  including Automotive and Aeronautics. “Inspector” will continue to evolve and adapt to the needs of the community thanks to the collaboration of the numerous stakeholders.Several industry players and “Inspector” users have expressed interest and support for ESI Group's initiative to deploy its data analysis software in open source. This is the case  for example  with CNS.Stephane Perrin  Managing Director of CNS states: ""The decision taken by ESI Group is a great illustration of the Group’s dedication to the innovation and scientific ecosystem with its cutting-edge technologies. At CNS  a Network and Security expertise company  we are mobilized to ensure the future of Inspector. In addition to integrating Inspector into our continuous network auditing software suite  we will also soon offer support for the software via our business unit dedicated to innovative solutions.""Emmanuel Leroy  EVP Product  Innovation & Industry Solutions at ESI Group said: ""Data and open source are the two main keywords of this new coordinated action with ENSAM. We are delighted to be able to take our collaboration a step further while contributing to academic and industrial research and innovation. ""Inspector"" will provide users with a tool for analyzing large volumes of data to optimize the performance of manufacturing processes. In a period where data is becoming key but remains expensive; I am convinced that this open-source release will open opportunities for industrial players  whether they are large companies or startups.""Information on how to obtain the Inspector download and installation linksThe ""Inspector"" module can be retrieved as an archive (674MB) with the following command: sftp inspector@jibleo.com:source_code/inendi-inspector_opensource_export_2022-01-27.tgz.The password associated with the SFTP account ""inspector"" is ""ut!iep2E"" and the checksum sha256 of the archive is d0404dd13c80ec8a4e32f406986731025881097ed03fa47a4af77827744f1000The location of the Gitlab project from which the export was made is the following: https://gitlab.com/inendi/inspectorThe software can now be installed with the following command (as indicated in the documentation on the Gitlab project homepage): flatpak install --user -y https://inendi.gitlab.io/inspector/install.flatpakrefAbout ESI GroupFounded in 1973  ESI Group is a leading innovator in Virtual Prototyping solutions and a global enabler of industrial transformation.

4153,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/letter-shareholders-061300652.html,Letter to our shareholders,Paris  May 3  2022 Dear Fellow Shareholder  Ipsos is engaged in a new and successful transformation to reinforce our worldwide leadership while strengthening...,"IPSOSParis  May 3  2022Dear Fellow Shareholder Ipsos is engaged in a new and successful transformation to reinforce our worldwide leadership while strengthening our governance with the support of our shareholders. Our strong set of results (FY results 2021 and 2022 First Quarter results) clearly demonstrates we are creating value and delivering for our shareholders.Our progress is now threatened by both:An ill-conceived and unnecessary attempt by a small minority of shareholders to nominate a candidate to the Board of Directors  without any prior dialogue or attempt to engage in our standing nomination process; andA fundamental misunderstanding from ISS of our governance and remuneration processes.We strongly recommend you vote AGAINST Resolution A at the Combined General Meeting on May 17.We strongly recommend you vote FOR items 12  15  16  17  20 at the Combined General Meeting on May 17.Over the past 24 months  Ipsos has executed its strategy to partner more closely with its clients so they can act faster  smarter and bolder. The results are clear:Our share price at a 20 years high above 45 euros and with strong consensus from analysts;2021 revenue growth of 17.9%  and 10.4% compared with 2019;Operating Margin at 12 9% in 2021  which has gained 300 basis points since two years and which is foreseen to remain above 12%;A higher generation of Free Cash Flows  which has led to an historical low net debt and therefore provides the financial resources for: a more aggressive acquisition policy  an increased dividend at 1.15 euros per share  and an additional buyback programme (on top of the recurring one of 1% of capital per year in order to limit the dilution of our free share programme).Alongside our demonstrated track record of performance  Ipsos has taken decisive steps to strengthen its governance processes  notably by separating the functions of Chairman and CEO.Last September  the Board appointed Ben Page as Ipsos’s Chief Executive Officer  effective November 15. Over the last 12 years  he had grown very successfully Ipsos in the UK and Ireland. Under his leadership  Ipsos has already built on its progress  and Mr. Page and his team are preparing a comprehensive discussion of management’s strategy called “Best People and Best Technologies” for further growth and value creation at our Investor Day on June 14 (which you are of course invited to attend).The Board has been renewed significantly over the course of the past five years  through a transparent process guaranteeing the appointment of the most qualified  independent board members. This process is run by a nomination committee  fully composed and chaired by independent directors.Story continuesAs a result  the majority of this year’s Board nominees have joined the Company over the past five years. That includes two new independent directors proposed for election to the Board this year - Pierre Barnabé and Virginie Calmels (who are bringing strong skills in media and technology and whose experiences are described in Appendix 1).Our proposed Board is also well-balanced  in terms of gender (50%)  skill sets  experience  diversity  nationalities (25% non-French) and meets the definition of independence in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF code (the corporate governance code of reference for French publicly traded companies).At 50%  our gender balance on the Board also serves a valuable purpose for our investors since that fact is a critical contributor to our inclusion in key CSR-related indices and rankings. We do not recommend going backwards  having a lower ratio and losing this quality and balance  with the inclusion of the proposed additional candidate  potentially leading to a 13-member Board and only 45% of women. Having 50% of women at our Board has been a key ESG initiatives at Ipsos among others which are described in Appendix 2.Up until last week and their discussions with the minority shareholders  it is worth noting that no proxy advisor had raised any concerns about IPSOS’s governance and about its directors or their independence. As a group  we are very committed to these values  and we are committed to the quality of our relationship with our shareholders.Therefore  we would like to draw your attention to some of the proposed resolutions  and more specifically:- Resolution A  shared by a small minority of shareholders to nominate a candidate to the Board of Directors: We strongly recommend you vote AGAINST.The minority shareholders’ proposal would undermine the progress outlined above. The individual proposed for nomination has no demonstrated understanding of our company and sector  appears to have no prior experience as a corporate officer or executive of a listed company  and did not seek to be selected by the Board’s open and transparent process  which seeks to select candidates on the basis of their skills and after meeting with them. Far from benefitting the company  this nomination would only destabilize the business and the progress we have made. It may also undermine our recently appointed new management and new CEO  at a time where the team is delivering good results and developing momentum in the marketplace that is also reflected in the stock price.The minority shareholders’ approach has also been confrontational and not reflective of an investor wanting the best for all shareholders and the company: after sending their request without any notice  they rejected dialogue with Ipsos for two weeks. A meeting was finally held yesterday  May 2nd  where they refused to explain why they believed such an adversarial approach was appropriate  or how that would serve the company’s interest.- Say-on-pay resolutions (items 12  15  16  17  20).We strongly recommend you vote FOR items 12  15  16  17  20 at the Combined General Meeting on May 17.The compensation granted to the executive managers are among the lowest of the SBF120  and Mr. Truchot’s package to reflect the conclusion of his role as Chief Executive Officer was entirely consistent with the strict implementation of the compensation policy  approved by an overwhelming 94% of our shareholders last year – and supported by several proxy advisors.Ipsos considers that the pay-out is objectively benchmarked and reflects full alignment with the performance of the company and shareholders’ interests.All of our compensation decisions are taken by our Compensation Committee that is comprised of independent directors and an employee representative appointed by the Unions  which qualifies it under the AFEP-MEDEF code as 100% independent.It is clear Ipsos is on the right path. Ipsos is creating value for all its shareholders. The fairness of the Resolution 12 about Mr Didier Truchot compensation is further supported by details given in Appendix 3.We hope this letter provides clarification and reassurance about Ipsos’s perspectives and current trajectory and are looking forward to sharing more about Ipsos on May 17th – in the meantime  do not hesitate to contact us should you have any questions on any resolution or the preparation for the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting.Our Chairman of the Board  Our CEO and the Chair of our Nomination Committee  as well as our Investor Relations team are available for any conference calls.Yours sincerely The Board of DirectorsAppendices:- Message of the Chairman dated 19 April about the two independent Directors proposed to the Shareholders - Ipsos ESG initiatives - Resolution 12: further explanations on Chairman and CEO compensation for 2021 - Composition of the Board as at February 1st  2022Appendix 1Message of the Chairman of the Board in the Convening Notice dated 19 April 2022about the two independent Directors proposed to the ShareholdersDear Shareholder We are delighted to invite you to attend the Ipsos Combined General Shareholders’ Meeting to be held at 9:30 am (CET) on May 17  2022 at Ipsos' registered office located 35 rue du Val de Marne in Paris (75013).In 2021  as the covid-19 pandemic continued  your Company's revenues reached a record level of EUR 2 146.7 million and it recorded an organic growth of 17.9%. Operating profit continued to rise and debt fell sharply thanks to excellent free cash flow generation. This extremely solid performance is the result of the good Momentum started in mid-2018 with the launch of the T.U.P. (Total Understanding Project) transformation plan  which had received strong commitment from our employees. Today  it is reflected in the increased confidence of our clients thanks to the adapted and digital solutions that we have been able to make available to them rapidly.2021 was also a year of managerial transition between the Chairman and CEO and founder of Ipsos  Mr. Didier Truchot  and the new CEO  Mr. Ben Page  whom our Board of Directors has chosen to appoint as of 15 November 2021. Ben Page has been with Ipsos since 2005  when the British research company MORI  specialized in social and public opinion research  was acquired by our Company. He was one of the main managers of the company. Under his leadership since 2009  Ipsos MORI has tripled its revenues and has become a major reference in its market. In 2021  Ipsos MORI accounted for nearly 20% of the group's revenues and more than 20% of its operating income.The Board of Directors is convinced that information  when obtained  analyzed and communicated with rigor and clarity by our professionals  is the best ally of the decision makers we support. Their talent combined with the development of our technology platforms allows us to be confident in our ability to maintain profitable growth over the long term.As you will see from the draft resolutions and information published on the Ipsos website  you will be asked to approve 35 resolutions this year  including 23 ordinary resolutions. These resolutions are presented in detail in the report of the Board of Directors to the General Shareholders’ Meeting.We would also like to draw your attention to some of the proposed resolutions  and more specifically the ones concerning:- The ratification of the co-optation by the Board of Directors of Mr. Ben Page  Chief Executive Officer  on October 4  2021  as director (resolution 5);- The ratification of the co-optation on January 12  2022 and the appointment of Mr. Pierre Barnabé as an independent director (resolutions 6 and 7);- The appointment of Mrs. Virginie Calmels as a new independent director (resolution 9) as from the date of the General Meeting.We propose a new balanced composition of the Board of Directors with 12 members  which will include 50% independent directors as required by law  and 50% women. If we take into account the mandate of Mr. Patrick Artus  whom we have reclassified as ""non-independent"" this year solely because of his participation in our Board for more than 12 years  the proportion of external directors is 60%. With regard to the two new terms of office as independent directors submitted for approval at this Meeting  namely those of Virginie Calmels and Pierre Barnabé  we wish to emphasize the important contributions of these individuals.Mrs. Virginie Calmels is President of CV Education  a higher education group specializing in the creative industries and digital marketing  which opened the first FUTURAe school in Boulogne-Billancourt in October 2020. 3 Virginie Calmels is a graduate of the Ecole Supérieure de Commerce de Toulouse and the Insead and also holds a degree in accounting and finance and a diploma in public accounting and auditing. In addition to her significant expertise in financial management  Virginie Calmels has extensive knowledge of digital marketing and is therefore particularly sensitive to Ipsos' business. She therefore has all the skills required to be appointed as an independent director of the Company  as she is or has been an independent director of other listed companies in the TMT sector (Iliad  Assystem  Technicolor). She is also involved in charitable activities which are at the heart of Ipsos' ESG policy.Mr. Pierre Barnabé is a recognized specialist in the technology world. He currently heads the Big Data and Cybersecurity division of Atos and will become CEO of Soitec on May 1. Previously  he was CEO of Alcatel-Lucent France and then Deputy CEO of Bull. He is ranked 16th in The Consulting Report's 50 Leaders in Cybersecurity (October 2021 ranking). Pierre Barnabé is “Chevalier de l'Ordre national du Mérite”. He has been appointed Director of Inria (Institut National de l'Informatique et de l'Automatique) since 2020 and was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Ensimag engineering school in June 2021. He has all the skills required to be appointed as an independent director of the Company and to contribute to the future technological choices of the Ipsos group. We hope these resolutions will meet with your approval. *** We hope you will find this letter helpful  and we would like to thank you for your interest in Ipsos and your backing for all our resolutions.Please do not hesitate to contact us should you have any questions on any resolution or the preparation for the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting. Yours sincerely Didier Truchot Chairman of the Board of DirectorsAppendix 2Ipsos ESG initiativesOur ESG initiatives are described in details in the section 5.4.1 of our 2021 Annual/Universal Registration Document. Report.In this context  our commitment to sustainable development has been continued and reinforced. Our 2021-2023 CSR roadmap  adopted in February 2021  reflects this commitment:We have set ourselves a target of carbon neutrality by 2035 - five years ahead of the 2040 deadline set by the international community.Our commitment to society is reflected in our commitment to ensuring that the diversity of our teams reflects the diversity of the societies in which we operate; we have continued to increase the proportion of women among our senior managers so that by 2021 we had 35% women and we are committed to reaching 40% by 2023.Our key sustainability targets will continue to be set and monitored by the Board of Directors. Under the leadership of our new CEO Ben Page  Ipsos will continue to develop its roadmap around three pillars: People  Society and Planet.The internal climate surveys carried out regularly demonstrate a higher level of commitment than that of other companies in the service sector and which has increased in recent years  which is explained by the pride of the teams in working in a company whose societal and environmental are recognized.In terms of gender equality and from the point of view of the equity ratio (gap between the executive's salary and the median of employees  which is one of the lowest in the SBF120)  Ipsos considers itself to be ahead.Mrs. Laurence Stoclet  Deputy CEO and Group CFO  had also been invited on October 25  2021 to speak publicly on these subjects  during a round table organized on the occasion of the publication of the “Palmarès de la féminisation” of SBF120 companies’ Boards  sponsored by the Ministry for Equality between Women and Men  Diversity and Equal Opportunities.It is therefore crucial to keep 50% women on our Board of Directors.Another example of our ESG initiatives  Ipsos was the first market research and opinion polling company in the world  in 2008  to join the UN Global Compact and  since then  has been involved in numerous RES initiatives  including actions in favor of Refugees and  through its Foundation created in 2014  in favor of the education of underprivileged children.In 2021  92% of the paper used by Ipsos was recycled.Appendix 3Resolution 12: further explanations on Chairman and CEO compensationfor 2021The Remuneration policy for the Chairman and CEO was described in section 13.1.2 of the 2020 Annual Report/2020 Universal Registration Document (URD) was submitted to the vote of the Shareholders under Resolution 10 at the AGM of May 27th  2021:All the major proxy agencies (Glass Lewis  ISS  Proxinvest) recommended to vote in favor of Resolution 10.The Resolution 10 was consequently adopted at 94.2% at the AGM.It is only logical for it to be considered as due to Mr Didier Truchot as this remuneration policy was very precise and transparent. In particular  about the reasons for the Indemnity in case of cessation of duties:Extract from 2020 URD  section 13.1.2 Compensation of Chairman and CEO13.1.2.7 Termination BenefitsIn the event of the dismissal or termination as the Chairman and CEO  the latter would receive a payment equal to twice his gross compensation received in the calendar year prior to him leaving office. Payment is subject to the following performance condition: Revenue for one of the three years prior to the year of dismissal must be higher  at constant exchange rates  than that of the preceding year. This payment therefore presupposes a progression assessed over at least two financial years  meaning no payment in the event of proven failure by the executive in the last years of his term of office. For reference  this commitment was authorized by the General Shareholders’ Meeting  most recently upon reappointment of the Chairman and CEO at the General Shareholders’ Meeting of April 28  2016 under the procedure for related-party agreements applicable by reference to former Article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code (now repealed). With the coming into force of the new Say on Pay regime at end-2019  termination benefits are no longer dealt with in this way and are now covered by the new regime.The payment of the compensation is not ruled out in the event that the beneficiary retires in the near future. It should be noted that the Chairman and CEO does not have a supplementary pension scheme from Ipsos  or any other statutory or contractual severance payment  as he does not have an employment contract. It is thus justified and in the Company’s best interests that the Ipsos founding executive who devoted almost all of his career to the company’s expansion should be able to benefit from this payment.13.1.2.8 Supplementary pension schemeThere is no supplementary pension scheme for the Chairman and CEO (or for the other Ipsos SA executive officers); more specifically  there is no top-hat pension scheme.As a matter of fact  Mr Didier Truchot benefits from no defined contribution  complementary pension schemes  401K  or other deferred schemes which are normally available to all employees and which are available to most CEOs of listed companies in France (where standard state pensions are a fraction of past compensation) or abroad where having specific pensions schemes are the rule for all Companies.This is why this indemnity for end of service/duty  whatever was the circumstance or cause  was approved by the Shareholders. It is only fair according to the Board that Mr Didier Truchot receives it. It would be totally illogical and inconsistent not to reconfirm this approval.In addition  the Board draws the attention of the Shareholders to the fact that the Board did not grant Mr Didier Truchot any Performance Free Shares related to the fiscal years 2020 and 2021. The standard remuneration policy for the CEO voted by the Shareholders includes a Performance Free Shares programme which is calling for an allocation of maximum 0 03% of capital (13.330 shares) per year  valued at approximately 400 keuros in 2021.In relation with the fiscal years 2020 and 2021  Mr Didier Truchot did not get those Free Shares allocations.Instead the Board decided to grant him the approved Indemnity for termination of duties as Chairman and CEO so that Mr Didier Truchot receives a fair compensation for the excellent performance of Ipsos in 2020 and in 2021.Mr Didier Truchot  Chairman and CEO compensation (in 2021 : until 14 November 2021) 2020 2021 Average 2 years Amounts due Amounts due Fixed compensation 489 810 437 395 463 602 Annual variable compensation 168 300 345 975 257 138 Annual grant of Performance Shares 0 0 0 Indemnity for termination of duties (1) - 1 081 672 530 836 Compensation allocated for the term of office as Director on the Board 0 0 0 Benefits in kind 0 0 0 Pensions/ Defined contributions / 401 K /… 0 0 0 Total 658 110 1 865 042 1 261 576This indemnity for termination of duties represents less than 2 years of normal compensation as the calculation is based on cash compensation amounts received in 2020  at the time of pandemic  where there was no salary increase and on the contrary a cut of 20% of compensation for 3 months.No other item was received or awarded (multi-annual variable compensation  benefits in kind  compensation for sitting on the Board  severance and/or non-compete payments  supplementary pension scheme).In addition  the benchmark of CEO compensations shows that Mr Didier Truchot compensation for 2020 and 2021 is one of the lowest of SBF120 and Next 80. It is also clearly lower than the compensation of other CEOs of listed market research companies (in average over the two years  his compensation was 10 times lower than one of Ipsos US competitors and half of the one of a UK competitor).In terms of ESG governance  it is to be noted that the Equity Ratio (difference between CEO package and the mean of all employees) is only at X15 and is one of the lowest in the market research industry worldwide and among all worldwide listed companies.The Board of DirectorsAppendix 4Ipsos Board of Directors as at February 1st  2022Nom Gender Nationality Independent Director Appointment and Compensation Committee Audit Committee CSR Committee Didier Truchot – Chairman of the Board of Directors M French NO Ben Page – CEO M British NO Laurence Stoclet – Deputy CEO and Chief Financial Officer F French NO Jennifer Hubber – Chief Client Officer F British NO M Patrick Artus1 M French NO M Pierre Barnabé M French YES M Anne Marion-Bouchacourt F French YES CC Eliane Rouyer-Chevalier F French YES M Filippo Pietro Lo Franco M Italian YES CC Florence von Erb F French YES CC André Lewitcki – Employee representative M French - M Sylvie Mayou – Employee representative F French - M Independence Rate 50% 100 % 66.66 % 50 % Percentage of women 50%Note 1:Patrick Artus was reclassified from ""independent director"" to ""non-independent"" during 2021 because his term of office had exceeded 12 years; without this reclassification  the independence rate would have been 60%.Directors representing employees  designated by the Unions (Force Ouvrière and CFE-CGC) are not included in the calculation of the Board's independence rate  in compliance with the article 8.3 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code to which Ipsos refers.CC = Commitee Chairman / M = MemberABOUT IPSOSIpsos is one of the largest market research and polling companies globally  operating in 90 markets and employing over 18 000 people.Our passionately curious research professionals  analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions  opinions and motivations of citizens  consumers  patients  customers or employees.

Subsequent to March 31  2022  we acquired or were under contract to acquire eleven self-storage facilities with 0.9 million net rentable square feet  for $147.2 million.Completed various expansion projects with 0.1 million net rentable square feet costing $19.4 million. At March 31  2022  we had various facilities in development and expansion with 4.8 million net rentable square feet estimated to cost $833.8 million.Raised $250 million in a public offering of our preferred shares.Operating Results for the Three Months Ended March 31  2022For the three months ended March 31  2022  net income allocable to our common shareholders was $464.1 million or $2.63 per diluted common share  compared to $385.8 million or $2.21 per diluted common share in 2021  representing an increase of $78.3 million or $0.42 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $167.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (ii) our $23.6 million equity share of gains on sale of real estate recorded by PS Business Parks  Inc. (""PSB"") in 2022  partially offset by (iii) a $75.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  (iv) a $17.9 million increase in interest expense  (v) a $10.0 million decrease in foreign currency exchange gains associated with our Euro denominated notes payable  and (vi) a $9.4 million gain on sale of real estate recognized in the three months ended March 31  2021.The $167.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the three months ended March 31  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 is a result of a $95.6 million increase in our Same Store Facilities and a $71.7 million increase in our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 15.8% or $102.1 million in the three months ended March 31  2022 as compared to 2021  due primarily to higher realized annual rent per available square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 3.6% or $6.5 million in the three months ended March 31  2022 as compared to 2021  due primarily to (i) a 4.8% ($3.2 million) increase in property tax expense  (ii) a 19.0% ($2.5 million) increase in repairs and maintenance expense  and (iii) a 17.5% ($2.3 million) increase in centralized management costs  partially offset by (iv) a 23.1% ($3.4 million) decrease in marketing expenses. The increase in net operating income of $71.7 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Funds from OperationsFor the three months ended March 31  2022  funds from operations (“FFO”) was $3.83 per diluted common share as compared to $3.08 in the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 24.4%. FFO is a non-GAAP measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and generally represents net income before depreciation and amortization expense  gains and losses and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets. A reconciliation of GAAP diluted net income per share to FFO per share  and additional descriptive information regarding this non-GAAP measure  is attached.We also present “Core FFO” and “Core FFO per share ” non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing  with respect to the periods presented below  our equity share of the impact of severance of senior executive and casualties from our equity investees. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance  and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However  Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such measures  Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.The following table reconciles FFO per share to Core FFO per share and FFO to Core FFO  respectively (unaudited):Three Months Ended March 31  2022 2021 Percentage Change (Amounts in thousands  except per share data) Reconciliation of FFO per Share to Core FFO per Share: FFO per share $ 3.83 $ 3.08 24.4 % Eliminate the per share impact of items excluded from Core FFO  including our equity share from investments: Foreign currency exchange gain (0.20 ) (0.26 ) Other items 0.02 — Core FFO per share $ 3.65 $ 2.82 29.4 % Reconciliation of FFO to Core FFO: FFO allocable to common shares $ 676 204 $ 539 254 25.4 % Eliminate the impact of items excluded from Core FFO  including our equity share from investments: Foreign currency exchange gain (35 377 ) (45 385 ) Other items 2 547 (349 ) Core FFO allocable to common shares $ 643 374 $ 493 520 30.4 % Diluted weighted average common shares 176 336 174 840 Core FFO per share $ 3.65 $ 2.82 29.4 %Property Operations – Same Store FacilitiesThe Same Store Facilities consist of facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy  revenues  and cost of operations since January 1  2020. The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2020  2021  and 2022 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities  which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. However  because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such a measure  Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2 282 facilities (149.5 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 75% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at March 31  2022 (unaudited):Three Months Ended March 31  2022 2021 Percentage Change (Dollar amounts in thousands  except for per square foot data) Revenues (a): Rental income $ 725 433 $ 627 153 15.7% Late charges and administrative fees 23 837 20 047 18.9% Total revenues 749 270 647 200 15.8% Direct cost of operations (a): Property taxes 70 004 66 782 4.8% On-site property manager payroll 30 700 28 744 6.8% Repairs and maintenance (f) 15 490 13 021 19.0% Utilities 11 446 10 796 6.0% Marketing 11 240 14 610 (23.1) % Other direct property costs 20 066 18 364 9.3% Total direct cost of operations 158 946 152 317 4.4% Direct net operating income (b) 590 324 494 883 19.3% Indirect cost of operations (a): Supervisory payroll (9 567) (10 330) (7.4) % Centralized management costs (15 557) (13 237) 17.5% Share-based compensation (3 859) (5 535) (30.3) % Net operating income (c) $ 561 341 $ 465 781 20.5% Gross margin (before indirect costs  depreciation and amortization expense) 78.8% 76.5% 3.0% Gross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense) 74.9% 72.0% 4.0% Weighted average for the period: Square foot occupancy 95.6% 95.6% —% Realized annual rental income per (d): Occupied square foot $ 20.29 $ 17.54 15.7% Available square foot $ 19.40 $ 16.78 15.6% At March 31: Square foot occupancy 95.1% 95.9% (0.8) % Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (e) $ 20.84 $ 17.97 16.0%(a) Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sales and expenses generated at the facilities. (b) Direct net operating income (“Direct NOI”)  a subtotal within NOI  is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll  centralized management costs  and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense. We utilize direct net operating income in evaluating property performance and in evaluating property operating trends as compared to our competitors. (c) See attached reconciliation of self-storage NOI to net income. (d) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency  and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition  the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts  which reduce rental income. (e) Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in  and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis  such as late charges and administrative fees  does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts  and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible. (f) Repairs and maintenance expense includes snow removal costs totaling $3.3 million and $2.0 million in the three months ended March 31  2022 and 2021  respectively.Property Operations – Non-Same Store FacilitiesIn addition to the 2 282 Same Store Facilities  we have 515 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies  revenues  or cost of operations since January 1  2020 or that we did not own as of January 1  2020  including 304 facilities that were acquired  54 newly developed facilities  91 facilities that have been expanded or are targeted for expansion  and 66 facilities that are unstabilized because they are under fill-up or were damaged in casualty events (collectively  the “Non-Same Store Facilities”). Operating data  metrics  and further commentary with respect to these facilities  including detail by vintage  are included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under “Analysis of Net Income - Self-Storage Operations” in our March 31  2022 Form 10-Q.Investing and Capital ActivitiesDuring the three months ended March 31  2022  we acquired ten self-storage facilities (three in Texas and one each in Arizona  Indiana  Maryland  Minnesota  North Carolina  Nevada  and Pennsylvania) with 0.8 million net rentable square feet for $127.7 million.Subsequent to March 31  2022  we acquired or were under contract to acquire eleven self-storage facilities across nine states with 0.9 million net rentable square feet  for $147.2 million.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 48 properties (4.1 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of ezStorage for $1.8 billion  which includes 47 self-storage facilities and a property that is under construction. These facilities generated revenues of $24.0 million  NOI of $18.6 million (including Direct NOI of $19.4 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 88.0% for the three months ended March 31  2022.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 56 properties (7.5 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of All Storage for $1.5 billion  with 55 properties closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and one property closed in February 2022. These facilities generated revenues of $16.8 million  NOI of $10.5 million (including Direct NOI of $11.2 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 77.3% for the three months ended March 31  2022.During the three months ended March 31  2022  we completed various expansion projects (0.1 million net rentable square feet) costing $19.4 million. At March 31  2022  we had various facilities in development (2.2 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $406.1 million and various expansion projects (2.6 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $427.7 million. Our aggregate 4.8 million net rentable square foot pipeline of development and expansion facilities includes 1.2 million in California  0.6 million in Florida  0.5 million in Texas  0.4 million in Maryland  0.3 million each in New Jersey and Washington  0.2 million each in Hawaii  Michigan  Nevada and New York  and 0.7 million in other states. The remaining $496.2 million of development costs for these projects is expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months.On January 13  2022  we issued our 4.100% Series S Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $250.0 million.On April 24  2022  PSB entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") whereby affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate (""Blackstone"") will acquire all outstanding shares of PSB's common stock for $187.50 per share in cash. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement  each share of PSB common stock and each common unit of partnership interest will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $187.50  without interest. If the transaction is consummated  we expect to (i) receive approximately $2.7 billion of cash proceeds in exchange for the approximate 41% common equity interest we hold in PSB  (ii) recognize an approximate $2.2 billion gain on the sale of our equity investment in PSB in the Consolidated Statement of Income  and (iii) distribute a $2.3 billion estimated tax gain on the sale to our common shareholders. The merger transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2022  however  the merger transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including approval by PSB’s common stockholders. Pursuant to a support agreement entered into with PSB and Blackstone  we have committed to vote our equity interests in favor of the transaction  subject to certain conditions. Following consummation of the transaction  our future operating results will no longer reflect contributions from our investment in PSB. For the three months ended March 31  2022 and 2021  our share of earnings from PSB contributed $25.5 million and $24.2 million  respectively  to Core FFO.Distributions DeclaredOn April 28  2022  our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $2.00 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on June 30  2022 to shareholders of record as of June 15  2022.Outlook for the Year Ending December 31  2022The following table outlines the Company’s Core FFO per share estimate and certain underlying assumptions for the year ending December 31  2022  excluding estimates for the impact of the potential sale of our investment in PSB pursuant to PSB's merger agreement with Blackstone:Guidance Ranges for 2022 Low High (Amounts in thousands  except per share data) Same Store: Revenue growth 12.00% 15.00% Expense growth 6.00% 8.00% Net operating income growth 13.40% 18.00% Acquisitions $1 000 000 Development openings $250 000 Non-Same Store net operating income $430 000 $470 000 Ancillary net operating income $150 000 $155 000 General and administrative expense $105 000 $111 000 Interest expense $152 000 $160 000 Preferred dividends $195 000 Capital expenditures $300 000 Core FFO per share $14.75 $15.65 Incremental Non-Same Store NOI to stabilization (2023 and beyond) $180 000Forward-looking Core FFO per share measures exclude estimates for the impact of (i) potential sale of our investment in PSB pursuant to PSB's merger agreement with Blackstone  (ii) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (iii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iv) certain other significant non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items such as loss contingency accruals  casualties  transactional due diligence  and advisory costs. Public Storage is unable to provide a reconciliation of Core FFO per share guidance measures to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future U.S. GAAP results.First Quarter Conference CallA conference call is scheduled for May 4  2022 at 9:00 a.m. (PDT) to discuss the first quarter earnings results.

with the non-GAAP measure FAD  are considered helpful measures of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts. FFO represents GAAP net income before depreciation and amortization  real estate gains or losses and impairment charges  which are excluded because they are based upon historical costs and assume that building values diminish ratably over time  while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FAD represents FFO adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges and to deduct capital expenditures. We utilize FAD in evaluating our ongoing cash flow available for investment  debt repayment and common distributions. We believe investors and analysts utilize FAD in a similar manner. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share.

It has developed layers of control to protect money and power and has segmented into national jurisdictions with centralised trading hubs  such as the NYSE or EuroNext.This highly regulated  insular world was ripped up with the coming of crypto oligarchic corporations that have been replaced by a truly globalised  decentralised  free market.In traditional financial markets  there are gatekeepers such as banks  stock exchanges  clearinghouses  brokers  etc.  who are interested in controlling who can and can’t trade and even what assets can be traded. Get on the wrong side of your government  and you can quickly lose access to your money when assets are held centrally. Even crypto centralised exchanges (CEXs) have the same issue  maintaining and clearing balances off a central database.The layers of control in markets also lead to inaccuracies and inefficiencies. The overrating of the creditworthiness of CDOs directly led to the 2007-8 global crash  for example. With few nodes in the system  one failure point can become catastrophic  and the concentrated power can cause the price divergence and inefficiencies when regulators take opposing stances.These traditional financial structures have also led to oligopolies – vast institutions begin to gatekeep market access with significant fees charged to access the market. The advent of Neo Brokers is somewhat changing this  but not fast enough.Many of these issues are resolved through decentralised finance (DeFi). Using the power of blockchain technology  many barriers to entry in traditional markets have been broken – anyone can trade crypto without concern for their nationality or status; they just need an internet connection. Assets remain in the hands of the owner within DeFi  meaning what you own can’t be seized following a change in regulation  for example.The pure economic incentive is the market driver rather than national regulators. Without brokers  there are no gatekeepers  and there are no bottlenecks of control – even if an exchange were to fail  for example  the whole infrastructure of DeFi would remain and keep the system together. Power is inherently unable to be concentrated in one place  meaning there is less chance of a significant failure  and oligopolies are no longer possible.No market can be perfect  and there are indeed flaws in DeFi that need to be resolved. Two of the primary functions of a prime brokerage are margin trading and automated trade execution. A desire from traders to remain anonymous coupled with a highly volatile crypto market is a disincentive for lenders to offer capital for margin trading.Automated actions like stop-loss and or limit orders need new triggers in DeFi; they traditionally are generated by the backend of prime broker systems. Another limitation with DeFi technology is the lack of interoperability between some decentralised exchanges (DEXs).Functionality on the frontend also causes friction with DeFi tools. Developers in the space tend to focus on the performance and pay less attention to the overall user interface and experience. This is an intangible barrier to entry for many people.To fully replicate the positive elements of traditional finance in the DeFi space  a new tool is needed  and it comes in the form of Primex Finance. The game-changing aspect of the protocol is the introduction of margin trading for risk-assessed traders.Borrowers can access funds through lending pools  known in the system as credit buckets  and trade across a range of DEXs. The lenders who fund these credit buckets can choose one that suits their risk profile and earn interest from trading profits  knowing that they will liquidate overly risky trader positions to secure their assets. The anonymity demanded by traders is no longer an issue when their risk profile is regularly scored. Primex also uses Keeper Nodes which allow for automated trading – these two innovations together negate the need for prime brokers.Allowing for cross-DEX trading with the protocol also removes that issue from the conversation. A trader can borrow assets through a credit bucket  open a position on one DEX  and close it on another.A digital-native  truly democratic financial system that’s decentralised  borderless  and distributed is the direct route of travel. While traditional financial institutions aren’t going anywhere soon  there will be more space taken up by DeFi solutions.By introducing margin trading  risk management  and DEX-agnosticism  Primex is at the forefront of the move to the mainstream for DeFi.,neutral,0.04,0.91,0.05,negative,0.02,0.11,0.87,True,English,"['Primex Finance', 'trading barriers', 'blockchain', 'globalised, decentralised, free market', 'regulated, insular world', '2007-8 global crash', 'pure economic incentive', 'overall user interface', 'traditional financial structures', 'crypto oligarchic corporations', 'automated trade execution', 'prime broker systems', 'centralised trading hubs', 'traditional financial institutions', 'risky trader positions', 'crypto centralised exchanges', 'one failure point', 'volatile crypto market', 'traditional financial markets', 'democratic financial system', 'decentralised exchanges', 'traditional markets', 'vast institutions', 'significant failure', 'automated trading', 'decentralised finance', 'traditional finance', 'stock exchanges', 'one place', 'prime brokerage', 'Automated actions', 'one DEX', 'diversified market', 'market driver', 'margin trading', 'trading profits', 'DEX trading', 'oldest industries', 'many products', 'national jurisdictions', 'wrong side', 'central database', 'price divergence', 'opposing stances', 'significant fees', 'blockchain technology', 'many barriers', 'internet connection', 'less chance', 'primary functions', 'limit orders', 'new triggers', 'less attention', 'intangible barrier', 'many people', 'positive elements', 'new tool', 'game-changing aspect', 'lending pools', 'credit buckets', 'risk profile', 'two innovations', 'direct route', 'risk management', 'prime brokers', 'market access', 'Neo Brokers', 'national regulators', 'Keeper Nodes', 'DeFi technology', 'DeFi tools', 'DeFi solutions', 'same issue', 'risk-assessed traders', 'concentrated power', 'Primex Finance', 'DeFi space', 'Spotlight', 'services', 'layers', 'control', 'money', 'NYSE', 'EuroNext', 'coming', 'gatekeepers', 'banks', 'clearinghouses', 'assets', 'government', 'CEXs', 'balances', 'inaccuracies', 'inefficiencies', 'overrating', 'creditworthiness', 'CDOs', 'example', 'oligopolies', 'advent', 'issues', 'entry', 'concern', 'nationality', 'status', 'hands', 'owner', 'regulation', 'bottlenecks', 'infrastructure', 'flaws', 'desire', 'disincentive', 'lenders', 'capital', 'stop-loss', 'backend', 'limitation', 'lack', 'interoperability', 'DEXs', 'Functionality', 'frontend', 'friction', 'Developers', 'performance', 'experience', 'protocol', 'introduction', 'Borrowers', 'funds', 'range', 'interest', 'anonymity', 'need', 'cross', 'conversation', 'travel', 'DEX-agnosticism', 'forefront', 'move', 'mainstream']",2022-05-02,2022-05-03,economictimes.indiatimes.com

4158,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/stamp-taxes-shares-manual/stsm999999,Stamp Taxes on Shares Manual,Guidance on Stamp Taxes on Shares and other Securities - Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT),The following is an alphabetical list of some of the legal terms that commonly occur in the financial securities industry and to Stamp Duty and SDRT. This edition draws on and encompasses the earlier Stamp Duty and SDRT Glossaries detailed in the Stamp Office Manual and incorporates new words and phrases that have emerged in the stock markets or have significance to SDRT.Some of the terms used in the financial world have precise meanings for some people but are generic for other individuals. This glossary should therefore be seen as a guide but not as authority. The glossary does not pretend to be comprehensive  given the huge vocabulary of the financial sector  but is intended as an aide memoir to assist with understanding.Where acronyms and other initials are used in this Glossary  they are listed in their strict alphabetical order rather than under their full name. Thus  for example  AIM will be found between ‘Agreement’ and ‘Allotment’.Suggestions for future insertions will be gratefully received and forwarded to:HMRC Stamp TaxesSDRT Technical Adviser100 Parliament StreetLondonSW1A 2BQA B C D E F G H I J L M N O P Q R S T U V W XAABSOLUTE INTERESTA full and complete right or title to  or estate in stocks and shares combining both the legal and beneficial interests.ACCOUNTABLE PERSONThe person who has statutory responsibility for the payment of SDRT to the HM Revenue & Customs. The accountable person is distinguishable from the liable person  who will normally be the person acquiring the chargeable security.ACCOUNT STATUS ‘A’In CREST  a member or participant account set up account status ‘A’ is the default for the payment of SDRT at the rate of 0.5% on securities purchased.ACCOUNT STATUS ‘C’In CREST  a member or participant account set up account status ‘C’ is the default for the payment of SDRT at the rate of 1.5% on securities purchased.ACCOUNT STATUS ‘Z’In CREST  a member or participant account set up with account status ‘Z’ means that no SDRT obligations arise on all purchases of UK registered securities. Such accounts include acquisitions for  and on behalf of  recognised charities.ACCUMULATION UNITSUnits in unit trusts / shares in an oeic  where income derived from investments held by the fund are ‘rolled up’ or automatically reinvested in the trust/oeic rather than being paid out to unit/shareholders as dividends. Unit/shareholders get the benefit of the dividends through a higher unit or share value.ACDThe person who operates an open-ended investment company (oeic) scheme and is responsible for investing cash contributions received from investors or dealing with surrenders of shares is called the Authorised Corporate Director (ACD). The ACD is responsible for keeping the register of the names of the holders of the oeic shares.The person who is entrusted with the custody of the investments/assets contained within an oeic on behalf of the investors is called the Trustee.ACQUISITIONThe process of one company taking over another by purchasing its assets or shares.ACTIVE MARKETA Market for a particular class of shares or stock in which there is active and regular trading.ADJUDICATIONUnder section 12 Stamp Act 1891  any person can request Stamp Taxes to express a formal opinion of the Stamp Duty charged upon executed documents and instruments of title. When the document is stamped with the duty assessed upon it a further stamp is impressed which denotes that it is then ‘Adjudged duly stamped’ or ‘Adjudged Not Chargeable with any duty’. The impression of the adjudication stamp on a document is conclusive and precludes any future question being raised by Stamp Taxes or a third party as the correctness of the stamping.The adjudication process is compulsory for various claims to stamp exemption and/or relief. This includes  share purchases undertaken by recognised charities  sales of securities to intermediaries  stock lending arrangements  company acquisitions and transactions between associated companies.ADRAn American Depositary Receipt (ADR) allows US investors to own shares in non-US companies. Denominated in dollars  ADRs can be traded in London. A depositary receipt is defined  broadly  as an instrument acknowledging that a person holds stocks or shares but that another person is entitled to rights in relation to stocks or shares of the same kind including the right to receive such securities. A depositary receipt is in effect a substitute for a company share and is issued by a bank whose business includes the issuing of receipts against the deposit of the actual shares concerned.ADSForeign stocks and shares that are issued in the U.S. and registered in the ADR system. The term ADR & ADS is often confused. In strictness  an ADS is the actual share trading  while an ADR represents a bundle of ADSs.AD VALOREMThe English translation is ‘according to value’  assessing Stamp Duty on a transfer of property as a percentage (that is 0.5% or 1.5%) of the value of.ADVISORY BROKERA broker that suggests changes to a shareholders existing portfolio or holding of securities. An advisory broker does not have the authority to execute share deals without client instruction.AGENT INDICATORUsed in CREST to indicate whether the participant is a SRO member acting as agent or principal. If a participant is acting under instructions from a client  the indicator is set to value ‘A’  denoting an agency capacity. If the CREST participant is trading directly with another CREST participant and is buying the shares onto his own book  he is acting in a principal capacity and the indicator is set to value ‘P’ (to indicate a principal share purchase). Agent indicator ‘S’ denotes that a principal is selling securities from his book to a third party.Indicator ‘N’ (not applicable) is input to show that the participant did not act in either an agent or principal capacity.AGREEMENTIncludes a legally binding contract made between two parties setting out details of actions which each is to perform and to which each has assented but goes wider.AIMThe Alternate Investment Market (AIM) is a Market designed for shares of emerging or smaller companies which cannot fulfil all the requirements of the London Stock Exchange for a full quotation listing. AIM is operated by the London Stock Exchange. There are approximately 400 companies listed on AIM.ALLOTMENTThe number of shares allotted to a subscriber of a new issue of shares.ANNUAL GENERAL MEETINGAn annual meeting called by the directors of a company to allow shareholders to stay informed and involved with Company decisions and workings.AMEXAmerican Stock Exchange.

This primarily affected Music Publishing digital  performance  and mechanical revenue. In prior years  these revenues were recognised when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue is now based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters  with a benefit for the first quarter of 2022  compared to the prior year.Music Publishing revenue also benefited from underlying organic growth trends and initial contributions from catalogue acquisitions made in prior years.Within Music Publishing  digital revenue grew 51.6% year-over-year  or 44.7% in constant currency  reflecting the continued growth of streaming and subscription  as well as the change in accounting. Performance revenue grew 19.7% year-over-year  or 16.7% in constant currency  reflecting the change in accounting. Synchronisation revenue grew 34.8% year-over-year  or 29.2% in constant currency  as a result of increased income from advertising and film.

These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance measures) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance  profitability  financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as described in this press release. In addition  it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG  thereby affecting comparability.EBITDA and EBITDA marginUMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the operating performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue. To calculate EBITDA  the accounting impact of the following items is excluded from the income from Operating Profit:i. amortization of intangible assets;ii. impairment losses on goodwill and other intangibles;iii. other income and expenses related to transactions with shareowners (except when directly recognized in equity);iv. depreciation of tangible assets including right of use assets;v. (gains)/losses on the sale of tangible assets  including right of use assets and intangible assets;vi. (income)/losses from equity affiliates;vii. restructuring expenses; andviii. other non-recurring items.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA marginThe difference between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consists of non-cash share-based compensation expenses [and certain one-time items that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity  including but not limited to professional fees and listing fees related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.

Recognition of that revenue is now based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected.

These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance measures) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance  profitability  financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as described in this press release. In addition  it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG  thereby affecting comparability.EBITDA and EBITDA marginUMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the operating performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue. To calculate EBITDA  the accounting impact of the following items is excluded from the income from Operating Profit:i. amortization of intangible assets;ii. impairment losses on goodwill and other intangibles;iii. other income and expenses related to transactions with shareowners (except when directly recognized in equity);iv. depreciation of tangible assets including right of use assets;v. (gains)/losses on the sale of tangible assets  including right of use assets and intangible assets;vi. (income)/losses from equity affiliates;vii. restructuring expenses; andviii. other non-recurring items.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA marginThe difference between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consists of non-cash share-based compensation expenses [and certain one-time items that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity  including but not limited to professional fees and listing fees related to UMG's listing on Euronext Amsterdam.

It doesn’t look like it was triggered by an event out in the world  because that news would have hit us by now ” he added.Brokers Nordnet said the sudden move was a “flash crash” that caused a brief market panic  while traders in Frankfurt and London said the outsized move might have been caused by algos going haywire or a big “fat finger” trade.A Euronext Oslo spokesperson said there was no news in the market that could explain the rapid decline.“We are looking into this as a matter of routine  there was no news in the market that could explain such a large move ” Euronext Oslo spokesperson Cathrine Segerlund said.Nasdaq said it continuously investigates price movements on its market place  and was in a dialogue with market participants over Monday’s volatility.“We currently see nothing to indicate errors in Nasdaq’s own systems ” a spokesperson for the exchange said in en e-mail.(Reporting by Stine Jacobsen and Nikolaj Skydsgaard in Copenhagen; Anna Ringstrom  Helena Soderpalm and Johan Alnader in Stockholm; Terje Solsvik in Oslo  Danilo Masoni in Milan  Sruthi Shankar in London  and Hakan Ersen in Frankfurt; editing by Gwladys Fouche),negative,0.01,0.11,0.88,negative,0.01,0.14,0.84,True,English,"['Brief crash', 'European stocks', 'holiday-thinned trading', 'The Stockholm benchmark stock index', 'Euronext Oslo spokesperson Cathrine Segerlund', 'pan-European STOXX 600 equity benchmark', 'A Euronext Oslo spokesperson', 'big “fat finger” trade', 'euro zone stocks’ volatility', 'many worried clients', 'brief market panic', 'European stocks', 'equity sales', 'erroneous trade', 'Stine Jacobsen', 'Nikolaj Skydsgaard', 'flash crash', 'trading activity', 'one point', 'Other indices', 'sudden move', '2 percentage points', 'sudden spike', 'Martin Munk', 'vice president', 'Jyske Bank', 'technical malfunction', 'outsized move', 'rapid decline', 'large move', 'price movements', 'Anna Ringstrom', 'Helena Soderpalm', 'Johan Alnader', 'Terje Solsvik', 'Danilo Masoni', 'Sruthi Shankar', 'Hakan Ersen', 'Gwladys Fouche', 'market place', 'market participants', 'two minutes', 'Brokers Nordnet', 'COPENHAGEN', 'Reuters', 'Monday', 'holiday', 'losses', '0942 GMT', 'countries', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Germany', 'Italy', 'France', 'fall', 'matter', '0758 GMT', 'closure', 'London', 'volumes', 'gauge', 'mid-March', 'something', 'event', 'world', 'news', 'traders', 'Frankfurt', 'algos', 'routine', 'Nasdaq', 'dialogue', 'errors', 'systems', 'exchange', 'mail', 'Milan']",2022-05-02,2022-05-03,wtvbam.com

This approval is the first of its kind in Europe for this uncommon condition  with limited treatment options currently available should patients progress after prior use of systemic therapy.Jaume Capdevila  M.D. PhD  Medical Oncologist at the Vall d´Hebron University Hospital and Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO)  Barcelona  and a trial investigator  said  “ The nature of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer means that this condition does not respond to the most commonly used standard of care for differentiated thyroid cancer. As a result  people living with this form of the disease have had limited treatment options should their disease progress. I am pleased to see the entrance of a new innovative treatment in Cabometyx  following limited progress for patients in this area for such a significant amount of time and I look forward to sharing more positive conversations with my patients on the number of options available to them.”The EC approval was based on results from the pivotal COSMIC-311 Phase III trial  which at a planned interim analysis  confirmed that the trial had met the primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS)  demonstrating a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by 78% versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.22; 96% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.36; P<0.0001) at a median follow-up of 6.2 months.1 The other primary endpoint  the objective response rate  also favored Cabometyx with 15% vs. 0% for placebo (p=0.028) at a median follow-up of 8.9 months  but did not meet the criteria for statistical significance.1 Given the efficacy and safety demonstrated within this analysis  the independent data monitoring committee recommended to stop enrolment and unblind sites and patients. The final results  at a median follow-up of 10.1 months  were then presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2021  whereby Cabometyx continued to demonstrate superior median PFS of 11.0 months versus 1.9 months with placebo and a maintained reduction in the risk of disease progression or death of 78% versus placebo ([HR]: 0.22  96% [CI]: 0.15-0.32; p<0.0001). These new analyses also demonstrated that superior efficacy was maintained with Cabometyx irrespective of previous vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-targeted therapy  supporting flexible sequencing decisions for physicians. The safety profile identified in the COSMIC-311 trial across the two analyses was consistent with that previously observed for Cabometyx and adverse events were managed with dose modifications.1 2Steven Hildemann  M.D. PhD  Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Head of Global Medical Affairs and Global Patient Safety at Ipsen  said  “ Confirmation of the approval of Cabometyx for this difficult-to-treat cancer is welcome news for patients and treating physicians. We are delighted that the European Commission has recognized the strength of the COSMIC-311 data and the possibilities that Cabometyx can deliver for people living with radioactive-iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. We are committed to researching areas of oncology with high unmet medical needs and this decision exemplifies our ambition to bring meaningful new treatments that have the potential to make tangible differences to people’s lives.”This EC approval follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval announced by Exelixis in September 2021 of Cabometyx for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic DTC that has progressed following prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible.Ipsen wishes to thank the patients and investigators involved in the COSMIC-311 clinical trial.About radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAI-R DTC)In 2020  over 580 000 new cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed worldwide.3 Thyroid cancer is the ninth most commonly occurring cancer globally and incidence is three times higher in women than in men  with the disease representing 1 in every 20 cancers diagnosed among women.4 While cancerous thyroid tumors include differentiated  medullary and anaplastic forms  differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) makes up about 90 to 95% of cases.5 6 These include papillary  follicular and Hürthle cell cancer.3 4 DTC is typically treated with surgery  followed by ablation of the remaining thyroid tissue with radioactive iodine (RAI)  but approximately 5 to 15% of cases are resistant to RAI treatment.7 Patients who develop RAI-R DTC have a poor prognosis with an average estimated survival of three to five years.8About the COSMIC-311 trialCOSMIC-311 is a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial that enrolled 258 patients at 164 sites globally.1 2 Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Cabometyx 60 mg or placebo once-daily.1 The primary endpoints were progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population as well as objective response rate in the first 100 randomly assigned patients (objective response rate intention-to-treat [OITT] population)  both evaluated by a blinded independent radiology committee. Additional endpoints include safety  overall survival and quality of life.1 Exelixis is the sponsor of the COSMIC-311 trial  and Ipsen is co-funding the trial.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ""believes""  ""anticipates"" and ""expects"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons and also taking into consideration assessment delays of certain clinical trials in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances  new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.
