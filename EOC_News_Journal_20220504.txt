(1)Full year 2022 average net production guidance range is retained at 46 000 to 48 000 boepd.Drilling operations on the A15 side-track well and three well pump upgrades at the Bertam field  Malaysia were completed by April 2022.Operating costs per boe of USD 17.7 for the first quarter of 2022  above the CMD guidance of USD 17.2 per boe mainly as a result of higher gas and energy prices. Full year 2022 operating costs guidance revised at between USD 16 to 17 per boe from USD 15.2 per boe. (3)Record high operating cash flow (OCF) generation for IPC for the first quarter 2022 amounted to MUSD 145. (3)Full year OCF guidance increased to between MUSD 430 to 635 (Brent USD 70 to 100 per barrel). (3)Capital and decommissioning expenditures of MUSD 40 for the first quarter of 2022  in line with CMD guidance.Record high free cash flow (FCF) generation for IPC for the first quarter of 2022 amounted to MUSD 96.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February 2022 has triggered a severe response from the international community that has further exacerbated the market tightness and the profound effects of this crisis are likely to be long lasting as consumers and producers alike reshape their thinking around access to resources and security of supply. Brent prices averaged over USD 100 per barrel during the first quarter of 2022  well in excess of fourth quarter 2021 Brent oil prices that averaged USD 80 per barrel.In Canada  first quarter 2022 Western Canadian Select (WCS) crude price differentials averaged below USD 15 per barrel and forward markets into 2022 and 2023 are pricing the WCS differential at below USD 14 per barrel. Completion and placement into service of Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement pipeline in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as the positive construction progress on the TransMountain pipeline expansion project are providing a much more constructive outlook for Canadian oil market egress relative to the tightness we have witnessed over the past several years. IPC has positioned itself well to benefit from this fundamental improvement in market conditions and has hedged approximately two thirds of our WCS differential exposure at around USD 13 per barrel for the remainder of 2022. No other oil hedges are in place providing full exposure to the strength we are seeing in both the Brent and West Texas Intermediate benchmarks.Gas markets have also strengthened driven by a combination of increasing demand and a longer period of cold weather in the United States reducing storage levels. In Canada storage levels are 40% below the average level seen in the past ten years. First quarter average Empress prices were CAD 4.96 per Mcf and forward prices are the strongest IPC has witnessed at above CAD 5.00 per Mcf for the remainder of 2022. IPC has hedged AECO gas prices  33 000 Mcf per day at CAD 3.60 per Mcf in Q2 and Q3 2022.IPC benefits from a well balanced mix of production comprising approximately 50% Canadian Crude  33% Canadian Natural Gas and 17% Brent weighted oil. With synchronized strength in pricing across the entire energy complex  combined with delivering operational excellence above the high end of our first quarter forecast  IPC has again been able to deliver our best ever quarterly financial performance since our launch in 2017.We were very pleased to complete IPC’s first USD 300 million bond issuance on February 1  2022  accessing the debt capital markets at a favourable time. We used a portion of the proceeds of the bond to fully repay and cancel our existing reserve-based lending facilities. We strongly believe that the winners in the next phase of the energy transition in the upstream oil and gas industry will be the companies able to access diverse sources of funding. Whilst we do not have an imminent acquisition  we believe that being able to demonstrate to sellers that IPC has the financial strength on its balance sheet  will enable IPC to access a greater universe of opportunities whilst differentiating us from our peers in terms of certainty of being able to close transactions.We have created significant value from acquisition for all of our stakeholders having concluded four acquisitions in the past four years and will remain opportunistic in our approach with respect to further M&A activity focusing on securing additional high quality resources  as well as maturing our significant contingent resource base in excess of 1.4 billion barrels.First Quarter 2022 HighlightsDuring the first quarter of 2022  our assets delivered average net production of 45 800 boepd  above our high end guidance. This was made possible by the very high uptime performance across all our assets as well as higher than forecast gas production at Suffield in Canada due to the milder winter conditions reducing the impact of freeze offs. Full year 2022 production guidance of 46 000 to 48 000 boepd is retained.Our operating costs per boe for the first quarter of 2022 was USD 17.7  USD 0.5 per boe above guidance and largely driven by higher gas prices for our Onion Lake thermal project and higher energy costs. The fact that we produce more than three times the volume of gas than we consume means that the positive revenue impact is more than three times the negative cost impact of higher gas prices. We are increasing our full year operating cost guidance from USD 15.2 per boe to USD 16 to 17 per boe to account for the increase we have seen in gas and energy prices.Operating cash flow (OCF) generation for the first quarter of 2022 was USD 145 million  a record high for IPC. Full year 2022 OCF guidance is being increased from USD 360 to 635 million to USD 430 to 635 million assuming average Brent oil prices of USD 70 to 100 per barrel for the remainder of 2022.Capital and decommissioning expenditure for the first quarter of 2022 was USD 40 million. Full year 2022 capital and decommissioning expenditure guidance is retained at USD 127 million.Free cash flow (FCF) generation was exceptionally strong at USD 96 million during the first quarter of 2022  a record quarterly result for IPC. Full year 2022 FCF guidance is being increased from USD 205 to 480 million to USD 275 to 480 million assuming average Brent oil prices of USD 70 to 100 per barrel for the remainder of 2022. This represents between 19% and 33% of IPC’s current market capitalization.(4)Net debt has reduced to USD 42 million by the end of the first quarter of 2022. During April 2022  IPC moved into a net cash position.IPC forecasts cumulative FCF for 2022 to 2026 of approximately USD 900 to 1 800 million (based on forecast Brent oil prices of USD 65 to 95 per barrel) generating estimated average annual FCF yield over the five year period of between 12% and 24%.(4)Capital Allocation PlansWe were also pleased to announce IPC’s 2022 capital allocation plans at our 2022 CMD. IPC plans to distribute to shareholders up to 40% of the FCF generated by IPC above achieved average Brent oil prices of USD 55 per barrel  provided that IPC’s net debt to EBITDA ratio is at or below 1 time.Share Repurchase ProgramsNormal Course Issuer BidIPC implemented the current share repurchase program/normal course issuer bid (NCIB) in December 2021. This program permits IPC to buy-back up to approximately 11.1 million shares  or approximately 7% of the total outstanding IPC shares at the time of launch  over the 12-month period up to December 2022. To date  IPC has purchased and cancelled approximately 4.4 million IPC shares under the program  or approximately 40% of the annual NCIB limit  at a total purchase cost of approximately USD 29 million. The average price of IPC shares purchased to date is approximately SEK 60 per share.Substantial Issuer BidGiven the strong operational delivery during the first quarter of 2022 and robust financial outlook  IPC intends to accelerate share repurchases above the limits of the NCIB. IPC is pleased to announce that IPC intends to commence a substantial issuer bid (SIB) under which the Corporation plans to offer to purchase for cancellation from shareholders up to CAD 128 million  or approximately USD 100 million or SEK 980 million  of IPC’s outstanding common shares. IPC believes that the SIB represents an effective use of IPC’s capital and that share repurchases continue to be an efficient way to return value to IPC’s shareholders.The SIB is expected to be conducted by way of a “modified Dutch auction” which will permit shareholders to choose  within the pricing range determined by IPC  the number of shares and the price at which they wish to tender such shares  with the purchase price for all tendering shareholders being the lowest purchase price per share that will enable IPC to purchase the maximum number of shares properly tendered to the offer  up to CAD 128 million. The pricing range for the SIB is expected to be set at between CAD 12.00 to 14.00 per share  or approximately SEK 92 to 107 per share based on current foreign exchange rates  representing a range of approximately 3% discount to 13% premium over the Corporation’s volume-weighted average price on the Toronto Stock Exchange over the 10 trading days prior to May 2  2022. The offer to purchase under the SIB is expected to be open for 35 calendar days from commencement of the SIB  unless varied  extended or withdrawn by IPC. IPC intends to suspend share repurchases under the NCIB until after the expiration of the SIB.At the minimum and maximum purchase price of the expected pricing range of CAD 12.00 to CAD 14.00  the offer to purchase under the SIB would be for up to between 10.7 million common shares (approximately 7.1% of shares currently outstanding) and 9.1 million common shares (approximately 6.1% of shares currently outstanding)  respectively. As of May 3  2022  150 966 013 common shares of IPC are issued and outstanding and IPC holds no common shares in treasury.Further details relating to the SIB  including instructions for tendering shares  will be provided by IPC at the time of commencement of the SIB and will be included in the formal offer to purchase and issuer bid circular  letter of transmittal for registered shareholders  notice of guaranteed delivery for registered shareholders  tender form for shareholders holding shares through Euroclear Sweden and other related documents which will be mailed and/or made available to shareholders  and which may be filed with applicable securities regulatory authorities and made available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on the Corporation’s website at www.international-petroleum.com.(5)Environmental  Social and Governance (“ESG“) PerformanceResponsible operatorship and ensuring that we adhere to the highest principles of business conduct have been an integral part of how we do business since the creation of IPC in 2017. Over the past five years  IPC has rapidly grown our business with the completion of three acquisitions in Canada  an acquisition in Malaysia in addition to significant organic investments into those businesses. In parallel  we have made a concerted effort to further develop and improve our sustainability strategy. As previously announced  IPC targets a reduction of our net GHG emissions intensity by the end of 2025 to 50% of the IPC’s 2019 baseline and the Corporation is on track to achieving that target.During the first quarter of 2022  IPC recorded no material safety or environmental incidents.”Notes:(1) See “Supplemental Information regarding Product Types” in “Disclosure of Oil and Gas Information” below.

The information was submitted for publication  through the contact persons set out above  at 07:30 CEST on May 3  2022. The Corporation's unaudited interim condensed consolidated financial statements (Financial Statements) and management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) for the three months ended March 31  2022 have been filed on SEDAR (www.sedar.com) and are also available on the Corporation's website (www.international-petroleum.com).Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release contains statements and information which constitute ""forward-looking statements"" or ""forward-looking information"" (within the meaning of applicable securities legislation). Such statements and information (together  ""forward-looking statements"") relate to future events  including the Corporation's future performance  business prospects or opportunities. Actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release are expressly qualified by this cautionary statement. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release  unless otherwise indicated. IPC does not intend  and does not assume any obligation  to update these forward-looking statements  except as required by applicable laws.The Covid-19 virus and the restrictions and disruptions related to it had a material effect on the world demand for  and prices of  oil and gas as well as the market price of the shares of oil and gas companies generally. Although demand  commodity prices and share prices have recovered  there can be no assurance that these effects will not resume or that commodity prices will not decrease or remain volatile in the future. These factors are beyond the control of the Corporation and it is difficult to assess how these  and other factors  will continue to affect the Corporation and the market price of IPC’s common shares. In light of the current situation  as at the date of this press release  the Corporation continues to review and assess its business plans and assumptions regarding the business environment  as well as its estimates of future production  cash flows  operating costs and capital expenditures.All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions  expectations  beliefs  plans  projections  forecasts  guidance  budgets  objectives  assumptions or future events or performance (often  but not always  using words or phrases such as ""seek""  ""anticipate""  ""plan""  ""continue""  ""estimate""  ""expect""  ""may""  ""will""  ""project""  “forecast”  ""predict""  ""potential""  ""targeting""  ""intend""  ""could""  ""might""  ""should""  ""believe""  ""budget"" and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be ""forward-looking statements"".Forward-looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements with respect to:IPC’s ability to maximize liquidity and financial flexibility in connection with the current and any future Covid-19 outbreaks;the potential for an improved future economic environment  including resulting from a lack of capital investment and drilling in the oil and gas industry;2022 production range  operating costs and capital and decommissioning expenditure estimates;estimates of future production  cash flows  operating costs and capital expenditures that are based on IPC’s current business plans and assumptions regarding the business environment  which are subject to change;IPC’s financial and operational flexibility to continue to react to recent events and navigate the Corporation through periods of volatile commodity prices;IPC’s continued access to its credit facilities  including current financial headroom  on terms acceptable to the Corporation;the ability to fully fund future expenditures and share repurchases from cash flows and current borrowing capacity;IPC’s ability to maintain operations  production and business in light of the current and any future Covid-19 outbreaks and the restrictions and disruptions related thereto  including risks related to production delays and interruptions  changes in laws and regulations and reliance on third-party operators and infrastructure;IPC’s intention and ability to continue to implement our strategies to build long-term shareholder value;the ability of IPC’s portfolio of assets to provide a solid foundation for organic and inorganic growth;the continued facility uptime and reservoir performance in IPC’s areas of operation;future development potential of the Suffield and Ferguson operations in Canada  including the timing and success of future oil and gas drilling and optimization programs;development of the Blackrod project in Canada  including estimates of resource volumes  future production  timing  breakeven prices and net present value;current and future drilling pad production and timing and success of facility upgrades  tie-in work and infill drilling at Onion Lake Thermal;the potential improvement in the Canadian oil egress situation and IPC’s ability to benefit from any such improvements;the timing and success of the future development projects and other organic growth opportunities in France;the ability to maintain current and forecast production in France;the timing and success of the Villeperdue West development project in France;the ability of IPC to achieve and maintain current and forecast production in Malaysia;the success of the drilling of the A15 sidetrack well and of the production well pump rate optimization project in Malaysia;the commencement  timing  completion and results of the substantial issuer bid (SIB);the ability of IPC to acquire common shares under the SIB or further common shares under the NCIB  including the timing of any such purchases;the return of value to IPC’s shareholders as a result of the SIB or the NCIB;the ability of IPC to implement future shareholder distributions in addition to the SIB and the NCIB;IPC’s ability to implement its GHG emissions intensity and climate strategies and to achieve its net GHG emissions intensity reduction targets;estimates of reserves and contingent resources;the ability to generate free cash flows and use that cash to repay debt;IPC’s ability to identify and complete future acquisitions; andfuture drilling and other exploration and development activities.Statements relating to ""reserves"" and ""contingent resources"" are also deemed to be forward-looking statements  as they involve the implied assessment  based on certain estimates and assumptions  that the reserves and resources described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and that the reserves and resources can be profitably produced in the future. Ultimate recovery of reserves or resources is based on forecasts of future results  estimates of amounts not yet determinable and assumptions of management.The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by IPC  including expectations and assumptions concerning: prevailing commodity prices and currency exchange rates; applicable royalty rates and tax laws; interest rates; future well production rates and reserve and contingent resource volumes; operating costs; the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals; the performance of existing wells; the success obtained in drilling new wells; anticipated timing and results of capital expenditures; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities; the timing  location and extent of future drilling operations; the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions; the benefits of acquisitions; the state of the economy and the exploration and production business in the jurisdictions in which IPC operates and globally; the availability and cost of financing  labour and services; and the ability to market crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids successfully.Although IPC believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are based are reasonable  undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because IPC can give no assurances that they will prove to be correct. Since forward-looking statements address future events and conditions  by their very nature they involve inherent risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to a number of factors and risks.These include  but are not limited to:the risks associated with the oil and gas industry in general such as operational risks in development  exploration and production;delays or changes in plans with respect to exploration or development projects or capital expenditures;the uncertainty of estimates and projections relating to reserves  resources  production  revenues  costs and expenses;health  safety and environmental risks;commodity price fluctuations;interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations;marketing and transportation;loss of markets;environmental and climate-related risks;competition;incorrect assessment of the value of acquisitions;failure to complete or realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions or dispositions;the ability to access sufficient capital from internal and external sources;failure to obtain required regulatory and other approvals; andchanges in legislation  including but not limited to tax laws  royalties  environmental and abandonment regulations.Readers are cautioned that the foregoing list of factors is not exhaustive.Additional information on these and other factors that could affect IPC  or its operations or financial results  are included in the MD&A (See ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" and “Reserves and Resources Advisory” therein)  the Corporation's Annual Information Form (AIF) for the year ended December 31  2021 (See ""Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information""  ""Reserves and Resources Advisory"" and "" Risk Factors"" therein) and other reports on file with applicable securities regulatory authorities  including previous financial reports  management’s discussion and analysis and material change reports  which may be accessed through the SEDAR website (www.sedar.com) or IPC's website (www.international-petroleum.com).The current and any future Covid-19 outbreaks may increase IPC’s exposure to  and magnitude of  each of the risks and uncertainties identified above that result from a reduction in demand for oil and gas consumption  lower commodity prices  reliance on third parties  operational risks and costs and changes in government regulation. The extent to which Covid-19 impacts IPC’s business  results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments  which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict  including  but not limited to  the duration and spread of the current and any future Covid-19 outbreaks  their severity  the actions taken to contain such outbreaks or treat their impact  and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume and their impacts to IPC’s business  results of operations and financial condition which could be more significant in upcoming periods as compared with previous periods. Even after the Covid-19 outbreaks have subsided  IPC may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to IPC’s business as a result of the global economic impact.Non-IFRS MeasuresReferences are made in this press release to ""operating cash flow"" (OCF)  “free cash flow” (FCF)  ""Earnings Before Interest  Tax  Depreciation and Amortization"" (EBITDA)  ""operating costs"" and ""net debt""/”net cash”  which are not generally accepted accounting measures under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and do not have any standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and  therefore  may not be comparable with similar measures presented by other public companies. Non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.The Corporation uses non-IFRS measures to provide investors with supplemental measures to assess the cash generated by and the financial performance and position of the Corporation. Management also uses non-IFRS measures internally in order to facilitate operating performance comparisons from period to period  prepare annual operating budgets and assess the Corporation’s ability to meet its future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes these non-IFRS measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they highlight trends in the core business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on IFRS financial measures. Management believes such measures allow for assessment of the Corporation’s operating performance and financial condition on a basis that is more consistent and comparable between reporting periods. The Corporation also believes that securities analysts  investors and other interested parties frequently use non-IFRS measures in the evaluation of issuers. Forward-looking statements are provided for the purpose of presenting information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future and readers are cautioned that such statements may not be appropriate for other purposes.The definition and reconciliation of each non-IFRS measure is presented in IPC's MD&A (See ""Non-IFRS Measures"" therein).Estimated free cash flow generation is based on IPC’s current business plans over the period of 2022 to 2026. Assumptions include average net production of approximately 47 Mboepd  average Brent oil prices of USD 65 to 95 per boe escalating by 2% per year  average gas prices of CAD 3.00 per thousand cubic feet  and average Brent to Western Canadian Select differentials as estimated by IPC’s independent reserves evaluator and as further described in the AIF. IPC’s current business plans and assumptions  and the business environment  are subject to change. Actual results may differ materially from forward-looking estimates and forecasts.Disclosure of Oil and Gas InformationThis press release contains references to estimates of gross and net reserves and resources attributed to the Corporation's oil and gas assets. Gross reserves / resources are the working interest (operating or non-operating) share before deduction of royalties and without including any royalty interests. Net reserves / resources are the working interest (operating or non-operating) share after deduction of royalty obligations  plus royalty interests in reserves/resources  and in respect of PSCs in Malaysia  adjusted for cost and profit oil. Unless otherwise indicated  reserves / resource volumes are presented on a gross basis.Reserve estimates  contingent resource estimates and estimates of future net revenue in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in Canada are effective as of December 31  2021  and are included in the reports prepared by Sproule Associates Limited (Sproule)  an independent qualified reserves evaluator  in accordance with National Instrument 51-101 – Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (NI 51-101) and the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (the COGE Handbook) and using Sproule’s December 31  2021 price forecasts.Reserve estimates  contingent resource estimates and estimates of future net revenue in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in France and Malaysia are effective as of December 31  2021  and are included in the report prepared by ERC Equipoise Ltd. (ERCE)  an independent qualified reserves auditor  in accordance with NI 51-101 and the COGE Handbook  and using Sproule’s December 31  2021 price forecasts.The price forecasts used in the Sproule and ERCE reports are available on the website of Sproule (sproule.com) and are contained in the AIF. These price forecasts are as at December 31  2021 and may not be reflective of current and future forecast commodity prices.The reserves life index (RLI) is calculated by dividing the 2P reserves of 270 MMboe as at December 31  2021  by the mid-point of the 2022 production guidance of 46 000 to 48 000 boepd.The product types comprising the 2P reserves and contingent resources described in this press release are contained in the AIF. See also “Supplemental Information regarding Product Types” below. Light  medium and heavy crude oil reserves/resources disclosed in this press release include solution gas and other by-products.""2P reserves"" means proved plus probable reserves. ""Proved reserves"" are those reserves that can be estimated with a high degree of certainty to be recoverable. It is likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the estimated proved reserves. ""Probable reserves"" are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the sum of the estimated proved plus probable reserves.Each of the reserves categories reported (proved and probable) may be divided into developed and undeveloped categories. “Developed reserves” are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from existing wells and installed facilities or  if facilities have not been installed  that would involve a low expenditure (for example  when compared to the cost of drilling a well) to put the reserves on production. The developed category may be subdivided into producing and non-producing. “Developed producing reserves” are those reserves that are expected to be recovered from completion intervals open at the time of the estimate. These reserves may be currently producing or  if shut-in  they must have previously been on production  and the date of resumption of production must be known with reasonable certainty. “Developed non-producing reserves” are those reserves that either have not been on production  or have previously been on production  but are shut-in  and the date of resumption of production is unknown. “Undeveloped reserves” are those reserves expected to be recovered from known accumulations where a significant expenditure (for example  when compared to the cost of drilling a well) is required to render them capable of production. They must fully meet the requirements of the reserves classification (proved  probable) to which they are assigned.Contingent resources are those quantities of petroleum estimated  as of a given date  to be potentially recoverable from known accumulations using established technology or technology under development  but which are not currently considered to be commercially recoverable due to one or more contingencies. Contingencies are conditions that must be satisfied for a portion of contingent resources to be classified as reserves that are: (a) specific to the project being evaluated; and (b) expected to be resolved within a reasonable timeframe. Contingencies may include factors such as economic  legal  environmental  political  and regulatory matters  or a lack of markets. It is also appropriate to classify as contingent resources the estimated discovered recoverable quantities associated with a project in the early evaluation stage. Contingent resources are further classified in accordance with the level of certainty associated with the estimates and may be sub-classified based on a project maturity and/or characterized by their economic status.There are three classifications of contingent resources: low estimate  best estimate and high estimate. Best estimate is a classification of estimated resources described in the COGE Handbook as the best estimate of the quantity that will be actually recovered. It is equally likely that the actual remaining quantities recovered will be greater or less than the best estimate. If probabilistic methods are used  there should be at least a 50% probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the best estimate.Contingent resources are further classified based on project maturity. The project maturity subclasses include development pending  development on hold  development unclarified and development not viable. All of the Corporation’s contingent resources are classified as either development on hold or development unclarified. Development on hold is defined as a contingent resource where there is a reasonable chance of development  but there are major non-technical contingencies to be resolved that are usually beyond the control of the operator. Development unclarified is defined as a contingent resource that requires further appraisal to clarify the potential for development and has been assigned a lower chance of development until commercial considerations can be clearly defined. Chance of development is the probability of a project being commercially viable.References to ""unrisked"" contingent resources volumes means that the reported volumes of contingent resources have not been risked (or adjusted) based on chance of commerciality. In accordance with the COGE Handbook guidance for contingent resources  the chance of commerciality is solely based on the chance of development associated with resolution of all contingencies required for the re-classification of the contingent resources as reserves being resolved. Reported unrisked volumes of contingent resources do not reflect the risking (or adjustment) of such volumes based on the chance of development of such resources.The contingent resources reported in this press release are estimates only. The estimates are based upon a number of factors and assumptions each of which contains estimation error which could result in future revisions of the estimates as more technical and commercial information becomes available. The estimation factors include  but are not limited to  the mapped extent of the oil and gas accumulations  geologic characteristics of the reservoirs  and dynamic reservoir performance. There are numerous risks and uncertainties associated with recovery of such resources  including many factors beyond the Corporation’s control. There is uncertainty that it will be commercially viable to produce any portion of the contingent resources referred to in this press release. References to “contingent resources” do not constitute  and should be distinguished from  references to “reserves”.2P reserves and contingent resources included in the reports prepared by Sproule and ERCE in respect of IPC’s oil and gas assets in Canada  France and Malaysia have been aggregated by IPC. Estimates of reserves  resources and future net revenue for individual properties may not reflect the same level of confidence as estimates of reserves  resources and future net revenue for all properties  due to the effects of aggregation. This press release contains estimates of the net present value of the future net revenue from IPC's reserves and contingent resources. The estimated values of future net revenue disclosed in this press release do not represent fair market value. There is no assurance that the forecast prices and cost assumptions used in the reserve and resources evaluations will be attained and variances could be material.BOEs may be misleading  particularly if used in isolation. A BOE conversion ratio of 6 thousand cubic feet (Mcf) per 1 barrel (bbl) is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. As the value ratio between natural gas and crude oil based on the current prices of natural gas and crude oil is significantly different from the energy equivalency of 6:1  utilizing a 6:1 conversion basis may be misleading as an indication of value.Supplemental Information regarding Product TypesThe following table is intended to provide supplemental information about the product type composition of IPC’s net average daily production figures provided in this document:Heavy Crude Oil(Mbopd) Light and Medium Crude Oil(Mbopd) Conventional Natural Gas(per day) Total(Mboepd) Three months ended March 31  2022 22.2 8.0 93.6 MMcf(15.6 Mboe) 45.8 March 31  2021 19.4 8.1 97.2 MMcf(16.2 Mboe) 43.7 Year ended December 31  2021 20.4 8.4 99.9 MMcf(16.7 Mboe) 45.5This press release also makes reference to IPC’s forecast total average daily production of 46 000 to 48 000 boepd for 2022. IPC estimates that approximately 46% of that production will be comprised of heavy oil  approximately 21% will be comprised of light and medium crude oil and approximately 33% will be comprised of conventional natural gas.CurrencyAll dollar amounts in this press release are expressed in United States dollars  except where otherwise noted.

4106,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/stamp-taxes-shares-manual/stsm999999,Stamp Taxes on Shares Manual,Guidance on Stamp Taxes on Shares and other Securities - Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT),The following is an alphabetical list of some of the legal terms that commonly occur in the financial securities industry and to Stamp Duty and SDRT. This edition draws on and encompasses the earlier Stamp Duty and SDRT Glossaries detailed in the Stamp Office Manual and incorporates new words and phrases that have emerged in the stock markets or have significance to SDRT.Some of the terms used in the financial world have precise meanings for some people but are generic for other individuals. This glossary should therefore be seen as a guide but not as authority. The glossary does not pretend to be comprehensive  given the huge vocabulary of the financial sector  but is intended as an aide memoir to assist with understanding.Where acronyms and other initials are used in this Glossary  they are listed in their strict alphabetical order rather than under their full name. Thus  for example  AIM will be found between ‘Agreement’ and ‘Allotment’.Suggestions for future insertions will be gratefully received and forwarded to:HMRC Stamp TaxesSDRT Technical Adviser100 Parliament StreetLondonSW1A 2BQA B C D E F G H I J L M N O P Q R S T U V W XAABSOLUTE INTERESTA full and complete right or title to  or estate in stocks and shares combining both the legal and beneficial interests.ACCOUNTABLE PERSONThe person who has statutory responsibility for the payment of SDRT to the HM Revenue & Customs. The accountable person is distinguishable from the liable person  who will normally be the person acquiring the chargeable security.ACCOUNT STATUS ‘A’In CREST  a member or participant account set up account status ‘A’ is the default for the payment of SDRT at the rate of 0.5% on securities purchased.ACCOUNT STATUS ‘C’In CREST  a member or participant account set up account status ‘C’ is the default for the payment of SDRT at the rate of 1.5% on securities purchased.ACCOUNT STATUS ‘Z’In CREST  a member or participant account set up with account status ‘Z’ means that no SDRT obligations arise on all purchases of UK registered securities. Such accounts include acquisitions for  and on behalf of  recognised charities.ACCUMULATION UNITSUnits in unit trusts / shares in an oeic  where income derived from investments held by the fund are ‘rolled up’ or automatically reinvested in the trust/oeic rather than being paid out to unit/shareholders as dividends. Unit/shareholders get the benefit of the dividends through a higher unit or share value.ACDThe person who operates an open-ended investment company (oeic) scheme and is responsible for investing cash contributions received from investors or dealing with surrenders of shares is called the Authorised Corporate Director (ACD). The ACD is responsible for keeping the register of the names of the holders of the oeic shares.The person who is entrusted with the custody of the investments/assets contained within an oeic on behalf of the investors is called the Trustee.ACQUISITIONThe process of one company taking over another by purchasing its assets or shares.ACTIVE MARKETA Market for a particular class of shares or stock in which there is active and regular trading.ADJUDICATIONUnder section 12 Stamp Act 1891  any person can request Stamp Taxes to express a formal opinion of the Stamp Duty charged upon executed documents and instruments of title. When the document is stamped with the duty assessed upon it a further stamp is impressed which denotes that it is then ‘Adjudged duly stamped’ or ‘Adjudged Not Chargeable with any duty’. The impression of the adjudication stamp on a document is conclusive and precludes any future question being raised by Stamp Taxes or a third party as the correctness of the stamping.The adjudication process is compulsory for various claims to stamp exemption and/or relief. This includes  share purchases undertaken by recognised charities  sales of securities to intermediaries  stock lending arrangements  company acquisitions and transactions between associated companies.ADRAn American Depositary Receipt (ADR) allows US investors to own shares in non-US companies. Denominated in dollars  ADRs can be traded in London. A depositary receipt is defined  broadly  as an instrument acknowledging that a person holds stocks or shares but that another person is entitled to rights in relation to stocks or shares of the same kind including the right to receive such securities. A depositary receipt is in effect a substitute for a company share and is issued by a bank whose business includes the issuing of receipts against the deposit of the actual shares concerned.ADSForeign stocks and shares that are issued in the U.S. and registered in the ADR system. The term ADR & ADS is often confused. In strictness  an ADS is the actual share trading  while an ADR represents a bundle of ADSs.AD VALOREMThe English translation is ‘according to value’  assessing Stamp Duty on a transfer of property as a percentage (that is 0.5% or 1.5%) of the value of.ADVISORY BROKERA broker that suggests changes to a shareholders existing portfolio or holding of securities. An advisory broker does not have the authority to execute share deals without client instruction.AGENT INDICATORUsed in CREST to indicate whether the participant is a SRO member acting as agent or principal. If a participant is acting under instructions from a client  the indicator is set to value ‘A’  denoting an agency capacity. If the CREST participant is trading directly with another CREST participant and is buying the shares onto his own book  he is acting in a principal capacity and the indicator is set to value ‘P’ (to indicate a principal share purchase). Agent indicator ‘S’ denotes that a principal is selling securities from his book to a third party.Indicator ‘N’ (not applicable) is input to show that the participant did not act in either an agent or principal capacity.AGREEMENTIncludes a legally binding contract made between two parties setting out details of actions which each is to perform and to which each has assented but goes wider.AIMThe Alternate Investment Market (AIM) is a Market designed for shares of emerging or smaller companies which cannot fulfil all the requirements of the London Stock Exchange for a full quotation listing.

More than 75 officers are taking part in the action  he said.Morgan Stanley confirmed that its premises were targeted and said the investigation relates to a “historic activity” and that the bank is “continuing to cooperate with the German authorities.”Prosecutors in Cologne are probing about 1 500 people from the financial industry and are ramping up the pressure on international banks. They raided Barclays Plc’s Frankfurt offices in March days after Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch premises were hit.Cum-Ex was a trading strategy that siphoned off at least 10 billion euros ($10.5 billion) in government revenue. Named for the Latin term for “With-Without ” the deals took advantage of German tax laws that seemed to allow multiple investors to claim refunds of a tax on dividends that was paid only once. The nation moved to abolish the practice in 2012.While dating back to more than a decade ago  the Cum-Ex scandal is still roiling the industry. Deutsche Bank AG is another major lender facing its repercussions. An influential advisory firm recommended over the weekend that company shareholders shouldn’t sign off on management’s actions for the past year  citing Cum-Ex as one of the reasons.Germany’s top court last week backed the retroactive application of laws to make sure the government can seize funds banks and other players involved in the scandal pocketed in the trades.Story continuesMorgan Stanley  next to a long list of other global investment banks  was mentioned as an alleged short seller in these deals in a search warrant Cologne prosecutors obtained in 2019 to raid Deutsche Boerse AG’s Clearstream unit.In the first indictment issued by Cologne prosecutors in the probe the same year  the bank is mentioned as a possible lender of shares needed to do the trades.(Updates with Morgan Stanley possble role in last paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.02,0.12,0.86,mixed,0.05,0.15,0.79,True,English,"['Tax Fraud Investigation', 'Morgan Stanley', 'Frankfurt', 'other global investment banks', 'influential advisory firm', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'Merrill Lynch premises', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Deutsche Bank AG', 'controversial Cum-Ex scandal', 'German tax laws', 'other players', 'international banks', 'funds banks', 'German prosecutors', 'Frankfurt offices', 'Morgan Stanley', 'tax payers', 'two suspects', 'related strategies', 'historic activity', 'Barclays Plc', 'March days', 'America Corp.', 'trading strategy', 'Latin term', 'multiple investors', 'major lender', 'company shareholders', 'past year', 'top court', 'retroactive application', 'long list', 'short seller', 'search warrant', 'Clearstream unit', 'first indictment', 'possible lender', 'possble role', 'last paragraph', 'German authorities', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Cologne prosecutors', 'financial industry', '10 billion euros', 'government revenue', 'wider probe', 'raid', 'part', 'billions', 'homes', 'spokesman', 'More', '75 officers', 'action', 'investigation', '1,500 people', 'pressure', 'deals', 'advantage', 'refunds', 'dividends', 'practice', 'repercussions', 'weekend', 'management', 'reasons', 'Germany', 'trades', 'Story', 'shares', 'Updates']",2022-05-03,2022-05-04,finance.yahoo.com

4130,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/221061/etf-april-round-up-natural-gas-funds-dominate.aspx,ETF April Round-up: Natural Gas Funds Dominate,1 day ago,The best performing exchange traded product (ETP) in April was the WisdomTree Natural Gas ETC (NGAS)  which gained more than 34 percentage points for the month. The European gas market is in turmoil after Moscow decided to cut off supplies to Bulgaria and Poland  pushing up prices strongly.As pointed out by Morningstar Germany editor Antje Schiffer  Europe's gas storage facilities were emptier than usual this winter given the time of year  even before the Russian attack on Ukraine. Fear has ruled the market since February 24. Investors are anxious that Europe will add gas to its list of sanctions  or that Russia will simply turn off the gas supply across the continent.Another direct consequence of the war is the rise in the prices of agricultural commodities  particularly soybeans  of which Russia is a major producer. Sanctions on Russia are playing a role in several harvesting regions  including major producers as Argentina  Brazil and Paraguay  where a shortage of diesel is impacting harvesting and truck transport between the fields and the ports. Only five months ago the US Department of Agriculture was still forecasting that global soybean producers would grow a surplus of 5 million tons. Now  this has been revised to a deficit of 2 million tons.Finally  among the best performers of the month there were two trackers of the VIX index  also known as the “fear gauge”. This tracks the S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll Index  a benchmark that offers exposure to the expected implied volatility of the S&P 500  and that it is typically used by investors to measure market risk  fear and stress.The LaggardsETFs exposed to digital assets  as blockchain or cryptocurrencies suffered heavily in April. 21Shares Fantom ETP (AFTM) was the biggest detractor within the ETFs universe  shedding 35%. This fund  launched on March 16  is designed to give investors a way to invest in the Fantom token that powers the Fantom blockchain  a platform for DeFi (decentralised finance)  dApps (decentralised apps) and enterprise applications.April was a difficult month for the crypto world  with sell-offs across the board. Ignoring stablecoins  the token that fell the least in April was BNB (Binance coin). The crypto  which is used as both BNB Chain’s native currency and as an exchange coin on Binance  fell almost 13% for the month.ETFs exposed to e-commerce and Chinese equity also suffered.Russian equity ETFs are suspended from trading until further notice  although this decision was not taken simultaneously by all European stock exchanges. The SIX Swiss Exchange in Zurich  for example  froze them on March 8  four days later than Euronext  Borsa Italiana  Deutsche Boerse and the London Stock Exchange.While waiting to find out the fate of these strategies  this puts the question of greater harmonisation of the European ETF market back on the table. Issuers themselves may even decide to stop offering them through a liquidation – many institutional and private clients might no longer want to hold Russia  either from an ESG perspective or to comply with sanctions.The Biggest ETFsBelow is a overview of the biggest European-domiciled ETPs in terms of assets  which could be more appropriate to consider among core holdings. Performances in April 2022 go from 3.8% of the iShares Physical Gold ETC (IGLN) down to the iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF (CSP1)  the Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF (VUSD) and the iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF (IDUS); all of them lost 3.7% last month.MethodologyAccording to Morningstar data  there are about 70 percentage points between the best and worst performing European exchange-traded products (ETPs) in April  with returns for the month ranging from 34.3% to -34.9%.We have looked at the key trends in the third month of the year  excluding inverse and leveraged funds. These instruments  being purely passive products  reflect the evolution of the markets without the bias (good or bad) of an active manager.Monthly top and flop performers often coincide with very volatile and therefore risky products  which should play a satellite role in your portfolio.,neutral,0.03,0.94,0.03,mixed,0.07,0.14,0.78,True,English,"['Natural Gas Funds', 'April Round-up', 'ETF', 'S&P 500 VIX Futures Enhanced Roll Index', 'iShares Core S&P 500 UCITS ETF', 'Vanguard S&P 500 UCITS ETF', 'Morningstar Germany editor Antje Schiffer', 'worst performing European exchange-traded products', 'iShares Physical Gold ETC', 'WisdomTree Natural Gas ETC', 'The SIX Swiss Exchange', 'European ETF market', 'European stock exchanges', 'exchange traded product', 'VIX index', 'London Stock Exchange', 'The Laggards ETFs', 'gas storage facilities', 'global soybean producers', 'The Biggest ETFs', 'European gas market', 'several harvesting regions', 'biggest European-domiciled ETPs', 'Russian equity ETFs', '21Shares Fantom ETP', 'core holdings', 'Morningstar data', 'exchange coin', 'passive products', 'risky products', 'biggest detractor', 'gas supply', 'Russian attack', 'major producers', 'Chinese equity', 'ETFs universe', 'market risk', '34 percentage points', 'direct consequence', 'agricultural commodities', 'truck transport', 'US Department', '5 million tons', '2 million tons', 'two trackers', 'decentralised finance', 'decentralised apps', 'enterprise applications', 'native currency', 'Borsa Italiana', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'greater harmonisation', 'many institutional', 'private clients', 'ESG perspective', '70 percentage points', 'key trends', 'leveraged funds', 'active manager', 'Monthly top', 'flop performers', 'Fantom token', 'Fantom blockchain', 'best performers', 'digital assets', 'crypto world', 'Binance coin', 'BNB Chain', 'satellite role', 'fear gauge', 'difficult month', 'third month', 'April', 'NGAS', 'turmoil', 'Moscow', 'supplies', 'Bulgaria', 'Poland', 'prices', 'time', 'year', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'Investors', 'list', 'sanctions', 'continent', 'war', 'soybeans', 'Argentina', 'Brazil', 'Paraguay', 'shortage', 'diesel', 'fields', 'ports', 'Agriculture', 'surplus', 'deficit', 'benchmark', 'exposure', 'volatility', 'stress', 'cryptocurrencies', 'AFTM', 'March', 'way', 'platform', 'dApps', 'sell-offs', 'board', 'stablecoins', 'e-commerce', 'trading', 'notice', 'decision', 'Zurich', 'example', 'Euronext', 'fate', 'strategies', 'question', 'Issuers', 'liquidation', 'overview', 'terms', 'Performances', 'IGLN', 'CSP', 'VUSD', 'IDUS', 'Methodology', 'returns', 'inverse', 'instruments', 'evolution', 'markets', 'bias', 'volatile', 'portfolio']",2022-05-04,2022-05-04,morningstar.co.uk

Targeting RGD-binding integrins is known to affect multiple disease hallmarks such as vascular leakage  inflammation  angiogenesis and fibrosis. The preclinical study investigated the therapeutic potential of THR-687  a potent pan-RGD integrin antagonist  in the streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes rat model.Following STZ-induced diabetes  different doses of THR-687 (6.7  16.7 or 75 µg/eye) or its vehicle were administered via 3 consecutive intravitreal injections in both eyes (with 1-week interval  n=7 rats/group). Untreated  non-diabetic rats served as controls (n=5 rats). At 4 weeks after diabetes-induction  the effect of THR-687 was investigated by histological analysis for retinal vascular leakage (using the tracer FITC-BSA)  for inflammatory cell activation (Iba1 immunoreactivity) and Müller cell gliosis (vimentin immunoreactivity). Statistical analysis was performed with a one-way analysis of variance using a Bonferroni multiple comparison test.Story continuesThe updated data shows:THR-687 reduced diabetes-induced increases in retinal permeability versus vehicle in a dose-dependent manner. The highest dose (75 µg/eye) completely prevented vascular leakage (p<0.001) while the mid dose (16.7 µg/eye) significantly decreased this pathology by 34 ± 21% (p<0.05) and the low dose (6.7 µg/eye) had no effect.All doses of THR-687 also significantly reduced the number of inflammatory cells  as compared to vehicle. Indeed  a reduction of 57 ± 12% was seen after administration of the highest dose (p<0.01)  a decrease of 43 ± 19% for the mid dose (p<0.05) and the low dose induced a reduction of 51 ± 13% (p<0.05).The highest dose of THR-687 also reduced the diabetes-induced increase in vimentin expression within the Müller cells back to baseline (p<0.05 versus vehicle)  whereas no significant differences following injections of the mid or low dose were observed.RGD-integrin antagonism using THR-687 potently inhibits vascular permeability  inflammation and gliosis induced by STZ in the diabetic rat retina. Given its broad mode of action  THR-687 is a promising drug candidate for the treatment of vision-threatening retinal pathologies and is currently in a Phase 2 clinical trial in DME patients (INTEGRAL - NCT05063734).A copy of the ARVO presentation is available under Conferences and Events within the Investors section of the Company’s website.Oxurion is currently evaluating THR-687 in a two-part Phase 2 clinical trial (“INTEGRAL”) in patients with DME. Part A dose optimization data from the INTEGRAL trial is anticipated this quarter. If successful  the efficacy and safety of THR-687 versus aflibercept (the current standard of care) will be evaluated in Part B of the INTEGRAL Phase 2 clinical trial in both treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients with DME with data expected in the second half of 2023.About OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is a biopharmaceutical company developing next generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies  which are designed to better improve and preserve vision in patients with retinal vascular disorders including diabetic macular edema (DME)  the leading cause of vision loss in diabetic patients worldwide as well as other conditions  including wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (ME-RVO). Oxurion is aiming to build a leading global franchise in the treatment of retinal vascular disorders based on the successful development of its two novel therapeutics. THR-149 is a potent plasma kallikrein inhibitor being developed as a potential new standard of care for the up to 50% of DME patients showing suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy. THR-687 is a highly selective pan-RGD integrin antagonist that is being developed as a potential first line therapy for DME patients as well as wet AMD and potentially ME-RVO.

This approval is the first of its kind in Europe for this uncommon condition  with limited treatment options currently available should patients progress after prior use of systemic therapy.Jaume Capdevila  M.D. PhD  Medical Oncologist at the Vall d´Hebron University Hospital and Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology (VHIO)  Barcelona  and a trial investigator  said  “ The nature of radioiodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer means that this condition does not respond to the most commonly used standard of care for differentiated thyroid cancer. As a result  people living with this form of the disease have had limited treatment options should their disease progress. I am pleased to see the entrance of a new innovative treatment in Cabometyx  following limited progress for patients in this area for such a significant amount of time and I look forward to sharing more positive conversations with my patients on the number of options available to them.”The EC approval was based on results from the pivotal COSMIC-311 Phase III trial  which at a planned interim analysis  confirmed that the trial had met the primary endpoint of progression free survival (PFS)  demonstrating a significant reduction in the risk of disease progression or death by 78% versus placebo (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.22; 96% confidence interval [CI]: 0.13-0.36; P<0.0001) at a median follow-up of 6.2 months.1 The other primary endpoint  the objective response rate  also favored Cabometyx with 15% vs. 0% for placebo (p=0.028) at a median follow-up of 8.9 months  but did not meet the criteria for statistical significance.1 Given the efficacy and safety demonstrated within this analysis  the independent data monitoring committee recommended to stop enrolment and unblind sites and patients. The final results  at a median follow-up of 10.1 months  were then presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Virtual Congress 2021  whereby Cabometyx continued to demonstrate superior median PFS of 11.0 months versus 1.9 months with placebo and a maintained reduction in the risk of disease progression or death of 78% versus placebo ([HR]: 0.22  96% [CI]: 0.15-0.32; p<0.0001). These new analyses also demonstrated that superior efficacy was maintained with Cabometyx irrespective of previous vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-targeted therapy  supporting flexible sequencing decisions for physicians. The safety profile identified in the COSMIC-311 trial across the two analyses was consistent with that previously observed for Cabometyx and adverse events were managed with dose modifications.1 2Steven Hildemann  M.D. PhD  Executive Vice President  Chief Medical Officer  Head of Global Medical Affairs and Global Patient Safety at Ipsen  said  “ Confirmation of the approval of Cabometyx for this difficult-to-treat cancer is welcome news for patients and treating physicians. We are delighted that the European Commission has recognized the strength of the COSMIC-311 data and the possibilities that Cabometyx can deliver for people living with radioactive-iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer. We are committed to researching areas of oncology with high unmet medical needs and this decision exemplifies our ambition to bring meaningful new treatments that have the potential to make tangible differences to people’s lives.”This EC approval follows the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval announced by Exelixis in September 2021 of Cabometyx for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older with locally advanced or metastatic DTC that has progressed following prior vascular endothelial growth factor receptor targeted therapy and who are radioactive iodine-refractory or ineligible.Ipsen wishes to thank the patients and investigators involved in the COSMIC-311 clinical trial.About radioactive iodine-refractory differentiated thyroid cancer (RAI-R DTC)In 2020  over 580 000 new cases of thyroid cancer were diagnosed worldwide.3 Thyroid cancer is the ninth most commonly occurring cancer globally and incidence is three times higher in women than in men  with the disease representing 1 in every 20 cancers diagnosed among women.4 While cancerous thyroid tumors include differentiated  medullary and anaplastic forms  differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) makes up about 90 to 95% of cases.5 6 These include papillary  follicular and Hürthle cell cancer.3 4 DTC is typically treated with surgery  followed by ablation of the remaining thyroid tissue with radioactive iodine (RAI)  but approximately 5 to 15% of cases are resistant to RAI treatment.7 Patients who develop RAI-R DTC have a poor prognosis with an average estimated survival of three to five years.8About the COSMIC-311 trialCOSMIC-311 is a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III trial that enrolled 258 patients at 164 sites globally.1 2 Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either Cabometyx 60 mg or placebo once-daily.1 The primary endpoints were progression-free survival in the intention-to-treat population as well as objective response rate in the first 100 randomly assigned patients (objective response rate intention-to-treat [OITT] population)  both evaluated by a blinded independent radiology committee. Additional endpoints include safety  overall survival and quality of life.1 Exelixis is the sponsor of the COSMIC-311 trial  and Ipsen is co-funding the trial. More information about this trial is available at ClinicalTrials.gov.About Cabometyx (cabozantinib)Outside the United States and Japan  Cabometyx is currently approved in 60 countries  including in the European Union (E.U.)

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ""believes""  ""anticipates"" and ""expects"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising product in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons and also taking into consideration assessment delays of certain clinical trials in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic products that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the Research and Development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a product in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the product concerned. There can be no guarantees a product will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the product will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and health care legislation; global trends toward health care cost containment; technological advances  new products and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new product development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative products; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its products which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance.

DSM expects its Health  Nutrition & Bioscience activities to deliver a high-single digit Adjusted EBITDA increase. For the Group  it expects a mid-single digit Adjusted EBITDA increase  with a high-single Adjusted Net Operating Free Cash Flow increase. This outlook is based on DSM's expectation of a stable Adjusted EBITDA in Materials following the strong performance in 2021.1 Adjusted EBITDA is an Alternative Performance Measure (APM) that reflects results from usual operations. Organic sales growth is the total impact of volume and price/mix. Adjusted Net Operating Free Cash Flow is the cash flow from operating activities  corrected for the cash flow of the APM adjustments  minus the cash flow of capital expenditures and drawing rights.2 DSM's Health  Nutrition & Bioscience structure became effective as of 1 January 2022. It consists of three businesses: Animal Nutrition and Health (ANH)  Health  Nutrition and Care (HNC) and Food & Beverage (F&B).

This collaboration has been reinforced with their mutual involvement in the DesCartes program led by the CNRS in Singapore  the CREATE-ID international research chair  and through the ESI - ENSAM virtual engineering laboratory.This open-source approach has many advantages. First  it allows the community to use the software in an optimal and fast way  thus  enabling the scientific community to benefit from new functionalities adapted to the requirements of each user  as well as from security improvements. Secondly  through its approach  ESI Group wishes to offer an opportunity to benefit from a software whose reliability has been proven over the years by its customers in various industries  including Automotive and Aeronautics. “Inspector” will continue to evolve and adapt to the needs of the community thanks to the collaboration of the numerous stakeholders.Several industry players and “Inspector” users have expressed interest and support for ESI Group's initiative to deploy its data analysis software in open source. This is the case  for example  with CNS.Stephane Perrin  Managing Director of CNS states: ""The decision taken by ESI Group is a great illustration of the Group’s dedication to the innovation and scientific ecosystem with its cutting-edge technologies. At CNS  a Network and Security expertise company  we are mobilized to ensure the future of Inspector. In addition to integrating Inspector into our continuous network auditing software suite  we will also soon offer support for the software via our business unit dedicated to innovative solutions.""Emmanuel Leroy  EVP Product  Innovation & Industry Solutions at ESI Group said: ""Data and open source are the two main keywords of this new coordinated action with ENSAM. We are delighted to be able to take our collaboration a step further while contributing to academic and industrial research and innovation. ""Inspector"" will provide users with a tool for analyzing large volumes of data to optimize the performance of manufacturing processes. In a period where data is becoming key but remains expensive; I am convinced that this open-source release will open opportunities for industrial players  whether they are large companies or startups.""Information on how to obtain the Inspector download and installation linksThe ""Inspector"" module can be retrieved as an archive (674MB) with the following command: sftp inspector@jibleo.com:source_code/inendi-inspector_opensource_export_2022-01-27.tgz.The password associated with the SFTP account ""inspector"" is ""ut!iep2E"" and the checksum sha256 of the archive is d0404dd13c80ec8a4e32f406986731025881097ed03fa47a4af77827744f1000The location of the Gitlab project from which the export was made is the following: https://gitlab.com/inendi/inspectorThe software can now be installed with the following command (as indicated in the documentation on the Gitlab project homepage): flatpak install --user -y https://inendi.gitlab.io/inspector/install.flatpakrefAbout ESI GroupFounded in 1973  ESI Group is a leading innovator in Virtual Prototyping solutions and a global enabler of industrial transformation.

4153,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/letter-shareholders-061300652.html,Letter to our shareholders,Paris  May 3  2022 Dear Fellow Shareholder  Ipsos is engaged in a new and successful transformation to reinforce our worldwide leadership while strengthening...,"IPSOSParis  May 3  2022Dear Fellow Shareholder Ipsos is engaged in a new and successful transformation to reinforce our worldwide leadership while strengthening our governance with the support of our shareholders. Our strong set of results (FY results 2021 and 2022 First Quarter results) clearly demonstrates we are creating value and delivering for our shareholders.Our progress is now threatened by both:An ill-conceived and unnecessary attempt by a small minority of shareholders to nominate a candidate to the Board of Directors  without any prior dialogue or attempt to engage in our standing nomination process; andA fundamental misunderstanding from ISS of our governance and remuneration processes.We strongly recommend you vote AGAINST Resolution A at the Combined General Meeting on May 17.We strongly recommend you vote FOR items 12  15  16  17  20 at the Combined General Meeting on May 17.Over the past 24 months  Ipsos has executed its strategy to partner more closely with its clients so they can act faster  smarter and bolder. The results are clear:Our share price at a 20 years high above 45 euros and with strong consensus from analysts;2021 revenue growth of 17.9%  and 10.4% compared with 2019;Operating Margin at 12 9% in 2021  which has gained 300 basis points since two years and which is foreseen to remain above 12%;A higher generation of Free Cash Flows  which has led to an historical low net debt and therefore provides the financial resources for: a more aggressive acquisition policy  an increased dividend at 1.15 euros per share  and an additional buyback programme (on top of the recurring one of 1% of capital per year in order to limit the dilution of our free share programme).Alongside our demonstrated track record of performance  Ipsos has taken decisive steps to strengthen its governance processes  notably by separating the functions of Chairman and CEO.Last September  the Board appointed Ben Page as Ipsos’s Chief Executive Officer  effective November 15. Over the last 12 years  he had grown very successfully Ipsos in the UK and Ireland. Under his leadership  Ipsos has already built on its progress  and Mr. Page and his team are preparing a comprehensive discussion of management’s strategy called “Best People and Best Technologies” for further growth and value creation at our Investor Day on June 14 (which you are of course invited to attend).The Board has been renewed significantly over the course of the past five years  through a transparent process guaranteeing the appointment of the most qualified  independent board members. This process is run by a nomination committee  fully composed and chaired by independent directors.Story continuesAs a result  the majority of this year’s Board nominees have joined the Company over the past five years. That includes two new independent directors proposed for election to the Board this year - Pierre Barnabé and Virginie Calmels (who are bringing strong skills in media and technology and whose experiences are described in Appendix 1).Our proposed Board is also well-balanced  in terms of gender (50%)  skill sets  experience  diversity  nationalities (25% non-French) and meets the definition of independence in accordance with the AFEP-MEDEF code (the corporate governance code of reference for French publicly traded companies).At 50%  our gender balance on the Board also serves a valuable purpose for our investors since that fact is a critical contributor to our inclusion in key CSR-related indices and rankings. We do not recommend going backwards  having a lower ratio and losing this quality and balance  with the inclusion of the proposed additional candidate  potentially leading to a 13-member Board and only 45% of women. Having 50% of women at our Board has been a key ESG initiatives at Ipsos among others which are described in Appendix 2.Up until last week and their discussions with the minority shareholders  it is worth noting that no proxy advisor had raised any concerns about IPSOS’s governance and about its directors or their independence. As a group  we are very committed to these values  and we are committed to the quality of our relationship with our shareholders.Therefore  we would like to draw your attention to some of the proposed resolutions  and more specifically:- Resolution A  shared by a small minority of shareholders to nominate a candidate to the Board of Directors: We strongly recommend you vote AGAINST.The minority shareholders’ proposal would undermine the progress outlined above. The individual proposed for nomination has no demonstrated understanding of our company and sector  appears to have no prior experience as a corporate officer or executive of a listed company  and did not seek to be selected by the Board’s open and transparent process  which seeks to select candidates on the basis of their skills and after meeting with them. Far from benefitting the company  this nomination would only destabilize the business and the progress we have made. It may also undermine our recently appointed new management and new CEO  at a time where the team is delivering good results and developing momentum in the marketplace that is also reflected in the stock price.The minority shareholders’ approach has also been confrontational and not reflective of an investor wanting the best for all shareholders and the company: after sending their request without any notice  they rejected dialogue with Ipsos for two weeks. A meeting was finally held yesterday  May 2nd  where they refused to explain why they believed such an adversarial approach was appropriate  or how that would serve the company’s interest.- Say-on-pay resolutions (items 12  15  16  17  20).We strongly recommend you vote FOR items 12  15  16  17  20 at the Combined General Meeting on May 17.The compensation granted to the executive managers are among the lowest of the SBF120  and Mr. Truchot’s package to reflect the conclusion of his role as Chief Executive Officer was entirely consistent with the strict implementation of the compensation policy  approved by an overwhelming 94% of our shareholders last year – and supported by several proxy advisors.Ipsos considers that the pay-out is objectively benchmarked and reflects full alignment with the performance of the company and shareholders’ interests.All of our compensation decisions are taken by our Compensation Committee that is comprised of independent directors and an employee representative appointed by the Unions  which qualifies it under the AFEP-MEDEF code as 100% independent.It is clear Ipsos is on the right path. Ipsos is creating value for all its shareholders. The fairness of the Resolution 12 about Mr Didier Truchot compensation is further supported by details given in Appendix 3.We hope this letter provides clarification and reassurance about Ipsos’s perspectives and current trajectory and are looking forward to sharing more about Ipsos on May 17th – in the meantime  do not hesitate to contact us should you have any questions on any resolution or the preparation for the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting.Our Chairman of the Board  Our CEO and the Chair of our Nomination Committee  as well as our Investor Relations team are available for any conference calls.Yours sincerely The Board of DirectorsAppendices:- Message of the Chairman dated 19 April about the two independent Directors proposed to the Shareholders - Ipsos ESG initiatives - Resolution 12: further explanations on Chairman and CEO compensation for 2021 - Composition of the Board as at February 1st  2022Appendix 1Message of the Chairman of the Board in the Convening Notice dated 19 April 2022about the two independent Directors proposed to the ShareholdersDear Shareholder We are delighted to invite you to attend the Ipsos Combined General Shareholders’ Meeting to be held at 9:30 am (CET) on May 17  2022 at Ipsos' registered office located 35 rue du Val de Marne in Paris (75013).In 2021  as the covid-19 pandemic continued  your Company's revenues reached a record level of EUR 2 146.7 million and it recorded an organic growth of 17.9%. Operating profit continued to rise and debt fell sharply thanks to excellent free cash flow generation. This extremely solid performance is the result of the good Momentum started in mid-2018 with the launch of the T.U.P. (Total Understanding Project) transformation plan  which had received strong commitment from our employees. Today  it is reflected in the increased confidence of our clients thanks to the adapted and digital solutions that we have been able to make available to them rapidly.2021 was also a year of managerial transition between the Chairman and CEO and founder of Ipsos  Mr. Didier Truchot  and the new CEO  Mr. Ben Page  whom our Board of Directors has chosen to appoint as of 15 November 2021. Ben Page has been with Ipsos since 2005  when the British research company MORI  specialized in social and public opinion research  was acquired by our Company. He was one of the main managers of the company. Under his leadership since 2009  Ipsos MORI has tripled its revenues and has become a major reference in its market. In 2021  Ipsos MORI accounted for nearly 20% of the group's revenues and more than 20% of its operating income.The Board of Directors is convinced that information  when obtained  analyzed and communicated with rigor and clarity by our professionals  is the best ally of the decision makers we support. Their talent combined with the development of our technology platforms allows us to be confident in our ability to maintain profitable growth over the long term.As you will see from the draft resolutions and information published on the Ipsos website  you will be asked to approve 35 resolutions this year  including 23 ordinary resolutions. These resolutions are presented in detail in the report of the Board of Directors to the General Shareholders’ Meeting.We would also like to draw your attention to some of the proposed resolutions  and more specifically the ones concerning:- The ratification of the co-optation by the Board of Directors of Mr. Ben Page  Chief Executive Officer  on October 4  2021  as director (resolution 5);- The ratification of the co-optation on January 12  2022 and the appointment of Mr. Pierre Barnabé as an independent director (resolutions 6 and 7);- The appointment of Mrs. Virginie Calmels as a new independent director (resolution 9) as from the date of the General Meeting.We propose a new balanced composition of the Board of Directors with 12 members  which will include 50% independent directors as required by law  and 50% women. If we take into account the mandate of Mr. Patrick Artus  whom we have reclassified as ""non-independent"" this year solely because of his participation in our Board for more than 12 years  the proportion of external directors is 60%. With regard to the two new terms of office as independent directors submitted for approval at this Meeting  namely those of Virginie Calmels and Pierre Barnabé  we wish to emphasize the important contributions of these individuals.Mrs. Virginie Calmels is President of CV Education  a higher education group specializing in the creative industries and digital marketing  which opened the first FUTURAe school in Boulogne-Billancourt in October 2020. 3 Virginie Calmels is a graduate of the Ecole Supérieure de Commerce de Toulouse and the Insead and also holds a degree in accounting and finance and a diploma in public accounting and auditing. In addition to her significant expertise in financial management  Virginie Calmels has extensive knowledge of digital marketing and is therefore particularly sensitive to Ipsos' business. She therefore has all the skills required to be appointed as an independent director of the Company  as she is or has been an independent director of other listed companies in the TMT sector (Iliad  Assystem  Technicolor). She is also involved in charitable activities which are at the heart of Ipsos' ESG policy.Mr. Pierre Barnabé is a recognized specialist in the technology world. He currently heads the Big Data and Cybersecurity division of Atos and will become CEO of Soitec on May 1. Previously  he was CEO of Alcatel-Lucent France and then Deputy CEO of Bull. He is ranked 16th in The Consulting Report's 50 Leaders in Cybersecurity (October 2021 ranking). Pierre Barnabé is “Chevalier de l'Ordre national du Mérite”. He has been appointed Director of Inria (Institut National de l'Informatique et de l'Automatique) since 2020 and was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Ensimag engineering school in June 2021. He has all the skills required to be appointed as an independent director of the Company and to contribute to the future technological choices of the Ipsos group. We hope these resolutions will meet with your approval. *** We hope you will find this letter helpful  and we would like to thank you for your interest in Ipsos and your backing for all our resolutions.Please do not hesitate to contact us should you have any questions on any resolution or the preparation for the Annual General Shareholders’ Meeting. Yours sincerely Didier Truchot Chairman of the Board of DirectorsAppendix 2Ipsos ESG initiativesOur ESG initiatives are described in details in the section 5.4.1 of our 2021 Annual/Universal Registration Document. Report.In this context  our commitment to sustainable development has been continued and reinforced. Our 2021-2023 CSR roadmap  adopted in February 2021  reflects this commitment:We have set ourselves a target of carbon neutrality by 2035 - five years ahead of the 2040 deadline set by the international community.Our commitment to society is reflected in our commitment to ensuring that the diversity of our teams reflects the diversity of the societies in which we operate; we have continued to increase the proportion of women among our senior managers so that by 2021 we had 35% women and we are committed to reaching 40% by 2023.Our key sustainability targets will continue to be set and monitored by the Board of Directors. Under the leadership of our new CEO Ben Page  Ipsos will continue to develop its roadmap around three pillars: People  Society and Planet.The internal climate surveys carried out regularly demonstrate a higher level of commitment than that of other companies in the service sector and which has increased in recent years  which is explained by the pride of the teams in working in a company whose societal and environmental are recognized.In terms of gender equality and from the point of view of the equity ratio (gap between the executive's salary and the median of employees  which is one of the lowest in the SBF120)  Ipsos considers itself to be ahead.Mrs. Laurence Stoclet  Deputy CEO and Group CFO  had also been invited on October 25  2021 to speak publicly on these subjects  during a round table organized on the occasion of the publication of the “Palmarès de la féminisation” of SBF120 companies’ Boards  sponsored by the Ministry for Equality between Women and Men  Diversity and Equal Opportunities.It is therefore crucial to keep 50% women on our Board of Directors.Another example of our ESG initiatives  Ipsos was the first market research and opinion polling company in the world  in 2008  to join the UN Global Compact and  since then  has been involved in numerous RES initiatives  including actions in favor of Refugees and  through its Foundation created in 2014  in favor of the education of underprivileged children.In 2021  92% of the paper used by Ipsos was recycled.Appendix 3Resolution 12: further explanations on Chairman and CEO compensationfor 2021The Remuneration policy for the Chairman and CEO was described in section 13.1.2 of the 2020 Annual Report/2020 Universal Registration Document (URD) was submitted to the vote of the Shareholders under Resolution 10 at the AGM of May 27th  2021:All the major proxy agencies (Glass Lewis  ISS  Proxinvest) recommended to vote in favor of Resolution 10.The Resolution 10 was consequently adopted at 94.2% at the AGM.It is only logical for it to be considered as due to Mr Didier Truchot as this remuneration policy was very precise and transparent. In particular  about the reasons for the Indemnity in case of cessation of duties:Extract from 2020 URD  section 13.1.2 Compensation of Chairman and CEO13.1.2.7 Termination BenefitsIn the event of the dismissal or termination as the Chairman and CEO  the latter would receive a payment equal to twice his gross compensation received in the calendar year prior to him leaving office. Payment is subject to the following performance condition: Revenue for one of the three years prior to the year of dismissal must be higher  at constant exchange rates  than that of the preceding year. This payment therefore presupposes a progression assessed over at least two financial years  meaning no payment in the event of proven failure by the executive in the last years of his term of office. For reference  this commitment was authorized by the General Shareholders’ Meeting  most recently upon reappointment of the Chairman and CEO at the General Shareholders’ Meeting of April 28  2016 under the procedure for related-party agreements applicable by reference to former Article L. 225-42-1 of the French Commercial Code (now repealed). With the coming into force of the new Say on Pay regime at end-2019  termination benefits are no longer dealt with in this way and are now covered by the new regime.The payment of the compensation is not ruled out in the event that the beneficiary retires in the near future. It should be noted that the Chairman and CEO does not have a supplementary pension scheme from Ipsos  or any other statutory or contractual severance payment  as he does not have an employment contract. It is thus justified and in the Company’s best interests that the Ipsos founding executive who devoted almost all of his career to the company’s expansion should be able to benefit from this payment.13.1.2.8 Supplementary pension schemeThere is no supplementary pension scheme for the Chairman and CEO (or for the other Ipsos SA executive officers); more specifically  there is no top-hat pension scheme.As a matter of fact  Mr Didier Truchot benefits from no defined contribution  complementary pension schemes  401K  or other deferred schemes which are normally available to all employees and which are available to most CEOs of listed companies in France (where standard state pensions are a fraction of past compensation) or abroad where having specific pensions schemes are the rule for all Companies.This is why this indemnity for end of service/duty  whatever was the circumstance or cause  was approved by the Shareholders. It is only fair according to the Board that Mr Didier Truchot receives it. It would be totally illogical and inconsistent not to reconfirm this approval.In addition  the Board draws the attention of the Shareholders to the fact that the Board did not grant Mr Didier Truchot any Performance Free Shares related to the fiscal years 2020 and 2021. The standard remuneration policy for the CEO voted by the Shareholders includes a Performance Free Shares programme which is calling for an allocation of maximum 0 03% of capital (13.330 shares) per year  valued at approximately 400 keuros in 2021.In relation with the fiscal years 2020 and 2021  Mr Didier Truchot did not get those Free Shares allocations.Instead the Board decided to grant him the approved Indemnity for termination of duties as Chairman and CEO so that Mr Didier Truchot receives a fair compensation for the excellent performance of Ipsos in 2020 and in 2021.Mr Didier Truchot  Chairman and CEO compensation (in 2021 : until 14 November 2021) 2020 2021 Average 2 years Amounts due Amounts due Fixed compensation 489 810 437 395 463 602 Annual variable compensation 168 300 345 975 257 138 Annual grant of Performance Shares 0 0 0 Indemnity for termination of duties (1) - 1 081 672 530 836 Compensation allocated for the term of office as Director on the Board 0 0 0 Benefits in kind 0 0 0 Pensions/ Defined contributions / 401 K /… 0 0 0 Total 658 110 1 865 042 1 261 576This indemnity for termination of duties represents less than 2 years of normal compensation as the calculation is based on cash compensation amounts received in 2020  at the time of pandemic  where there was no salary increase and on the contrary a cut of 20% of compensation for 3 months.No other item was received or awarded (multi-annual variable compensation  benefits in kind  compensation for sitting on the Board  severance and/or non-compete payments  supplementary pension scheme).In addition  the benchmark of CEO compensations shows that Mr Didier Truchot compensation for 2020 and 2021 is one of the lowest of SBF120 and Next 80. It is also clearly lower than the compensation of other CEOs of listed market research companies (in average over the two years  his compensation was 10 times lower than one of Ipsos US competitors and half of the one of a UK competitor).In terms of ESG governance  it is to be noted that the Equity Ratio (difference between CEO package and the mean of all employees) is only at X15 and is one of the lowest in the market research industry worldwide and among all worldwide listed companies.The Board of DirectorsAppendix 4Ipsos Board of Directors as at February 1st  2022Nom Gender Nationality Independent Director Appointment and Compensation Committee Audit Committee CSR Committee Didier Truchot – Chairman of the Board of Directors M French NO Ben Page – CEO M British NO Laurence Stoclet – Deputy CEO and Chief Financial Officer F French NO Jennifer Hubber – Chief Client Officer F British NO M Patrick Artus1 M French NO M Pierre Barnabé M French YES M Anne Marion-Bouchacourt F French YES CC Eliane Rouyer-Chevalier F French YES M Filippo Pietro Lo Franco M Italian YES CC Florence von Erb F French YES CC André Lewitcki – Employee representative M French - M Sylvie Mayou – Employee representative F French - M Independence Rate 50% 100 % 66.66 % 50 % Percentage of women 50%Note 1:Patrick Artus was reclassified from ""independent director"" to ""non-independent"" during 2021 because his term of office had exceeded 12 years; without this reclassification  the independence rate would have been 60%.Directors representing employees  designated by the Unions (Force Ouvrière and CFE-CGC) are not included in the calculation of the Board's independence rate  in compliance with the article 8.3 of the AFEP-MEDEF Code to which Ipsos refers.CC = Commitee Chairman / M = MemberABOUT IPSOSIpsos is one of the largest market research and polling companies globally  operating in 90 markets and employing over 18 000 people.Our passionately curious research professionals  analysts and scientists have built unique multi-specialist capabilities that provide true understanding and powerful insights into the actions  opinions and motivations of citizens  consumers  patients  customers or employees.

Subsequent to March 31  2022  we acquired or were under contract to acquire eleven self-storage facilities with 0.9 million net rentable square feet  for $147.2 million.Completed various expansion projects with 0.1 million net rentable square feet costing $19.4 million. At March 31  2022  we had various facilities in development and expansion with 4.8 million net rentable square feet estimated to cost $833.8 million.Raised $250 million in a public offering of our preferred shares.Operating Results for the Three Months Ended March 31  2022For the three months ended March 31  2022  net income allocable to our common shareholders was $464.1 million or $2.63 per diluted common share  compared to $385.8 million or $2.21 per diluted common share in 2021  representing an increase of $78.3 million or $0.42 per diluted common share. The increase is due primarily to (i) a $167.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income and (ii) our $23.6 million equity share of gains on sale of real estate recorded by PS Business Parks  Inc. (""PSB"") in 2022  partially offset by (iii) a $75.3 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense  (iv) a $17.9 million increase in interest expense  (v) a $10.0 million decrease in foreign currency exchange gains associated with our Euro denominated notes payable  and (vi) a $9.4 million gain on sale of real estate recognized in the three months ended March 31  2021.The $167.3 million increase in self-storage net operating income in the three months ended March 31  2022 as compared to the same period in 2021 is a result of a $95.6 million increase in our Same Store Facilities and a $71.7 million increase in our Non-Same Store Facilities (as defined below). Revenues for the Same Store Facilities increased 15.8% or $102.1 million in the three months ended March 31  2022 as compared to 2021  due primarily to higher realized annual rent per available square foot. Cost of operations for the Same Store Facilities increased by 3.6% or $6.5 million in the three months ended March 31  2022 as compared to 2021  due primarily to (i) a 4.8% ($3.2 million) increase in property tax expense  (ii) a 19.0% ($2.5 million) increase in repairs and maintenance expense  and (iii) a 17.5% ($2.3 million) increase in centralized management costs  partially offset by (iv) a 23.1% ($3.4 million) decrease in marketing expenses. The increase in net operating income of $71.7 million for the Non-Same Store Facilities is due primarily to the impact of facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Funds from OperationsFor the three months ended March 31  2022  funds from operations (“FFO”) was $3.83 per diluted common share as compared to $3.08 in the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 24.4%. FFO is a non-GAAP measure defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts and generally represents net income before depreciation and amortization expense  gains and losses and impairment charges with respect to real estate assets. A reconciliation of GAAP diluted net income per share to FFO per share  and additional descriptive information regarding this non-GAAP measure  is attached.We also present “Core FFO” and “Core FFO per share ” non-GAAP measures that represent FFO and FFO per share excluding the impact of (i) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (ii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iii) certain other non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items primarily representing  with respect to the periods presented below  our equity share of the impact of severance of senior executive and casualties from our equity investees. We review Core FFO and Core FFO per share to evaluate our ongoing operating performance  and we believe they are used by investors and REIT analysts in a similar manner. However  Core FFO and Core FFO per share are not substitutes for net income and net income per share. Because other REITs may not compute Core FFO or Core FFO per share in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such measures  Core FFO and Core FFO per share may not be comparable among REITs.The following table reconciles FFO per share to Core FFO per share and FFO to Core FFO  respectively (unaudited):Three Months Ended March 31  2022 2021 Percentage Change (Amounts in thousands  except per share data) Reconciliation of FFO per Share to Core FFO per Share: FFO per share $ 3.83 $ 3.08 24.4 % Eliminate the per share impact of items excluded from Core FFO  including our equity share from investments: Foreign currency exchange gain (0.20 ) (0.26 ) Other items 0.02 — Core FFO per share $ 3.65 $ 2.82 29.4 % Reconciliation of FFO to Core FFO: FFO allocable to common shares $ 676 204 $ 539 254 25.4 % Eliminate the impact of items excluded from Core FFO  including our equity share from investments: Foreign currency exchange gain (35 377 ) (45 385 ) Other items 2 547 (349 ) Core FFO allocable to common shares $ 643 374 $ 493 520 30.4 % Diluted weighted average common shares 176 336 174 840 Core FFO per share $ 3.65 $ 2.82 29.4 %Property Operations – Same Store FacilitiesThe Same Store Facilities consist of facilities that have been owned and operated on a stabilized level of occupancy  revenues  and cost of operations since January 1  2020. The composition of our Same Store Facilities allows us to more effectively evaluate the ongoing performance of our self-storage portfolio in 2020  2021  and 2022 and exclude the impact of fill-up of unstabilized facilities  which can significantly affect operating trends. We believe the Same Store information is used by investors and analysts in a similar manner. However  because other REITs may not compute Same Store Facilities in the same manner as we do  may not use the same terminology  or may not present such a measure  Same Store Facilities may not be comparable among REITs. The following table summarizes the historical operating results of these 2 282 facilities (149.5 million net rentable square feet) that represent approximately 75% of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our U.S. consolidated self-storage portfolio at March 31  2022 (unaudited):Three Months Ended March 31  2022 2021 Percentage Change (Dollar amounts in thousands  except for per square foot data) Revenues (a): Rental income $ 725 433 $ 627 153 15.7% Late charges and administrative fees 23 837 20 047 18.9% Total revenues 749 270 647 200 15.8% Direct cost of operations (a): Property taxes 70 004 66 782 4.8% On-site property manager payroll 30 700 28 744 6.8% Repairs and maintenance (f) 15 490 13 021 19.0% Utilities 11 446 10 796 6.0% Marketing 11 240 14 610 (23.1) % Other direct property costs 20 066 18 364 9.3% Total direct cost of operations 158 946 152 317 4.4% Direct net operating income (b) 590 324 494 883 19.3% Indirect cost of operations (a): Supervisory payroll (9 567) (10 330) (7.4) % Centralized management costs (15 557) (13 237) 17.5% Share-based compensation (3 859) (5 535) (30.3) % Net operating income (c) $ 561 341 $ 465 781 20.5% Gross margin (before indirect costs  depreciation and amortization expense) 78.8% 76.5% 3.0% Gross margin (before depreciation and amortization expense) 74.9% 72.0% 4.0% Weighted average for the period: Square foot occupancy 95.6% 95.6% —% Realized annual rental income per (d): Occupied square foot $ 20.29 $ 17.54 15.7% Available square foot $ 19.40 $ 16.78 15.6% At March 31: Square foot occupancy 95.1% 95.9% (0.8) % Annual contract rent per occupied square foot (e) $ 20.84 $ 17.97 16.0%(a) Revenues and cost of operations do not include tenant reinsurance and merchandise sales and expenses generated at the facilities. (b) Direct net operating income (“Direct NOI”)  a subtotal within NOI  is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the impact of supervisory payroll  centralized management costs  and share-based compensation in addition to depreciation and amortization expense. We utilize direct net operating income in evaluating property performance and in evaluating property operating trends as compared to our competitors. (c) See attached reconciliation of self-storage NOI to net income. (d) Realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the weighted average occupied square feet for the period. Realized annual rent per available square foot (“REVPAF”) is computed by dividing annualized rental income  before late charges and administrative fees  by the total available rentable square feet for the period. These measures exclude late charges and administrative fees in order to provide a better measure of our ongoing level of revenue. Late charges are dependent upon the level of delinquency  and administrative fees are dependent upon the level of move-ins. In addition  the rates charged for late charges and administrative fees can vary independently from rental rates. These measures take into consideration promotional discounts  which reduce rental income. (e) Annual contract rent represents the agreed upon monthly rate that is paid by our tenants in place at the time of measurement. Contract rates are initially set in the lease agreement upon move-in  and we adjust them from time to time with notice. Contract rent excludes other fees that are charged on a per-item basis  such as late charges and administrative fees  does not reflect the impact of promotional discounts  and does not reflect the impact of rents that are written off as uncollectible. (f) Repairs and maintenance expense includes snow removal costs totaling $3.3 million and $2.0 million in the three months ended March 31  2022 and 2021  respectively.Property Operations – Non-Same Store FacilitiesIn addition to the 2 282 Same Store Facilities  we have 515 facilities that were not stabilized with respect to occupancies  revenues  or cost of operations since January 1  2020 or that we did not own as of January 1  2020  including 304 facilities that were acquired  54 newly developed facilities  91 facilities that have been expanded or are targeted for expansion  and 66 facilities that are unstabilized because they are under fill-up or were damaged in casualty events (collectively  the “Non-Same Store Facilities”). Operating data  metrics  and further commentary with respect to these facilities  including detail by vintage  are included in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under “Analysis of Net Income - Self-Storage Operations” in our March 31  2022 Form 10-Q.Investing and Capital ActivitiesDuring the three months ended March 31  2022  we acquired ten self-storage facilities (three in Texas and one each in Arizona  Indiana  Maryland  Minnesota  North Carolina  Nevada  and Pennsylvania) with 0.8 million net rentable square feet for $127.7 million.Subsequent to March 31  2022  we acquired or were under contract to acquire eleven self-storage facilities across nine states with 0.9 million net rentable square feet  for $147.2 million.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 48 properties (4.1 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of ezStorage for $1.8 billion  which includes 47 self-storage facilities and a property that is under construction. These facilities generated revenues of $24.0 million  NOI of $18.6 million (including Direct NOI of $19.4 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 88.0% for the three months ended March 31  2022.During 2021  we acquired a portfolio of 56 properties (7.5 million net rentable square feet) operated under the brand name of All Storage for $1.5 billion  with 55 properties closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 and one property closed in February 2022. These facilities generated revenues of $16.8 million  NOI of $10.5 million (including Direct NOI of $11.2 million)  and average square footage occupancy of 77.3% for the three months ended March 31  2022.During the three months ended March 31  2022  we completed various expansion projects (0.1 million net rentable square feet) costing $19.4 million. At March 31  2022  we had various facilities in development (2.2 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $406.1 million and various expansion projects (2.6 million net rentable square feet) estimated to cost $427.7 million. Our aggregate 4.8 million net rentable square foot pipeline of development and expansion facilities includes 1.2 million in California  0.6 million in Florida  0.5 million in Texas  0.4 million in Maryland  0.3 million each in New Jersey and Washington  0.2 million each in Hawaii  Michigan  Nevada and New York  and 0.7 million in other states. The remaining $496.2 million of development costs for these projects is expected to be incurred primarily in the next 18 to 24 months.On January 13  2022  we issued our 4.100% Series S Preferred Shares for gross proceeds of $250.0 million.On April 24  2022  PSB entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the ""Merger Agreement"") whereby affiliates of Blackstone Real Estate (""Blackstone"") will acquire all outstanding shares of PSB's common stock for $187.50 per share in cash. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement  each share of PSB common stock and each common unit of partnership interest will be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to $187.50  without interest. If the transaction is consummated  we expect to (i) receive approximately $2.7 billion of cash proceeds in exchange for the approximate 41% common equity interest we hold in PSB  (ii) recognize an approximate $2.2 billion gain on the sale of our equity investment in PSB in the Consolidated Statement of Income  and (iii) distribute a $2.3 billion estimated tax gain on the sale to our common shareholders. The merger transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2022  however  the merger transaction is subject to customary closing conditions  including approval by PSB’s common stockholders. Pursuant to a support agreement entered into with PSB and Blackstone  we have committed to vote our equity interests in favor of the transaction  subject to certain conditions. Following consummation of the transaction  our future operating results will no longer reflect contributions from our investment in PSB. For the three months ended March 31  2022 and 2021  our share of earnings from PSB contributed $25.5 million and $24.2 million  respectively  to Core FFO.Distributions DeclaredOn April 28  2022  our Board of Trustees declared a regular common quarterly dividend of $2.00 per common share. The Board also declared dividends with respect to our various series of preferred shares. All the dividends are payable on June 30  2022 to shareholders of record as of June 15  2022.Outlook for the Year Ending December 31  2022The following table outlines the Company’s Core FFO per share estimate and certain underlying assumptions for the year ending December 31  2022  excluding estimates for the impact of the potential sale of our investment in PSB pursuant to PSB's merger agreement with Blackstone:Guidance Ranges for 2022 Low High (Amounts in thousands  except per share data) Same Store: Revenue growth 12.00% 15.00% Expense growth 6.00% 8.00% Net operating income growth 13.40% 18.00% Acquisitions $1 000 000 Development openings $250 000 Non-Same Store net operating income $430 000 $470 000 Ancillary net operating income $150 000 $155 000 General and administrative expense $105 000 $111 000 Interest expense $152 000 $160 000 Preferred dividends $195 000 Capital expenditures $300 000 Core FFO per share $14.75 $15.65 Incremental Non-Same Store NOI to stabilization (2023 and beyond) $180 000Forward-looking Core FFO per share measures exclude estimates for the impact of (i) potential sale of our investment in PSB pursuant to PSB's merger agreement with Blackstone  (ii) foreign currency exchange gains and losses  (iii) charges related to the redemption of preferred securities  and (iv) certain other significant non-cash and/or nonrecurring income or expense items such as loss contingency accruals  casualties  transactional due diligence  and advisory costs. Public Storage is unable to provide a reconciliation of Core FFO per share guidance measures to corresponding U.S. GAAP measures on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort due to the overall high variability of most of the foregoing items that have been excluded. The items that are being excluded are difficult to predict and a reconciliation could result in disclosure that would be imprecise or potentially misleading. Material changes to any one of these items could have a significant effect on our guidance and future U.S. GAAP results.First Quarter Conference CallA conference call is scheduled for May 4  2022 at 9:00 a.m. (PDT) to discuss the first quarter earnings results.

with the non-GAAP measure FAD  are considered helpful measures of REIT performance by REITs and many REIT analysts. FFO represents GAAP net income before depreciation and amortization  real estate gains or losses and impairment charges  which are excluded because they are based upon historical costs and assume that building values diminish ratably over time  while we believe that real estate values fluctuate due to market conditions. FAD represents FFO adjusted to exclude certain non-cash charges and to deduct capital expenditures. We utilize FAD in evaluating our ongoing cash flow available for investment  debt repayment and common distributions. We believe investors and analysts utilize FAD in a similar manner. FFO and FFO per share are not a substitute for net income or earnings per share. FFO and FAD are not substitutes for GAAP net cash flow in evaluating our liquidity or ability to pay dividends  because they exclude investing and financing activities presented on our statements of cash flows. In addition  other REITs may compute these measures differently  so comparisons among REITs may not be helpful.PUBLIC STORAGE SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Reconciliation of Self-Storage Net Operating Income to Net Income (Unaudited – amounts in thousands) Three Months Ended March 31  2022 2021 Self-storage revenues for: Same Store Facilities $ 749 270 $ 647 200 Acquired facilities 86 371 11 123 Newly developed and expanded facilities 60 076 41 477 Other non-same store facilities 21 298 16 547 Self-storage revenues 917 015 716 347 Self-storage cost of operations for: Same Store Facilities 187 929 181 419 Acquired facilities 31 031 7 177 Newly developed and expanded facilities 19 417 17 335 Other non-same store facilities 7 117 6 174 Self-storage cost of operations 245 494 212 105 Self-storage NOI for: Same Store Facilities 561 341 465 781 Acquired facilities 55 340 3 946 Newly developed and expanded facilities 40 659 24 142 Other non-same store facilities 14 181 10 373 Self-storage NOI (a) 671 521 504 242 Ancillary revenues 56 430 50 915 Ancillary cost of operations (15 515 ) (16 318 ) Depreciation and amortization (222 128 ) (146 859 ) General and administrative expense (23 069 ) (19 574 ) Interest and other income 3 379 2 852 Interest expense (33 124 ) (15 250 ) Equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate entities 43 424 19 456 Gain on sale of real estate — 9 413 Foreign currency exchange gain 35 377 45 385 Net income on our income statement $ 516 295 $ 434 262",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.02,neutral,0.04,0.89,0.08,True,English,"['Public Storage Reports Results', 'Three Months', 'Same Store direct net operating income margin', '0.8 million net rentable square feet', '0.9 million net rentable square feet', '0.1 million net rentable square feet', '4.8 million net rentable square feet', 'higher realized annual rent', 'foreign currency exchange gains', 'self-storage net operating income', 'The Public Storage team', 'Real Estate Investment Trusts', 'available square foot', 'ten self-storage facilities', 'eleven self-storage facilities', 'Euro denominated notes', 'centralized management costs', 'additional descriptive information', 'ongoing operating performance', 'Non-Same Store Facilities', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'multi-factor external growth', 'balance sheet strength', 'PS Business Parks', 'real estate assets', 'Same Store revenues', 'various expansion projects', 'net income', '$23.6 million equity share', 'operating strength', 'operating results', 'diluted common share', 'nonrecurring income', 'various facilities', '1.8 million customers', '$9.4 million gain', 'same period', 'public offering', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'revenue growth', 'exceptional performance', 'senior executive', '$10.0 million decrease', '$167.3 million increase', '$75.3 million increase', '$17.9 million increase', '$95.6 million increase', '$71.7 million increase', 'equity investees', 'common shareholders', 'three months', 'first quarter', 'Joe Russell', 'industry-leading platform', 'first-mover technologies', 'preferred shares', 'amortization expense', 'interest expense', 'tax expense', 'maintenance expense', 'marketing expenses', 'GAAP measure', 'National Association', 'preferred securities', 'other non-cash', 'expense items', 'REIT analysts', 'similar manner', 'GAAP diluted', 'impairment charges', 'core FFO', '15.8% increase', 'GLENDALE', 'Calif.', 'NYSE', 'PSA', 'needs', 'President', 'Highlights', 'March', 'contract', 'development', 'sale', 'PSB', 'depreciation', 'operations', 'property', 'repairs', 'impact', 'fill-up', 'Funds', 'losses', 'respect', 'reconciliation', 'redemption', 'periods', 'severance', 'casualties', 'investors', '2021', '4.8% ($']",2022-05-03,2022-05-04,businesswire.com

4158,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.gov.uk/hmrc-internal-manuals/stamp-taxes-shares-manual/stsm999999,Stamp Taxes on Shares Manual,Guidance on Stamp Taxes on Shares and other Securities - Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Reserve Tax (SDRT),The following is an alphabetical list of some of the legal terms that commonly occur in the financial securities industry and to Stamp Duty and SDRT. This edition draws on and encompasses the earlier Stamp Duty and SDRT Glossaries detailed in the Stamp Office Manual and incorporates new words and phrases that have emerged in the stock markets or have significance to SDRT.Some of the terms used in the financial world have precise meanings for some people but are generic for other individuals. This glossary should therefore be seen as a guide but not as authority. The glossary does not pretend to be comprehensive  given the huge vocabulary of the financial sector  but is intended as an aide memoir to assist with understanding.Where acronyms and other initials are used in this Glossary  they are listed in their strict alphabetical order rather than under their full name. Thus  for example  AIM will be found between ‘Agreement’ and ‘Allotment’.Suggestions for future insertions will be gratefully received and forwarded to:HMRC Stamp TaxesSDRT Technical Adviser100 Parliament StreetLondonSW1A 2BQA B C D E F G H I J L M N O P Q R S T U V W XAABSOLUTE INTERESTA full and complete right or title to  or estate in stocks and shares combining both the legal and beneficial interests.ACCOUNTABLE PERSONThe person who has statutory responsibility for the payment of SDRT to the HM Revenue & Customs.

When the document is stamped with the duty assessed upon it a further stamp is impressed which denotes that it is then ‘Adjudged duly stamped’ or ‘Adjudged Not Chargeable with any duty’. The impression of the adjudication stamp on a document is conclusive and precludes any future question being raised by Stamp Taxes or a third party as the correctness of the stamping.The adjudication process is compulsory for various claims to stamp exemption and/or relief. This includes  share purchases undertaken by recognised charities  sales of securities to intermediaries  stock lending arrangements  company acquisitions and transactions between associated companies.ADRAn American Depositary Receipt (ADR) allows US investors to own shares in non-US companies.

When a security is transformed from one ISIN code to another  CREST will automatically transform open bargains in order to create new replacement transactions in the new ISIN(s) by centrally deleting the open transaction and replacing it with a new transaction.The replacement transaction is centrally generated by CREST with Transaction Stamp Status value ‘N’ (no SDRT liability  result of automatic transformation).

CREST is currently only able to settle UK and Irish company shares (securities) that are listed on a stock exchange.In general terms  shares in companies that do not have an exchange listing and therefore are not capable of being settled in CREST are called ‘residual securities’.UK registered residual securities are regarded as being ‘stock or marketable securities’ for Stamp Duty charging purposes and ‘chargeable securities’ for SDRT.REVERSE STOCK SPLITA reduction in the number of a company’s shares in circulation but the value of its remaining shares enhanced. For example  a 1:2 reverse split means that a holding of 100 shares valued at a market price of £2 per share is reduced to 50 shares but at a market value of £4 per share.Companies undertake reverse stock splits for a variety of reasons - to avoid its shares being delisted on an exchange  make their shares appear more valuable  although in reality nothing changes.

For further information  please see “Other developments”Story continuesFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR JANUARY-MARCH 2022Sampo Group’s core business  P&C insurance  reported an underwriting profit of EUR 290 million (317) in January-March 2022. Excluding COVID-19 effects reported in the first quarter of 2021  underwriting profit grew 4 per cent. The Group combined ratio increased by 2.3 percentage points to 83.5 per cent (81.2)  driven mainly by the economic activity returning back to normal levels as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted during the quarter. Excluding the COVID-19 effects reported in If and Topdanmark in the first quarter of 2021  the combined ratio improved by 0.1 percentage points from 83.6 per cent a year ago. Gross written premiums increased by 7 per cent to EUR 2 833 million  supported by strong renewals and high retention. Sampo targets mid-single digit per cent underwriting profit growth on average and a combined ratio below 86 per cent for 2021-2023.If P&C continued its strong performance and achieved an underwriting profit of EUR 234 million (213)  representing a year-on-year growth of 10 per cent. The growth was driven by 0.7 percentage points improvement in the combined ratio to 80.8 per cent (81.5) and a strong 6.9 per cent currency adjusted premium growth. Premiums grew in all Business Areas and markets  supported by strong 1 January renewals with rate increases  high retention and an increase in customer count. If’s adjusted risk ratio improved by 0.7 percentage points year-on-year. Effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic were well below those observed in 2021 and have therefore not been quantified. Profit before taxes increased to EUR 283 million (257).Topdanmark’s profit before taxes decreased to EUR 37 million (137) in Sampo Group’s profit and loss account. The combined ratio was 87.8 per cent (84.7).Hastings’ performance in the first quarter was affected by challenging UK motor insurance market  with competitive pricing and elevated claims inflation. Hastings has taken a disciplined approach to pricing  leading to rate driven currency adjusted premium growth of 10 per cent and broadly stable policy count from year-end. Home insurance policies grew by 18 per cent year-on-year. The operating ratio increased to 92.5 per cent (75.1)  mainly as a result of a reduction in COVID-19 effects. Hastings profit before taxes excluding non-operational depreciation and amortisation amounted to EUR 17 million (56) and reported profit before taxes stood at EUR 2 million (46).Mandatum segment’s profit before taxes for January-March 2022 increased to EUR 80 million (76). Despite the uncertain market situation  Mandatum’s unit-linked and other client assets under management remained near record high levels at EUR 10.9 billion (11.1)  as net flows partly offset adverse market developments. Mandatum Life’s Solvency II ratio increased to 216 per cent (190)  as weak mark-to-market investment results were more than offset by increasing interest rates and a decrease in the symmetric adjustment.Holding segment’s profit before taxes increased to EUR 164 million (115)  including a dividend of EUR 157 million from Nordea and a gain of EUR 28 million from the sale of 19 million Nordea shares in the open market. During April 2022  Sampo completed the exit from Nordea and stated that management will propose that a new share buyback programme is launched after the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2022  subject to the AGM renewing the Board authorisation on share repurchases.The share buyback programme of EUR 750 million launched on October 2021 was completed on 25 March 2022. In total  Sampo repurchased 17.1 million own shares  corresponding to 3.1 per cent of all shares. The repurchased shares were cancelled on 31 March 2022. On 30 March 2022  Sampo launched a new buyback programme of up to EUR 250 million.Sampo Group’s Solvency II ratio increased to 200 per cent (185) over the quarter  net of dividend accrual based on the 2021 insurance dividend of EUR 1.70 per share and the new buyback programme of EUR 250 million. The improvement of 15 percentage points from year-end 2021 was mainly driven by rising interest rates and a decline in the symmetric adjustment. Sampo targets a solvency ratio of 170-190 per cent. The sale of Sampo's remaining Nordea shares in April is expected to add approximately 30 percentage points to the group solvency ratio.Sampo Group’s financial leverage increased to 24.8 per cent from 23.8 per cent at the end of 2021  driven by a decrease in equity. Adjusted for the proposed dividend and ongoing buyback programme  the financial leverage amounted to 29.0 per cent (27.9). Sampo targets a financial leverage below 30 per cent.Sampo plc’s Annual General Meeting will be held on 18 May 2022. The Board has proposed on 9 February 2022 to the AGM a dividend of EUR 4.10 per share  of which the insurance dividend is EUR 1.70 per share.GROUP CEO’S COMMENTSampo’s first quarter performance proved resilient to the increase in economic and geopolitical uncertainty observed during the year  most notably in relation to the tragic and unjustified war in Ukraine. We have achieved excellent P&C underwriting results and our balance sheet remains solid  allowing the launch of a new buyback programme. In addition  we continued to execute on our strategic agenda by completing the exit from Nordea during April.Taking a closer look at P&C insurance  our largest operation  If P&C  delivered an excellent quarter. Premium growth stood at 7 per cent year-on-year even though new car sales declined by around 20 per cent across the Nordic region. Underlying margins were also robust  with a record-strong combined ratio of 80.8 per cent despite above-expected large losses and loss frequencies returning close to normal levels after pandemic related restrictions ended.The rise in energy and commodity prices triggered by the war in Ukraine has increased uncertainty over the trajectory of inflation  both in terms of broader consumer prices and with regard to the cost of insurance claims. We have continued to observe claims inflation at around three per cent in the Nordic region during 2022  broadly at the same level as at the end of 2021  helped by our multi-year procurement agreements. Nonetheless  given the eternal external environment we see potential upside risk to this figure as we progress through the year. Hence  we are pricing on the basis of prudent assumptions and working closely with customers to ensure that the right coverage is in place. Premium growth and retention have both been excellent across all If P&C’s business areas in the first quarter  which gives me confidence in our ability to navigate the operating environment.The interaction between Hastings and If P&C is intensifying; I see significant cultural overlap between the two organisations that will create value over time. In the first quarter  conditions in the UK motor market have been challenging  with elevated claims inflation putting pressure on underwriting margins. Hastings has remained disciplined in its pricing  increasing rates to cover rising claims costs  which has supported premium growth of 10 per cent. Meanwhile  the home insurance book has made excellent progress as policy count grew by 18 per cent year-on-year.Capital markets were volatile in the first quarter. Higher interest rates are having a positive economic effect on our business through increased reinvestment rates and lower liability values. Due to the short duration of our fixed income portfolio  we are relatively well positioned to rotate into higher yielding instruments. On the downside  wider credit spreads and a decline in equity markets had a negative impact on investment return in the first quarter.Sampo’s balance sheet has been resilient to the increase in uncertainty  as both capital and financial leverage have remained at or above target levels. Hence  we were able to launch a new EUR 250 million share buyback programme shortly after completing the EUR 750 million programme launched last year.On 29 April  Sampo reached a key milestone in its strategy by completing the exit from Nordea  thus becoming a pure insurance group. With a clearer focus for both management and shareholders  I am confident that we have a robust foundation for even stronger operational and value creation. The exit from Nordea also further increases the Group’s resilience by reducing our exposure to market risk. Following the sale  management intends to propose to the Board that a new share buyback programme is launched after the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2022.Looking to the rest of the year  I am optimistic about the performance of our excellent P&C operations and remain committed to our P&C insurance focused strategy.Torbjörn MagnussonGroup CEO and PresidentOUTLOOKOutlook for 2022Sampo Group’s P&C insurance operations are expected to achieve underwriting margins that meet the annual targets set for 2021-2023. At Group level  Sampo targets a combined ratio of below 86 per cent  while the target for its largest subsidiary  If P&C  is below 85 per cent. Hastings targets an operating ratio of below 88 per cent. Following strong performance in the first quarter  the outlook for If P&C’s 2022 combined ratio has been improved to 82–84 per cent.The combined and operating ratios of Sampo Group’s P&C insurance operations are subject to volatility driven by  among other factors  seasonal weather patterns  large claims  prior year development and fluctuations in claims frequency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects are particularly relevant for individual segments and business areas  such as the Danish and UK operations.The mark-to-market component of investment returns will be significantly influenced by capital markets’ developments  particularly in life insurance.With regard to Topdanmark  reference is made to the profit forecast model that the company publishes on a quarterly basis.The major risks and uncertainties for the Group in the near-termIn its current day-to-day business activities Sampo Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties  mainly through its major business units.Major risks affecting the Group companies’ profitability and its variation are market  credit  insurance and operational risks. At the Group level  sources of risks are the same  although they are not directly additive due to the effects of diversification.Uncertainties in the form of major unforeseen events may have an immediate impact on the Group’s profitability. The identification of unforeseen events is easier than the estimation of their probabilities  timing  and potential outcomes. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic a combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus  supply chain problems and elevated demand for consumer goods have led to high levels of inflation  with energy and product prices being particularly affected. More recently the war in Ukraine has created a new negative supply shock for the global economy depressing economic growth and further pushing up the prices of commodities and energy. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine are consequently currently causing significant uncertainties on economic and capital market development. There are also a number of widely identified macroeconomic  political and other sources of uncertainty which can  in various ways  affect the financial services industry in a negative manner.Other sources of uncertainty are unforeseen structural changes in the business environment and already identified trends and potential wide-impact events. These external drivers may have a long-term impact on how Sampo Group’s business will be conducted. Examples of identified trends are demographic changes  sustainability issues  and technological developments in areas such as artificial intelligence and digitalisation including threats posed by cybercrime.OTHER DEVELOPMENTSDividend proposalOn 9 February 2022  the Sampo Board proposed to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 4.10 per share for the 2021 financial year. The dividend is proposed to be paid to the shareholders registered in the Register of Shareholders held by Euroclear Finland Oy as at the record date of 20 May 2022. The Board proposes that the dividends be paid on 31 May 2022. The full dividend proposal is available on www.sampo.com/agm.Effects of external events on Sampo GroupThe first quarter saw an increase in geopolitical uncertainty as Russia launched an invasion into neighbouring Ukraine. The Group has limited insurance exposures in the affected region through certain Nordic industrial lines clients and coverage is subject to war exclusions. On the asset side  Sampo has no material direct investments in Russia or Ukraine.Given the limited direct exposure  the biggest risk from the war in Ukraine to Sampo relates to second order capital markets and macroeconomic effects. The Group carries substantial market risk exposures via its strategic investments and through insurance company investment portfolios and liabilities  which may be adversely affected by market shocks. This risk taking is supported by financial buffers calibrated to withstand volatility  and Sampo operated above its target financial strength levels at the end of the first quarter of 2022.Macroeconomic effects could also have an impact on Sampo’s operational business  for example by reducing economic growth  aggravating supply chain problems and inflating commodity prices. These considerations are particularly relevant as supply chain disruption and high inflation had already become established prior to the invasion following the COVID-19 pandemic and associated monetary and fiscal stimulus programmes.In the Nordic and Baltic countries  COVID-19 effects in the quarter were materially below the levels observed over 2021. Motor claims frequencies were affected by pandemic-related restrictions in the first part of the quarter but later returned toward pre-pandemic levels. In the UK  motor claims frequencies have increased as restrictions were lifted but remain below pre-COVID-19 levels. Given the limited impact of COVID-19 and the increasing difficulty in reliably estimating associated effects  Sampo has decided not to provide any quantitative disclosure of COVID-19 effects in the first quarter.EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODShare buyback programmeSampo’s share buyback programme announced on 30 March 2022 continued after the end of the reporting period. By Friday 29 April 2022 market close  the company had bought in total 2 851 150 Sampo A shares representing 0.53 per cent of the total number of shares in Sampo plc. The progress of the buyback programme can be followed on www.sampo.com/releases.Disposals of Nordea sharesSampo sold all of its remaining Nordea holding in April  after the end of the reporting period  through an accelerated bookbuild offering of 200 million shares on 29 April and the sale of 26 million shares in the open market. The transactions generated total gross proceeds of EUR 2.1 billion and will have a positive accounting effect of approximately EUR 82 million on Sampo’s consolidated statement of profit and loss.In connection with disclosing the results of the bookbuild offering  Sampo disclosed that management intends to propose to the Board that a new share buyback programme is launched after the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2022  subject to the AGM renewing the Board authorisation on share repurchases.SAMPO PLCBoard of DirectorsFor more information  please contactKnut Arne Alsaker  Group CFO  tel. +358 10 516 0010Sami Taipalus  Head of Investor Relations  tel. +358 10 516 0030Maria Silander  Communications Manager  Media Relations  tel. +358 10 516 0031Conference callAn English-language conference call for investors and analysts will be arranged at 4 pm Finnish time (2 pm UK time).

The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.Previous outlookSuominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2022 will decrease from 2021. The main reasons are inventory levels which still remain high at certain customers as well as operational issues in the entire supply chain due to the current COVID-19 situation  both of which will impact the result negatively especially in the first quarter. In 2021  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.Story continuesPetri Helsky  President & CEO:“For Suominen the beginning of 2022 has been challenging as was expected. Certain key customers especially in the US continued to struggle with their inventory levels. Furthermore  in the early part of the year both our and our customers’ operations were affected by the omicron variant of the COVID-19. Both of these factors impacted our sales negatively. On the cost side we have seen further sharp increases in raw material  energy and freight costs. Due to the lag in our sales pricing mechanisms our pricing in the first quarter did not fully reflect these increases.We condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine and we feel deeply for all Ukrainians whose lives have been devastated by Russia’s incredulous aggression. The war has minor direct impact to Suominen’s business as we have had no suppliers in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine and only very few customers in Russia. Since the war started  we have stopped all sales to Russia. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the invasion which contribute to the significant cost inflation mentioned above.Our net sales were EUR 110.3 million (115.3) in the first quarter. Sales volumes decreased from the COVID-19 boom levels while sales prices increased clearly following the higher raw material prices. Our quarterly EBITDA was EUR 3.3 million (18.5). The main reasons for the decline were the lower volumes and the timing gap between our customer pricing and raw material  energy and freight costs which increased even more than the sales prices.To improve our financial performance  we have launched an EBITDA improvement program to identify both new sales opportunities and cost savings initiatives. As an example of actions taken  we implemented an energy surcharge to all our products sold in Europe in mid-March. Also  as the inventory issues in the US are mainly related to a certain product group  we have been working to widen the product portfolio at the production lines especially affected by the inventory imbalance.In line with our vision to be the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens we are continuously developing our sustainable product offering. During the quarter  we launched our first carbon neutral product BIOLACE® Zero. Our efforts in the sustainability area were also recognized at the IDEA®22 Conference with our HYDRASPUN® Aquaflo winning the Nonwoven Product Achievement Award.The near future continues to look challenging. The war in Ukraine has worsened the inflationary pressures in raw material  energy and freight costs and increased uncertainty overall. The inventory levels at our certain US key customers have remained elevated despite a decreasing trend supported by solid end consumer demand. However  we are more optimistic about the second half of the year. We are seeing signs of the raw material cost inflation moderating from the third quarter onwards and we also expect improved demand for our products through normalization of the US inventory levels and our portfolio widening actions mentioned above.NET SALESIn January–March 2022  Suominen’s net sales decreased by 4% from the comparison period to EUR 110.3 million (115.3). Sales volumes decreased while sales prices increased following the higher raw material prices. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 4.6 million.Suominen has two business areas  Americas and Europe. Net sales of the Americas business area were EUR 61.7 million (71.9) and net sales of the Europe business area were EUR 48.5 million (43.4).EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULTEBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) declined to EUR 3.3 million (18.5). This was driven by lower sales volumes and the timing gap between the higher raw material  energy and freight costs and sales pricing. The positive impact from currencies on EBITDA was EUR 0.6 million.Operating profit decreased to EUR -1.3 million (13.6).Result before income taxes was EUR -2.2 million (16.9)  and result for the reporting period was EUR -2.3 million (13.8). In the comparison period  the sale of Amerplast impacted the result positively by EUR 3.7 million.FINANCINGThe Group’s net interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value amounted to EUR 53.8 million (20.2) at the end of the review period. The gearing ratio was 35.0% (13.3%) and the equity ratio 39.8% (43.9%).In January–March  net financial expenses were EUR -0.9 million (+3.3)  or -0.8% (2.8%) of net sales. The net financial expenses of the comparison period include a gain of EUR 3.7 million arising from the sale of Amerplast. Fluctuations in exchange rates decreased the net financial items by EUR 0.7 million. In the comparison period the fluctuations in exchange rates decreased the net financial items by EUR 0.7 million.Cash flow from operations was EUR -2.7 million (16.0)  representing a cash flow per share of EUR -0.05 (0.28). The decline in the cash flow from operations was mainly due to the lower result. An additional EUR 4.3 million was tied up in working capital (in Q1 2021: tied up additional EUR 2.2 million).CAPITAL EXPENDITUREThe gross capital expenditure totaled EUR 1.8 million (5.2) and was mainly related to normal maintenance investments.Depreciation and amortization for the review period amounted to EUR 4.6 million (4.9).PROGRESS IN SUSTAINABILITYWe have strong focus on safety and accident prevention  and our long-term target is to have zero lost time accidents. In the first quarter there were no LTA’s at Suominen sites.The employee-manager performance and development discussions  conducted in February–March  covered 98% of the white-collar employees. Our target is to develop and harmonize the performance and development process for our blue-collar employees globally.We are committed to continuously improving our production efficiency and the efficient utilization of natural resources. In the first quarter we continued our active measures towards our targets to reduce energy consumption  greenhouse gas emissions  water consumption and waste to landfill by 20% per ton of product by 2025 compared to the base year of 2019. As an example of our concrete actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions we installed solar panels to our Alicante plant during the first quarter of the year.We offer a comprehensive portfolio of sustainable nonwovens to our customers and we are continuously developing new and innovative solutions with a reduced environmental impact. During the first quarter of 2022 we launched our first carbon neutral product BIOLACE® Zero. Our target is a 50% increase in sales of sustainable nonwovens by 2025 compared to 2019  and to have over 10 sustainable product launches per year.Suominen reports progress in its key sustainability KPIs annually.As part of our Annual Report 2021 published on March 2  2022 we reported on the progress of our sustainability performance. Our sustainability reporting in 2021 was done in accordance with the Core option of the GRI Standards from the Global Reporting Initiative and it was assured by an external partner.INFORMATION ON SHARES AND SHARE CAPITALShare capitalThe number of Suominen’s registered shares was 58 259 219 shares on March 31  2022  equaling to a share capital of EUR 11 860 056.00.Share trading and priceThe number of Suominen Corporation shares traded on Nasdaq Helsinki from January 1 to March 31  2022 was 7 195 433 shares  accounting for 12.6% of the average number of shares (excluding treasury shares).

At the same time the total holding of Erkki Etola and companies controlled by him in Suominen Corporation crossed the 20% flagging threshold.February 25  2022: The shareholding of Etola Group Oy  controlled by Mr. Erkki Etola  in Suominen Corporation crossed the 5% flagging threshold.January 20  2022: The shareholding of Ilmarinen Mutual Pension Insurance Company in Suominen Corporation fell below the threshold of 5%.SHORT TERM RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIESThe raw material  energy and logistics markets relevant for Suominen continue to experience significant volatility and cost inflation. This can impact Suominen’s financial performance depending on how the markets develop.Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have very few customers and no suppliers in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation mentioned above.Also the COVID-19 pandemic can still cause uncertainty in Suominen’s business environment. The key risks related to the virus concern the health and safety of Suominen personnel and customers  possible shortages of raw materials and issues linked to logistics  as well as potential closures of customers’ or our own plants due to virus infections. Our customers have generally performed well financially even during the pandemic and thus our customer credit risks have not materially increased.Suominen’s other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability and customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks.A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen’s Annual Report 2021 at suominen.fi/investors.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  the pandemic-caused demand spike followed by moderation of said demand has led to an inventory imbalance in the whole supply chain especially in the US which still partially persists.The war in Ukraine has worsened the inflationary pressures in raw material  energy and freight costs and increased uncertainty overall. However  we are seeing signs of the raw material cost inflation moderating from the third quarter onwards and we also expect normalization of the US inventory levels going forward.OUTLOOK FOR 2022Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2022 will decrease clearly from 2021. The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT AND REMUNERATION REPORTSuominen has prepared a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for2021  which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listedcompanies.

Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.The link between the components of the key ratios per share and the consolidated financial statements is presented in the consolidated financial statements of 2021. The link between the components of the alternative performance measures and the consolidated financial statements is presented in Suominen’s Annual Report for 2021.Calculation of key ratios per shareEarnings per shareBasic earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period. net of tax = Share-issue adjusted average number of shares excluding treasury sharesDiluted earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury sharesEUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the period -2 336 13 774 20 734 Average share-issue adjusted number of shares 57 323 494 57 581 245 57 579 440 Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 419 946 57 912 920 58 023 347 Earnings per share EUR Basic -0.04 0.24 0.36 Diluted -0.04 0.24 0.36Cash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares. end of reporting period31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Cash flow from operations  EUR thousand -2 679 15 954 11 088 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 462 142 57 599 164 57 293 235 Cash flow from operations per share  EUR -0.05 0.28 0.19Equity per shareEquity per shareTotal equity attributable to owners of the parent = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares. end of reporting period31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent  EUR thousand 153 504 152 227 163 199 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 462 142 57 599 164 57 293 235 Equity per share  EUR 2.67 2.64 2.85Market capitalizationMarket capitalization = Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares x share price at the end of period31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares 57 462 142 57 599 164 57 293 235 Share price at end of the period  EUR 3.55 5.74 5.18 Market capitalization  EUR million 204.0 330.6 296.8Share turnoverShare turnover = The proportion of number of shares traded during the period to weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares traded during the period 7 195 433 7 004 147 17 714 203 Average number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 323 494 57 581 245 57 579 440 Share turnover  % 12.6 12.2 30.8Calculation of key ratios and alternative performance measuresOperating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses. adjusted with items affecting comparabilityIn order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods. Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2022 or 2021.EBITDA and comparable EBITDAEBITDA is an important measure that focuses on the operating performance excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization  financial items and income taxes  in other words what is the margin on net sales after deducting operating expenses.EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment lossesComparable EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Operating profit -1 268 13 592 26 941 + Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 4 566 4 942 20 092 EBITDA 3 298 18 534 47 033Gross capital expenditureEUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Increases in intangible assets 261 19 162 Increases in property  plant and equipment 1 508 5 207 17 609 Gross capital expenditure 1 768 5 226 17 771Interest-bearing net debtIt is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors.Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value - interest-bearing receivables - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 348 100 381 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 1 451 1 845 1 794 Cash and cash equivalents -97 046 -81 999 -101 357 Interest-bearing net debt 53 753 20 227 49 570 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 348 100 381 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 1 451 1 845 1 794 Nominal value of interest-bearing liabilities 150 799 102 226 150 927Return on equity (ROE)  %Return on equity (ROE)  % = Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) x 100 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent (quarterly average)EUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) 4 625 40 344 20 734 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.3.2021 / 31.3.2020 / 31.12.2020 152 227 135 868 145 882 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.6.2021 / 30.6.2020 / 31.3.2021 159 386 138 551 152 227 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.9.2021 / 30.9.2020 / 30.6.2021 159 682 144 074 159 386 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.12.2021 / 31.12.2020 / 30.9.2021 163 199 145 882 159 682 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.3.2022 / 31.3.2021 / 31.12.2021 153 504 152 227 163 199 Average 157 600 143 320 156 075 Return on equity (ROE)  % 2.9 28.1 13.3Invested capitalInvested capital = Total equity + interest-bearing liabilities – cash and cash equivalentsThe calculation formula for invested capital has been changed.

Ever since  our key priority has been to protect our personnel’s safety in Ukraine. We have provided our Ukrainian employees and their family members with transportation to neighboring Poland and Romania  as well as accommodation. To our knowledge  none of our employees has been hurt or has died as a result of Russia’s acts of war.Story continuesAspo’s business environment is looking quite different from our estimate in our financial statements release. It is obvious that the operating environment has changed dramatically in eastern markets  and Russia’s reprehensible invasion will have an enduring impact on business opportunities in the region.As announced previously  Aspo has decided to withdraw Leipurin’s operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. We will investigate strategic alternatives  also including the possible divestment of these businesses. The more detailed schedule and implementation of the process will be evaluated  and the process will be carried out addressing the company’s employees and customers  as well as local legislation. Telko’s ability to continue its operations in Russia has deteriorated  and the stricter sanctions have accelerated the adaptation of operations. Since the war broke out in Ukraine  the capital invested in Telko’s warehouse and receivables in Russia has decreased by roughly 30%. The investigation of strategic alternatives for Telko’s operations in Russia is being actively continued. The majority of ESL Shipping’s operations related to Russia has been suspended  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. All transportation operations related to Russia are expected to stop by the end of the year. Aspo’s management is closely monitoring the progress and impact of the crisis and will assess and carry out any further measures on a business-specific basis.Aspo’s financial results for the first quarter of 2022 can be regarded as excellent. The Group’s net sales increased by 23% to EUR 162.6 million. The growth target of 5–10% was significantly exceeded. Operating profit also increased significantly from the comparative period to EUR 10.1 million and 6.2%. The operating profit of Telko and Leipurin for the first quarter was particularly affected by their warehouses in Ukraine  which were destroyed as a result of Russia’s acts of war  and credit loss provisions associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine. Considering the Group as a whole  items affecting comparability totaled EUR -4.9 million during the first quarter. This also includes ESL Shipping’s sales gains of EUR 1.5 million  attributable to the sale of the barge Espa. The Group’s comparable operating profit for the first quarter was record-high at EUR 15.0 (7.9) million. The comparable operating profit was 9.2% (6.0%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Earnings per share increased to EUR 0.21 (0.19)  with the impact of items affecting comparability on earnings per share being approximately EUR -0.13. Net cash from operating activities remained at a very strong level. All this results from our personnel’s strong commitment and our operational successes in a very challenging market environment.Our strong result during the first quarter was particularly driven by ESL Shipping’s excellent performance. The shipping company’s net sales increased by 31% to EUR 56.8 (43.4) million  and its comparable operating profit was EUR 7.9 (4.5) million and 13.9% (10.4%)  nearly achieving the target level of 14.0%.Telko also continued its strong performance. Telko’s net sales increased by 31% to EUR 75.9 million  and its comparable operating profit was EUR 8.6 (4.6) million and 11.3% (7.9%)  exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Leipurin’s net sales remained at the comparative period’s level at EUR 27.7 (28.0) million. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit during the first quarter was EUR 0.7 (0.3) million and 2.5% (1.1%). The operating profit target set for Leipurin is 5%. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit without Vulganus was EUR 1.0 (0.5) million and operating profit rate 4.0% (1.9%).On March 2  2022  Aspo canceled its guidance for 2022 due to uncertainties caused by Russia’s acts of war and the resulting sanctions. Even though the exceptional circumstances caused by the war still involve significant uncertainties  we were already able to issue a new guidance at the beginning of April  according to which Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit will be EUR 27–34 million in 2022.Even though our operating environment has undergone dramatic changes  we will continue to determinedly implement our strategy published in December. According to the strategy  Aspo will focus on expanding its business in western markets. Decisions on solutions concerning operations in Russia will be made in a controlled manner  also considering the position of employees and any restrictions set by local legislation.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsOn December 1  2021  Aspo published new long-term financial targets:Operating profit of 8%Net sales growth 5–10% per yearReturn on equity of over 20%Gearing less than 130%With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%.Aspo’s net sales increased by 24% during the first quarter of 2022. The comparable operating profit rate was 9.2% (6.0%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained high at 21.2% (21.8%). Gearing decreased to 118.8% (129.4%).Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit from continuing and discontinued operationsAspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is presented less significant items affecting comparability that are rare and deviate from normal business operations. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by the war.Aspo announced in December 2021 that the Kauko business segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  have been defined as businesses outside Aspo’s core operations. As a result  the Kauko business segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in consolidated reporting in accordance with IFRS  and its results are reported separately from the figures of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. With regard to the income statement  comparative periods’ figures have been restated to correspond to the same presentation method. The results of Vulganus are reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.Net sales and operating profit margin  Group total 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales  Group total 162.6 132.4 586.4 Net sales  continuing operations 160.4 129.4 573.3 Net sales  discontinued operations 2.2 3.0 13.1 Operating profit  Group total 10.1 7.9 33.9 Operating profit  Group total  % 6.2 6.0 5.8 Items affecting comparability*) -4.9 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 15.0 7.9 42.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 9.2 6.0 7.2Comparable operating profit  Group total 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping  operating profit 9.2 4.5 26.8 Telko  operating profit 4.0 4.6 20.4 Leipurin  operating profit -0.4 0.3 -2.4 Other operations  operating profit -2.5 -1.6 -7.9 Operating profit from continuing operations 10.3 7.8 36.9 Operating profit from discontinued operations -0.2 0.1 -3.0 Operating profit  Group total 10.1 7.9 33.9 Items affecting comparability*) -4.9 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 15.0 7.9 42.4*) The items affecting the comparability of the first quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -4.9 million  consist of EUR 1.5 million in sales gains from ESL Shipping barge Espa  ESL Shipping’s cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the war in Ukraine  EUR -2.6 million in losses from the destruction of Telko’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -2.0 million associated with Telko’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  EUR -0.7 million in losses from the destruction of Leipurin’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -0.2 million associated with Leipurin’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  and EUR -0.2 million in Leipurin’s other business adaptation expenses in Russia. The operating result of other operations included the share-based payment of EUR -0.5 million granted to Aspo’s previous CEO.The items affecting the comparability of 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin’s goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko’s terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of the discontinued operations.SustainabilitySustainability is a key factor in guiding Aspo’s management system and the process of investigating new investment objects. Aspo’s businesses aim to be forerunners in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) targets for the Group and significant parts of its businesses. The key goal is to reduce the emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. During the past 12 months  the emission intensity continued to improve  driven by business growth  and it was 0.39 (0.42). Another key target is to improve the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIF). During the past 12 months  LTIF was 7.6 (8.8)  while the target for 2022 is 7.0. The long-term goal is zero occupational accidents.The impact of the war in Ukraine on Aspo’s operating environmentAspo’s operating environment has changed dramatically in a short period of time. The European security environment has deteriorated as a result of Russia’s armed invasion of Ukraine. The invasion has caused direct losses for Aspo’s businesses through the destruction of warehouses in Ukraine  for example. The indirect impact on Aspo’s business operations includes the significant fluctuations in prices and exchange rates. Suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The war drastically reduces operating conditions in eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  but particularly based on values. The sanctions imposed by western countries and Russia’s legislative measures prevent the transportation of goods and the transfer of payments  rapidly reducing net sales and profitability. As the level of security has decreased  vessel operations have also been restricted and Russian products cannot be transported. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight. In western markets  Russia’s acts of war have only had a minor impact at present  while the impact on financial development  production and supply chains  and inflation will be significant.Russia accounts for less than 15% of the Group’s equity  and this share will continue to be actively reduced. Aspo’s assets in Russia are mainly related to inventories and trade receivables. The financial significance of small-scale production operations is very minor for the Group. Approximately 170 employees of Aspo Group’s all personnel work in Russia.In news  the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion  but its impact can still be felt in our operating environment. The global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on certain Aspo’s businesses  decelerating trading and the completion of orders. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations and especially among crew members.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 1-3/2022 Share 1-3/2021 Share Change MEUR % MEUR % % Finland 53.3 33 42.5 33 25 Scandinavia 28.6 18 24.7 19 16 Baltic countries 15.5 10 11.9 9 30 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 40.3 25 35.0 27 15 Other countries 22.7 14 15.3 12 48 Total 160.4 100 129.4 100 24The Group’s main market areas are Finland  Scandinavia  the Baltic region  and eastern markets (Russia  other CIS countries  and Ukraine). The relative share of net sales in eastern markets decreased during the first quarter of 2022  mainly due to the war in Ukraine. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at western markets.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s cash flow from operating activities in January–March was EUR 15.2 (6.6) million. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -0.6 (-7.2) million. Free cash flow during the first quarter was EUR 13.8 (5.1) million. Investments mainly consisted of the dockage of ESL Shipping’s vessels.3/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Interest-bearing liabilities  inlc. lease liabilities 200.8 185.1 Cash and cash equivalents 41.3 17.7 Net interest-bearing debt 159.5 167.4Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 159.5 million  and gearing fell to 118.8% (3/2021: 139.0%; 12/2021: 129.4%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the period was 31.4%(3/2021: 31.1%; 12/2021: 32.0%).Net financial expenses in January–March totaled EUR -1.8 (-0.9) million. The impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the increase in financial expenses was EUR -0.9 million. The average rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 1.3% (1.5%).The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents were EUR 41.3 million at the end of the review period (12/2021: EUR 17.7 million). Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40.0 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. EUR 20 million of Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program were in use (3/2021: EUR 8 million; 12/2021: EUR 5 million).On March 28  2022  Aspo announced that it will exercise its right to withdraw the full hybrid loan of EUR 20 million with 8.75% interest issued on April 30  2020. The hybrid loan was repaid on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsThe tensions between Russia and Ukraine that ignited in 2014 intensified until the beginning of this year and erupted in Russia’s armed invasion of Ukraine in February. The invasion has caused considerable human suffering and devastating destruction in Ukraine. Risks classified previously as geopolitical risks have materialized in various ways as material losses and threats directed at the personnel  as well as significant decreases in business in crisis areas. As a result of different sanctions  legislative obstacles and value-driven causes  it has become more difficult to engage in business in Russia  and no relief is in sight in the foreseeable future. Aspo’s businesses in Russia will be affected by the restrictions imposed due to the war  and it is possible that this will cause financial losses for Aspo. The impact will also extend to Aspo’s operations in Belarus and Kazakhstan. At present  it is impossible to estimate the duration or extent of Russia’s acts of war in Ukraine.Globally  there are many geopolitical risk clusters  the development of which is difficult to predict. Changes in these regions may be rapid and unpredictable  which is why it is difficult to estimate their potential impact on Aspo’s businesses. International sanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. In addition  various countries have imposed import bans or other trade restrictions on each other’s products. Geopolitical tensions can escalate and cause direct damage to business  payments and even suspend business operations in a crisis area or in areas affected by it. The crisis can also lead to human  economic and monetary losses. Possible sanctions  including counter-sanctions  and any changes in them could lead to business difficulties and economic losses.Increased economic activity has caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to increase rapidly  and increased uncertainties over the functioning of logistics in certain market situations. Aspo may temporarily benefit from this increase in prices  while the prices of purchased raw materials or leased capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes in different market situations  are also increasing risks. Growing inflation and rising interest rates may decelerate general economic growth and reduce demand for Aspo’s businesses. Furthermore  any non-functioning or restricted functioning of logistics due to sanctions or other causes may restrict Aspo’s businesses  and they may also be affected by cyber risks and disruptions in information systems.In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its steady results through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial investments and consequently may reduce solvency.The coronavirus pandemic continues to have an impact on Aspo’s businesses. Any new variants of coronavirus and their rapid spread may lead to various interruptions and financial losses.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation  they involve risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESSESESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk cargo company in the Baltic Sea region. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 48 vessels with a total capacity of 456 000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (75% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 23 vessels (23%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service.1-3/2022 1-3/2021 Change  % Net sales  MEUR 56.8 43.4 31 Operating profit  MEUR 9.2 4.5 104 Operating profit  % 16.2 10.4 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 1.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 7.9 4.5 76 Comparable operating profit  % 13.9 10.4The first quarter was yet again the strongest in ESL Shipping’s history. Net sales increased by 31% from the comparative period to EUR 56.8 (43.4) million. During the quarter  the operating profit more than doubled to a record-high level of EUR 9.2 (4.5) million. It includes sales gains of EUR 1.5 million attributable to the sale of the barge Espa and cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the shutdown of operations in Russia. The comparable operating profit increased significantly to EUR 7.9 (4.5) million.The strong result is a good indication of the effectiveness of the shipping company’s partnership strategy  and the entire personnel’s operational success in challenging operating conditions. The comparable operating profit rate of 13.9% (10.4%) achieved during the first quarter was excellent  considering the challenging ice conditions in the Bothnian Bay compared with previous years  and the target level of 14.0% was nearly achieved.As announced previously  the majority of ESL Shipping’s operations related to Russia has been suspended  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. All transportation operations in Russia are expected to stop by the end of the year at the latest. The schedule depends on any obligations set in existing customer contracts. ESL Shipping has also suspended the start-up of its previously established Russian company.The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories was historically strong during the first quarter. In contract traffic  demand for transportation remained strong throughout the review period  and market freight rates were at a high level in all customer segments and vessel categories. With regard to ship fuels  the price of diesel doubled and that of LNG  which suffered the most from disruptions in European energy markets  was nearly four times higher than in the comparative period  but the impact of the price increases on costs are offset through long-term fuel clauses in transportation agreements.The current level of very high fuel surcharges will increase net sales and reduce the operating profit rate  used as an indicator of relative profitability  even though no actual changes would take place in the absolute operating profit. The volume of cargo transported by the shipping company during the first quarter increased from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.5) million tonnes.The program for building the shipping company’s new next-generation low emission electric hybrid vessels has proceeded as planned  and the metal construction of the first vessel started in the middle of March. The vessels are expected to start operations from the third quarter of 2023 onwards at three-month intervals. The scheduled dockage of the current fleet continued when a larger vessel was docked for roughly one week during the first quarter.The long-term development of sustainability and the maintenance of a high level of safety are characteristic to the shipping company’s operations. ESL Shipping’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The shipping company aims to halve its carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. In this  the “Virtual arrival” model deployed by the shipping company plays a significant role  in which contractual practices for ship scheduling will be updated in cooperation with customers and ports to enable environmentally friendlier vessel operations. Savings in energy costs will be distributed between the shipping company and each customer so that both parties benefit from the new policy. During the first quarter  the emission intensity of ESL Shipping’s transportation operations decreased by 17% from the comparative period to 15.8 grams of carbon dioxide per ton mile.ESL Shipping outlook for 2022Demand for transportation and the price level of sea freights in the company’s main market area in Northern Europe are at a satisfactory level in all vessel categories. Most of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements. After deliveries of Russian raw materials stopped  certain of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers were forced to seek new suppliers for part of their production input required in new geographic areas. This is expected to extend transportation distances and increase demand for sea transportation per ton mile among ESL Shipping’s largest vessels.In the short term and especially during the second quarter  the volumes of raw materials transported by Handysize vessels will decrease from previous estimates  as customers’ procurement activities shift away from Russia. The timing of transportation volumes will also be affected by maintenance stoppages at ports and railroad maintenance in Northern Sweden. Restrictions on vessel sizes at ports in the company’s main market area and at its customers’ ports  combined with the need for year-round transportation  will again secure ESL Shipping’s transportation demand starting from the second half of the year when deliveries shipped from across the oceans to replace Russian raw materials reach Europe and are shipped further to customers.In the smaller vessel category  transportation demand in contract traffic is expected to remain at a satisfactory level. However  customers’ supply chains may involve challenges in the availability of raw materials that may also have an impact on realized product transportation volumes. Vessel rents that have partly increased to an unhealthy level are starting to decrease  and the availability of additional capacity is expected to improve during the second and third quarters. The determined preventive measures will continue to protect the personnel’s health security during the coronavirus pandemic.In Northern Europe  there continues to be considerable growth in interest among customers in environmentally friendly maritime transport that produces as low carbon emissions as possible. In addition to ESL Shipping’s investments in new highly environmentally friendly vessels  the shipping company is preparing long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide sea transportation with even lower carbon emissions  and even fossil-free transportation  in the future.With regard to the order placed for the Green Coaster electric hybrid vessels and its options  the shipping company is preparing investors’ entry in the ownership and operations of vessels within a pooling arrangement  which is a common practice in international shipping operations. The aim is to accelerate ESL Shipping’s operational growth and improve its profitability and return on capital.During the rest of 2022  two larger and four smaller vessel units will be docked for a total of approximately 95 days. In total  there will be approximately 105 dockage days in 2022. In 2021  the corresponding figure was 229. After these dockages  all vessels owned by ESL Shipping will be equipped with ballast water treatment systems that meet new environmental regulations.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service both in the east and the west. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.Kauko has been defined as a business outside Aspo’s core operations. As a result  Kauko’s figures are no longer reported as part of Telko. Kauko’s figures have been removed from all of Telko’s figures.Telko 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 75.9 58.0 31 Operating profit  MEUR 4.0 4.6 -13 Operating profit  % 5.3 7.9 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -4.6 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 8.6 4.6 87 Comparable operating profit  % 11.3 7.9During the first quarter  Telko’s net sales grew strongly to EUR 75.9 (58.0) million. Its operating profit for the first quarter decreased to EUR 4.0 (4.6) million. The operating profit rate was 5.3% (7.9%). The operating result includes items affecting comparability of EUR -4.6 million relating to the destroyed warehouse in Ukraine and a credit loss provision associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine. Sales were significantly affected by the increase in prices after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine  which also raised sales margins to an unusually high level. Then again  exchange rate losses resulting from the steep decline in the value of the Russian ruble reduced the results. Without the items affecting comparability  Telko’s operating result for the first quarter was EUR 8.6 (4.6) million  and its operating profit rate was 11.3% (7.9%). Telko has focused on assisting its employees and their families in Ukraine  helping them evacuate  and providing accommodation for those fleeing the war. While sales have decreased steeply in Ukraine  Telko is committed to continuing its operations in the country.In Russia  Telko focuses on selling its existing stocks as announced previously. After the war broke out in Ukraine  the capital invested in Telko’s warehouse and receivables in Russia has decreased by roughly 30%. Telko’s ability to continue its operations in Russia has deteriorated  and stricter sanctions have accelerated the adaptation of operations. The investigation of strategic alternatives continues.In western markets  Telko’s sales developed as planned  and the Ukrainian crisis has not had any direct impact on operations. Demand remained stable in all of Telko’s business operations  while difficulties in availability continued to restrict the development of volumes in all operations. Prices remained high in all operations and even increased in several business areas. Telko has continued its growth efforts in western markets  which has had an impact on the increase in costs.The net sales of the plastics business increased by 22% during the first quarter to EUR 39.3 (32.1) million. The price level of plastics was clearly higher than during the comparative period in all product groups  and the average price of sales increased significantly. Prices partly reached a historically unusual level. While availability problems have decreased  challenges still remain in certain product groups. Customer demand was at a normal level. However  the high price levels of raw materials and energy have forced certain customers to temporarily restrict their production.The net sales of the chemicals business increased by 53% to EUR 25.3 (16.5) million. The exceptional demand in eastern markets and high price levels are reflected in the first quarter’s figures. In general  product prices increased in nearly all product groups in all markets. Delays in deliveries have been common. In addition  transportation prices are increasing clearly in Europe. Demand in key customer segments has remained stable  even though the high cost level is starting to affect companies’ operations.The net sales of the lubricants business increased by 20% to EUR 11.3 (9.4) million. Telko acquired all shares in Estonian Mentum AS at the end of 2021. As a result of the acquisition  Telko’s sales of lubricants increased significantly from the previous year. Prices of lubricants increased clearly during the beginning of the year. Availability issues have not been as significant as in other business areas. Telko has discontinued its small-scale lubricants business in Russia.Telko outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and its consequences have a significant impact on Telko’s outlook for the rest of the year. The outlook for the second quarter is relatively strong  driven by the strong increase in prices  while the outlook for the rest of the year is very uncertain due to the geopolitical situation and its broader impact on markets.In Russia  Telko focuses on actively reducing its working capital. As a result  sales are expected to remain strong during the next few months and decline steeply towards the end of the year. Telko will continue its operations in Ukraine  while sales are expected to remain very low and operations are expected to produce a loss this year.In general  product prices are expected to remain high as a result of increases in crude oil prices and prolonged difficulties in deliveries. Demand is expected to remain fairly strong. Production difficulties due to the availability of raw materials and components independent of Telko will have a negative impact on Telko’s certain customer groups. The war in Ukraine is expected to have an indirect impact on general cost levels  logistics and goods flows.Due to the steep decline in net sales in Russia and Belarus  Telko’s net sales are expected to decrease significantly towards the end of the year. The EU’s latest sanctions will accelerate this change. Of Telko’s businesses  the chemicals business has held the highest relative share in Russia.According to its strategy  Telko will seek not only organic growth in the western markets  but also acquisition targets that accelerate the achievement of the strategic goals set for Telko.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in eight countries that have been grouped into three regional organizations  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  East  and the Baltic region. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. Leipurin’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. Leipurin uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners.Vulganus Oy manufactures and maintains refrigeration and freezing solutions for the food industry through its spiral products. Vulganus has been classified as held for sale  but its results are still reported as part of the Leipurin segment.Leipurin 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 27.7 28.0 -1 Operating profit  MEUR -0.4 0.3 -233 Operating profit  % -1.4 1.1 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -1.1 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 0.7 0.3 133 Comparable operating profit  % 2.5 1.1Leipurin’s net sales during the first quarter remained at the comparative period’s level at EUR 27.7 (28.0) million. During the comparative period  machine sales in Russia significantly increased net sales. In Finland  net sales increased by 14% to EUR 10.4 (9.1) million. In the Baltic region  net sales increased by 19% to EUR 8.0 (6.7) million. Net sales in East developed positively until the war broke out in Ukraine and increased by 3% to EUR 6.8 million (6.6) during the quarter. During the first quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 12% to EUR 18.2 (16.3) million. Sales to the food industry fell short of the target in the Baltic region and Ukraine  being EUR 2.6 (2.6) million. At the beginning of the year  the euro-denominated increase in sales was driven by the significantly grown global market prices of raw materials but  measured in kilograms  sales also increased to the pre-pandemic level. The cost of living increased significantly in Finland and the Baltic region  strengthening the shift in consumer demand toward more affordable products.The outbreak of the war in Ukraine during the last week of February drastically changed Leipurin’s operating environment. Leipurin prioritized the security and livelihood of its personnel in Ukraine. After the period under review  Leipurin decided to withdraw its operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. Leipurin will investigate strategic alternatives  also including the possible divestment of these businesses. The more detailed schedule and implementation of the process will be evaluated  and the process will be carried out addressing the company’s employees and customers  as well as local legislation. Leipurin will continue its operations in Ukraine.The impact of the coronavirus pandemic decreased significantly during the beginning of the year. The development of the sales margin was particularly positive  with the margin also exceeding the level preceding the outbreak of the pandemic in 2019.Leipurin’s operating result for the first quarter was EUR -0.4 (0.3) million  and the operating profit rate was -1.4% (1.1%). Losses of EUR -0.7 million from Leipurin’s warehouse destroyed in Ukraine and a credit loss provision of EUR -0.2 million associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine reduced Leipurin’s operating result for the first quarter. In addition  a provision of approximately EUR -0.2 million was recognized in relation to the company’s adaptation measures in Russia. These items affecting comparability totaled EUR -1.1 million. The comparable operating profit for the first quarter stood at EUR 0.7 (0.3) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.5% (1.1%).Rising market prices for steel raw materials  slow progress in after sales during the first part of the year and cost overruns in certain projects continued to significantly reduce the profitability of Vulganus Oy’s machine manufacturing operations. Vulganus’s net sales during the first quarter stood at EUR 2.5 (1.4) million  and its operating loss was EUR -0.3 (-0.2) million.The profit management program launched during the second quarter of 2021 will develop the capability of knowledge management and help to improve the commercial performance. Key tools include Group-wide category management and the improved efficiency of the supply chain and logistics. The management model already increased financial performance during 2021. The implementation of the program was particularly reflected in the positive development of results in Finland.Availability challenges still persist in different product categories. In Finland and the Baltic region  Leipurin has succeeded in using the post-pandemic recovery in demand. Sales measured in kilograms already exceeded the 2019 level  whereas they fell short of the level of the first quarter in 2019 in eastern markets.Leipurin outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and results.Increased energy prices will have a negative impact on demand for more valuable products  at least in the Baltic region. They will also cause profitability challenges for the bakery segment’s customers.The impact of the coronavirus pandemic and extreme weather conditions on global supply chains will be emphasized  affecting the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times. Raw material prices are increasing steeply.The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Leipurin will continue its profit management program  and it will contribute to further improve financial performance in western markets. The knowledge management program helps Leipurin control rising costs and purchase prices and foresee their impact on customer prices.Vulganus’s order book for 2022 has been confirmed to be excellent.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group’s administration  the financial and ICT service center  and a small number of other functions not covered by business units. The operating result for other operations was EUR -2.5 (-1.6) million in the first quarter. The share-based payment of EUR -0.5 million granted to Aspo’s previous CEO was included in the operating result of other operations. In addition  the difference from the comparative period can be explained by expert costs associated with various projects.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

As a result  the Kauko operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in group reporting in accordance with IFRS 5 standard  and its results and balance sheet items are reported separately from the continuing operations of Aspo Group. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures of the comparative periods have been restated. On the balance sheet  the assets of the Kauko operating segment are reported under “Assets held for sale” and liabilities under “Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale”. Vulganus Oy’s assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented similarly. In the statement of comprehensive income  Vulganus is reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  and the figures of the comparative period (3/2021) have not therefore been restated.Profit from discontinued operations 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales 2.2 3.0 13.1 Materials and services -1.6 -2.2 -9.6 Employee benefit expenses -0.5 -0.4 -1.7 Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 0.0 -3.5 Depreciation  leased assets 0.0 -0.1 Other operating expenses -0.3 -0.3 -1.2 Operating profit -0.2 0.1 -3.0 Profit before taxes -0.2 0.1 -3.0 Profit for the period -0.2 0.1 -3.0Profit from discontinued operations includes the income and expenses of Kauko operating segment  insofar as they are considered to transfer outside Aspo Group in conjunction with the divestment. Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations during the first quarter is EUR 0.1 (0.1) million higher than the Kauko operating segment’s profit.

4187,Euroclear,Google API,https://coingeek.com/belgium-fsma-releases-registration-steps-for-digital-assets-firms/,Belgium’s FSMA releases registration steps for digital assets firms,11 hours ago,Belgium  the European Union (EU) and NATO headquarters  is introducing a registration regime for digital assets firms. The Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) has introduced new guidelines for Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs) to get licensed in the country.The guideline outlined seven conditions for digital asset companies to meet to register. The first one is that the company must at least be incorporated as either a Belgian public limited company/cooperative society  a European company  or a cooperative society and have a minimum capital of EUR 50 000 (approximately $53 700).It follows that companies seeking registration will need to have registered corporate offices and central points of contact in Belgium. They also need to have effective management and sound and prudent shareholders.Similarly  they must also comply with Belgian laws to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Fulfilling all these  digital asset companies are also required to meet all cybersecurity standards and make payments toward the FSMA’s operating cost in carrying out their regulatory duties.In a notice  the FSMA stated that the conditions went into force last May 1  and are binding on any legal person in Belgium that provides exchange services between digital currencies and legal currencies or custody wallet services.“As from 1 May 2022  any legal person established in Belgium that wants to provide exchange services between virtual currencies and legal currencies  or custody wallet services  within Belgium will have to register with the FSMA in advance ” the FSMA notice read.It adds that providers already operating on the date must notify the FSMA of their activity before July 1 and apply for registration before September 1.Digital assets adoption in BelgiumThe digital currency industry is well represented in the Western European country  with even some level of notoriety. Back in 2018  the FSMA published a list of suspicious digital assets investment firms to protect investors.Following subsequent updates  the list has over 120 such firms included. However  the warnings have not dampened the adoption of digital assets even among government circles and among the country’s population.Earlier this year  Christophe De Beukelaer  a Belgian member of parliament representing the city of Brussels  announced that he would accept his salary in Bitcoin all through 2022. A report by Triple-A revealed that an estimated 2.36% of all Belgians held digital currencies at the end of 2021.Meanwhile  the country’s financial sector has not been left out. Per a Reuters report  the Belgium-based securities settlement house  Euroclear  joined a consortium of banks building a blockchain-backed payments system called Fnality.Watch: CoinGeek New York presentation  Integrating Business Apps with BSV Blockchain: Europe’s First Large-Scale AdoptionNew to Bitcoin?

4188,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/40186/allen--overy-announces-sixth-cohort-for-fuse-innovation-hub,Allen & Overy announces sixth cohort for Fuse Innovation Hub,5 hours ago,Allen & Overy’s Fuse innovation hub has announced members of its sixth cohort  and with 16 businesses tapped to join the Hub’s ranks  this year marks the largest cohort in Fuse’s history.Shruti Ajitsaria  Allen & Overy partner and head of Fuse  explains that the quality of applicants from over 25 countries was immensely high  and expects that the talent that comes from this cohort will continue to provide valuable solutions not only for Allen & Overy  but for the firm’s financial services clients into the future.“Fuse started off looking strictly at LegalTech  but we’ve always had the great privilege of speaking with people in banks’ strategic investment teams  or innovative areas such as their digital assets  crypto or blockchain focuses. As a result  what we have realised is that all of these areas are raising new and interesting questions that we  Allen & Overy  need to be at the forefront of  because our clients are investigating these concepts.”In addition to an open application process  Fuse also welcomes a selection of applications nominated by a handful of Allen & Overy’s clients. Ajitsaria notes that “as legal advisors  we need to learn alongside our clients and learn at the same pace with the same access to information  so that when they ask to understand their ability to use new technologies  we can provide legal advice that is grounded in reality and experiential practice.”Ajitsaria furthers that while the “all-star selection committee” boasts a formidable group of external members from the likes of Goldman Sachs  Microsoft Ventures  Meta  and BT  the vital factor in the selection process is ensuring that there is strong upfront buy-in from Allen & Overy partners. “The partners need to know that the businesses we invest time and effort in  are going to make a difference to their work.”The innovation hub boasts an impressive portfolio of alumni  notable members including Avvoka  Draftwise  Definely  and the sustainable finance tech platform  Greenomy.Greenomy will be returning to Fuse for a second year as an alumni member in 2022  explains Anna Blake  sustainability analyst at the company.The Belgium-based firm is a 2021 Fuse alumni and has since won the 2021 G20 Techsprint for the ‘Data collection  verification and sharing’ category  was admitted to the FCA’s Digital Sandbox  and also received (an undisclosed) investment from Euroclear earlier this year.Blake comments: “Over the past year  the Fuse innovation hub has provided Greenomy with excellent training and growth opportunities  including administering advice on how to create and execute a successful pitch and holding conversations around the most effective ways in which to refine  develop  and promote our solution to the UK market.”Blake elaborates that as sustainable finance regulation is booming  there is a regulatory demand for corporates and financial market participants to fulfil more and more disclosure requirements. “Considering its excellent market knowledge  A&O is the best partner to understand this new segment  and Fuse offers us an experimental haven to help develop and promote solutions to corporates  asset managers  and credit institutions that are facing these new reporting burdens.”Greenomy is currently working on updating their solution to incorporate the UK Taxonomy  with the objective of introducing it to the UK market one month after the introduction of legislation  which is currently being drafted. “The fuse innovation hub has given us the exposure to trial our pilot solution with UK customers and to ensure it is ready for them to navigate the maze of the new UK Taxonomy once it is released.”From over 130 applicants  the new LegalTech companies selected to join Fuse include:CUBE - Helps regulated institutions by using AI to capture  track and analyse complex  multijurisdictional and multilingual regulatory data.Eperoto - Helps dispute resolution teams to perform risk-value assessments by utilising decision theory. It clearly shows the risks and rewards of legal proceedings compared with a negotiated settlement.Everchron - Helps litigation and arbitration teams to collaborate on matters via use of a centralised platform.Legalme - Helps claimants and their lawyers automate housing disrepair claims  improving resolution outcomes and allowing timely and effective client support.

The following description is only a summary. This summary does not purport to be complete  or to give full effect to  the provisions of statutory or common laws  and is subject to  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the terms and detailed provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designation) and our amended and restated bylaws. We urge you to read these documents. Please read “Where You Can Find More Information.” Authorized Capital Stock At May 2  2022  our authorized capital consisted of: •1 800 000 000 shares of common stock  par value $0.10 per share  of which approximately 805 805 000 were outstanding  and ​ •5 000 000 shares of preferred stock  par value $0.10 per share  issuable in series  of which no shares were issued and outstanding. ​ Common Stock Holders of common stock may receive dividends if and when declared by our board of directors. The payment of dividends on our common stock may be limited by obligations to holders of any preferred stock and covenants contained in debt agreements. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters submitted to them. Cumulative voting of shares is prohibited  meaning that the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares voting for the election of directors can elect all directors to be elected if they choose to do so. Our common stock has no preemptive rights and is not convertible  redeemable or assessable  or entitled to the benefits of any sinking fund. If we liquidate or dissolve our business  the holders of common stock will share ratably in all assets available for distribution to stockholders after creditors are paid and preferred stockholders receive their distributions. All issued and outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. Any shares of common stock we offer under this prospectus will be fully paid and nonassessable. In October 2021  in connection with the merger involving Cimarex  we effectively assumed the obligations associated with Cimarex’s preferred stock  par value $0.01 per share  designated as 8 1/8% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Cimarex Preferred Stock”). Each holder of Cimarex Preferred Stock has the right at any time  at its option  to convert any or all of such holder’s shares of Cimarex Preferred Stock at an initial conversion rate of 34.1008 shares of fully paid and nonassessable shares of our common stock and $471.3975 in cash per share of Cimarex Preferred Stock. The initial conversion rate of 34.1008 adjusts upon the occurrence of certain events  including the payment of cash dividends to our common stockholders  and is 36.24997 as of March 31  2022. Additionally  beginning on and continuing after October 15  2021  Cimarex has the right  at its option  if the closing sale price of our common stock meets certain criteria  to elect to cause all  and not part  of the outstanding shares of Cimarex Preferred Stock to be converted into that number of shares of our common stock for each eligible share of Cimarex Preferred Stock equal to the conversion rate in effect on the mandatory conversion date as such terms are defined in the Certificate of Designations for the Cimarex Preferred Stock and $471.3975 in cash per share of Cimarex Preferred Stock. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE and trades under the symbol “CTRA.” Preferred Stock The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series. Our board of directors may establish attributes of any series  including  without limitation  the designation and number of shares in the series  dividend rates6TABLE OF CONTENTS(cumulative or noncumulative)  conversion rights  redemption rights  voting rights  and any other rights and qualifications  preferences and limitations or restrictions on shares of a series. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us without any vote or action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of shares of common stock. The specific terms of a particular series of preferred stock will be described in a certificate of designation relating to that series. This summary of the undesignated preferred stock discusses terms and conditions that we expect may apply to any series of the preferred stock that may be offered under this prospectus. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the particular terms of each series of preferred stock actually offered. If indicated in the prospectus supplement  the terms of any series may differ from the terms described below. We expect the prospectus supplement for any preferred stock that we actually offer pursuant to this prospectus to include some or all of the following terms: •the designation of the series of preferred stock; ​ •the number of shares of preferred stock offered  the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of the preferred stock; ​ •the dividend rate or rates of the shares  the method or methods of calculating the dividend rate or rates  the dates on which dividends  if declared  will be payable  and whether or not the dividends are to be cumulative and  if cumulative  the circumstances in which dividends shall be cumulative; ​ •the amounts payable on shares of the preferred stock in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation  dissolution or winding up; ​ •the redemption rights and price or prices  if any  for the shares of preferred stock; ​ •the terms  and the amount  of any sinking fund or analogous fund providing for the purchase or redemption of the shares of preferred stock; ​ •any restrictions on our ability to make payments on any of our capital stock if dividend or other payments are not made on the preferred stock; ​ •any voting rights granted to the holders of the shares of preferred stock in addition to those required by Delaware law or our restated certificate of incorporation; ​ •whether the shares of preferred stock will be convertible into shares of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock  and  if convertible  the conversion price or prices  and any adjustment or other terms and conditions upon which the conversion shall be made; ​ •any other rights  preferences  restrictions  limitations or conditions relative to the shares of preferred stock permitted by Delaware law or our restated certificate of incorporation; ​ •any listing of the preferred stock on any securities exchange; and ​ •if appropriate  a discussion of material United States federal income tax considerations. ​ Subject to our restated certificate of incorporation and to any limitations imposed by any then outstanding preferred stock  we may issue additional series of preferred stock  at any time or from time to time  with such powers  preferences  rights and qualifications  limitations or restrictions as our board of directors determines  and without further action of the stockholders  including holders of our then outstanding preferred stock  if any. Limitation on Directors’ Liability Delaware has adopted a law that allows corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for breach of directors’ fiduciary duty of care. The duty of care requires that  when acting on behalf of the corporation  directors must exercise an informed business judgment based on all material information reasonably available to them. Absent the limitations allowed by the law  directors are accountable to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for acts of gross negligence. Although Delaware law does not change directors’ duty of care  it7TABLE OF CONTENTSallows corporations to limit available relief to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission. Our restated certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by this law. Specifically  our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director  except for liability: •for any breach of their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders; ​ •for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; ​ •under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; or ​ •for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. ​ This limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors  and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care  even though such an action  if successful  might otherwise have benefited our stockholders. Effects of Certain Provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware Law Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control or the removal of existing management  of deterring potential acquirors from making an offer to our stockholders and of limiting any opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices for our common stock in connection therewith. This could be the case notwithstanding that a majority of our stockholders might benefit from such a change in control or offer. Advance Notice for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations Our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions requiring that advance notice be delivered to us of any business to be brought by a stockholder before an annual meeting of stockholders and providingfor certain procedures to be followed by stockholders in nominating persons for election to our board of directors. Generally  the advance notice provisions provide that the stockholder must give written notice to our Secretary not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting  except that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date  notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting (or  if less than 100 days’ prior notice or public announcement of the scheduled meeting date is given or made  then the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which the notice of such meeting was mailed to our stockholders or the day on which such public announcement was made). The notice must set forth specific information regarding that stockholder and that business or director nominee  as described in our amended and restated bylaws. Proxy Access Our amended and restated bylaws permit a stockholder  or a group of up to 20 stockholders (with a group of any two or more funds that are under common management and investment control constituting a single stockholder)  owning 3% or more of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in our proxy materials director candidates constituting up to 20% of our board of directors (or  if such amount is not a whole number  the closest whole number below 20%)  provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the amended and restated bylaws and subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in the amended and restated bylaws. Vacancies on the Board of Directors Our amended and restated bylaws provide that vacancies on the board of directors arising through death  resignation  retirement or removal shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office whether or not the remaining directors constitute a quorum.8TABLE OF CONTENTSStockholder Action by Written Consent Our amended and restated bylaws permit stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders act by written consent must by written notice request our board of directors fix a record date. No written consent will be effective unless  within 60 days of the record date established by our board of directors  a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to us in the manner prescribed by our amended and restated bylaws. Special Meetings of Stockholders Our amended and restated bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called at any time only by our chairman  our chief executive officer  our president or our board of directors. The only business that may be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders is that business specified in the notice of the meeting. Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute As a Delaware corporation  we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”). In general  Section 203 prevents us from engaging in a business combination with an “interested stockholder” ​(generally  a person owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock) for three years following the time that person becomes a 15% stockholder unless either: •before that person became a 15% stockholder  our board of directors approved the transaction in which the stockholder became a 15% stockholder or approved the business combination; ​ •upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder’s becoming a 15% stockholder  the stockholder owns at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction began (excluding stock held by directors who are also officers and by employee stock plans that do not provide employees with the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer); or ​ •after the transaction in which that person became a 15% stockholder  the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a stockholder meeting by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the 15% stockholder. ​ Under Section 203  these restrictions also do not apply to certain business combinations proposed by a 15% stockholder following the disclosure of an extraordinary transaction with a person who was not a 15% stockholder during the previous three years or who became a 15% stockholder with the approval of a majority of our directors. This exception applies only if the extraordinary transaction is approved or not opposed by a majority of our directors who were directors before any person became a 15% stockholder in the previous three years  or the successors of these directors. Exclusive Forum for Adjudication of Disputes Our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum  the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf  (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director  officer  other employee or agent of ours to us or our stockholders  including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty  (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated bylaws or restated certificate of incorporation (as either may be amended from time to time) or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or asserting an “internal corporate claim” ​(as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL) . In addition  unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum  the Federal District Courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Under the Securities Act  federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act  and stockholders cannot waive compliance with9TABLE OF CONTENTSthe federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims  Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Although we believe these provisions are beneficial by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law or U.S. securities laws in the types of lawsuits to which they apply  the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers or against us. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws related to choice of forum. The enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings  and it is possible that  in connection with one or more actions or proceedings described above  a court could rule that this provision in our amended and restated bylaws is inapplicable or unenforceable.

A copy of the Indenture  which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part  is incorporated herein by reference. Except as otherwise defined in this prospectus  capitalized terms used in this summary have the meanings given to them in the Indenture. The provisions of the Indenture will generally be applicable to all of the debt securities. Selected provisions of the Indenture are described in this prospectus. Additional or different provisions that are applicable to a particular series of debt securities will  if material  be described in a prospectus supplement relating to the offering of debt securities of that series. These provisions may include  among other things and to the extent applicable  the following: •the title of the debt securities; ​ •the extent  if any  to which the debt securities are subordinated in right of payment to other indebtedness of Coterra; ​ •any limit on the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities; ​ •the persons to whom any interest on the debt securities will be payable  if other than the registered holders thereof on the regular record date therefor; ​ •the date or dates on which the principal of the debt securities will be payable; ​ •the rate or rates at which the debt securities will bear interest  if any  and the date or dates from which interest will accrue; ​ •the dates on which interest will be payable and the regular record dates for interest payment dates; ​ •the place or places where the principal of and any premium and interest on the debt securities will be payable; ​ •the period or periods  if any  within which  and the price or prices at which  the debt securities may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at our option; ​ •our obligation  if any  to redeem or purchase the debt securities pursuant to sinking fund or similar provisions and the terms and conditions of any such redemption or purchase; ​ •the denominations in which the debt securities will be issuable  if other than denominations of $2 000 and any integral multiple of $1 000 in excess thereof; ​ •the currency  currencies or currency units  if other than currency of the United States of America  in which payment of the principal of and any premium or interest on the debt securities will be payable  and the terms and conditions of any elections that may be made available with respect thereto; ​ •any index or formula used to determine the amount of payments of principal of and any premium or interest on the debt securities; ​ •whether the debt securities are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more global securities and  if so  the identity of the depositary  if any  for the global securities; ​ •whether the debt securities are to be issued under Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act and  in such case  any provisions unique to such issuance including any transfer restrictions or exchange and registration rights; ​ •the terms and conditions  if any  pursuant to which the debt securities are convertible into or exchangeable for the common stock or other securities of Coterra or any other person; ​ •the principal amount (or any portion of the principal amount) of the debt securities which will be payable upon any declaration of acceleration of the maturity of the debt securities pursuant to an event of default; ​12TABLE OF CONTENTS•the applicability to the debt securities of the provisions described in “— Defeasance” below; and ​ •any other terms applicable to that series in accordance with the Indenture  which could be different from those described in this prospectus. ​ We may issue debt securities at a discount from their stated principal amount. Federal income tax considerations and other special considerations applicable to any debt security issued with original issue discount (an “original issue discount security”) may be described in an applicable prospectus supplement. If the purchase price of any series of the debt securities is payable in a foreign currency or currency unit or if the principal of or any premium or interest on any series of the debt securities is payable in a foreign currency or currency unit  the restrictions  elections  general tax considerations  specific terms  and other information with respect to the debt securities and the applicable foreign currency or currency unit will be set forth in an applicable prospectus supplement. Unless otherwise indicated in an applicable prospectus supplement: •the debt securities will be issued only in fully registered form (without coupons) in denominations of $2 000 and any integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof; and ​ •payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities will be payable  and the exchange  conversion  and transfer of debt securities will be registrable  at our office or agency maintained for those purposes and at any other office or agency maintained for those purposes. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of the debt securities  but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith. ​ Form of Debt Securities We will issue each debt security only in registered form  without coupons  unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement. In addition  we will issue each debt security in global (i.e.  book-entry) form only  unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement. Debt securities in book-entry form will be represented by a global security registered in the name of a depositary  which will be the holder of all the debt securities represented by the global security. Those who own beneficial interests in a global debt security will do so through participants in the depositary’s securities clearance system  and the rights of these indirect owners will be governed solely by the applicable procedures of the depositary and its participants. References to “holders” in this section mean those who own debt securities registered in their own names  on the books that we or the Trustee maintain for this purpose  and not those who own beneficial interests in debt securities registered in street name or in debt securities issued in book-entry form through one or more depositaries. Book-Entry Procedures Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement  the following is a summary of the depositary arrangements applicable to debt securities issued in global form and for which the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) acts as a depositary. We have provided the following descriptions of the operations and procedures of DTC  Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking  société anonyme (“Clearstream”) solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of DTC  Euroclear and Clearstream and are subject to change by them from time to time. Neither we  any underwriters or the Trustee takes any responsibility for these operations or procedures  and you are urged to contact DTC  Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants directly to discuss these matters. Each global debt security will be deposited with  or on behalf of  DTC  as depositary  or its nominee  and registered in the name of a nominee of DTC. Except under the limited circumstances described below  global debt securities are not exchangeable for definitive certificated debt securities. Ownership of beneficial interests in a global debt security is limited to institutions that have accounts with DTC or its nominee  or persons that may hold interests through those participants. In addition  ownership13TABLE OF CONTENTSof beneficial interests by participants in a global debt security will be evidenced only by  and the transfer of that ownership interest will be effected only through  records maintained by DTC or its nominee for a global debt security. Ownership of beneficial interests in a global debt security by persons that hold those interests through participants will be evidenced only by  and the transfer of that ownership interest within that participant will be effected only through  records maintained by that participant. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the debt securities. Beneficial owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase  but beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction  as well as periodic statements of their holdings  from the participants through which the beneficial owners entered the transaction. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of securities they purchase in definitive form. These laws may impair your ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global debt security. We will make payment of principal of  and interest on  debt securities represented by a global debt security registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee to DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  as the registered owner and holder of the global debt security representing those debt securities. DTC has advised us that upon receipt of any payment of principal of  or interest on  a global debt security  DTC will immediately credit accounts of participants on its book-entry registration and transfer system with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective interests in the principal amount of that global debt security  as shown in the records of DTC. Payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global debt security held through those participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices  as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name ” and will be the sole responsibility of those participants  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements that may be in effect from time to time. Neither we  the Trustee nor any of our respective agents will be responsible for any aspect of the records of DTC  any nominee or any participant relating to  or payments made on account of  beneficial interests in a permanent global debt security or for maintaining  supervising or reviewing any of the records of DTC  any nominee or any participant relating to such beneficial interests. A global debt security is exchangeable for definitive debt securities registered in the name of  and a transfer of a global debt security may be registered to  any person other than DTC or its nominee  only if: •DTC notifies us that it is unwilling  unable or has ceased to be a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and we do not appoint another institution to act as depositary within 90 days; or ​ •we notify the Trustee that we wish to terminate that global security. ​ Any global debt security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence will be exchangeable in whole for definitive debt securities in registered form  of like tenor and of an equal aggregate principal amount as the global debt security  in denominations specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  if other than $2 000 and multiples of $1 000. The definitive debt securities will be registered by the registrar in the name or names instructed by DTC. We expect that these instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from its participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the global debt security. Except as provided above  owners of the beneficial interests in a global debt security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of debt securities in definitive form and will not be considered the holders of debt securities for any purpose under the Indenture. No global debt security shall be exchangeable except for another global debt security of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. Accordingly  each person owning a beneficial interest in a global debt security must rely on the procedures of DTC and  if that person is not a participant  on the procedures of the participant through which that person owns its interest  to exercise any rights of a holder under the global debt security or the Indenture. We understand that  under existing industry practices  in the event that we request any action of holders  or an owner of a beneficial interest in a global debt security desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the debt securities or the Indenture  DTC would authorize the participants14TABLE OF CONTENTSholding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action. Additionally  those participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through those participants to give or take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York  a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code  and a “clearing agency” registered under the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities of its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants in securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants. By doing so  DTC eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations  and certain other organizations. DTC is owned by a number of its participants and by the New York Stock Exchange  Inc. and NYSE Amex Equities. Access to DTC’s book-entry system is also available to others  such as banks  brokers  dealers  and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant  either directly or indirectly. The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC. Investors may hold interests in the debt securities outside the U.S. through Euroclear or Clearstream if they are participants in those systems  or indirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s names on the books of their respective depositaries  which in turn will hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Euroclear has advised us that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for participants of Euroclear (“Euroclear Participants”) and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear includes various other services  including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by the Euroclear S.A./N.V. (the “Euroclear Operator”)  under contract with Euroclear Clearance Systems S.C.  a Belgian cooperative corporation (the “Cooperative”). All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator  and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator  not the Cooperative. The Cooperative establishes policy for Euroclear on behalf of Euroclear Participants. Euroclear Participants include banks (including central banks)  securities brokers and dealers  and other professional financial intermediaries and may include any agents. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear Participant  either directly or indirectly. Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear  the related Operating Procedures of Euroclear  and applicable Belgian law (collectively  the “Terms and Conditions”). The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear  withdrawals of securities and cash within Euroclear  withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear  and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear Participants and has no record of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear Participants. Distributions with respect to debt securities held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear Participants in accordance with the Terms and Conditions  to the extent received by the U.S. depositary for Euroclear. Clearstream has advised us that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for its participating organizations (“Clearstream Participants”) and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Clearstream Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Participants  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to Clearstream Participants  among other things  services for safekeeping  administration  clearance  and settlement of internationally traded securities and15TABLE OF CONTENTSsecurities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. As a professional depositary  Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Monetary Institute. Clearstream Participants are recognized financial institutions around the world  including agents  securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations  and certain other organizations and may include any agents. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others  such as banks  brokers  dealers  and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream Participant either directly or indirectly. Distributions with respect to debt securities held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream Participants in accordance with its rules and procedures  to the extent received by the U.S. depositary for Clearstream. Secondary market trading between Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and will be settled using the procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in immediately available funds. Cross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC  on the one hand  and directly or indirectly through Euroclear or Clearstream participants  on the other  will be effected within DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its U.S. depositary; however  such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will  if the transaction meets its settlement requirements  deliver instructions to its U.S. depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving debt securities in DTC  and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective U.S. depositaries. Because of time-zone differences  credits of securities received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits  or any transactions in the securities settled during such processing  will be reported to the relevant Euroclear participants or Clearstream participants on that business day. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of securities by or through a Euroclear participant or a Clearstream participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the business day of settlement in DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC. Although DTC  Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of debt securities among participants of DTC  Euroclear and Clearstream  they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures and they may discontinue the procedures at any time. Certain Covenants Maintenance of Office or Agency We will be required to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan  City of New York  or  if different  in each place of payment for each series of debt securities for notice and demand purposes and for the purposes of presenting or surrendering debt securities for payment  registration of transfer  or exchange. Paying Agents If we act as our own paying agent with respect to any series of debt securities  on or before each due date of the principal of or interest on any of the debt securities of that series  we will be required to segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to payment a sum sufficient to pay the amount due and to notify the Trustee promptly of our action or failure to act. If we have one or more paying agents for any series of debt securities  prior to each due date of the principal of or interest on any debt securities of that16TABLE OF CONTENTSseries  we will be required to deposit with a paying agent a sum sufficient to pay the amount due and  unless the paying agent is the Trustee  to promptly notify the Trustee of our action or failure to act. All moneys paid by us to a paying agent for the payment of principal of (or premium  if any) or interest on any debt securities that remain unclaimed for two years after the principal (or premium  if any) or interest has become due and payable may be repaid to us  and thereafter the holder of those debt securities may look only to us for payment thereof. Corporate Existence We will be required to preserve and keep in full force and effect our corporate existence  charter rights  statutory rights  licenses and franchises; provided that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right  license or franchise if the Company shall determine that such preservation is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company. Compliance Certificate The Company will be required to file annually with the Trustee a certificate signed by two of its officers  stating whether or not the officers know of any default by the Company in compliance with any provision of the Indenture. Merger and Consolidation The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into  or convey  transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets on a consolidated basis to  any Person  unless: (1)the resulting  surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a company  corporation  partnership  trust or limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America  any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume  by supplemental indenture  executed and delivered to the Trustee  all the obligations of the Company under the debt securities of any series and the Indenture; provided that if the Successor Company is not a corporation  a corporate wholly owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the United States of America  any State thereof or the District of Columbia shall become a co-issuer of such debt securities; ​ (2)immediately after giving effect to such transaction  no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and ​ (3)the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel  each stating that such consolidation  merger  sale  conveyance  transfer or lease  and such supplemental indenture (if any)  comply with the Indenture and that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with. ​ For purposes of the foregoing  the sale  lease  conveyance  transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more subsidiaries of the Company  which properties and assets  if held by the Company instead of such subsidiaries  would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis  shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis. The predecessor Company will be released from its obligations under the Indenture and the Successor Company will succeed to  and be substituted for  and may exercise every right and power of  the Company under the Indenture  but  in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets  the predecessor Company will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the debt securities of any series. Events of Default The following are Events of Default under the Indenture with respect to debt securities of any series: (1)default in any payment of interest on any debt security of that series when due and the continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; ​17TABLE OF CONTENTS(2)default in the payment of principal of or premium  if any  on any debt security of that series when due at its stated maturity or by declaration of acceleration  call for redemption or otherwise; ​ (3)failure to make any sinking fund payment when and as due by the terms of any debt security of that series and the continuance of such default for a period of 60 days; ​ (4)failure by the Company to perform or comply with any other covenant (other than a covenant or a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere specifically dealt with as an event of default or which has been expressly included in the Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of debt securities other than that series) for a period of 90 days after written notice thereof has been given to us as provided in the Indenture; ​ (5)specified events of bankruptcy  insolvency  or reorganization involving the Company; and ​ (6)any other Event of Default provided with respect to debt securities of that series. ​ Pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act  the Trustee is required to give to the holders of the debt securities of that series notice of all defaults known to it within 90 days of the occurrence thereof  except that other than in the case of a default of the character contemplated in clause (1)  (2)  or (3) above  the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as it in good faith determines that the withholding of notice is in the interests of the holders of the debt securities of that series. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs  the principal of  and accrued interest  if any  on the debt securities of that series will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder of the debt securities of that series. If any other Event of Default with respect to debt securities of any series occurs and is continuing  either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may declare the principal amount of  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on all debt securities of that series to be due and payable immediately. However  at any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to debt securities of any series has been made  but before a judgment or decree based on such acceleration has been obtained  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may  under specified circumstances  rescind and annul such acceleration. See “— Amendments and Waivers” below. Subject to the duty of the Trustee to act with the requisite standard of care during an Event of Default  the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of debt securities of any series unless such holders have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs  expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal  premium  if any  or interest when due  no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the debt securities of any series unless: (1)such holder has previously given the Trustee notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of that series; ​ (2)holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy in respect of such Event of Default; ​ (3)such holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss  liability or expense; ​ (4)the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and ​ (5)the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series have not given the Trustee a direction that is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. ​ Subject to certain restrictions  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series are given the right to direct the time  method and place of conducting any proceeding18TABLE OF CONTENTSfor any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture provides that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing  the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee  however  may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture  the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Any additional Events of Default with respect to any series of debt securities  and any variations from the foregoing Events of Default applicable to any series of debt securities  will be described in an applicable prospectus supplement. An event of default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default for any other series issued under the Indenture. Subordination The prospectus supplement  if any  relating to any offering of subordinated debt securities will describe the specific subordination provisions  including the extent of subordination of payments by the Company of the principal of  premium  if any  on and interest on such subordinated debt securities. Amendments and Waivers Subject to certain exceptions  the Indenture and the debt securities of any series may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all of the debt securities at the time outstanding (voting as a single class) or  if the amendment or supplement affects the debt securities of fewer than all of such series of debt securities  by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all such series affected by the amendment or supplement  with the debt securities of all the affected series voting together as a single class for this purpose (including without limitation  consents obtained in connection with a purchase of  or tender offer or exchange offer for  such debt securities) and  subject to certain exceptions  any past default or compliance with any provisions may be waived with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the debt securities at the time outstanding (voting as a single class) or  if the waiver of compliance with provisions affects the debt securities of fewer than all of such series of debt securities  by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all such series affected by the waiver  with the debt securities of all the affected series voting together as a single class for this purpose (including waivers obtained in connection with a purchase of  or tender offer or exchange offer for  such debt securities). In addition  without the consent of any Holder  the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or any series for certain purposes as set forth in the Indenture. However  without the consent of each holder of an outstanding debt security affected  no amendment  supplement or waiver may  among other things: (1)reduce the percentage in principal amount of debt securities of such series whose holders must consent to an amendment; ​ (2)reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such debt security; ​ (3)reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such debt security; ​ (4)reduce the premium payable upon the redemption or repurchase of any such debt security or change the time at which any such debt security may be redeemed or repurchased pursuant to the Indenture or any supplemental indenture; ​ (5)change the place or currency of payment of principal of  or premium  if any  or interest on any such debt security; ​ (6)impair the right of any holder to receive payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on ​19TABLE OF CONTENTSsuch holder’s debt securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder’s debt securities; or (7)make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holder’s consent or in the waiver provisions for such securities. ​ The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or supplement. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or supplement. A consent to any amendment  supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any holder of debt securities given in connection with a tender of such holder’s debt securities will not be rendered invalid by such tender. Satisfaction and Discharge The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all notes issued thereunder  when either: (1)all such notes that have been authenticated and delivered (except lost  stolen or destroyed notes that have been replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or ​ (2)all such notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise  will become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name  and at the expense  of the Company  and the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with such Trustee  as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders  cash in U.S. dollars  U.S. Government Obligations (as defined in the Indenture)  or a combination thereof  in such amounts as will be sufficient  without consideration of any reinvestment of interest  to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal  premium  if any  and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption  as the case may be; ​ (3)the Company has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it with respect to notes under the Indenture; and ​ (4)the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the notes at maturity or the redemption date  as the case may be. ​ In addition  the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied. Defeasance The Company at any time may terminate all its obligations under the debt securities of any series and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”)  except for certain obligations  including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of such debt securities  to replace mutilated  destroyed  lost or stolen debt securities and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the debt securities of any series. The Company may at any time terminate its obligations to comply with certain covenants described above under “— Certain Covenants” and certain covenants of any outstanding series of debt securities that may be contained in any applicable prospectus supplement  and we may omit to comply with such covenants without creating an Event of Default (“covenant defeasance”). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe our ability to be released from any of our covenant obligations under the Indenture with respect to any series of debt securities.20TABLE OF CONTENTSIn order to exercise either defeasance option  the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of any series to redemption or maturity  as the case may be  and must comply with certain other conditions  including  without limitation  delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) to the effect that holders of such series will not recognize income  gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred. In the case of legal defeasance only  such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable Federal income tax law. If the Company fails to comply with its remaining obligations under the Indenture with respect to the debt securities of any series following a covenant defeasance and such debt securities are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of any undefeased Event of Default  the amount of money and U.S. Government Obligations on deposit with the Trustee may be insufficient to pay amounts due on such debt securities at the time of the acceleration resulting from such Event of Default; however  the Company will remain liable in respect of such payments. Payments We will pay interest  principal and other amounts payable with respect to the debt securities of any series to the holders of record of those debt securities as of the record dates and otherwise in the manner specified below or in the prospectus supplement for that series. We will make payments on a global debt security in accordance with the applicable policies of the depositary as in effect from time to time. Under those policies  we will pay directly to the depositary  or its nominee  and not to any indirect owners who own beneficial interests in the global debt security. An indirect owner’s right to receive those payments will be governed by the rules and practices of the depositary and its participants. We will make payments on a debt security in non-global  registered form as follows. We will pay interest that is due on an interest payment date by check mailed on the interest payment date to the holder at his or her address shown on the Trustee’s records as of the close of business on the regular record date. We will make all other payments by check at the paying agent described below  against surrender of the debt security. All payments by check will be made in next-day funds (i.e.  funds that become available on the day after the check is cashed). Alternatively  if a non-global debt security has a face amount of at least $1 000 000 and the holder asks us to do so  we will pay any amount that becomes due on the debt security by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account at a bank in New York City  on the due date. To request wire payment  the holder must give the paying agent appropriate wire transfer instructions at least five business days before the requested wire payment is due. In the case of any interest payment due on an interest payment date  the instructions must be given by the person or entity who is the holder on the relevant regular record date. In the case of any other payment  payment will be made only after the debt security is surrendered to the paying agent. Any wire instructions  once properly given  will remain in effect unless and until new instructions are given in the manner described above. Book-entry and other indirect owners should consult their banks or brokers for information on how they will receive payments on their debt securities. No Individual Liability of Incorporators  Stockholders  Officers or Directors The Indenture provides that no incorporator and no past  present or future stockholder  officer or director of the Company or any successor company  in their capacity as such  shall have any individual liability for any of our obligations under the debt securities or the Indenture. Governing Law The Indenture is  and the debt securities will be  governed by  and construed in accordance with  the laws of the State of New York.21TABLE OF CONTENTSRegarding the Trustee The Indenture does not prohibit the Trustee from serving as trustee under any other indenture to which we may be a party from time to time or from engaging in other transactions with us. If the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and there is an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities  the Trustee must eliminate the conflict or resign.22TABLE OF CONTENTS​DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS We may issue warrants to purchase any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares and purchase contracts.

A prospectus supplement  if required  will set forth any required information such as the terms of the offering and the method of distribution and will include the following information: •the name or names of any underwriters or agents; ​ •the purchase price of the securities from us; ​ •the net proceeds to us from the sale of the securities; ​ •any over-allotment options under which underwriters may purchase additional securities from us; ​ •any underwriting discounts  commissions and other items constituting compensation to underwriters  dealers or agents; ​ •any public offering price; ​ •any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers; and ​ •any securities exchange or market on which the securities offered in a prospectus supplement may be listed. ​ Sale Through Underwriters or Dealers If we use underwriters in the sale of securities  the underwriters will acquire the securities for their own account. The underwriters may resell the securities from time to time in one or more transactions  including negotiated transactions  at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of sale. Underwriters may offer securities to the public either through underwriting syndicates represented by one or more managing underwriters or directly by one or more firms acting as underwriters. The obligations of the underwriters to purchase the securities may be subject to conditions  and the underwriters may in such event be obligated to purchase all the offered securities if they purchase any of them. The underwriters may change from time to time any initial public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers. Underwriters may sell our common stock under this prospectus by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act  which includes sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange  on any other existing trading market for our common stock or to or through a market maker  or in privately negotiated transactions. Unless stated otherwise in any applicable prospectus supplement  the sales agent with respect to any such at the market offering will make all sales using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices  on mutually agreeable terms between the sales agent and us. Any applicable prospectus supplement will include the amount of any compensation to be received by the sales agent. During and after an offering through underwriters  the underwriters may purchase and sell the securities in the open market. These transactions may include overallotment and stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover syndicate short positions created in connection with the offering. The underwriters also may impose a penalty bid  which means that selling concessions allowed to syndicate members or other broker-dealers for the offered securities sold for their account may be reclaimed by the syndicate if the offered securities are repurchased by the syndicate in stabilizing or covering transactions. These activities may stabilize  maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the offered securities  which may be higher than the price that might otherwise prevail in the open market. If commenced  the underwriters may discontinue these activities at any time. If we use dealers in the sale of securities  we will sell the securities to them as principals. They may then resell those securities to the public at varying prices determined by the dealers at the time of resale. We also may agree to sell  and the relevant underwriters or agents may agree to solicit offers to purchase  blocks of27TABLE OF CONTENTSsecurities.

Delayed Delivery Contracts We may authorize agents  underwriters or dealers to solicit offers from certain types of institutions to purchase securities from us at the public offering price under delayed delivery contracts. These contracts would provide for payment and delivery on a specified date in the future. The contracts would be subject only to those conditions described in a prospectus supplement. Such prospectus supplement will describe the commission payable for solicitation of those contracts. Remarketing We may offer and sell any of the securities in connection with a remarketing upon their purchase  in accordance with a redemption or repayment by their terms or otherwise  by one or more remarketing firms acting as principals for their own accounts or as our agents. The name of any remarketing firm  the terms of any remarketing agreement and the compensation to be paid to the remarketing firm will be included in a prospectus supplement  as required. Remarketing firms may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act.

For further information  please see “Other developments”FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR JANUARY-MARCH 2022Sampo Group’s core business  P&C insurance  reported an underwriting profit of EUR 290 million (317) in January-March 2022. Excluding COVID-19 effects reported in the first quarter of 2021  underwriting profit grew 4 per cent. The Group combined ratio increased by 2.3 percentage points to 83.5 per cent (81.2)  driven mainly by the economic activity returning back to normal levels as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted during the quarter. Excluding the COVID-19 effects reported in If and Topdanmark in the first quarter of 2021  the combined ratio improved by 0.1 percentage points from 83.6 per cent a year ago. Gross written premiums increased by 7 per cent to EUR 2 833 million  supported by strong renewals and high retention. Sampo targets mid-single digit per cent underwriting profit growth on average and a combined ratio below 86 per cent for 2021-2023.If P&C continued its strong performance and achieved an underwriting profit of EUR 234 million (213)  representing a year-on-year growth of 10 per cent. The growth was driven by 0.7 percentage points improvement in the combined ratio to 80.8 per cent (81.5) and a strong 6.9 per cent currency adjusted premium growth. Premiums grew in all Business Areas and markets  supported by strong 1 January renewals with rate increases  high retention and an increase in customer count. If’s adjusted risk ratio improved by 0.7 percentage points year-on-year. Effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic were well below those observed in 2021 and have therefore not been quantified. Profit before taxes increased to EUR 283 million (257).Topdanmark’s profit before taxes decreased to EUR 37 million (137) in Sampo Group’s profit and loss account. The combined ratio was 87.8 per cent (84.7).Hastings’ performance in the first quarter was affected by challenging UK motor insurance market  with competitive pricing and elevated claims inflation. Hastings has taken a disciplined approach to pricing  leading to rate driven currency adjusted premium growth of 10 per cent and broadly stable policy count from year-end. Home insurance policies grew by 18 per cent year-on-year. The operating ratio increased to 92.5 per cent (75.1)  mainly as a result of a reduction in COVID-19 effects. Hastings profit before taxes excluding non-operational depreciation and amortisation amounted to EUR 17 million (56) and reported profit before taxes stood at EUR 2 million (46).Mandatum segment’s profit before taxes for January-March 2022 increased to EUR 80 million (76). Despite the uncertain market situation  Mandatum’s unit-linked and other client assets under management remained near record high levels at EUR 10.9 billion (11.1)  as net flows partly offset adverse market developments. Mandatum Life’s Solvency II ratio increased to 216 per cent (190)  as weak mark-to-market investment results were more than offset by increasing interest rates and a decrease in the symmetric adjustment.Holding segment’s profit before taxes increased to EUR 164 million (115)  including a dividend of EUR 157 million from Nordea and a gain of EUR 28 million from the sale of 19 million Nordea shares in the open market. During April 2022  Sampo completed the exit from Nordea and stated that management will propose that a new share buyback programme is launched after the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2022  subject to the AGM renewing the Board authorisation on share repurchases.The share buyback programme of EUR 750 million launched on October 2021 was completed on 25 March 2022. In total  Sampo repurchased 17.1 million own shares  corresponding to 3.1 per cent of all shares. The repurchased shares were cancelled on 31 March 2022. On 30 March 2022  Sampo launched a new buyback programme of up to EUR 250 million.Sampo Group’s Solvency II ratio increased to 200 per cent (185) over the quarter  net of dividend accrual based on the 2021 insurance dividend of EUR 1.70 per share and the new buyback programme of EUR 250 million. The improvement of 15 percentage points from year-end 2021 was mainly driven by rising interest rates and a decline in the symmetric adjustment. Sampo targets a solvency ratio of 170-190 per cent. The sale of Sampo's remaining Nordea shares in April is expected to add approximately 30 percentage points to the group solvency ratio.Sampo Group’s financial leverage increased to 24.8 per cent from 23.8 per cent at the end of 2021  driven by a decrease in equity. Adjusted for the proposed dividend and ongoing buyback programme  the financial leverage amounted to 29.0 per cent (27.9). Sampo targets a financial leverage below 30 per cent.Sampo plc’s Annual General Meeting will be held on 18 May 2022. The Board has proposed on 9 February 2022 to the AGM a dividend of EUR 4.10 per share  of which the insurance dividend is EUR 1.70 per share.GROUP CEO’S COMMENTSampo’s first quarter performance proved resilient to the increase in economic and geopolitical uncertainty observed during the year  most notably in relation to the tragic and unjustified war in Ukraine. We have achieved excellent P&C underwriting results and our balance sheet remains solid  allowing the launch of a new buyback programme. In addition  we continued to execute on our strategic agenda by completing the exit from Nordea during April.Taking a closer look at P&C insurance  our largest operation  If P&C  delivered an excellent quarter. Premium growth stood at 7 per cent year-on-year even though new car sales declined by around 20 per cent across the Nordic region. Underlying margins were also robust  with a record-strong combined ratio of 80.8 per cent despite above-expected large losses and loss frequencies returning close to normal levels after pandemic related restrictions ended.The rise in energy and commodity prices triggered by the war in Ukraine has increased uncertainty over the trajectory of inflation  both in terms of broader consumer prices and with regard to the cost of insurance claims. We have continued to observe claims inflation at around three per cent in the Nordic region during 2022  broadly at the same level as at the end of 2021  helped by our multi-year procurement agreements. Nonetheless  given the eternal external environment we see potential upside risk to this figure as we progress through the year. Hence  we are pricing on the basis of prudent assumptions and working closely with customers to ensure that the right coverage is in place. Premium growth and retention have both been excellent across all If P&C’s business areas in the first quarter  which gives me confidence in our ability to navigate the operating environment.The interaction between Hastings and If P&C is intensifying; I see significant cultural overlap between the two organisations that will create value over time. In the first quarter  conditions in the UK motor market have been challenging  with elevated claims inflation putting pressure on underwriting margins. Hastings has remained disciplined in its pricing  increasing rates to cover rising claims costs  which has supported premium growth of 10 per cent. Meanwhile  the home insurance book has made excellent progress as policy count grew by 18 per cent year-on-year.Capital markets were volatile in the first quarter. Higher interest rates are having a positive economic effect on our business through increased reinvestment rates and lower liability values. Due to the short duration of our fixed income portfolio  we are relatively well positioned to rotate into higher yielding instruments. On the downside  wider credit spreads and a decline in equity markets had a negative impact on investment return in the first quarter.Sampo’s balance sheet has been resilient to the increase in uncertainty  as both capital and financial leverage have remained at or above target levels. Hence  we were able to launch a new EUR 250 million share buyback programme shortly after completing the EUR 750 million programme launched last year.On 29 April  Sampo reached a key milestone in its strategy by completing the exit from Nordea  thus becoming a pure insurance group. With a clearer focus for both management and shareholders  I am confident that we have a robust foundation for even stronger operational and value creation. The exit from Nordea also further increases the Group’s resilience by reducing our exposure to market risk. Following the sale  management intends to propose to the Board that a new share buyback programme is launched after the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2022.Looking to the rest of the year  I am optimistic about the performance of our excellent P&C operations and remain committed to our P&C insurance focused strategy.Torbjörn MagnussonGroup CEO and PresidentOUTLOOKOutlook for 2022Sampo Group’s P&C insurance operations are expected to achieve underwriting margins that meet the annual targets set for 2021-2023. At Group level  Sampo targets a combined ratio of below 86 per cent  while the target for its largest subsidiary  If P&C  is below 85 per cent. Hastings targets an operating ratio of below 88 per cent. Following strong performance in the first quarter  the outlook for If P&C’s 2022 combined ratio has been improved to 82–84 per cent.The combined and operating ratios of Sampo Group’s P&C insurance operations are subject to volatility driven by  among other factors  seasonal weather patterns  large claims  prior year development and fluctuations in claims frequency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects are particularly relevant for individual segments and business areas  such as the Danish and UK operations.The mark-to-market component of investment returns will be significantly influenced by capital markets’ developments  particularly in life insurance.With regard to Topdanmark  reference is made to the profit forecast model that the company publishes on a quarterly basis.The major risks and uncertainties for the Group in the near-termIn its current day-to-day business activities Sampo Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties  mainly through its major business units.Major risks affecting the Group companies’ profitability and its variation are market  credit  insurance and operational risks. At the Group level  sources of risks are the same  although they are not directly additive due to the effects of diversification.Uncertainties in the form of major unforeseen events may have an immediate impact on the Group’s profitability. The identification of unforeseen events is easier than the estimation of their probabilities  timing  and potential outcomes. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic a combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus  supply chain problems and elevated demand for consumer goods have led to high levels of inflation  with energy and product prices being particularly affected. More recently the war in Ukraine has created a new negative supply shock for the global economy depressing economic growth and further pushing up the prices of commodities and energy. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine are consequently currently causing significant uncertainties on economic and capital market development. There are also a number of widely identified macroeconomic  political and other sources of uncertainty which can  in various ways  affect the financial services industry in a negative manner.Other sources of uncertainty are unforeseen structural changes in the business environment and already identified trends and potential wide-impact events. These external drivers may have a long-term impact on how Sampo Group’s business will be conducted. Examples of identified trends are demographic changes  sustainability issues  and technological developments in areas such as artificial intelligence and digitalisation including threats posed by cybercrime.OTHER DEVELOPMENTSDividend proposalOn 9 February 2022  the Sampo Board proposed to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 4.10 per share for the 2021 financial year. The dividend is proposed to be paid to the shareholders registered in the Register of Shareholders held by Euroclear Finland Oy as at the record date of 20 May 2022. The Board proposes that the dividends be paid on 31 May 2022. The full dividend proposal is available on www.sampo.com/agm.Effects of external events on Sampo GroupThe first quarter saw an increase in geopolitical uncertainty as Russia launched an invasion into neighbouring Ukraine. The Group has limited insurance exposures in the affected region through certain Nordic industrial lines clients and coverage is subject to war exclusions. On the asset side  Sampo has no material direct investments in Russia or Ukraine.Given the limited direct exposure  the biggest risk from the war in Ukraine to Sampo relates to second order capital markets and macroeconomic effects. The Group carries substantial market risk exposures via its strategic investments and through insurance company investment portfolios and liabilities  which may be adversely affected by market shocks. This risk taking is supported by financial buffers calibrated to withstand volatility  and Sampo operated above its target financial strength levels at the end of the first quarter of 2022.Macroeconomic effects could also have an impact on Sampo’s operational business  for example by reducing economic growth  aggravating supply chain problems and inflating commodity prices. These considerations are particularly relevant as supply chain disruption and high inflation had already become established prior to the invasion following the COVID-19 pandemic and associated monetary and fiscal stimulus programmes.In the Nordic and Baltic countries  COVID-19 effects in the quarter were materially below the levels observed over 2021. Motor claims frequencies were affected by pandemic-related restrictions in the first part of the quarter but later returned toward pre-pandemic levels. In the UK  motor claims frequencies have increased as restrictions were lifted but remain below pre-COVID-19 levels. Given the limited impact of COVID-19 and the increasing difficulty in reliably estimating associated effects  Sampo has decided not to provide any quantitative disclosure of COVID-19 effects in the first quarter.EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODShare buyback programmeSampo’s share buyback programme announced on 30 March 2022 continued after the end of the reporting period. By Friday 29 April 2022 market close  the company had bought in total 2 851 150 Sampo A shares representing 0.53 per cent of the total number of shares in Sampo plc. The progress of the buyback programme can be followed on www.sampo.com/releases.Disposals of Nordea sharesSampo sold all of its remaining Nordea holding in April  after the end of the reporting period  through an accelerated bookbuild offering of 200 million shares on 29 April and the sale of 26 million shares in the open market. The transactions generated total gross proceeds of EUR 2.1 billion and will have a positive accounting effect of approximately EUR 82 million on Sampo’s consolidated statement of profit and loss.In connection with disclosing the results of the bookbuild offering  Sampo disclosed that management intends to propose to the Board that a new share buyback programme is launched after the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2022  subject to the AGM renewing the Board authorisation on share repurchases.SAMPO PLCBoard of DirectorsFor more information  please contactKnut Arne Alsaker  Group CFO  tel. +358 10 516 0010Sami Taipalus  Head of Investor Relations  tel. +358 10 516 0030Maria Silander  Communications Manager  Media Relations  tel. +358 10 516 0031Conference callAn English-language conference call for investors and analysts will be arranged at 4 pm Finnish time (2 pm UK time).

Ever since  our key priority has been to protect our personnel’s safety in Ukraine. We have provided our Ukrainian employees and their family members with transportation to neighboring Poland and Romania  as well as accommodation. To our knowledge  none of our employees has been hurt or has died as a result of Russia’s acts of war.Aspo’s business environment is looking quite different from our estimate in our financial statements release. It is obvious that the operating environment has changed dramatically in eastern markets  and Russia’s reprehensible invasion will have an enduring impact on business opportunities in the region.As announced previously  Aspo has decided to withdraw Leipurin’s operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. We will investigate strategic alternatives  also including the possible divestment of these businesses. The more detailed schedule and implementation of the process will be evaluated  and the process will be carried out addressing the company’s employees and customers  as well as local legislation. Telko’s ability to continue its operations in Russia has deteriorated  and the stricter sanctions have accelerated the adaptation of operations. Since the war broke out in Ukraine  the capital invested in Telko’s warehouse and receivables in Russia has decreased by roughly 30%. The investigation of strategic alternatives for Telko’s operations in Russia is being actively continued. The majority of ESL Shipping’s operations related to Russia has been suspended  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. All transportation operations related to Russia are expected to stop by the end of the year. Aspo’s management is closely monitoring the progress and impact of the crisis and will assess and carry out any further measures on a business-specific basis.Aspo’s financial results for the first quarter of 2022 can be regarded as excellent. The Group’s net sales increased by 23% to EUR 162.6 million. The growth target of 5–10% was significantly exceeded. Operating profit also increased significantly from the comparative period to EUR 10.1 million and 6.2%. The operating profit of Telko and Leipurin for the first quarter was particularly affected by their warehouses in Ukraine  which were destroyed as a result of Russia’s acts of war  and credit loss provisions associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine. Considering the Group as a whole  items affecting comparability totaled EUR -4.9 million during the first quarter. This also includes ESL Shipping’s sales gains of EUR 1.5 million  attributable to the sale of the barge Espa. The Group’s comparable operating profit for the first quarter was record-high at EUR 15.0 (7.9) million. The comparable operating profit was 9.2% (6.0%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Earnings per share increased to EUR 0.21 (0.19)  with the impact of items affecting comparability on earnings per share being approximately EUR -0.13. Net cash from operating activities remained at a very strong level. All this results from our personnel’s strong commitment and our operational successes in a very challenging market environment.Our strong result during the first quarter was particularly driven by ESL Shipping’s excellent performance. The shipping company’s net sales increased by 31% to EUR 56.8 (43.4) million  and its comparable operating profit was EUR 7.9 (4.5) million and 13.9% (10.4%)  nearly achieving the target level of 14.0%.Telko also continued its strong performance. Telko’s net sales increased by 31% to EUR 75.9 million  and its comparable operating profit was EUR 8.6 (4.6) million and 11.3% (7.9%)  exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Leipurin’s net sales remained at the comparative period’s level at EUR 27.7 (28.0) million. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit during the first quarter was EUR 0.7 (0.3) million and 2.5% (1.1%). The operating profit target set for Leipurin is 5%. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit without Vulganus was EUR 1.0 (0.5) million and operating profit rate 4.0% (1.9%).On March 2  2022  Aspo canceled its guidance for 2022 due to uncertainties caused by Russia’s acts of war and the resulting sanctions. Even though the exceptional circumstances caused by the war still involve significant uncertainties  we were already able to issue a new guidance at the beginning of April  according to which Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit will be EUR 27–34 million in 2022.Even though our operating environment has undergone dramatic changes  we will continue to determinedly implement our strategy published in December. According to the strategy  Aspo will focus on expanding its business in western markets. Decisions on solutions concerning operations in Russia will be made in a controlled manner  also considering the position of employees and any restrictions set by local legislation.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsOn December 1  2021  Aspo published new long-term financial targets:Operating profit of 8%Net sales growth 5–10% per yearReturn on equity of over 20%Gearing less than 130%With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%.Aspo’s net sales increased by 24% during the first quarter of 2022. The comparable operating profit rate was 9.2% (6.0%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained high at 21.2% (21.8%). Gearing decreased to 118.8% (129.4%).Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit from continuing and discontinued operationsAspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is presented less significant items affecting comparability that are rare and deviate from normal business operations. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by the war.Aspo announced in December 2021 that the Kauko business segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  have been defined as businesses outside Aspo’s core operations. As a result  the Kauko business segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in consolidated reporting in accordance with IFRS  and its results are reported separately from the figures of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. With regard to the income statement  comparative periods’ figures have been restated to correspond to the same presentation method. The results of Vulganus are reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.Net sales and operating profit margin  Group total 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales  Group total 162.6 132.4 586.4 Net sales  continuing operations 160.4 129.4 573.3 Net sales  discontinued operations 2.2 3.0 13.1 Operating profit  Group total 10.1 7.9 33.9 Operating profit  Group total  % 6.2 6.0 5.8 Items affecting comparability*) -4.9 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 15.0 7.9 42.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 9.2 6.0 7.2Comparable operating profit  Group total 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping  operating profit 9.2 4.5 26.8 Telko  operating profit 4.0 4.6 20.4 Leipurin  operating profit -0.4 0.3 -2.4 Other operations  operating profit -2.5 -1.6 -7.9 Operating profit from continuing operations 10.3 7.8 36.9 Operating profit from discontinued operations -0.2 0.1 -3.0 Operating profit  Group total 10.1 7.9 33.9 Items affecting comparability*) -4.9 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 15.0 7.9 42.4*) The items affecting the comparability of the first quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -4.9 million  consist of EUR 1.5 million in sales gains from ESL Shipping barge Espa  ESL Shipping’s cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the war in Ukraine  EUR -2.6 million in losses from the destruction of Telko’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -2.0 million associated with Telko’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  EUR -0.7 million in losses from the destruction of Leipurin’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -0.2 million associated with Leipurin’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  and EUR -0.2 million in Leipurin’s other business adaptation expenses in Russia. The operating result of other operations included the share-based payment of EUR -0.5 million granted to Aspo’s previous CEO.The items affecting the comparability of 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin’s goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko’s terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of the discontinued operations.SustainabilitySustainability is a key factor in guiding Aspo’s management system and the process of investigating new investment objects. Aspo’s businesses aim to be forerunners in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) targets for the Group and significant parts of its businesses. The key goal is to reduce the emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. During the past 12 months  the emission intensity continued to improve  driven by business growth  and it was 0.39 (0.42). Another key target is to improve the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIF). During the past 12 months  LTIF was 7.6 (8.8)  while the target for 2022 is 7.0. The long-term goal is zero occupational accidents.The impact of the war in Ukraine on Aspo’s operating environmentAspo’s operating environment has changed dramatically in a short period of time. The European security environment has deteriorated as a result of Russia’s armed invasion of Ukraine. The invasion has caused direct losses for Aspo’s businesses through the destruction of warehouses in Ukraine  for example. The indirect impact on Aspo’s business operations includes the significant fluctuations in prices and exchange rates. Suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The war drastically reduces operating conditions in eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  but particularly based on values. The sanctions imposed by western countries and Russia’s legislative measures prevent the transportation of goods and the transfer of payments  rapidly reducing net sales and profitability. As the level of security has decreased  vessel operations have also been restricted and Russian products cannot be transported. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight. In western markets  Russia’s acts of war have only had a minor impact at present  while the impact on financial development  production and supply chains  and inflation will be significant.Russia accounts for less than 15% of the Group’s equity  and this share will continue to be actively reduced. Aspo’s assets in Russia are mainly related to inventories and trade receivables. The financial significance of small-scale production operations is very minor for the Group. Approximately 170 employees of Aspo Group’s all personnel work in Russia.In news  the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion  but its impact can still be felt in our operating environment. The global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on certain Aspo’s businesses  decelerating trading and the completion of orders. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations and especially among crew members.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 1-3/2022 Share 1-3/2021 Share Change MEUR % MEUR % % Finland 53.3 33 42.5 33 25 Scandinavia 28.6 18 24.7 19 16 Baltic countries 15.5 10 11.9 9 30 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 40.3 25 35.0 27 15 Other countries 22.7 14 15.3 12 48 Total 160.4 100 129.4 100 24The Group’s main market areas are Finland  Scandinavia  the Baltic region  and eastern markets (Russia  other CIS countries  and Ukraine). The relative share of net sales in eastern markets decreased during the first quarter of 2022  mainly due to the war in Ukraine. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at western markets.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s cash flow from operating activities in January–March was EUR 15.2 (6.6) million. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -0.6 (-7.2) million. Free cash flow during the first quarter was EUR 13.8 (5.1) million.

The impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the increase in financial expenses was EUR -0.9 million. The average rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 1.3% (1.5%).The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents were EUR 41.3 million at the end of the review period (12/2021: EUR 17.7 million). Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40.0 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. EUR 20 million of Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program were in use (3/2021: EUR 8 million; 12/2021: EUR 5 million).On March 28  2022  Aspo announced that it will exercise its right to withdraw the full hybrid loan of EUR 20 million with 8.75% interest issued on April 30  2020. The hybrid loan was repaid on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsThe tensions between Russia and Ukraine that ignited in 2014 intensified until the beginning of this year and erupted in Russia’s armed invasion of Ukraine in February. The invasion has caused considerable human suffering and devastating destruction in Ukraine. Risks classified previously as geopolitical risks have materialized in various ways as material losses and threats directed at the personnel  as well as significant decreases in business in crisis areas. As a result of different sanctions  legislative obstacles and value-driven causes  it has become more difficult to engage in business in Russia  and no relief is in sight in the foreseeable future. Aspo’s businesses in Russia will be affected by the restrictions imposed due to the war  and it is possible that this will cause financial losses for Aspo. The impact will also extend to Aspo’s operations in Belarus and Kazakhstan. At present  it is impossible to estimate the duration or extent of Russia’s acts of war in Ukraine.Globally  there are many geopolitical risk clusters  the development of which is difficult to predict. Changes in these regions may be rapid and unpredictable  which is why it is difficult to estimate their potential impact on Aspo’s businesses. International sanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. In addition  various countries have imposed import bans or other trade restrictions on each other’s products. Geopolitical tensions can escalate and cause direct damage to business  payments and even suspend business operations in a crisis area or in areas affected by it. The crisis can also lead to human  economic and monetary losses. Possible sanctions  including counter-sanctions  and any changes in them could lead to business difficulties and economic losses.Increased economic activity has caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to increase rapidly  and increased uncertainties over the functioning of logistics in certain market situations. Aspo may temporarily benefit from this increase in prices  while the prices of purchased raw materials or leased capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes in different market situations  are also increasing risks. Growing inflation and rising interest rates may decelerate general economic growth and reduce demand for Aspo’s businesses. Furthermore  any non-functioning or restricted functioning of logistics due to sanctions or other causes may restrict Aspo’s businesses  and they may also be affected by cyber risks and disruptions in information systems.In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its steady results through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial investments and consequently may reduce solvency.The coronavirus pandemic continues to have an impact on Aspo’s businesses. Any new variants of coronavirus and their rapid spread may lead to various interruptions and financial losses.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation  they involve risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESSESESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk cargo company in the Baltic Sea region. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 48 vessels with a total capacity of 456 000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (75% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 23 vessels (23%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service.1-3/2022 1-3/2021 Change  % Net sales  MEUR 56.8 43.4 31 Operating profit  MEUR 9.2 4.5 104 Operating profit  % 16.2 10.4 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 1.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 7.9 4.5 76 Comparable operating profit  % 13.9 10.4The first quarter was yet again the strongest in ESL Shipping’s history. Net sales increased by 31% from the comparative period to EUR 56.8 (43.4) million. During the quarter  the operating profit more than doubled to a record-high level of EUR 9.2 (4.5) million. It includes sales gains of EUR 1.5 million attributable to the sale of the barge Espa and cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the shutdown of operations in Russia. The comparable operating profit increased significantly to EUR 7.9 (4.5) million.The strong result is a good indication of the effectiveness of the shipping company’s partnership strategy  and the entire personnel’s operational success in challenging operating conditions. The comparable operating profit rate of 13.9% (10.4%) achieved during the first quarter was excellent  considering the challenging ice conditions in the Bothnian Bay compared with previous years  and the target level of 14.0% was nearly achieved.As announced previously  the majority of ESL Shipping’s operations related to Russia has been suspended  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. All transportation operations in Russia are expected to stop by the end of the year at the latest. The schedule depends on any obligations set in existing customer contracts. ESL Shipping has also suspended the start-up of its previously established Russian company.The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories was historically strong during the first quarter. In contract traffic  demand for transportation remained strong throughout the review period  and market freight rates were at a high level in all customer segments and vessel categories. With regard to ship fuels  the price of diesel doubled and that of LNG  which suffered the most from disruptions in European energy markets  was nearly four times higher than in the comparative period  but the impact of the price increases on costs are offset through long-term fuel clauses in transportation agreements.The current level of very high fuel surcharges will increase net sales and reduce the operating profit rate  used as an indicator of relative profitability  even though no actual changes would take place in the absolute operating profit. The volume of cargo transported by the shipping company during the first quarter increased from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.5) million tonnes.The program for building the shipping company’s new next-generation low emission electric hybrid vessels has proceeded as planned  and the metal construction of the first vessel started in the middle of March. The vessels are expected to start operations from the third quarter of 2023 onwards at three-month intervals. The scheduled dockage of the current fleet continued when a larger vessel was docked for roughly one week during the first quarter.The long-term development of sustainability and the maintenance of a high level of safety are characteristic to the shipping company’s operations. ESL Shipping’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The shipping company aims to halve its carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. In this  the “Virtual arrival” model deployed by the shipping company plays a significant role  in which contractual practices for ship scheduling will be updated in cooperation with customers and ports to enable environmentally friendlier vessel operations. Savings in energy costs will be distributed between the shipping company and each customer so that both parties benefit from the new policy. During the first quarter  the emission intensity of ESL Shipping’s transportation operations decreased by 17% from the comparative period to 15.8 grams of carbon dioxide per ton mile.ESL Shipping outlook for 2022Demand for transportation and the price level of sea freights in the company’s main market area in Northern Europe are at a satisfactory level in all vessel categories. Most of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements. After deliveries of Russian raw materials stopped  certain of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers were forced to seek new suppliers for part of their production input required in new geographic areas. This is expected to extend transportation distances and increase demand for sea transportation per ton mile among ESL Shipping’s largest vessels.In the short term and especially during the second quarter  the volumes of raw materials transported by Handysize vessels will decrease from previous estimates  as customers’ procurement activities shift away from Russia. The timing of transportation volumes will also be affected by maintenance stoppages at ports and railroad maintenance in Northern Sweden. Restrictions on vessel sizes at ports in the company’s main market area and at its customers’ ports  combined with the need for year-round transportation  will again secure ESL Shipping’s transportation demand starting from the second half of the year when deliveries shipped from across the oceans to replace Russian raw materials reach Europe and are shipped further to customers.In the smaller vessel category  transportation demand in contract traffic is expected to remain at a satisfactory level. However  customers’ supply chains may involve challenges in the availability of raw materials that may also have an impact on realized product transportation volumes. Vessel rents that have partly increased to an unhealthy level are starting to decrease  and the availability of additional capacity is expected to improve during the second and third quarters. The determined preventive measures will continue to protect the personnel’s health security during the coronavirus pandemic.In Northern Europe  there continues to be considerable growth in interest among customers in environmentally friendly maritime transport that produces as low carbon emissions as possible. In addition to ESL Shipping’s investments in new highly environmentally friendly vessels  the shipping company is preparing long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide sea transportation with even lower carbon emissions  and even fossil-free transportation  in the future.With regard to the order placed for the Green Coaster electric hybrid vessels and its options  the shipping company is preparing investors’ entry in the ownership and operations of vessels within a pooling arrangement  which is a common practice in international shipping operations. The aim is to accelerate ESL Shipping’s operational growth and improve its profitability and return on capital.During the rest of 2022  two larger and four smaller vessel units will be docked for a total of approximately 95 days. In total  there will be approximately 105 dockage days in 2022. In 2021  the corresponding figure was 229. After these dockages  all vessels owned by ESL Shipping will be equipped with ballast water treatment systems that meet new environmental regulations.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service both in the east and the west. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.Kauko has been defined as a business outside Aspo’s core operations. As a result  Kauko’s figures are no longer reported as part of Telko. Kauko’s figures have been removed from all of Telko’s figures.Telko 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 75.9 58.0 31 Operating profit  MEUR 4.0 4.6 -13 Operating profit  % 5.3 7.9 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -4.6 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 8.6 4.6 87 Comparable operating profit  % 11.3 7.9During the first quarter  Telko’s net sales grew strongly to EUR 75.9 (58.0) million. Its operating profit for the first quarter decreased to EUR 4.0 (4.6) million. The operating profit rate was 5.3% (7.9%). The operating result includes items affecting comparability of EUR -4.6 million relating to the destroyed warehouse in Ukraine and a credit loss provision associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine. Sales were significantly affected by the increase in prices after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine  which also raised sales margins to an unusually high level. Then again  exchange rate losses resulting from the steep decline in the value of the Russian ruble reduced the results. Without the items affecting comparability  Telko’s operating result for the first quarter was EUR 8.6 (4.6) million  and its operating profit rate was 11.3% (7.9%). Telko has focused on assisting its employees and their families in Ukraine  helping them evacuate  and providing accommodation for those fleeing the war. While sales have decreased steeply in Ukraine  Telko is committed to continuing its operations in the country.In Russia  Telko focuses on selling its existing stocks as announced previously. After the war broke out in Ukraine  the capital invested in Telko’s warehouse and receivables in Russia has decreased by roughly 30%. Telko’s ability to continue its operations in Russia has deteriorated  and stricter sanctions have accelerated the adaptation of operations. The investigation of strategic alternatives continues.In western markets  Telko’s sales developed as planned  and the Ukrainian crisis has not had any direct impact on operations. Demand remained stable in all of Telko’s business operations  while difficulties in availability continued to restrict the development of volumes in all operations. Prices remained high in all operations and even increased in several business areas. Telko has continued its growth efforts in western markets  which has had an impact on the increase in costs.The net sales of the plastics business increased by 22% during the first quarter to EUR 39.3 (32.1) million. The price level of plastics was clearly higher than during the comparative period in all product groups  and the average price of sales increased significantly. Prices partly reached a historically unusual level. While availability problems have decreased  challenges still remain in certain product groups. Customer demand was at a normal level. However  the high price levels of raw materials and energy have forced certain customers to temporarily restrict their production.The net sales of the chemicals business increased by 53% to EUR 25.3 (16.5) million. The exceptional demand in eastern markets and high price levels are reflected in the first quarter’s figures. In general  product prices increased in nearly all product groups in all markets. Delays in deliveries have been common. In addition  transportation prices are increasing clearly in Europe. Demand in key customer segments has remained stable  even though the high cost level is starting to affect companies’ operations.The net sales of the lubricants business increased by 20% to EUR 11.3 (9.4) million. Telko acquired all shares in Estonian Mentum AS at the end of 2021. As a result of the acquisition  Telko’s sales of lubricants increased significantly from the previous year. Prices of lubricants increased clearly during the beginning of the year. Availability issues have not been as significant as in other business areas. Telko has discontinued its small-scale lubricants business in Russia.Telko outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and its consequences have a significant impact on Telko’s outlook for the rest of the year. The outlook for the second quarter is relatively strong  driven by the strong increase in prices  while the outlook for the rest of the year is very uncertain due to the geopolitical situation and its broader impact on markets.In Russia  Telko focuses on actively reducing its working capital. As a result  sales are expected to remain strong during the next few months and decline steeply towards the end of the year. Telko will continue its operations in Ukraine  while sales are expected to remain very low and operations are expected to produce a loss this year.In general  product prices are expected to remain high as a result of increases in crude oil prices and prolonged difficulties in deliveries. Demand is expected to remain fairly strong. Production difficulties due to the availability of raw materials and components independent of Telko will have a negative impact on Telko’s certain customer groups. The war in Ukraine is expected to have an indirect impact on general cost levels  logistics and goods flows.Due to the steep decline in net sales in Russia and Belarus  Telko’s net sales are expected to decrease significantly towards the end of the year. The EU’s latest sanctions will accelerate this change. Of Telko’s businesses  the chemicals business has held the highest relative share in Russia.According to its strategy  Telko will seek not only organic growth in the western markets  but also acquisition targets that accelerate the achievement of the strategic goals set for Telko.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in eight countries that have been grouped into three regional organizations  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  East  and the Baltic region. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. Leipurin’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. Leipurin uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners.Vulganus Oy manufactures and maintains refrigeration and freezing solutions for the food industry through its spiral products. Vulganus has been classified as held for sale  but its results are still reported as part of the Leipurin segment.Leipurin 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 27.7 28.0 -1 Operating profit  MEUR -0.4 0.3 -233 Operating profit  % -1.4 1.1 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -1.1 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 0.7 0.3 133 Comparable operating profit  % 2.5 1.1Leipurin’s net sales during the first quarter remained at the comparative period’s level at EUR 27.7 (28.0) million. During the comparative period  machine sales in Russia significantly increased net sales. In Finland  net sales increased by 14% to EUR 10.4 (9.1) million. In the Baltic region  net sales increased by 19% to EUR 8.0 (6.7) million. Net sales in East developed positively until the war broke out in Ukraine and increased by 3% to EUR 6.8 million (6.6) during the quarter. During the first quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 12% to EUR 18.2 (16.3) million. Sales to the food industry fell short of the target in the Baltic region and Ukraine  being EUR 2.6 (2.6) million. At the beginning of the year  the euro-denominated increase in sales was driven by the significantly grown global market prices of raw materials but  measured in kilograms  sales also increased to the pre-pandemic level. The cost of living increased significantly in Finland and the Baltic region  strengthening the shift in consumer demand toward more affordable products.The outbreak of the war in Ukraine during the last week of February drastically changed Leipurin’s operating environment. Leipurin prioritized the security and livelihood of its personnel in Ukraine. After the period under review  Leipurin decided to withdraw its operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. Leipurin will investigate strategic alternatives  also including the possible divestment of these businesses. The more detailed schedule and implementation of the process will be evaluated  and the process will be carried out addressing the company’s employees and customers  as well as local legislation. Leipurin will continue its operations in Ukraine.The impact of the coronavirus pandemic decreased significantly during the beginning of the year. The development of the sales margin was particularly positive  with the margin also exceeding the level preceding the outbreak of the pandemic in 2019.Leipurin’s operating result for the first quarter was EUR -0.4 (0.3) million  and the operating profit rate was -1.4% (1.1%). Losses of EUR -0.7 million from Leipurin’s warehouse destroyed in Ukraine and a credit loss provision of EUR -0.2 million associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine reduced Leipurin’s operating result for the first quarter. In addition  a provision of approximately EUR -0.2 million was recognized in relation to the company’s adaptation measures in Russia. These items affecting comparability totaled EUR -1.1 million. The comparable operating profit for the first quarter stood at EUR 0.7 (0.3) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.5% (1.1%).Rising market prices for steel raw materials  slow progress in after sales during the first part of the year and cost overruns in certain projects continued to significantly reduce the profitability of Vulganus Oy’s machine manufacturing operations. Vulganus’s net sales during the first quarter stood at EUR 2.5 (1.4) million  and its operating loss was EUR -0.3 (-0.2) million.The profit management program launched during the second quarter of 2021 will develop the capability of knowledge management and help to improve the commercial performance. Key tools include Group-wide category management and the improved efficiency of the supply chain and logistics. The management model already increased financial performance during 2021. The implementation of the program was particularly reflected in the positive development of results in Finland.Availability challenges still persist in different product categories. In Finland and the Baltic region  Leipurin has succeeded in using the post-pandemic recovery in demand. Sales measured in kilograms already exceeded the 2019 level  whereas they fell short of the level of the first quarter in 2019 in eastern markets.Leipurin outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and results.Increased energy prices will have a negative impact on demand for more valuable products  at least in the Baltic region. They will also cause profitability challenges for the bakery segment’s customers.The impact of the coronavirus pandemic and extreme weather conditions on global supply chains will be emphasized  affecting the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times. Raw material prices are increasing steeply.The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Leipurin will continue its profit management program  and it will contribute to further improve financial performance in western markets. The knowledge management program helps Leipurin control rising costs and purchase prices and foresee their impact on customer prices.Vulganus’s order book for 2022 has been confirmed to be excellent.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group’s administration  the financial and ICT service center  and a small number of other functions not covered by business units. The operating result for other operations was EUR -2.5 (-1.6) million in the first quarter. The share-based payment of EUR -0.5 million granted to Aspo’s previous CEO was included in the operating result of other operations. In addition  the difference from the comparative period can be explained by expert costs associated with various projects.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

As a result  the Kauko operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in group reporting in accordance with IFRS 5 standard  and its results and balance sheet items are reported separately from the continuing operations of Aspo Group. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures of the comparative periods have been restated. On the balance sheet  the assets of the Kauko operating segment are reported under “Assets held for sale” and liabilities under “Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale”. Vulganus Oy’s assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented similarly. In the statement of comprehensive income  Vulganus is reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  and the figures of the comparative period (3/2021) have not therefore been restated.Profit from discontinued operations 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales 2.2 3.0 13.1 Materials and services -1.6 -2.2 -9.6 Employee benefit expenses -0.5 -0.4 -1.7 Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 0.0 -3.5 Depreciation  leased assets 0.0 -0.1 Other operating expenses -0.3 -0.3 -1.2 Operating profit -0.2 0.1 -3.0 Profit before taxes -0.2 0.1 -3.0 Profit for the period -0.2 0.1 -3.0Profit from discontinued operations includes the income and expenses of Kauko operating segment  insofar as they are considered to transfer outside Aspo Group in conjunction with the divestment. Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations during the first quarter is EUR 0.1 (0.1) million higher than the Kauko operating segment’s profit.

The majority of ESL Shipping's operations in Russia have been suspended and the ship capacity has been transferred to other traffic areas. All transports related to Russia are estimated to end by the end of the year. Telko continues to focus on selling the still existing inventories in Russia. Telko's conditions for continuing to operate in Russia have weakened significantly  and the tightened sanctions have accelerated the adjustment of operations.Aspo Plc’s Annual Shareholders’ Meeting held on April 6  2022  decided  as proposed by the Board of Directors  that EUR 0.23 per share be distributed in dividends for the 2021 financial year  and that no dividend be paid for shares held by Aspo Plc.

The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.Previous outlookSuominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2022 will decrease from 2021. The main reasons are inventory levels which still remain high at certain customers as well as operational issues in the entire supply chain due to the current COVID-19 situation  both of which will impact the result negatively especially in the first quarter. In 2021  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.Petri Helsky  President & CEO:“For Suominen the beginning of 2022 has been challenging as was expected. Certain key customers especially in the US continued to struggle with their inventory levels. Furthermore  in the early part of the year both our and our customers’ operations were affected by the omicron variant of the COVID-19. Both of these factors impacted our sales negatively. On the cost side we have seen further sharp increases in raw material  energy and freight costs. Due to the lag in our sales pricing mechanisms our pricing in the first quarter did not fully reflect these increases.We condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine and we feel deeply for all Ukrainians whose lives have been devastated by Russia’s incredulous aggression. The war has minor direct impact to Suominen’s business as we have had no suppliers in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine and only very few customers in Russia. Since the war started  we have stopped all sales to Russia. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the invasion which contribute to the significant cost inflation mentioned above.Our net sales were EUR 110.3 million (115.3) in the first quarter. Sales volumes decreased from the COVID-19 boom levels while sales prices increased clearly following the higher raw material prices. Our quarterly EBITDA was EUR 3.3 million (18.5). The main reasons for the decline were the lower volumes and the timing gap between our customer pricing and raw material  energy and freight costs which increased even more than the sales prices.To improve our financial performance  we have launched an EBITDA improvement program to identify both new sales opportunities and cost savings initiatives. As an example of actions taken  we implemented an energy surcharge to all our products sold in Europe in mid-March. Also  as the inventory issues in the US are mainly related to a certain product group  we have been working to widen the product portfolio at the production lines especially affected by the inventory imbalance.In line with our vision to be the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens we are continuously developing our sustainable product offering. During the quarter  we launched our first carbon neutral product BIOLACE® Zero. Our efforts in the sustainability area were also recognized at the IDEA®22 Conference with our HYDRASPUN® Aquaflo winning the Nonwoven Product Achievement Award.The near future continues to look challenging. The war in Ukraine has worsened the inflationary pressures in raw material  energy and freight costs and increased uncertainty overall. The inventory levels at our certain US key customers have remained elevated despite a decreasing trend supported by solid end consumer demand. However  we are more optimistic about the second half of the year. We are seeing signs of the raw material cost inflation moderating from the third quarter onwards and we also expect improved demand for our products through normalization of the US inventory levels and our portfolio widening actions mentioned above.NET SALESIn January–March 2022  Suominen’s net sales decreased by 4% from the comparison period to EUR 110.3 million (115.3). Sales volumes decreased while sales prices increased following the higher raw material prices. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 4.6 million.Suominen has two business areas  Americas and Europe. Net sales of the Americas business area were EUR 61.7 million (71.9) and net sales of the Europe business area were EUR 48.5 million (43.4).EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULTEBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) declined to EUR 3.3 million (18.5). This was driven by lower sales volumes and the timing gap between the higher raw material  energy and freight costs and sales pricing. The positive impact from currencies on EBITDA was EUR 0.6 million.Operating profit decreased to EUR -1.3 million (13.6).Result before income taxes was EUR -2.2 million (16.9)  and result for the reporting period was EUR -2.3 million (13.8). In the comparison period  the sale of Amerplast impacted the result positively by EUR 3.7 million.FINANCINGThe Group’s net interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value amounted to EUR 53.8 million (20.2) at the end of the review period. The gearing ratio was 35.0% (13.3%) and the equity ratio 39.8% (43.9%).In January–March  net financial expenses were EUR -0.9 million (+3.3)  or -0.8% (2.8%) of net sales. The net financial expenses of the comparison period include a gain of EUR 3.7 million arising from the sale of Amerplast. Fluctuations in exchange rates decreased the net financial items by EUR 0.7 million. In the comparison period the fluctuations in exchange rates decreased the net financial items by EUR 0.7 million.Cash flow from operations was EUR -2.7 million (16.0)  representing a cash flow per share of EUR -0.05 (0.28). The decline in the cash flow from operations was mainly due to the lower result.

This can impact Suominen’s financial performance depending on how the markets develop.Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have very few customers and no suppliers in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation mentioned above.Also the COVID-19 pandemic can still cause uncertainty in Suominen’s business environment. The key risks related to the virus concern the health and safety of Suominen personnel and customers  possible shortages of raw materials and issues linked to logistics  as well as potential closures of customers’ or our own plants due to virus infections. Our customers have generally performed well financially even during the pandemic and thus our customer credit risks have not materially increased.Suominen’s other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability and customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks.A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen’s Annual Report 2021 at suominen.fi/investors.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  the pandemic-caused demand spike followed by moderation of said demand has led to an inventory imbalance in the whole supply chain especially in the US which still partially persists.The war in Ukraine has worsened the inflationary pressures in raw material  energy and freight costs and increased uncertainty overall. However  we are seeing signs of the raw material cost inflation moderating from the third quarter onwards and we also expect normalization of the US inventory levels going forward.OUTLOOK FOR 2022Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2022 will decrease clearly from 2021. The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT AND REMUNERATION REPORTSuominen has prepared a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for2021  which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listedcompanies.

Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.The link between the components of the key ratios per share and the consolidated financial statements is presented in the consolidated financial statements of 2021. The link between the components of the alternative performance measures and the consolidated financial statements is presented in Suominen’s Annual Report for 2021.Calculation of key ratios per shareEarnings per shareBasic earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period. net of tax = Share-issue adjusted average number of shares excluding treasury sharesDiluted earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury sharesEUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the period -2 336 13 774 20 734 Average share-issue adjusted number of shares 57 323 494 57 581 245 57 579 440 Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 419 946 57 912 920 58 023 347 Earnings per share EUR Basic -0.04 0.24 0.36 Diluted -0.04 0.24 0.36Cash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares. end of reporting period31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Cash flow from operations  EUR thousand -2 679 15 954 11 088 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 462 142 57 599 164 57 293 235 Cash flow from operations per share  EUR -0.05 0.28 0.19Equity per shareEquity per shareTotal equity attributable to owners of the parent = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares. end of reporting period31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent  EUR thousand 153 504 152 227 163 199 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 462 142 57 599 164 57 293 235 Equity per share  EUR 2.67 2.64 2.85Market capitalizationMarket capitalization = Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares x share price at the end of period31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares 57 462 142 57 599 164 57 293 235 Share price at end of the period  EUR 3.55 5.74 5.18 Market capitalization  EUR million 204.0 330.6 296.8Share turnoverShare turnover = The proportion of number of shares traded during the period to weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares traded during the period 7 195 433 7 004 147 17 714 203 Average number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 323 494 57 581 245 57 579 440 Share turnover  % 12.6 12.2 30.8Calculation of key ratios and alternative performance measuresOperating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses. adjusted with items affecting comparabilityIn order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods. Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2022 or 2021.EBITDA and comparable EBITDAEBITDA is an important measure that focuses on the operating performance excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization  financial items and income taxes  in other words what is the margin on net sales after deducting operating expenses.EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment lossesComparable EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Operating profit -1 268 13 592 26 941 + Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 4 566 4 942 20 092 EBITDA 3 298 18 534 47 033Gross capital expenditureEUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Increases in intangible assets 261 19 162 Increases in property  plant and equipment 1 508 5 207 17 609 Gross capital expenditure 1 768 5 226 17 771Interest-bearing net debtIt is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors.Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value - interest-bearing receivables - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 348 100 381 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 1 451 1 845 1 794 Cash and cash equivalents -97 046 -81 999 -101 357 Interest-bearing net debt 53 753 20 227 49 570 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 348 100 381 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 1 451 1 845 1 794 Nominal value of interest-bearing liabilities 150 799 102 226 150 927Return on equity (ROE)  %Return on equity (ROE)  % = Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) x 100 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent (quarterly average)EUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) 4 625 40 344 20 734 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.3.2021 / 31.3.2020 / 31.12.2020 152 227 135 868 145 882 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.6.2021 / 30.6.2020 / 31.3.2021 159 386 138 551 152 227 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.9.2021 / 30.9.2020 / 30.6.2021 159 682 144 074 159 386 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.12.2021 / 31.12.2020 / 30.9.2021 163 199 145 882 159 682 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.3.2022 / 31.3.2021 / 31.12.2021 153 504 152 227 163 199 Average 157 600 143 320 156 075 Return on equity (ROE)  % 2.9 28.1 13.3Invested capitalInvested capital = Total equity + interest-bearing liabilities – cash and cash equivalentsThe calculation formula for invested capital has been changed.

Greenomy helps corporates  credit institutions and asset managers comply with new European Union sustainable finance legislation by digitalising the data capturing and reporting processes.As part of our commitment to ESG  we are pleased to announce that Euroclear has taken the important step to reduce its global carbon footprint by committing to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We will now set CO2 reduction actions with the commitment to achieve net-zero value chain Green House Gas (GHG) emissions by no later than 2050.Implications from the invasion of Ukraine and SanctionsOur thoughts are with those affected by the humanitarian crisis resulting from the invasion of Ukraine. We have focused on supporting our staff  especially those of Ukrainian and Russian origin  as well as those in bordering countries.Euroclear is complying with the international sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine and has suspended all transactions with sanctioned entities since 28 February. In addition to ensuring all the sanctions are applied immediately and completely  our teams are supporting clients diligently in managing the exceptional situation. We are working closely with clients to apply all new rules fully and according to the spirit of the sanctions.A consequence of the sanctions is that assets owned by sanctioned parties are blocked in the respective financial market infrastructures  including Euroclear. As the assets mature through their lifecycle  cashflows (e.g. coupons and redemptions) that are normally transferred to the underlying parties accumulate on our balance sheet for as long as the sanctions remain in place. We do not expect these sanctions to affect our financial performance. During the first quarter  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by â¬23 billion year-on-year  for which the company is working on the mitigation of potential regulatory capital requirements.In light of these circumstances  the Board of Euroclear considers it to be prudent to wait until the second half of 2022 to formally decide on the dividend payment of EUR 88.5 per share (equating to a total of EUR 279 million) as announced in its full year results.Commenting on the results  Lieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer  said:""The invasion of Ukraine is deeply troubling and our thoughts are with all who are impacted. As a financial market infrastructure  we have an important role to play in a turbulent world. I am proud of the staff response as our people mobilised swiftly to apply the sanctions; to support clients during the exceptional circumstances; and to contribute to relief efforts for those affected. From a financial and operational perspective  Euroclear continues to perform very well  achieving another strong quarter as we continue to deliver on our strategy.""Appendix: Financial Statements for Euroclear Bank and Euroclear InvestmentsInfographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1805341/Euroclear_2.jpgAbout EuroclearEuroclear Group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

More than 75 officers are taking part in the action  he said.Morgan Stanley confirmed that its premises were targeted and said the investigation relates to a “historic activity” and that the bank is “continuing to cooperate with the German authorities.”Prosecutors in Cologne are probing about 1 500 people from the financial industry and are ramping up the pressure on international banks. They raided Barclays Plc’s Frankfurt offices in March days after Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill Lynch premises were hit.Cum-Ex was a trading strategy that siphoned off at least 10 billion euros ($10.5 billion) in government revenue. Named for the Latin term for “With-Without ” the deals took advantage of German tax laws that seemed to allow multiple investors to claim refunds of a tax on dividends that was paid only once. The nation moved to abolish the practice in 2012.While dating back to more than a decade ago  the Cum-Ex scandal is still roiling the industry. Deutsche Bank AG is another major lender facing its repercussions. An influential advisory firm recommended over the weekend that company shareholders shouldn’t sign off on management’s actions for the past year  citing Cum-Ex as one of the reasons.Germany’s top court last week backed the retroactive application of laws to make sure the government can seize funds banks and other players involved in the scandal pocketed in the trades.Story continuesMorgan Stanley  next to a long list of other global investment banks  was mentioned as an alleged short seller in these deals in a search warrant Cologne prosecutors obtained in 2019 to raid Deutsche Boerse AG’s Clearstream unit.In the first indictment issued by Cologne prosecutors in the probe the same year  the bank is mentioned as a possible lender of shares needed to do the trades.(Updates with Morgan Stanley possble role in last paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2022 Bloomberg L.P.,negative,0.02,0.12,0.86,mixed,0.05,0.15,0.79,True,English,"['Tax Fraud Investigation', 'Morgan Stanley', 'Frankfurt', 'other global investment banks', 'influential advisory firm', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'Merrill Lynch premises', '2022 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Deutsche Bank AG', 'controversial Cum-Ex scandal', 'German tax laws', 'other players', 'international banks', 'funds banks', 'German prosecutors', 'Frankfurt offices', 'Morgan Stanley', 'tax payers', 'two suspects', 'related strategies', 'historic activity', 'Barclays Plc', 'March days', 'America Corp.', 'trading strategy', 'Latin term', 'multiple investors', 'major lender', 'company shareholders', 'past year', 'top court', 'retroactive application', 'long list', 'short seller', 'search warrant', 'Clearstream unit', 'first indictment', 'possible lender', 'possble role', 'last paragraph', 'German authorities', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'Cologne prosecutors', 'financial industry', '10 billion euros', 'government revenue', 'wider probe', 'raid', 'part', 'billions', 'homes', 'spokesman', 'More', '75 officers', 'action', 'investigation', '1,500 people', 'pressure', 'deals', 'advantage', 'refunds', 'dividends', 'practice', 'repercussions', 'weekend', 'management', 'reasons', 'Germany', 'trades', 'Story', 'shares', 'Updates']",2022-05-03,2022-05-04,finance.yahoo.com
4195,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/morgan-stanley-gets-a-dose-of-the-most-feared-woman-in-finance-1.1760808,Morgan Stanley Gets a Dose of the Most Feared Woman in Finance,12 hours ago,(Bloomberg) -- The most feared woman in finance isn’t a regulator  a short-seller or a hedge fund titan. You won’t find her office in the City of London  Washington or on Wall Street.But her name resonates in the offices from Bank of America Corp. to Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley and scores of their global peers: Anne Brorhilker  the German prosecutor exacting justice for the multibillion-dollar Cum-Ex tax-trading scam that’s been called the biggest tax heist in history.Brorhilker  48  has won four convictions against bankers in the past two years in a prosecution that’s roiling global finance. Just yesterday dozens of officials descended on Morgan Stanley’s Frankfurt offices.Add that to recent raids of Barclays Plc and BofA’s Merrill Lynch Frankfurt offices and it suggests she is tightening her focus on higher-profile banks. Neither Barclays  Morgan Stanley or BofA -- or any of their employees -- has been charged.Brorhilker is expected to indict the first top executive in the next few months: Christian Olearius  once the head of M.M. Warburg & Co. and still a major shareholder  according to people familiar with the matter. Olearius has denied wrongdoing.Among the other suspects her office is probing are ex-Deutsche Bank chief executive officers Anshu Jain and Josef Ackermann and former investment banking chief Garth Ritchie  as well as Macquarie Group Ltd. CEO Shemara Wikramanayake and predecessor Nicholas Moore. None have been charged.Big GameBrorhilker  senior prosecutor and department head in Cologne  has made it clear she’s going after top executives and that big settlements aren’t enough. She is currently examining some 1 500 people she says may have played a role in deals that mostly took place between 2006 and 2012. Overall  Cum-Ex is estimated to have cost Germany at least 10 billion euros ($10.91 billion).She “worked painstakingly through an extremely complex scandal ” Konrad Duffy  adviser for financial crime prevention at the nongovernmental organization Finanzwende  said in an interview. Other prosecutors “might have quickly dropped the investigations against a few settlement payments from banks  but then the precise details of the financial industry’s involvement would never have come to light.”QuickTake: Why ‘Cum-Ex’ Tax Dodge Casts Shadow on Global BanksThis article is based on interviews with more than a dozen people involved in the Cum-Ex investigations. Most asked not to be identified because their roles in the cases don’t allow them to comment publicly. Brorhilker declined to be interviewed.In a country where prosecutors and judges are rarely known by name  Brorhilker has become the face of the Cum-Ex probe. A small woman with long  ash-blond hair and stylish glasses  she has won the respect of many defense lawyers who have worked closely with her and call her audacious  hardworking and reliable. Some admit they underestimated her.Overreaching?Her critics say she has gone too far. A lawyer for M.M. Warburg  the Hamburg bank whose deals were at the center of the first Cum-Ex trials  told Germany’s top court that prosecutors were waging “an unprecedented smear campaign” against the lender.Even those who applaud her work say Brorhilker may be overreaching  that no one can prosecute so many people and that keeping them as suspects for years can be a professional death sentence. They say it would make more sense to settle with the banks now instead of dragging the investigations out for years with unclear prospects.Thomas Fischer  a former high court judge who is representing Warburg’s Olearius in a parliamentary inquiry into Cum-Ex  is even more critical.“She is certainly qualified and a very diligent prosecutor  but she’s extremely opinionated ” Fischer said. “German rules of criminal procedure require that a prosecutor must approach each case unbiased. But she said publicly herself that right from the start she didn’t have even a shadow of a doubt that Cum-Ex was criminal. That doesn’t match.”‘With-Without’Brorhilker came to the work in 2013 more or less by accident. A colleague had reduced her hours and needed to swap cases. At the time  few outside the financial industry had ever heard of Cum-Ex  a Latin phrase that means “with-without.”How It All Started: Employees at Dozens of Big Banks Said to Face German ProbeIn the trading strategy  shares were sold around dividend day to allow more than one investor to claim a refund on a tax that was paid only once  a ploy enabled by the way Germany collected dividend taxes. The complicated structure of the deals  with elaborate strings of short sales and derivative trades through multiple parties  made it difficult to investigate them.Back then  it was still hotly contested whether the deals were criminal or just a clever strategy to take advantage of a badly built system. Initially Brorhilker was on her own  and Cum-Ex was just one of several files on her desk. She was confronted by an army of corporate lawyers ready to fiercely defend the trades and the people behind them.Brorhilker has faced critics even on her turf. In 2020  her superiors rejected her plan to raid the Hamburg tax authority. A year later the search was back on  after the justice minister in her home state intervened.Today she heads her own department  overseeing 30 prosecutors devoted to Cum-Ex. New police investigative teams have been set up. Germany even extended the prosecution period for tax crimes  giving her more time to go after the big players and hold off on settlements  at least for now.Music LoverBrorhilker  who is married  doesn’t talk much about her personal life  people who know her say. She is a passionate lover of music  plays two instruments and briefly considered becoming a teacher. Her brother  Jan Brorhilker  is chief operating officer for Germany at the Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young. Their father was a partner there.She turned to Jan  like their father an economist by training  when she started to look into Cum-Ex. While some of those who used the strategy claimed it merely took advantage of market inefficiencies  he told her the profit had to come from somewhere else. That could only be the tax angle  she concluded.Read More: The Unemployed Trader Who Became a $700 Million Cum-Ex ExileRaised in North Rhine-Westphalia  she studied law at Bochum University and jumped right into prosecution after finishing her legal education. She is known for keeping long hours and often works even during time off at her parents’ vacation home on the North Sea  according to people close to her. Defense lawyers who have worked with Brorhilker recount calls they’ve gotten from her when she’s theoretically on holiday there.Her tireless labor “is what you would wish of a prosecutor ” said Stefan Kirsch  an attorney for one of two former traders convicted at the first Cum-Ex trial. The judges rewarded their cooperation by sparing them jail time  after Brorhilker argued for that.Next Five YearsBrorhilker first got the financial world’s attention with a series of raids across Europe and in the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands in 2014. The moves required cooperation with law enforcement agencies in 14 countries. She monitored the activity in a war room set up by the police  studying lights on a huge screen that showed authorities simultaneously sweeping into banks and offices in London  Luxembourg and other financial hubs.These operations increased the pressure on the Cum-Ex community and eventually helped bring a major breakthrough: cooperating witnesses. Brorhilker spent most of 2017 interviewing suspects who agreed to help her.Read More: Bust Bank Sues Deutsche Boerse’s Clearstream Over Cum-ExSome who declined her invitations to talk have paid the consequences. The chief of a British hedge fund was arrested at her request in the South of France two summers ago when he tried to board a plane to London with his family after a vacation. He was brought to Germany and allowed to leave only after being questioned and posting bail.Brorhilker says she’s far from finished.“We’re planning for the next five years ” she said in an interview in October with the German public broadcaster ARD. “If you are talking about 1 billion euros of tax loss  like we do in some of the cases  this needs diligent preparation.”She has the patience. Hanno Berger  Germany’s most successful tax lawyer before he was dubbed the “mastermind of Cum-Ex ” went on trial on April 4 in Bonn. He spent almost a decade in his Swiss chalet before being extradited in February. Berger says what he did was legal.Meanwhile  an army of bank lawyers remain on active duty  tasked with watching every move Brorhilker makes. At this point  it seems  there are few who underestimate her.Read MoreFrom Star Performer to Star Witness -- A Cum-Ex Trader CooperatesBanker Drew Macquarie Into Cum-Ex.

The following description is only a summary. This summary does not purport to be complete  or to give full effect to  the provisions of statutory or common laws  and is subject to  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the terms and detailed provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designation) and our amended and restated bylaws. We urge you to read these documents. Please read “Where You Can Find More Information.” Authorized Capital Stock At May 2  2022  our authorized capital consisted of: •1 800 000 000 shares of common stock  par value $0.10 per share  of which approximately 805 805 000 were outstanding  and ​ •5 000 000 shares of preferred stock  par value $0.10 per share  issuable in series  of which no shares were issued and outstanding. ​ Common Stock Holders of common stock may receive dividends if and when declared by our board of directors. The payment of dividends on our common stock may be limited by obligations to holders of any preferred stock and covenants contained in debt agreements. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters submitted to them. Cumulative voting of shares is prohibited  meaning that the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares voting for the election of directors can elect all directors to be elected if they choose to do so. Our common stock has no preemptive rights and is not convertible  redeemable or assessable  or entitled to the benefits of any sinking fund. If we liquidate or dissolve our business  the holders of common stock will share ratably in all assets available for distribution to stockholders after creditors are paid and preferred stockholders receive their distributions. All issued and outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. Any shares of common stock we offer under this prospectus will be fully paid and nonassessable. In October 2021  in connection with the merger involving Cimarex  we effectively assumed the obligations associated with Cimarex’s preferred stock  par value $0.01 per share  designated as 8 1/8% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Cimarex Preferred Stock”). Each holder of Cimarex Preferred Stock has the right at any time  at its option  to convert any or all of such holder’s shares of Cimarex Preferred Stock at an initial conversion rate of 34.1008 shares of fully paid and nonassessable shares of our common stock and $471.3975 in cash per share of Cimarex Preferred Stock. The initial conversion rate of 34.1008 adjusts upon the occurrence of certain events  including the payment of cash dividends to our common stockholders  and is 36.24997 as of March 31  2022. Additionally  beginning on and continuing after October 15  2021  Cimarex has the right  at its option  if the closing sale price of our common stock meets certain criteria  to elect to cause all  and not part  of the outstanding shares of Cimarex Preferred Stock to be converted into that number of shares of our common stock for each eligible share of Cimarex Preferred Stock equal to the conversion rate in effect on the mandatory conversion date as such terms are defined in the Certificate of Designations for the Cimarex Preferred Stock and $471.3975 in cash per share of Cimarex Preferred Stock. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE and trades under the symbol “CTRA.” Preferred Stock The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series. Our board of directors may establish attributes of any series  including  without limitation  the designation and number of shares in the series  dividend rates6TABLE OF CONTENTS(cumulative or noncumulative)  conversion rights  redemption rights  voting rights  and any other rights and qualifications  preferences and limitations or restrictions on shares of a series. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us without any vote or action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of shares of common stock. The specific terms of a particular series of preferred stock will be described in a certificate of designation relating to that series. This summary of the undesignated preferred stock discusses terms and conditions that we expect may apply to any series of the preferred stock that may be offered under this prospectus. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the particular terms of each series of preferred stock actually offered.

We expect the prospectus supplement for any preferred stock that we actually offer pursuant to this prospectus to include some or all of the following terms: •the designation of the series of preferred stock; ​ •the number of shares of preferred stock offered  the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of the preferred stock; ​ •the dividend rate or rates of the shares  the method or methods of calculating the dividend rate or rates  the dates on which dividends  if declared  will be payable  and whether or not the dividends are to be cumulative and  if cumulative  the circumstances in which dividends shall be cumulative; ​ •the amounts payable on shares of the preferred stock in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation  dissolution or winding up; ​ •the redemption rights and price or prices  if any  for the shares of preferred stock; ​ •the terms  and the amount  of any sinking fund or analogous fund providing for the purchase or redemption of the shares of preferred stock; ​ •any restrictions on our ability to make payments on any of our capital stock if dividend or other payments are not made on the preferred stock; ​ •any voting rights granted to the holders of the shares of preferred stock in addition to those required by Delaware law or our restated certificate of incorporation; ​ •whether the shares of preferred stock will be convertible into shares of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock  and  if convertible  the conversion price or prices  and any adjustment or other terms and conditions upon which the conversion shall be made; ​ •any other rights  preferences  restrictions  limitations or conditions relative to the shares of preferred stock permitted by Delaware law or our restated certificate of incorporation; ​ •any listing of the preferred stock on any securities exchange; and ​ •if appropriate  a discussion of material United States federal income tax considerations. ​ Subject to our restated certificate of incorporation and to any limitations imposed by any then outstanding preferred stock  we may issue additional series of preferred stock  at any time or from time to time  with such powers  preferences  rights and qualifications  limitations or restrictions as our board of directors determines  and without further action of the stockholders  including holders of our then outstanding preferred stock  if any. Limitation on Directors’ Liability Delaware has adopted a law that allows corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for breach of directors’ fiduciary duty of care. The duty of care requires that  when acting on behalf of the corporation  directors must exercise an informed business judgment based on all material information reasonably available to them. Absent the limitations allowed by the law  directors are accountable to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for acts of gross negligence. Although Delaware law does not change directors’ duty of care  it7TABLE OF CONTENTSallows corporations to limit available relief to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission. Our restated certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by this law. Specifically  our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director  except for liability: •for any breach of their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders; ​ •for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; ​ •under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; or ​ •for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. ​ This limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors  and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care  even though such an action  if successful  might otherwise have benefited our stockholders. Effects of Certain Provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware Law Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control or the removal of existing management  of deterring potential acquirors from making an offer to our stockholders and of limiting any opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices for our common stock in connection therewith. This could be the case notwithstanding that a majority of our stockholders might benefit from such a change in control or offer. Advance Notice for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations Our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions requiring that advance notice be delivered to us of any business to be brought by a stockholder before an annual meeting of stockholders and providingfor certain procedures to be followed by stockholders in nominating persons for election to our board of directors. Generally  the advance notice provisions provide that the stockholder must give written notice to our Secretary not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting  except that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date  notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting (or  if less than 100 days’ prior notice or public announcement of the scheduled meeting date is given or made  then the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which the notice of such meeting was mailed to our stockholders or the day on which such public announcement was made). The notice must set forth specific information regarding that stockholder and that business or director nominee  as described in our amended and restated bylaws. Proxy Access Our amended and restated bylaws permit a stockholder  or a group of up to 20 stockholders (with a group of any two or more funds that are under common management and investment control constituting a single stockholder)  owning 3% or more of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in our proxy materials director candidates constituting up to 20% of our board of directors (or  if such amount is not a whole number  the closest whole number below 20%)  provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the amended and restated bylaws and subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in the amended and restated bylaws. Vacancies on the Board of Directors Our amended and restated bylaws provide that vacancies on the board of directors arising through death  resignation  retirement or removal shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office whether or not the remaining directors constitute a quorum.8TABLE OF CONTENTSStockholder Action by Written Consent Our amended and restated bylaws permit stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders act by written consent must by written notice request our board of directors fix a record date. No written consent will be effective unless  within 60 days of the record date established by our board of directors  a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to us in the manner prescribed by our amended and restated bylaws. Special Meetings of Stockholders Our amended and restated bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called at any time only by our chairman  our chief executive officer  our president or our board of directors. The only business that may be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders is that business specified in the notice of the meeting. Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute As a Delaware corporation  we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”). In general  Section 203 prevents us from engaging in a business combination with an “interested stockholder” ​(generally  a person owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock) for three years following the time that person becomes a 15% stockholder unless either: •before that person became a 15% stockholder  our board of directors approved the transaction in which the stockholder became a 15% stockholder or approved the business combination; ​ •upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder’s becoming a 15% stockholder  the stockholder owns at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction began (excluding stock held by directors who are also officers and by employee stock plans that do not provide employees with the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer); or ​ •after the transaction in which that person became a 15% stockholder  the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a stockholder meeting by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the 15% stockholder. ​ Under Section 203  these restrictions also do not apply to certain business combinations proposed by a 15% stockholder following the disclosure of an extraordinary transaction with a person who was not a 15% stockholder during the previous three years or who became a 15% stockholder with the approval of a majority of our directors. This exception applies only if the extraordinary transaction is approved or not opposed by a majority of our directors who were directors before any person became a 15% stockholder in the previous three years  or the successors of these directors. Exclusive Forum for Adjudication of Disputes Our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum  the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf  (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director  officer  other employee or agent of ours to us or our stockholders  including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty  (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated bylaws or restated certificate of incorporation (as either may be amended from time to time) or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or asserting an “internal corporate claim” ​(as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL) . In addition  unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum  the Federal District Courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Under the Securities Act  federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act  and stockholders cannot waive compliance with9TABLE OF CONTENTSthe federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims  Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Although we believe these provisions are beneficial by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law or U.S. securities laws in the types of lawsuits to which they apply  the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers or against us. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws related to choice of forum. The enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings  and it is possible that  in connection with one or more actions or proceedings described above  a court could rule that this provision in our amended and restated bylaws is inapplicable or unenforceable. Transfer Agent and Registrar The transfer agent and registrar for the common stock is Equiniti Trust Company.10TABLE OF CONTENTS​DESCRIPTION OF RIGHTS We may issue rights to purchase any combination of common stock  preferred stock or other securities. These rights may be issued independently or together with any other security offered hereby and may or may not be transferable by the stockholder receiving the rights in such offering. The rights will be issued under rights agreements to be entered into between us and a bank or trust company  as rights agent. The rights agent will act solely as our agent in connection with the certificates representing the rights and will not assume any obligation or relationship of agency or trust with any holders of rights certificates or beneficial owners of rights. You should read the particular terms of the rights  which will be described in more detail in any applicable prospectus supplement. The particular terms of any rights offered by any prospectus supplement  and the extent to which the general provisions summarized below may apply to the offered securities  will be described in a prospectus supplement. Any applicable prospectus supplement will describe the terms of rights we offer  the rights agreement relating to the rights and the certificates representing the rights  including the following: •the title of the rights and the aggregate number outstanding; ​ •the date of determining the stockholders entitled to the rights distribution; ​ •the number of rights issued or to be issued to each stockholder; ​ •the exercise price payable for each share of common stock  preferred stock or other securities upon the exercise of the rights; ​ •the number and terms of the shares of common stock  preferred stock or other securities which may be purchased per each right; ​ •the extent to which the rights are transferable; ​ •the date on which the holder’s ability to exercise the rights shall commence  and the date on which the rights shall expire; ​ •the extent to which the rights may include an over-subscription privilege with respect to unsubscribed securities; ​ •if applicable  the material terms of any standby underwriting or purchase arrangement entered into by us in connection with the offering of such rights; and ​ •any other terms of the rights  including the terms  procedures  conditions and limitations relating to the exchange and exercise of the rights. ​11TABLE OF CONTENTS​DESCRIPTION OF DEBT SECURITIES The debt securities that we may offer by this prospectus consist of notes  debentures  or other evidences of indebtedness of Coterra  which we refer to as “debt securities.” We may issue debt securities in one or more series under the indenture (the “Indenture”)  dated as of October 7  2021  between us and U.S. Bank Trust Company  National Association (the “Trustee”)  as successor in interest to U.S. Bank National Association as trustee. A copy of the Indenture  which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part  is incorporated herein by reference. Except as otherwise defined in this prospectus  capitalized terms used in this summary have the meanings given to them in the Indenture. The provisions of the Indenture will generally be applicable to all of the debt securities. Selected provisions of the Indenture are described in this prospectus. Additional or different provisions that are applicable to a particular series of debt securities will  if material  be described in a prospectus supplement relating to the offering of debt securities of that series. These provisions may include  among other things and to the extent applicable  the following: •the title of the debt securities; ​ •the extent  if any  to which the debt securities are subordinated in right of payment to other indebtedness of Coterra; ​ •any limit on the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities; ​ •the persons to whom any interest on the debt securities will be payable  if other than the registered holders thereof on the regular record date therefor; ​ •the date or dates on which the principal of the debt securities will be payable; ​ •the rate or rates at which the debt securities will bear interest  if any  and the date or dates from which interest will accrue; ​ •the dates on which interest will be payable and the regular record dates for interest payment dates; ​ •the place or places where the principal of and any premium and interest on the debt securities will be payable; ​ •the period or periods  if any  within which  and the price or prices at which  the debt securities may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at our option; ​ •our obligation  if any  to redeem or purchase the debt securities pursuant to sinking fund or similar provisions and the terms and conditions of any such redemption or purchase; ​ •the denominations in which the debt securities will be issuable  if other than denominations of $2 000 and any integral multiple of $1 000 in excess thereof; ​ •the currency  currencies or currency units  if other than currency of the United States of America  in which payment of the principal of and any premium or interest on the debt securities will be payable  and the terms and conditions of any elections that may be made available with respect thereto; ​ •any index or formula used to determine the amount of payments of principal of and any premium or interest on the debt securities; ​ •whether the debt securities are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more global securities and  if so  the identity of the depositary  if any  for the global securities; ​ •whether the debt securities are to be issued under Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act and  in such case  any provisions unique to such issuance including any transfer restrictions or exchange and registration rights; ​ •the terms and conditions  if any  pursuant to which the debt securities are convertible into or exchangeable for the common stock or other securities of Coterra or any other person; ​ •the principal amount (or any portion of the principal amount) of the debt securities which will be payable upon any declaration of acceleration of the maturity of the debt securities pursuant to an event of default; ​12TABLE OF CONTENTS•the applicability to the debt securities of the provisions described in “— Defeasance” below; and ​ •any other terms applicable to that series in accordance with the Indenture  which could be different from those described in this prospectus. ​ We may issue debt securities at a discount from their stated principal amount. Federal income tax considerations and other special considerations applicable to any debt security issued with original issue discount (an “original issue discount security”) may be described in an applicable prospectus supplement. If the purchase price of any series of the debt securities is payable in a foreign currency or currency unit or if the principal of or any premium or interest on any series of the debt securities is payable in a foreign currency or currency unit  the restrictions  elections  general tax considerations  specific terms  and other information with respect to the debt securities and the applicable foreign currency or currency unit will be set forth in an applicable prospectus supplement. Unless otherwise indicated in an applicable prospectus supplement: •the debt securities will be issued only in fully registered form (without coupons) in denominations of $2 000 and any integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof; and ​ •payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities will be payable  and the exchange  conversion  and transfer of debt securities will be registrable  at our office or agency maintained for those purposes and at any other office or agency maintained for those purposes. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of the debt securities  but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith. ​ Form of Debt Securities We will issue each debt security only in registered form  without coupons  unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement. In addition  we will issue each debt security in global (i.e.  book-entry) form only  unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement. Debt securities in book-entry form will be represented by a global security registered in the name of a depositary  which will be the holder of all the debt securities represented by the global security. Those who own beneficial interests in a global debt security will do so through participants in the depositary’s securities clearance system  and the rights of these indirect owners will be governed solely by the applicable procedures of the depositary and its participants. References to “holders” in this section mean those who own debt securities registered in their own names  on the books that we or the Trustee maintain for this purpose  and not those who own beneficial interests in debt securities registered in street name or in debt securities issued in book-entry form through one or more depositaries. Book-Entry Procedures Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement  the following is a summary of the depositary arrangements applicable to debt securities issued in global form and for which the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) acts as a depositary. We have provided the following descriptions of the operations and procedures of DTC  Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking  société anonyme (“Clearstream”) solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of DTC  Euroclear and Clearstream and are subject to change by them from time to time. Neither we  any underwriters or the Trustee takes any responsibility for these operations or procedures  and you are urged to contact DTC  Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants directly to discuss these matters. Each global debt security will be deposited with  or on behalf of  DTC  as depositary  or its nominee  and registered in the name of a nominee of DTC. Except under the limited circumstances described below  global debt securities are not exchangeable for definitive certificated debt securities. Ownership of beneficial interests in a global debt security is limited to institutions that have accounts with DTC or its nominee  or persons that may hold interests through those participants. In addition  ownership13TABLE OF CONTENTSof beneficial interests by participants in a global debt security will be evidenced only by  and the transfer of that ownership interest will be effected only through  records maintained by DTC or its nominee for a global debt security. Ownership of beneficial interests in a global debt security by persons that hold those interests through participants will be evidenced only by  and the transfer of that ownership interest within that participant will be effected only through  records maintained by that participant. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the debt securities. Beneficial owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase  but beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction  as well as periodic statements of their holdings  from the participants through which the beneficial owners entered the transaction. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of securities they purchase in definitive form. These laws may impair your ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global debt security. We will make payment of principal of  and interest on  debt securities represented by a global debt security registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee to DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  as the registered owner and holder of the global debt security representing those debt securities. DTC has advised us that upon receipt of any payment of principal of  or interest on  a global debt security  DTC will immediately credit accounts of participants on its book-entry registration and transfer system with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective interests in the principal amount of that global debt security  as shown in the records of DTC. Payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global debt security held through those participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices  as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name ” and will be the sole responsibility of those participants  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements that may be in effect from time to time. Neither we  the Trustee nor any of our respective agents will be responsible for any aspect of the records of DTC  any nominee or any participant relating to  or payments made on account of  beneficial interests in a permanent global debt security or for maintaining  supervising or reviewing any of the records of DTC  any nominee or any participant relating to such beneficial interests. A global debt security is exchangeable for definitive debt securities registered in the name of  and a transfer of a global debt security may be registered to  any person other than DTC or its nominee  only if: •DTC notifies us that it is unwilling  unable or has ceased to be a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and we do not appoint another institution to act as depositary within 90 days; or ​ •we notify the Trustee that we wish to terminate that global security. ​ Any global debt security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence will be exchangeable in whole for definitive debt securities in registered form  of like tenor and of an equal aggregate principal amount as the global debt security  in denominations specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  if other than $2 000 and multiples of $1 000. The definitive debt securities will be registered by the registrar in the name or names instructed by DTC. We expect that these instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from its participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the global debt security. Except as provided above  owners of the beneficial interests in a global debt security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of debt securities in definitive form and will not be considered the holders of debt securities for any purpose under the Indenture. No global debt security shall be exchangeable except for another global debt security of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. Accordingly  each person owning a beneficial interest in a global debt security must rely on the procedures of DTC and  if that person is not a participant  on the procedures of the participant through which that person owns its interest  to exercise any rights of a holder under the global debt security or the Indenture. We understand that  under existing industry practices  in the event that we request any action of holders  or an owner of a beneficial interest in a global debt security desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the debt securities or the Indenture  DTC would authorize the participants14TABLE OF CONTENTSholding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action. Additionally  those participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through those participants to give or take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York  a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code  and a “clearing agency” registered under the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities of its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants in securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants. By doing so  DTC eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations  and certain other organizations. DTC is owned by a number of its participants and by the New York Stock Exchange  Inc. and NYSE Amex Equities. Access to DTC’s book-entry system is also available to others  such as banks  brokers  dealers  and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant  either directly or indirectly. The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC. Investors may hold interests in the debt securities outside the U.S. through Euroclear or Clearstream if they are participants in those systems  or indirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s names on the books of their respective depositaries  which in turn will hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Euroclear has advised us that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for participants of Euroclear (“Euroclear Participants”) and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear includes various other services  including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by the Euroclear S.A./N.V. (the “Euroclear Operator”)  under contract with Euroclear Clearance Systems S.C.  a Belgian cooperative corporation (the “Cooperative”). All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator  and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator  not the Cooperative. The Cooperative establishes policy for Euroclear on behalf of Euroclear Participants. Euroclear Participants include banks (including central banks)  securities brokers and dealers  and other professional financial intermediaries and may include any agents. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear Participant  either directly or indirectly. Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear  the related Operating Procedures of Euroclear  and applicable Belgian law (collectively  the “Terms and Conditions”). The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear  withdrawals of securities and cash within Euroclear  withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear  and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear Participants and has no record of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear Participants. Distributions with respect to debt securities held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear Participants in accordance with the Terms and Conditions  to the extent received by the U.S. depositary for Euroclear. Clearstream has advised us that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for its participating organizations (“Clearstream Participants”) and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Clearstream Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Participants  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to Clearstream Participants  among other things  services for safekeeping  administration  clearance  and settlement of internationally traded securities and15TABLE OF CONTENTSsecurities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. As a professional depositary  Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Monetary Institute. Clearstream Participants are recognized financial institutions around the world  including agents  securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations  and certain other organizations and may include any agents. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others  such as banks  brokers  dealers  and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream Participant either directly or indirectly. Distributions with respect to debt securities held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream Participants in accordance with its rules and procedures  to the extent received by the U.S. depositary for Clearstream. Secondary market trading between Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and will be settled using the procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in immediately available funds. Cross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC  on the one hand  and directly or indirectly through Euroclear or Clearstream participants  on the other  will be effected within DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its U.S. depositary; however  such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will  if the transaction meets its settlement requirements  deliver instructions to its U.S. depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving debt securities in DTC  and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective U.S. depositaries. Because of time-zone differences  credits of securities received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits  or any transactions in the securities settled during such processing  will be reported to the relevant Euroclear participants or Clearstream participants on that business day. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of securities by or through a Euroclear participant or a Clearstream participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the business day of settlement in DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC. Although DTC  Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of debt securities among participants of DTC  Euroclear and Clearstream  they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures and they may discontinue the procedures at any time. Certain Covenants Maintenance of Office or Agency We will be required to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan  City of New York  or  if different  in each place of payment for each series of debt securities for notice and demand purposes and for the purposes of presenting or surrendering debt securities for payment  registration of transfer  or exchange. Paying Agents If we act as our own paying agent with respect to any series of debt securities  on or before each due date of the principal of or interest on any of the debt securities of that series  we will be required to segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to payment a sum sufficient to pay the amount due and to notify the Trustee promptly of our action or failure to act. If we have one or more paying agents for any series of debt securities  prior to each due date of the principal of or interest on any debt securities of that16TABLE OF CONTENTSseries  we will be required to deposit with a paying agent a sum sufficient to pay the amount due and  unless the paying agent is the Trustee  to promptly notify the Trustee of our action or failure to act. All moneys paid by us to a paying agent for the payment of principal of (or premium  if any) or interest on any debt securities that remain unclaimed for two years after the principal (or premium  if any) or interest has become due and payable may be repaid to us  and thereafter the holder of those debt securities may look only to us for payment thereof. Corporate Existence We will be required to preserve and keep in full force and effect our corporate existence  charter rights  statutory rights  licenses and franchises; provided that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right  license or franchise if the Company shall determine that such preservation is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company. Compliance Certificate The Company will be required to file annually with the Trustee a certificate signed by two of its officers  stating whether or not the officers know of any default by the Company in compliance with any provision of the Indenture. Merger and Consolidation The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into  or convey  transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets on a consolidated basis to  any Person  unless: (1)the resulting  surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a company  corporation  partnership  trust or limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America  any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume  by supplemental indenture  executed and delivered to the Trustee  all the obligations of the Company under the debt securities of any series and the Indenture; provided that if the Successor Company is not a corporation  a corporate wholly owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the United States of America  any State thereof or the District of Columbia shall become a co-issuer of such debt securities; ​ (2)immediately after giving effect to such transaction  no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and ​ (3)the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel  each stating that such consolidation  merger  sale  conveyance  transfer or lease  and such supplemental indenture (if any)  comply with the Indenture and that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with. ​ For purposes of the foregoing  the sale  lease  conveyance  transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more subsidiaries of the Company  which properties and assets  if held by the Company instead of such subsidiaries  would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis  shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis. The predecessor Company will be released from its obligations under the Indenture and the Successor Company will succeed to  and be substituted for  and may exercise every right and power of  the Company under the Indenture  but  in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets  the predecessor Company will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the debt securities of any series. Events of Default The following are Events of Default under the Indenture with respect to debt securities of any series: (1)default in any payment of interest on any debt security of that series when due and the continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; ​17TABLE OF CONTENTS(2)default in the payment of principal of or premium  if any  on any debt security of that series when due at its stated maturity or by declaration of acceleration  call for redemption or otherwise; ​ (3)failure to make any sinking fund payment when and as due by the terms of any debt security of that series and the continuance of such default for a period of 60 days; ​ (4)failure by the Company to perform or comply with any other covenant (other than a covenant or a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere specifically dealt with as an event of default or which has been expressly included in the Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of debt securities other than that series) for a period of 90 days after written notice thereof has been given to us as provided in the Indenture; ​ (5)specified events of bankruptcy  insolvency  or reorganization involving the Company; and ​ (6)any other Event of Default provided with respect to debt securities of that series. ​ Pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act  the Trustee is required to give to the holders of the debt securities of that series notice of all defaults known to it within 90 days of the occurrence thereof  except that other than in the case of a default of the character contemplated in clause (1)  (2)  or (3) above  the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as it in good faith determines that the withholding of notice is in the interests of the holders of the debt securities of that series. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs  the principal of  and accrued interest  if any  on the debt securities of that series will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder of the debt securities of that series. If any other Event of Default with respect to debt securities of any series occurs and is continuing  either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may declare the principal amount of  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on all debt securities of that series to be due and payable immediately. However  at any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to debt securities of any series has been made  but before a judgment or decree based on such acceleration has been obtained  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may  under specified circumstances  rescind and annul such acceleration. See “— Amendments and Waivers” below. Subject to the duty of the Trustee to act with the requisite standard of care during an Event of Default  the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of debt securities of any series unless such holders have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs  expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal  premium  if any  or interest when due  no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the debt securities of any series unless: (1)such holder has previously given the Trustee notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of that series; ​ (2)holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy in respect of such Event of Default; ​ (3)such holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss  liability or expense; ​ (4)the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and ​ (5)the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series have not given the Trustee a direction that is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. ​ Subject to certain restrictions  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series are given the right to direct the time  method and place of conducting any proceeding18TABLE OF CONTENTSfor any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture provides that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing  the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee  however  may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture  the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Any additional Events of Default with respect to any series of debt securities  and any variations from the foregoing Events of Default applicable to any series of debt securities  will be described in an applicable prospectus supplement. An event of default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default for any other series issued under the Indenture. Subordination The prospectus supplement  if any  relating to any offering of subordinated debt securities will describe the specific subordination provisions  including the extent of subordination of payments by the Company of the principal of  premium  if any  on and interest on such subordinated debt securities. Amendments and Waivers Subject to certain exceptions  the Indenture and the debt securities of any series may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all of the debt securities at the time outstanding (voting as a single class) or  if the amendment or supplement affects the debt securities of fewer than all of such series of debt securities  by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all such series affected by the amendment or supplement  with the debt securities of all the affected series voting together as a single class for this purpose (including without limitation  consents obtained in connection with a purchase of  or tender offer or exchange offer for  such debt securities) and  subject to certain exceptions  any past default or compliance with any provisions may be waived with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the debt securities at the time outstanding (voting as a single class) or  if the waiver of compliance with provisions affects the debt securities of fewer than all of such series of debt securities  by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all such series affected by the waiver  with the debt securities of all the affected series voting together as a single class for this purpose (including waivers obtained in connection with a purchase of  or tender offer or exchange offer for  such debt securities). In addition  without the consent of any Holder  the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or any series for certain purposes as set forth in the Indenture. However  without the consent of each holder of an outstanding debt security affected  no amendment  supplement or waiver may  among other things: (1)reduce the percentage in principal amount of debt securities of such series whose holders must consent to an amendment; ​ (2)reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such debt security; ​ (3)reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such debt security; ​ (4)reduce the premium payable upon the redemption or repurchase of any such debt security or change the time at which any such debt security may be redeemed or repurchased pursuant to the Indenture or any supplemental indenture; ​ (5)change the place or currency of payment of principal of  or premium  if any  or interest on any such debt security; ​ (6)impair the right of any holder to receive payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on ​19TABLE OF CONTENTSsuch holder’s debt securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder’s debt securities; or (7)make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holder’s consent or in the waiver provisions for such securities. ​ The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or supplement. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or supplement. A consent to any amendment  supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any holder of debt securities given in connection with a tender of such holder’s debt securities will not be rendered invalid by such tender. Satisfaction and Discharge The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all notes issued thereunder  when either: (1)all such notes that have been authenticated and delivered (except lost  stolen or destroyed notes that have been replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or ​ (2)all such notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise  will become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name  and at the expense  of the Company  and the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with such Trustee  as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders  cash in U.S. dollars  U.S. Government Obligations (as defined in the Indenture)  or a combination thereof  in such amounts as will be sufficient  without consideration of any reinvestment of interest  to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal  premium  if any  and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption  as the case may be; ​ (3)the Company has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it with respect to notes under the Indenture; and ​ (4)the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the notes at maturity or the redemption date  as the case may be. ​ In addition  the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied. Defeasance The Company at any time may terminate all its obligations under the debt securities of any series and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”)  except for certain obligations  including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of such debt securities  to replace mutilated  destroyed  lost or stolen debt securities and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the debt securities of any series. The Company may at any time terminate its obligations to comply with certain covenants described above under “— Certain Covenants” and certain covenants of any outstanding series of debt securities that may be contained in any applicable prospectus supplement  and we may omit to comply with such covenants without creating an Event of Default (“covenant defeasance”). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe our ability to be released from any of our covenant obligations under the Indenture with respect to any series of debt securities.20TABLE OF CONTENTSIn order to exercise either defeasance option  the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of any series to redemption or maturity  as the case may be  and must comply with certain other conditions  including  without limitation  delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) to the effect that holders of such series will not recognize income  gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred. In the case of legal defeasance only  such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable Federal income tax law. If the Company fails to comply with its remaining obligations under the Indenture with respect to the debt securities of any series following a covenant defeasance and such debt securities are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of any undefeased Event of Default  the amount of money and U.S. Government Obligations on deposit with the Trustee may be insufficient to pay amounts due on such debt securities at the time of the acceleration resulting from such Event of Default; however  the Company will remain liable in respect of such payments. Payments We will pay interest  principal and other amounts payable with respect to the debt securities of any series to the holders of record of those debt securities as of the record dates and otherwise in the manner specified below or in the prospectus supplement for that series. We will make payments on a global debt security in accordance with the applicable policies of the depositary as in effect from time to time. Under those policies  we will pay directly to the depositary  or its nominee  and not to any indirect owners who own beneficial interests in the global debt security. An indirect owner’s right to receive those payments will be governed by the rules and practices of the depositary and its participants. We will make payments on a debt security in non-global  registered form as follows. We will pay interest that is due on an interest payment date by check mailed on the interest payment date to the holder at his or her address shown on the Trustee’s records as of the close of business on the regular record date. We will make all other payments by check at the paying agent described below  against surrender of the debt security. All payments by check will be made in next-day funds (i.e.  funds that become available on the day after the check is cashed). Alternatively  if a non-global debt security has a face amount of at least $1 000 000 and the holder asks us to do so  we will pay any amount that becomes due on the debt security by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account at a bank in New York City  on the due date. To request wire payment  the holder must give the paying agent appropriate wire transfer instructions at least five business days before the requested wire payment is due. In the case of any interest payment due on an interest payment date  the instructions must be given by the person or entity who is the holder on the relevant regular record date. In the case of any other payment  payment will be made only after the debt security is surrendered to the paying agent. Any wire instructions  once properly given  will remain in effect unless and until new instructions are given in the manner described above. Book-entry and other indirect owners should consult their banks or brokers for information on how they will receive payments on their debt securities. No Individual Liability of Incorporators  Stockholders  Officers or Directors The Indenture provides that no incorporator and no past  present or future stockholder  officer or director of the Company or any successor company  in their capacity as such  shall have any individual liability for any of our obligations under the debt securities or the Indenture. Governing Law The Indenture is  and the debt securities will be  governed by  and construed in accordance with  the laws of the State of New York.21TABLE OF CONTENTSRegarding the Trustee The Indenture does not prohibit the Trustee from serving as trustee under any other indenture to which we may be a party from time to time or from engaging in other transactions with us. If the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and there is an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities  the Trustee must eliminate the conflict or resign.22TABLE OF CONTENTS​DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS We may issue warrants to purchase any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares and purchase contracts. Each warrant will entitle the holder to purchase for cash a number of securities at the exercise price as will in each case be described in  or can be determined from  the applicable prospectus supplement relating to the offered warrants. Warrants may be issued independently or together with any securities and may be attached to or separate from the securities.

We may also  at our option  elect to offer fractional shares of preferred stock. If we exercise this option  we will issue receipts for depositary shares  each of which will represent a fraction of a share of a particular series of preferred stock  to be described in an applicable prospectus supplement. The shares of any series of preferred stock represented by depositary shares will be deposited under a deposit agreement between us and one or more depositaries selected by us  who we will name in an applicable prospectus supplement. Subject to the terms of the deposit agreement  each holder of a depositary share will be entitled  in proportion to the applicable share or fraction thereof represented by the depositary share  to all of the rights and preferences  if any  of the preferred stock represented thereby  including any dividend  voting  redemption  conversion and liquidation rights. The depositary shares will be evidenced by depositary receipts issued pursuant to the deposit agreement. The particular terms of the depositary shares offered by any prospectus supplement will be described in a prospectus supplement  which will also include a discussion of certain United States federal income tax consequences. We will include a copy of the form of deposit agreement  including the form of depositary receipt  and any other instrument establishing the terms of any depositary shares we offer as exhibits to a filing we will make with the SEC in connection with that offering. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”24TABLE OF CONTENTS​DESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTS AND PURCHASE UNITS We may issue purchase contracts representing contracts obligating holders  subject to the terms of such purchase contracts  to purchase from us  and us to sell to the holders  a specified or varying number of our common stock  preferred stock or other securities described in this prospectus at a future date or dates. Alternatively  the purchase contracts may  subject to the terms of such purchase contracts  obligate us to purchase from holders  and obligate the holders to sell to us  a specified or varying number of common stock  preferred stock or other securities described in this prospectus. The price per unit of our common stock  preferred stock or other securities described in this prospectus and number of units may be fixed at the time the purchase contracts are entered into or may be determined by reference to a specific formula set forth in the purchase contracts. We may issue the purchase contracts separately or as part of units  which we refer to as “purchase units ” consisting of a purchase contract and other securities or obligations issued by us or third parties  including government securities  in each case  securing the holders’ obligations to purchase the relevant securities under the purchase contracts. The purchase contracts may require us to make periodic payments to the holders of the purchase contracts or purchase units or vice versa  and such payments may be unsecured or prefunded on some basis. Any applicable prospectus supplement will describe the terms of any purchase contract or purchase units. The description in a prospectus supplement will not necessarily be complete and will be qualified in its entirety by reference to the purchase contracts  and  if applicable  collateral arrangements and depositary arrangements  relating to the purchase contracts or purchase units.25TABLE OF CONTENTS​DESCRIPTION OF UNITS We may issue units of securities consisting of one or more of the following securities: common stock  preferred stock  rights  debt securities  warrants  depositary shares and purchase contracts. We may evidence each series of units issued by unit certificates that we will issue under a separate unit agreement. We may enter into unit agreements with a unit agent. Each unit agent will be a bank or trust company that we select. You should read the particular terms of these documents  which will be described in more detail in a prospectus supplement. If we offer any units  certain terms of that series of units will be described in a prospectus supplement  including  without limitation  the following  as applicable: •the title of the series of units; ​ •identification and description of the separate constituent securities comprising the units; ​ •the price or prices at which the units will be issued; ​ •the date  if any  on and after which the constituent securities comprising the units will be separately transferable; ​ •a description of the term of any unit agreement governing the units; ​ •a description of the provisions for the payment  settlement  transfer or exchange of the units; ​ •if appropriate  a discussion of material United States federal income tax considerations; and ​ •any other terms of the units and their constituent securities. ​26TABLE OF CONTENTS​PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We may sell the securities on a delayed or continuous basis in and outside the United States through the methods described below or through any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law  including through a combination of such methods. A prospectus supplement  if required  will set forth any required information such as the terms of the offering and the method of distribution and will include the following information: •the name or names of any underwriters or agents; ​ •the purchase price of the securities from us; ​ •the net proceeds to us from the sale of the securities; ​ •any over-allotment options under which underwriters may purchase additional securities from us; ​ •any underwriting discounts  commissions and other items constituting compensation to underwriters  dealers or agents; ​ •any public offering price; ​ •any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers; and ​ •any securities exchange or market on which the securities offered in a prospectus supplement may be listed. ​ Sale Through Underwriters or Dealers If we use underwriters in the sale of securities  the underwriters will acquire the securities for their own account. The underwriters may resell the securities from time to time in one or more transactions  including negotiated transactions  at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of sale. Underwriters may offer securities to the public either through underwriting syndicates represented by one or more managing underwriters or directly by one or more firms acting as underwriters. The obligations of the underwriters to purchase the securities may be subject to conditions  and the underwriters may in such event be obligated to purchase all the offered securities if they purchase any of them. The underwriters may change from time to time any initial public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers. Underwriters may sell our common stock under this prospectus by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act  which includes sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange  on any other existing trading market for our common stock or to or through a market maker  or in privately negotiated transactions. Unless stated otherwise in any applicable prospectus supplement  the sales agent with respect to any such at the market offering will make all sales using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices  on mutually agreeable terms between the sales agent and us. Any applicable prospectus supplement will include the amount of any compensation to be received by the sales agent. During and after an offering through underwriters  the underwriters may purchase and sell the securities in the open market. These transactions may include overallotment and stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover syndicate short positions created in connection with the offering. The underwriters also may impose a penalty bid  which means that selling concessions allowed to syndicate members or other broker-dealers for the offered securities sold for their account may be reclaimed by the syndicate if the offered securities are repurchased by the syndicate in stabilizing or covering transactions. These activities may stabilize  maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the offered securities  which may be higher than the price that might otherwise prevail in the open market. If commenced  the underwriters may discontinue these activities at any time. If we use dealers in the sale of securities  we will sell the securities to them as principals. They may then resell those securities to the public at varying prices determined by the dealers at the time of resale. We also may agree to sell  and the relevant underwriters or agents may agree to solicit offers to purchase  blocks of27TABLE OF CONTENTSsecurities. The terms of each such agreement will be set forth in more detail in any applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus. The dealers participating in any sale of the securities may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act with respect to any sale of those securities. If required  we will include in any applicable prospectus supplement the names of the dealers and the terms of the transaction. Direct Sales and Sales Through Agents We may sell the securities directly. In that event  no underwriters or agents would be involved. We also may sell the securities through agents we designate from time to time to solicit offers from purchasers to purchase the securities included in this prospectus or to sell such securities in ordinary brokerage transactions on our behalf. If required  a prospectus supplement will name any agent involved in the offer or sale of the offered securities and will describe any commissions payable by us to the agent. Unless stated otherwise in any applicable prospectus supplement  any agent will agree to use its reasonable best efforts to solicit purchases for the period of its appointment. We may sell the securities directly to institutional investors or others who may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act with respect to any sale of those securities. We will describe the terms of any such sales in a prospectus supplement. We may also offer securities through subscription rights distributed to our stockholders on a pro rata basis  which may or may not be transferable. In any distribution of subscription rights to stockholders  if all of the underlying securities are not subscribed for  we may then sell the unsubscribed securities directly to third parties or may engage the services of one or more underwriters  dealers or agents  including standby underwriters  to sell the unsubscribed securities to third parties. Delayed Delivery Contracts We may authorize agents  underwriters or dealers to solicit offers from certain types of institutions to purchase securities from us at the public offering price under delayed delivery contracts. These contracts would provide for payment and delivery on a specified date in the future. The contracts would be subject only to those conditions described in a prospectus supplement. Such prospectus supplement will describe the commission payable for solicitation of those contracts. Remarketing We may offer and sell any of the securities in connection with a remarketing upon their purchase  in accordance with a redemption or repayment by their terms or otherwise  by one or more remarketing firms acting as principals for their own accounts or as our agents. The name of any remarketing firm  the terms of any remarketing agreement and the compensation to be paid to the remarketing firm will be included in a prospectus supplement  as required. Remarketing firms may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act. Derivative Transactions We may enter into derivative transactions with third parties  or sell securities not covered by this prospectus to third parties in privately negotiated transactions. If any applicable prospectus supplement indicates  in connection with those derivatives  the third parties may sell securities covered by this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement  including in short sale transactions then the third parties may use securities pledged by us or borrowed from us or others to settle those sales or to close out any related open borrowings of securities  and may use securities received from us in settlement of those derivatives to close out any related open borrowings of securities. The third parties in these sale transactions will be underwriters and will be identified in such applicable prospectus supplement or in a post-effective amendment to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. General Information In connection with the sale of the securities  underwriters  dealers or agents may be deemed to have received compensation from us in the form of underwriting discounts or commissions and also may receive28TABLE OF CONTENTScommissions from securities purchasers for whom they may act as agent. Underwriters may sell the securities to or through dealers  and the dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts  concessions or commissions from the underwriters or commissions from the purchasers for whom they may act as agent. We will provide in a prospectus supplement any required information regarding any underwriting discounts or other compensation that we pay to underwriters or agents in connection with the securities offering  and any discounts  concessions or commissions that underwriters allow to dealers. We may agree to indemnify underwriters  dealers and agents who participate in the distribution of securities against certain liabilities to which they may become subject in connection with the sale of the securities  including liabilities arising under the Securities Act  or to contribute with respect to payments that the agents  dealers or underwriters may be required to make because of those liabilities. Agents  dealers and underwriters  or their affiliates or associates  may be customers of  engage in transactions with or perform services for us in the ordinary course of their businesses. Other than our common stock  which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange  each series of offered securities will have no established trading market. We may elect to list any series of offered securities on an exchange  but we are not obligated to do so. It is possible that one or more underwriters may make a market in a series of offered securities. However  they will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of  or the trading market for  any of our offered securities. To the extent required  this prospectus may be amended or supplemented from time to time to describe a specific plan of distribution. The place and time of delivery for the securities in respect of which this prospectus is delivered may be set forth in a prospectus supplement  if required.29TABLE OF CONTENTS​​LEGAL MATTERS The validity of the securities offered by this prospectus and certain other legal matters will be passed upon for us by Baker Botts L.L.P.

4202,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/morgan-stanley-gets-a-dose-of-the-most-feared-woman-in-finance-1.1760808,Morgan Stanley Gets a Dose of the Most Feared Woman in Finance,12 hours ago,(Bloomberg) -- The most feared woman in finance isn’t a regulator  a short-seller or a hedge fund titan. You won’t find her office in the City of London  Washington or on Wall Street.But her name resonates in the offices from Bank of America Corp. to Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley and scores of their global peers: Anne Brorhilker  the German prosecutor exacting justice for the multibillion-dollar Cum-Ex tax-trading scam that’s been called the biggest tax heist in history.Brorhilker  48  has won four convictions against bankers in the past two years in a prosecution that’s roiling global finance. Just yesterday dozens of officials descended on Morgan Stanley’s Frankfurt offices.Add that to recent raids of Barclays Plc and BofA’s Merrill Lynch Frankfurt offices and it suggests she is tightening her focus on higher-profile banks. Neither Barclays  Morgan Stanley or BofA -- or any of their employees -- has been charged.Brorhilker is expected to indict the first top executive in the next few months: Christian Olearius  once the head of M.M. Warburg & Co. and still a major shareholder  according to people familiar with the matter. Olearius has denied wrongdoing.Among the other suspects her office is probing are ex-Deutsche Bank chief executive officers Anshu Jain and Josef Ackermann and former investment banking chief Garth Ritchie  as well as Macquarie Group Ltd. CEO Shemara Wikramanayake and predecessor Nicholas Moore. None have been charged.Big GameBrorhilker  senior prosecutor and department head in Cologne  has made it clear she’s going after top executives and that big settlements aren’t enough. She is currently examining some 1 500 people she says may have played a role in deals that mostly took place between 2006 and 2012. Overall  Cum-Ex is estimated to have cost Germany at least 10 billion euros ($10.91 billion).She “worked painstakingly through an extremely complex scandal ” Konrad Duffy  adviser for financial crime prevention at the nongovernmental organization Finanzwende  said in an interview. Other prosecutors “might have quickly dropped the investigations against a few settlement payments from banks  but then the precise details of the financial industry’s involvement would never have come to light.”QuickTake: Why ‘Cum-Ex’ Tax Dodge Casts Shadow on Global BanksThis article is based on interviews with more than a dozen people involved in the Cum-Ex investigations. Most asked not to be identified because their roles in the cases don’t allow them to comment publicly. Brorhilker declined to be interviewed.In a country where prosecutors and judges are rarely known by name  Brorhilker has become the face of the Cum-Ex probe. A small woman with long  ash-blond hair and stylish glasses  she has won the respect of many defense lawyers who have worked closely with her and call her audacious  hardworking and reliable. Some admit they underestimated her.Overreaching?Her critics say she has gone too far. A lawyer for M.M. Warburg  the Hamburg bank whose deals were at the center of the first Cum-Ex trials  told Germany’s top court that prosecutors were waging “an unprecedented smear campaign” against the lender.Even those who applaud her work say Brorhilker may be overreaching  that no one can prosecute so many people and that keeping them as suspects for years can be a professional death sentence. They say it would make more sense to settle with the banks now instead of dragging the investigations out for years with unclear prospects.Thomas Fischer  a former high court judge who is representing Warburg’s Olearius in a parliamentary inquiry into Cum-Ex  is even more critical.“She is certainly qualified and a very diligent prosecutor  but she’s extremely opinionated ” Fischer said. “German rules of criminal procedure require that a prosecutor must approach each case unbiased. But she said publicly herself that right from the start she didn’t have even a shadow of a doubt that Cum-Ex was criminal. That doesn’t match.”‘With-Without’Brorhilker came to the work in 2013 more or less by accident. A colleague had reduced her hours and needed to swap cases. At the time  few outside the financial industry had ever heard of Cum-Ex  a Latin phrase that means “with-without.”How It All Started: Employees at Dozens of Big Banks Said to Face German ProbeIn the trading strategy  shares were sold around dividend day to allow more than one investor to claim a refund on a tax that was paid only once  a ploy enabled by the way Germany collected dividend taxes. The complicated structure of the deals  with elaborate strings of short sales and derivative trades through multiple parties  made it difficult to investigate them.Back then  it was still hotly contested whether the deals were criminal or just a clever strategy to take advantage of a badly built system. Initially Brorhilker was on her own  and Cum-Ex was just one of several files on her desk. She was confronted by an army of corporate lawyers ready to fiercely defend the trades and the people behind them.Brorhilker has faced critics even on her turf. In 2020  her superiors rejected her plan to raid the Hamburg tax authority. A year later the search was back on  after the justice minister in her home state intervened.Today she heads her own department  overseeing 30 prosecutors devoted to Cum-Ex. New police investigative teams have been set up. Germany even extended the prosecution period for tax crimes  giving her more time to go after the big players and hold off on settlements  at least for now.Music LoverBrorhilker  who is married  doesn’t talk much about her personal life  people who know her say. She is a passionate lover of music  plays two instruments and briefly considered becoming a teacher. Her brother  Jan Brorhilker  is chief operating officer for Germany at the Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young. Their father was a partner there.She turned to Jan  like their father an economist by training  when she started to look into Cum-Ex. While some of those who used the strategy claimed it merely took advantage of market inefficiencies  he told her the profit had to come from somewhere else. That could only be the tax angle  she concluded.Read More: The Unemployed Trader Who Became a $700 Million Cum-Ex ExileRaised in North Rhine-Westphalia  she studied law at Bochum University and jumped right into prosecution after finishing her legal education. She is known for keeping long hours and often works even during time off at her parents’ vacation home on the North Sea  according to people close to her. Defense lawyers who have worked with Brorhilker recount calls they’ve gotten from her when she’s theoretically on holiday there.Her tireless labor “is what you would wish of a prosecutor ” said Stefan Kirsch  an attorney for one of two former traders convicted at the first Cum-Ex trial. The judges rewarded their cooperation by sparing them jail time  after Brorhilker argued for that.Next Five YearsBrorhilker first got the financial world’s attention with a series of raids across Europe and in the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands in 2014. The moves required cooperation with law enforcement agencies in 14 countries. She monitored the activity in a war room set up by the police  studying lights on a huge screen that showed authorities simultaneously sweeping into banks and offices in London  Luxembourg and other financial hubs.These operations increased the pressure on the Cum-Ex community and eventually helped bring a major breakthrough: cooperating witnesses. Brorhilker spent most of 2017 interviewing suspects who agreed to help her.Read More: Bust Bank Sues Deutsche Boerse’s Clearstream Over Cum-ExSome who declined her invitations to talk have paid the consequences. The chief of a British hedge fund was arrested at her request in the South of France two summers ago when he tried to board a plane to London with his family after a vacation. He was brought to Germany and allowed to leave only after being questioned and posting bail.Brorhilker says she’s far from finished.“We’re planning for the next five years ” she said in an interview in October with the German public broadcaster ARD. “If you are talking about 1 billion euros of tax loss  like we do in some of the cases  this needs diligent preparation.”She has the patience. Hanno Berger  Germany’s most successful tax lawyer before he was dubbed the “mastermind of Cum-Ex ” went on trial on April 4 in Bonn. He spent almost a decade in his Swiss chalet before being extradited in February. Berger says what he did was legal.Meanwhile  an army of bank lawyers remain on active duty  tasked with watching every move Brorhilker makes. At this point  it seems  there are few who underestimate her.Read MoreFrom Star Performer to Star Witness -- A Cum-Ex Trader CooperatesBanker Drew Macquarie Into Cum-Ex.

4206,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.msn.com/en-za/news/other/all-hands-on-deck-at-the-jse-in-bid-to-stem-the-tide-of-delistings/ar-AAWVmrT,All hands on deck at the JSE in bid to stem the tide of delistings,JSE CEO Leila Fourie added that this is a multidecade trend. “Listings on the Deutsche Börse have fallen 36%; on the Swiss Exchange  22%; the LSE  21%; and the JSE  18%.” That said  there are many things the executive team is doing to reverse this.,The JSE is considering the establishment of a dedicated technology bourse  it is reconsidering the requirement that the public holds 20% of every listed equity  it is exploring ways to simplify listing and reporting requirements  and it is actively building its feeder market.These are all measures to stem what has been dubbed the terminal decline of South Africa’s primary stock exchange.At the JSE’s AGM  held virtually this week for the third year in a row  shareholders raised their concerns about the fact that in 2021 it experienced net delistings for the seventh year in a row  and asked what was being done to alter this.“What we know is that well-functioning exchanges enable economic growth and development by facilitating the mobilisation of financial resources by bringing together those who need capital to innovate and grow with those who have the resources to invest ” says Chris Logan  the director of Opportune Investments.“Despite the fact that the JSE’s CEO has stated that attracting new listings is a key objective  the pace of delistings is accelerating. It is apparent that more than just red tape is behind our shrinking market. Is the JSE doing enough to promote how exchanges enable economic growth and development?”The JSE’s outgoing chair  Nku Nyembezi  acknowledged that this matter is a real issue  and noted that several measures had been undertaken to reverse this trend – including the launch of JSE Private Placements  a digital marketplace that pairs private debt and equity issuers with investors  including venture capital funders. However  she added  delisting from public markets is a global phenomenon that will be challenging to reverse.“The only exception is tech-related listings. You can see this on Nasdaq  Euronext  and some of the Chinese exchanges. The JSE is not attracting net new listings. It is not that SA is bereft of technology companies  but private capital is highly available and growth has been explosive. A lot of entrepreneurs go that route ” she said.“As regulatory compliance increases  along with the disclosure requirements  so people are attracted to private markets. We are not likely to see a shift in the trends we see.”JSE CEO Leila Fourie added that this is a multidecade trend. “Listings on the Deutsche Börse have fallen 36%; on the Swiss Exchange  22%; the LSE  21%; and the JSE  18%.”That said  there are many things the executive team is doing to reverse this.Encouraging new listings is about more than simply easing regulations or updating the technology.“It’s about recommitting ourselves to the market and the broader country we serve to build back better ” says Fourie.“Building the economy creates jobs  prosperity  and hope. SMEs are vital in this regard. It is for this reason that we started two supporting programmes  an incubator of incubators aimed at smaller start-ups  and the JSE Enterprise Acceleration Programme  aimed at more established scale-up companies.”On a positive note  Fourie added that while the focus is on growing new revenue streams  the core trading  clearing and settlement business  which remains the primary driver of returns  is performing well.“The JSE recorded R49-billion in average daily value traded in March 2022. This is the best month in the history of the JSE.”This was supported by strong foreign inflows during the first quarter of 2022  a change from the past three years  which have been marked by outflows.A pipeline of new listings  including Coca-Cola Beverages  Southern Palladium  African Bank and Zenith Energy  will add investor interest  she says.But what about retail investor interest? asked Paul Miller  a shareholder and business development specialist.“The participation of retail investors in our local market is low  in particular  relative to resource-rich mining markets like Canada and Australia  and particularly when juxtapositioned relative to the explosion of local retail interest in cryptocurrency and forex trading platforms ” said Miller.“For instance  Luno claims 2.2 million SA investors  relative to the 452 000 people who have access to the JSE via broker direct accounts.

With a compelling valuation versus its peers Euronext and Deutsche Börse  we confirm our buy rating. Macroeconomic environments will ...,"CHUNYIP WONG/iStock via Getty ImagesAfter our initiation of coverage with a buy rating for the London Stock Exchange Group plc (OTCPK:LDNXF  OTCPK:LNSTY)  today  we analyse its Q1 numbers. As a brief recap  our internal team believed that clearinghouses are a smart investment in uncertain times. We are positive about the following:Macroeconomic environments will drive volatility and volumes on exchanges  using VIX as a company's revenue proxy we are estimating higher results for the Q2; Strong company results and better than expected synergies from the Refinitiv integration; Limited Russia and Ukraine exposure.Q1 ResultsLooking at the CEO's comment  we see that our long-term view has been confirmed by his words: “LSEG has delivered a good first quarter  with strong underlying performance across all divisions. During the quarter we announced two acquisitions to enhance our product offerings in Trading & Banking and Customer & Third-Party Risk. We also announced the divestment of BETA+  which will simplify and refocus our Wealth Solutions business"". London Stock Exchange Group continues to be resilient. 73% of LSE income is highly recurring in nature with a diversified clientele  sector and product activities and with a high geographical footprint.Looking at the details  top-line sales were just a bit above the consensus expectations  in particular  we note that capital market sales offset the post-trade division. LSEG's total revenue stood at £1.751 billion and this was up by 6.3% compared to the previous year-end. If we include Russia / Ukraine impacts  revenue would have been up by 6.8%. For 2022  we understand £60m is the data & analytics business impact on clientele based in Russia.London Stock Exchange Group Q1 ResultsSource: London Stock Exchange Group Q1 Trading UpdateRefinitiv synergies are on track and the company achieved a £25m run-rate in Q1 stating also that they will meet all the financial targets. Looking again at the M&A  LSE will complete the other two acquisitions to reinforce post-trade solutions with Quantile and TORA  and GDC for the data & analytics businesses. BETA+ net of proceeds will return to shareholders via share repurchasing likely to happen in Q3.The CEO was pretty happy to announce that ""Our ability to invest for growth  make strategic acquisitions and return capital to shareholders demonstrates the strength of the Group and its high-quality recurring revenues. The Group is well positioned and we look forward to further progress during the rest of 2022"".Conclusion And ValuationOur internal team has high confidence in the business combination with Refinitiv. The combined company offers more resiliency for investors and a strategic logic in economies of scope. We believe that management is on track to achieve ""EBITDA >50% target by end of next year"". Looking at the valuation  we see that LSE is undervalued compared to Euronext and Deutsche Börse both at P/E and also on EV/EBITDA. We believe this is not justified and we reiterate our valuation of 8700p based on an EV/EBITDA of 18x.London Stock Exchange Group GuidanceSource: London Stock Exchange Group Q1 Trading UpdateIf you are interested in our previous articles on the European stock exchange  please have a look at our recent publications:",neutral,0.09,0.87,0.04,mixed,0.58,0.1,0.32,True,English,"['London Stock Exchange Q1 Earnings', 'Refinitiv Integration', 'Track', 'London Stock Exchange Group Q1 Trading Update', 'London Stock Exchange Group Q1 Results Source', 'London Stock Exchange Group Guidance Source', 'London Stock Exchange Group plc', 'European stock exchange', 'strong underlying performance', 'high-quality recurring revenues', 'Deutsche Börse', 'high geographical footprint', 'Strong company results', 'good first quarter', 'Wealth Solutions business', 'other two acquisitions', 'capital market sales', 'The Group', 'Q1 numbers', 'higher results', 'top-line sales', 'post-trade solutions', 'high confidence', 'business impact', 'strategic acquisitions', 'business combination', 'CHUNYIP WONG', 'Getty Images', 'buy rating', 'OTCPK:LDNXF', 'OTCPK:LNSTY', 'brief recap', 'internal team', 'smart investment', 'uncertain times', 'Macroeconomic environments', 'long-term view', 'product offerings', 'Third-Party Risk', 'product activities', 'consensus expectations', 'post-trade division', 'previous year-end', '£25m run-rate', 'financial targets', 'M&A', 'share repurchasing', 'strategic logic', 'EBITDA >50% target', 'next year', 'previous articles', 'recent publications', 'combined company', 'revenue proxy', 'Refinitiv integration', 'total revenue', 'Ukraine exposure', 'diversified clientele', 'analytics businesses', 'BETA+ net', 'Limited Russia', 'LSE income', 'Refinitiv synergies', 'iStock', 'initiation', 'coverage', 'clearinghouses', 'volatility', 'volumes', 'exchanges', 'VIX', 'Q2', 'CEO', 'comment', 'words', 'LSEG', 'divisions', 'Banking', 'Customer', 'divestment', 'nature', 'sector', 'details', 'data', 'track', 'Quantile', 'TORA', 'GDC', 'proceeds', 'shareholders', 'Q3.', 'ability', 'growth', 'strength', 'progress', 'rest', 'Conclusion', 'Valuation', 'resiliency', 'investors', 'economies', 'scope', 'management', 'Euronext', 'P/E', 'EV/EBITDA', '8700p', '18x', 'look', '2022']",2022-05-04,2022-05-04,seekingalpha.com

Sales prices may vary based on market prices and other factors.The ADSs and the underlying ordinary shares will be issued through a capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights under the provisions of Article L. 225-136 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce)  Article L. 411-2 1° of the French monetary and financial code (Code monétaire et financier) and pursuant to the 25th resolution adopted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on May 19  2020  within the limit of a maximum number of 23 673 831 ordinary shares and ADSs (being the maximum authorized by the shareholders in such resolution)  representing a maximum potential dilution of approximately 26% based on the existing share capital of the Company.It should be noted that the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders has been convened for May 20  2022 (the “2022 Annual General Meeting”). During the 2022 Annual General Meeting  new resolutions allowing for capital increases will be put to the shareholders’ vote. If they are approved  they will replace  inter alia  the aforementioned 25th resolution adopted by the 2020 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders held on May 19  2020 (the “2020 Annual General Meeting”). Therefore  from then on  ADSs offered in the ATM and the underlying ordinary shares would be issued either (i) through a capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights under the provisions of Article L. 225-136 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce)  Article L. 411-2 1° of the French monetary and financial code (Code monétaire et financier) and pursuant to the 20th resolution adopted by the 2022 Annual General Meeting  or (ii) through a capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights and reserved to a category of investors under the provisions of Article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) and pursuant to the 22nd resolution adopted by the 2022 Annual General Meeting. In both cases (i) and (ii) above  the maximum number of ordinary shares and ADSs that can be issued is 23 922 825 ordinary shares (being the maximum authorized by the shareholders in both such resolutions).Pursuant to the 25th resolution adopted by the 2020 Annual General Meeting and  if and when applicable  the 20th resolution that would adopted by the 2022 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders  the ADSs offered in the ATM can only be offered to “Qualified Institutional Buyers” as defined in Rule 144A under the US 1933 Securities Act  as amended (the “Securities Act”) or to “accredited investors” as defined in Regulation D under the Securities Act. If after the 2022 Annual General Meeting  we were to decide to rely instead on the aforementioned 22nd resolution that would be adopted at such meeting  the ADSs offered in the ATM could only be offered to the following categories of investors: (i) industrial or commercial companies involved in the pharmaceutical / biotechnological sector  or (ii) investment companies or investment funds’ management companies or investment funds  governed by French or foreign law  or (iii) any other legal person (including a trust) or natural person that invest on a regular basis  in the pharmaceutical / biotechnological sector  meeting  in each of the cases (i) to (iii) above  the criteria for participating in an offer made pursuant to Article L. 411-2 1° of the French monetary and financial code (Code monétaire et financier) (i.e. also being Qualified Institutional Buyers or Accredited Investors as described above).On an illustrative basis  assuming the issuance of the full amount of $75 million of ADSs under the ATM program at an assumed offering price of $3.10  the last reported sale price of the ADSs on Nasdaq on April 21  2022  a holder of 1.0% of the outstanding Company’s share capital as of the date of this press release  would hold 0.74% of the outstanding Company’s share capital after the completion of the transaction (calculated on the basis of the number of outstanding shares on the date of publication of this press release).During the term of the ATM program  the Company will include in the publication of its financial results information about its use of the program during the preceding quarter and will also provide an update after each capital increase on a dedicated location on its corporate website in order to inform investors about the main features of each issue that may be completed under the ATM program from time to time. In addition  in case of a particularly significant capital increase  the Company will publish an ad hoc press release.A shelf registration statement on Form F-3 (including a prospectus) relating to Innate’s ADSs was filed with the SEC and became effective upon filing on January 31  2021. Before purchasing ADSs in the offering  prospective investors should read the prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus  together with the documents incorporated by reference therein. Prospective investors may obtain these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively  a copy of the prospectus supplement (and accompanying prospectus) relating to the offering may be obtained from SVB Securities LLC  Attention: Syndicate Department  53 State Street  40th Floor  Boston  MA 02109  by telephone at (800) 808-7525  ext. 6105  or by email at syndicate@svbsecurities.com. Unless total issuances of ordinary shares under the ATM program over a rolling twelve months period were to represent (together  as the case may be  with other issuances of ordinary shares effected on the basis of Article 1  paragraph 5.a) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of June 14 2017) 20% or more of the then outstanding share capital of the Company  no prospectus will be subject to the approbation of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (“AMF”).This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy these securities  nor shall there be any sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction. In particular  no public offering of the ADSs will be made in Europe.About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage oncology-focused biotech company dedicated to improving treatment and clinical outcomes for patients through therapeutic antibodies that harness the immune system to fight cancer.Innate Pharma’s broad pipeline of antibodies includes several potentially first-in-class clinical and preclinical candidates in cancers with high unmet medical need.Innate is a pioneer in the understanding of natural killer cell biology and has expanded its expertise in the tumor microenvironment and tumor-antigens  as well as antibody engineering.

The product candidate’s physics-based mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering an adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly  with immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company sponsored phase I clinical study  evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC and for patients with lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy  either naïve or resistant to prior PD-1 (either primary or secondary as per SITC criteria).Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in strategic collaborations to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2021  the Company entered into an additional strategic collaboration agreement with LianBio to support its global phase III study in Asia along with four future registrational studies.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Recurring revenues (81%) grew 8% organically; non-recurring revenues rose 9% organically. Digital & services revenues (93%) grew 9% organically; print revenues grew 4% organically. Expert solutions (56%) grew 10% organically.First-quarter adjusted operating profit margin increased  with strong operational gearing more than compensating for increased personnel expenses .First-quarter adjusted free cash flow increased 6% in constant currencies  despite higher capital expenditure and tax payments in the quarter.Net debt-to-EBITDA 1.2x as of March 31  2022.2022 share buyback: €216 million of intended buyback of up to €600 million completed in the year through May 2  2022.Nancy McKinstry  CEO and Chair of the Executive Board  commented: “The year has started well  with improved organic growth across all four divisions  even if we exclude favorable timing and phasing effects that influenced the first quarter.

While we face more challenging revenue comparables in the remainder of the year  we are confident in reaffirming our overall guidance for 2022.”First Quarter 2022 DevelopmentsFirst quarter revenues increased 13% in reporting currency  partly reflecting the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro compared to a year ago (average EUR/USD rate 1.12 versus 1.20 in 1Q 2021). In constant currencies  first quarter revenues increased 8%. Excluding both currency and the net effect of acquisitions and divestments  organic growth was 8% (1Q 2021: 4%). All divisions posted improved organic growth in the quarter compared to a year ago.Story continuesRecurring revenues (81% of revenues)  which include subscriptions and other repeating revenue streams  increased 8% organically against a relatively weak comparable (1Q 2021: 3%). Non-recurring revenues (19% of revenues) increased 9% organically (1Q 2021: 7%) with transactional revenues in Governance  Risk & Compliance (GRC) broadly flat (1Q 2021: 11%) but other non-recurring revenues  such as software license and implementation services  up 14% organically (1Q 2021: stable). Print revenues rose 4% organically (1Q 2021: 6%)  with an 8% organic decline in Legal & Regulatory print revenues more than offset by an organic increase in Health.The adjusted operating profit margin increased in all divisions  except in Governance  Risk & Compliance. The first quarter margin benefitted from operational gearing which more than offset increased personnel costs related to hires made in recent quarters. Expenses related to travel and other activities that were reduced during the pandemic remained low in the first quarter but are expected to build over the year.Health revenues increased 9% organically (1Q 2021: 8%) in the quarter  with strong performance around the world. Clinical Solutions grew 9% organically (1Q 2021: 6%)  driven by strong subscription renewals for our decision support tool  UpToDate  and our drug information solutions  Medi-Span and Lexicomp. Health Learning  Research & Practice also grew 9% organically (1Q 2021: 11%)  buoyed by an unexpected increase in U.S. print book revenues due to favorable timing of distributor orders. Organic growth in Learning  Research & Practice digital subscriptions  advertising  and other non-recurring revenues slowed compared to a year ago due to a challenging comparable.Tax & Accounting revenues grew 9% organically (1Q 2021: 3%)  largely reflecting revenue phasing related to the timing of the U.S. tax season and a surge in demand for outsourced professional services in a tight labor market. Corporate Performance Solutions (CCH Tagetik and TeamMate) recorded mid-single digit organic growth  driven by double-digit organic growth at CCH Tagetik. Professional Tax & Accounting North America recorded double-digit organic growth  against a weak comparable which saw revenues shift into the second quarter of 2021 due to the delay in the U.S. tax season. Professional Tax & Accounting Europe delivered mid-single digit organic growth  while Asia Pacific growth moderated.Governance  Risk & Compliance revenues increased 8% organically (1Q 2021: 3%). Legal Services organic growth was 7% (1Q 2021: 2%)  mainly driven by robust renewals for CT Corporation legal representation subscription services. Financial Services recorded 8% organic growth (1Q 2021: 5%). In Compliance Solutions  subscription revenues increased  especially for eOriginal digital lending solutions  however this was offset by a decline in transactional volumes due to the absence of a Paycheck Protection Program1 in 2022 and the market-wide decline in U.S. mortgage originations. Finance  Risk & Reporting posted strong organic growth driven by non-recurring implementation services and higher license fees for OneSumX software. On April 8  2022  GRC completed the acquisition of International Document Services (IDS) for approximately $70 million in cash.Legal & Regulatory revenues grew 6% organically (1Q 2021: 2%)  benefitting from higher non-recurring license revenues for EHS/ORM2 software. Information Solutions (79% of divisional revenues) posted 3% organic growth (1Q 2021: 2%)  with digital information solutions up 7% and print formats down 8% in the quarter. Divestitures  notably the disposal of the U.S. Legal Education business in September 2021  reduced divisional revenues by 4% in constant currencies in the quarter. The sale of our legal publishing assets in Spain and France  agreed in December 2021 and expected to complete in 2022  remains subject to approval of the Spanish antitrust authorities.Cash Flow and Net DebtFirst quarter adjusted free cash flow increased 6% in constant currencies. Cash conversion was lower than a year ago due to an increase in capital expenditures and a decline in working capital inflows. Mainly as a result of new U.S. rules on the capitalization of research & development expenses  cash tax payments increased. Net cash spend on acquisitions was nil  while a total of €157 million in cash was deployed towards share repurchases during the first quarter.As of March 31  2022  net debt was €1 920 million  compared to €2 131 million at December 31  2021. Net-debt-to-EBITDA  based on rolling twelve months’ EBITDA  was 1.2x at the end of March 2022  compared to 1.4x at year-end 2021.As of March 31  2022  the number of issued ordinary shares outstanding (excluding 5.5 million shares held in treasury) was 257.1 million.Dividends and Share BuybacksAt the Annual General Meeting held on April 21  2022  shareholders approved a total dividend of €1.57 over financial year 2021. This results in a final dividend of €1.03 per share to be paid to shareholders on May 18  2022 (ADRs: May 25  2022). The interim dividend for 2022 will be set at 40% of the prior year total dividend.In the year to date  Wolters Kluwer has repurchased 2.3 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of €216 million (average share price €92.55). This includes a €46 million block trade executed on February 24  2022  to offset dilution caused by incentive share issuance. For the period starting May 5  2022  up to and including August 1  2022  we have engaged a third party to execute €140 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer’s Articles of Association. Share repurchases will be used for capital reduction purposes and to meet obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.Recent ESG and Other DevelopmentsAs of the end of April  90% of our offices have reopened and about a quarter of our global workforce was back in office for all or part of the week. At the 2022 Annual General Meeting in April  Ann Ziegler succeeded Frans Cremers as Chair of the Supervisory Board. Heleen Kersten was appointed Member  increasing the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board to 57%.Full-Year 202 2 OutlookWe reiterate our overall guidance for full-year 2022 adjusted operating profit margin  adjusted free cash flow  return on invested capital (ROIC)  and diluted adjusted EPS (see table below). We continue to expect good organic growth for the full year  albeit slower than in 2021 due to challenging comparables starting in the second quarter. The recent suspension of business in Russia and Belarus is expected to have minimal impact as these countries represent less than 1% of group revenues. We maintain our full year adjusted operating profit margin guidance  although we now expect the group margin to rise in the first half of 2022. As previously indicated  we expect growth in diluted adjusted EPS to be dampened by a return to our historical tax rate.Full-Year 2022 Outlook Performance indicators 2022 Guidance 2021 Adjusted operating profit margin 25.5%-26.0% 25.3% Adjusted free cash flow €1 025-1 075 million €1 010 million ROIC Around 14% 13.7% Diluted adjusted EPS Mid-single-digit growth €3.38 Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reported currencies and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2022 of €/$1.13. Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.18). Guidance reflects share repurchases for up to €600 million in 2022.If current exchange rates persist  the U.S. dollar rate will have a positive effect on 2022 results reported in euros. In 2021  Wolters Kluwer generated more than 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2021 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 2 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS3.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We currently expect that restructuring costs will increase to within our normal range of €10-€15 million (FY 2021: €6 million). We expect adjusted net financing costs of approximately €65 million in constant currencies4  including lease interest charges. We expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to increase to approximately 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2021: 21.5%). Capital expenditure is expected to be within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2021: 5.0%). We expect the full-year cash conversion ratio to be in the range of 100%-105% (FY 2021: 112%).Any guidance we provide assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins and earnings in the near term.2022 Outlook by DivisionHealth: we expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels  mainly due to the absence of a contract win of the size of the 2021 ASCO deal. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to improve modestly.Tax & Accounting: we expect organic growth to improve slightly from 2021 levels and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Governance  Risk & Compliance: we expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels  due to slower growth in transactional revenues in the second half of the year. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to ease in the first half but to improve for the full year.Legal & Regulatory: we expect organic growth to be in line with 2021. The adjusted operating profit margin is expected to decline in the second half and for the full year due to the absence of the one-off pension amendment recorded in 2021.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

Overall activity has grown strongly over pre-pandemic levels as we turned in double-digit growth compared to Q1 2019. Our pan-European omnichannel model continues to prove its relevance  as does the continued strength of our brand and unique offering.We are moving ahead with our sustainable growth agenda with drive and energy. We have extended our selective marketplace to another country  Spain  at the end of March. Across France and Spain  our marketplace now consists of over 140 000 SKUs and 1 100 brands. Furthermore  and fully in line with our Raison d’être  we were proud to unveil in February our “Good is beautiful” CSR movement  covering five pillars of environmental and societal commitments  with bold targets and milestones  including carbon neutrality on scopes 1 and 2 this year.Confident in our model  we will maintain our focus on serving our customers and protecting our profitability in a still complex and volatile environment. Visibility for the remainder of the year stays limited  Assuming no further deterioration of macro-economic and supply chain conditions  we confirm our full-year 2022 guidance.”Story continues1st Quarter 2022 Key commercial developmentsMaisons du Monde’s 2022 sales performance needs to be looked at in light of what happened over the previous years. 2021 was a year of outstanding performance  especially on the online channel  after the COVID-disrupted 2020. The latest normalised year  truly comparable to 2022  is 2019. When compared to Q1 2019  Maisons du Monde showed consistent growth in all channels  geographies and categories over Q1 2022.Brand and customersIn terms of brand and customers  Maisons du Monde continued to develop over the quarter. The Instagram community grew by +10% yoy  reaching 5.4 million followers across Europe and +182% vs 2019. Total monthly audience on Pinterest reached 495K in the quarter  increasing by 77% vs Q1 2021 and 99% vs 2019. Total active customers reached 7.5 million at quarter-end  up 16% vs Q1 2021 and 15% vs Q1 2019  and omnichannel customers have increased by 15% year on year.Good is Beautiful labelIn February 2022  Maisons du Monde launched its Good is Beautiful brand movement to keep embedding sustainable development in its strategy and customer communication. Good is Beautiful is a company-wide pledge that links the history  the present and the ambition of Maisons du Monde to create a positive impact throughout its ecosystem. It is built on 5 commitments with ambitious and quantified targets:Offering a collection that is stylish and sustainable Target: 40% of the offer under the Good is Beautiful label by 2025 Acting with grassroots associations to protect the environment and help those in need Target: 100 Good is Beautiful places created by 2025 Promoting equal opportunities Targets: 50% of women within the Top 100 of the Company and 500 youngsters mentored by 2025 to help them access the workforce Offering a second life to products Target: 20 000 products repaired every year Transforming business lines to reduce Maisons du Monde’s environmental footprint Targets: -25% carbon intensity by 2025 on scopes 1  2 and 3 and 100% of stores powered with renewable energyLaunch of Spanish marketplaceMarch 2022 saw the launch of the marketplace in Spain  and already offers nearly 50 000 SKUs from over 290 brands. First weeks of operation are fully in line with expectations.1st quarter 2022 sales of EUR 313 million were broadly stable yoy (-1.3%; -4.0% LFL) compared to the exceptionally high level of Q1 2021 (EUR 317 million  up 37% vs 2020). Q1 2022 performance benefited from a favourable effect of an efficient supply chain monitoring which allowed the Group to ship more customer orders than planned  compensating for softer demand than expected in the second part of the quarter.As was the case for all retailers  online traffic and conversion rate were lower than last year and were partly offset by an increase in average basket size by 6% yoy.Store traffic was positive yoy given the store closures that took place in Q1 2021. Stores that were open during both periods saw a decrease in traffic  especially in March  as a result of lower consumer confidence.Compared to the pre-pandemic Q1 2019  total Q1 2022 Group sales were up +15%.Total GMV of EUR 329 million was stable yoy thanks to a very strong 43% increase in the marketplace GMV. Compared to Q1 2019  GMV grew by +21%  illustrating the launch of the marketplace in France at the end of 2020.Sales by category:Decoration sales were unchanged compared Q1 2021 at EUR 175 million  coming from a very high comparable base in 2021  which had grown by +39% vs 2020. When compared to Q1 2019  decoration sales grew by 17%  demonstrating over time the successful revamping of collections undertaken in 2019. Maisons du Monde’s decoration collections continued to meet with success especially on tableware and outdoor items.Furniture inventory continued to be impacted by supply chain disruptions  and Q1 2022 sales were therefore slightly down (-2%) and represented 44% of total Group sales (- 0.5 percentage point vs Q1 2021). Here again  the high comparison base of Q1 2021 (+34% vs Q1 2020) blurs the global picture. Compared to Q1 2019  furniture sales grew by 13%  even though product availability was not yet at its target level. Furniture inventory has improved over the period  with replenishment program in line with plan despite the complex environment. As COVID rebounds in China  some manufacturing and freight operations are currently hampered. Exercising its now proven agility  the Group is monitoring the situation very closely to optimise sourcing and shipping plans.Sales by channel:Online sales decreased by 13.2% yoy to reach EUR 104 million  yet still represented one-third of total Group sales. This evolution is explained by the exceptional outperformance of the 1st quarter last year which was up 73% due to the pandemic-related store closures as well as the docker strike in Q1 2020. Compared to Q1 2019  Q1 2022 online sales were up a very strong 46%  lifted by countries such as Germany  Spain and Italy  which growth vs Q1 2019 neared 60%.Maisons du Monde’s selective marketplace  continued its fast growth with GMV totalling EUR 20 million during the period (+43% yoy). At the end of March 2022  the marketplace featured over 1 100 brands and 140 000 SKUs. Maisons du Monde continues to roll out its omnichannel strategy  and the marketplace is now available in all French stores. Furthermore  at the end of the quarter  the marketplace expanded for the first-time outside France: it is now available in Spain and boasts nearly 50 000 SKUs from over 290 brands.Store salesIn part thanks to a favourable comparable base  total 1st quarter store sales were up 6% at EUR 209 million. Store sales were also up 5% vs their pre-pandemic level of Q1 2019.At 31 March 2022  Maisons du Monde had 350 stores  compared to 357 at 31 December 2021. During the quarter  the Group closed  as planned  8 stores: 5 closures in France  2 in Belgium  1 in Italy and opened one store in Spain  maintaining its yearly objective of 0 to 5 net openings.Sales by geographySales in France reached EUR 162 million (52% of total sales)  down 11% vs Q1 2021  but up 3% vs Q1 2019  in a context of still suboptimal inventory levels.Store sales in France were EUR 114 million down 9% yoy but roughly stable vs Q1 2019 despite a net reduction of 7 stores over the 3-year period. They represented 55% of total store sales  -9 percentage points vs Q1 2021.Online sales in France were down 15% yoy but a strong 33% vs Q1 2019.International sales totalled EUR 151 million  up 12% vs Q1 2021  and a solid 32% vs 2019. They represented 48% of total sales (+ 6 percentage points vs 2019).International growth was fuelled by new store openings (+ 23 net stores since Q1 2019)  and a more online-driven channel mix  online representing 37% of international sales in Q1 2021  vs 31% in Q1 2019.International store sales were up +32% to EUR 95 million  thanks to the addition of 10 stores to the international network since the end of March 2021.Compared to Q1 2021  international sales also benefitted from a low comparison base of 2021  which was still impacted by store closures  notably in Germany  Spain and Italy.2022 Commercial and operational prioritiesFor the remainder of 2022  the Group’s commercial priorities are to:Keep strengthening Maisons du Monde’s omnichannel model to the service of customersSelectively rebuild inventories while actively managing sourcing constraintsProtecting the Group’s profitability through rigorous cost control  while advancing on the strategic agendaSustain efforts towards corporate social responsibility2022 guidanceIn an environment that remains complex and volatile  the Group sees a slow start to the first half of the year and considers Q2 dynamics will be hampered by the global inflation context and its impact on demand  alongside COVID-related slowdowns in Asia which may impact restocking plans. As a result  sales in the first half should be slightly negative. On the other hand  the second half will benefit from higher inventory levels  especially in furniture  to support top line growth acceleration  and a more favourable comparable base.In this context  and assuming no further deterioration of macro-economic and supply chain conditions  the Group confirms its full-year 2022 objectives:Positive top line growth  to be fine-tuned as visibility improvesAn EBIT margin around 9%FCF of EUR 65 million to 75 millionReduction of the Group’s carbon intensity: CO 2 neutrality for scopes 1 and 2Dividend pay-out ratio of 30% to 40%***Update ESG Impact Share Buy Back ProgramMaisons du Monde completed its EUR 50 million “ESG Impact” share buyback program launched last October.

Overall activity has grown strongly over pre-pandemic levels as we turned in double-digit growth compared to Q1 2019. Our pan-European omnichannel model continues to prove its relevance  as does the continued strength of our brand and unique offering.We are moving ahead with our sustainable growth agenda with drive and energy. We have extended our selective marketplace to another country  Spain  at the end of March. Across France and Spain  our marketplace now consists of over 140 000 SKUs and 1 100 brands. Furthermore  and fully in line with our Raison d’être  we were proud to unveil in February our “Good is beautiful” CSR movement  covering five pillars of environmental and societal commitments  with bold targets and milestones  including carbon neutrality on scopes 1 and 2 this year.Confident in our model  we will maintain our focus on serving our customers and protecting our profitability in a still complex and volatile environment. Visibility for the remainder of the year stays limited  Assuming no further deterioration of macro-economic and supply chain conditions  we confirm our full-year 2022 guidance.”Story continues1st Quarter 2022 Key commercial developmentsMaisons du Monde’s 2022 sales performance needs to be looked at in light of what happened over the previous years. 2021 was a year of outstanding performance  especially on the online channel  after the COVID-disrupted 2020. The latest normalised year  truly comparable to 2022  is 2019. When compared to Q1 2019  Maisons du Monde showed consistent growth in all channels  geographies and categories over Q1 2022.Brand and customersIn terms of brand and customers  Maisons du Monde continued to develop over the quarter. The Instagram community grew by +10% yoy  reaching 5.4 million followers across Europe and +182% vs 2019. Total monthly audience on Pinterest reached 495K in the quarter  increasing by 77% vs Q1 2021 and 99% vs 2019. Total active customers reached 7.5 million at quarter-end  up 16% vs Q1 2021 and 15% vs Q1 2019  and omnichannel customers have increased by 15% year on year.Good is Beautiful labelIn February 2022  Maisons du Monde launched its Good is Beautiful brand movement to keep embedding sustainable development in its strategy and customer communication. Good is Beautiful is a company-wide pledge that links the history  the present and the ambition of Maisons du Monde to create a positive impact throughout its ecosystem. It is built on 5 commitments with ambitious and quantified targets:Offering a collection that is stylish and sustainable Target: 40% of the offer under the Good is Beautiful label by 2025 Acting with grassroots associations to protect the environment and help those in need Target: 100 Good is Beautiful places created by 2025 Promoting equal opportunities Targets: 50% of women within the Top 100 of the Company and 500 youngsters mentored by 2025 to help them access the workforce Offering a second life to products Target: 20 000 products repaired every year Transforming business lines to reduce Maisons du Monde’s environmental footprint Targets: -25% carbon intensity by 2025 on scopes 1  2 and 3 and 100% of stores powered with renewable energyLaunch of Spanish marketplaceMarch 2022 saw the launch of the marketplace in Spain  and already offers nearly 50 000 SKUs from over 290 brands. First weeks of operation are fully in line with expectations.1st quarter 2022 sales of EUR 313 million were broadly stable yoy (-1.3%; -4.0% LFL) compared to the exceptionally high level of Q1 2021 (EUR 317 million  up 37% vs 2020). Q1 2022 performance benefited from a favourable effect of an efficient supply chain monitoring which allowed the Group to ship more customer orders than planned  compensating for softer demand than expected in the second part of the quarter.As was the case for all retailers  online traffic and conversion rate were lower than last year and were partly offset by an increase in average basket size by 6% yoy.Store traffic was positive yoy given the store closures that took place in Q1 2021. Stores that were open during both periods saw a decrease in traffic  especially in March  as a result of lower consumer confidence.Compared to the pre-pandemic Q1 2019  total Q1 2022 Group sales were up +15%.Total GMV of EUR 329 million was stable yoy thanks to a very strong 43% increase in the marketplace GMV. Compared to Q1 2019  GMV grew by +21%  illustrating the launch of the marketplace in France at the end of 2020.Sales by category:Decoration sales were unchanged compared Q1 2021 at EUR 175 million  coming from a very high comparable base in 2021  which had grown by +39% vs 2020. When compared to Q1 2019  decoration sales grew by 17%  demonstrating over time the successful revamping of collections undertaken in 2019. Maisons du Monde’s decoration collections continued to meet with success especially on tableware and outdoor items.Furniture inventory continued to be impacted by supply chain disruptions  and Q1 2022 sales were therefore slightly down (-2%) and represented 44% of total Group sales (- 0.5 percentage point vs Q1 2021). Here again  the high comparison base of Q1 2021 (+34% vs Q1 2020) blurs the global picture. Compared to Q1 2019  furniture sales grew by 13%  even though product availability was not yet at its target level. Furniture inventory has improved over the period  with replenishment program in line with plan despite the complex environment. As COVID rebounds in China  some manufacturing and freight operations are currently hampered. Exercising its now proven agility  the Group is monitoring the situation very closely to optimise sourcing and shipping plans.Sales by channel:Online sales decreased by 13.2% yoy to reach EUR 104 million  yet still represented one-third of total Group sales. This evolution is explained by the exceptional outperformance of the 1st quarter last year which was up 73% due to the pandemic-related store closures as well as the docker strike in Q1 2020. Compared to Q1 2019  Q1 2022 online sales were up a very strong 46%  lifted by countries such as Germany  Spain and Italy  which growth vs Q1 2019 neared 60%.Maisons du Monde’s selective marketplace  continued its fast growth with GMV totalling EUR 20 million during the period (+43% yoy). At the end of March 2022  the marketplace featured over 1 100 brands and 140 000 SKUs. Maisons du Monde continues to roll out its omnichannel strategy  and the marketplace is now available in all French stores. Furthermore  at the end of the quarter  the marketplace expanded for the first-time outside France: it is now available in Spain and boasts nearly 50 000 SKUs from over 290 brands.Store salesIn part thanks to a favourable comparable base  total 1st quarter store sales were up 6% at EUR 209 million. Store sales were also up 5% vs their pre-pandemic level of Q1 2019.At 31 March 2022  Maisons du Monde had 350 stores  compared to 357 at 31 December 2021. During the quarter  the Group closed  as planned  8 stores: 5 closures in France  2 in Belgium  1 in Italy and opened one store in Spain  maintaining its yearly objective of 0 to 5 net openings.Sales by geographySales in France reached EUR 162 million (52% of total sales)  down 11% vs Q1 2021  but up 3% vs Q1 2019  in a context of still suboptimal inventory levels.Store sales in France were EUR 114 million down 9% yoy but roughly stable vs Q1 2019 despite a net reduction of 7 stores over the 3-year period. They represented 55% of total store sales  -9 percentage points vs Q1 2021.Online sales in France were down 15% yoy but a strong 33% vs Q1 2019.International sales totalled EUR 151 million  up 12% vs Q1 2021  and a solid 32% vs 2019. They represented 48% of total sales (+ 6 percentage points vs 2019).International growth was fuelled by new store openings (+ 23 net stores since Q1 2019)  and a more online-driven channel mix  online representing 37% of international sales in Q1 2021  vs 31% in Q1 2019.International store sales were up +32% to EUR 95 million  thanks to the addition of 10 stores to the international network since the end of March 2021.Compared to Q1 2021  international sales also benefitted from a low comparison base of 2021  which was still impacted by store closures  notably in Germany  Spain and Italy.2022 Commercial and operational prioritiesFor the remainder of 2022  the Group’s commercial priorities are to:Keep strengthening Maisons du Monde’s omnichannel model to the service of customersSelectively rebuild inventories while actively managing sourcing constraintsProtecting the Group’s profitability through rigorous cost control  while advancing on the strategic agendaSustain efforts towards corporate social responsibility2022 guidanceIn an environment that remains complex and volatile  the Group sees a slow start to the first half of the year and considers Q2 dynamics will be hampered by the global inflation context and its impact on demand  alongside COVID-related slowdowns in Asia which may impact restocking plans. As a result  sales in the first half should be slightly negative. On the other hand  the second half will benefit from higher inventory levels  especially in furniture  to support top line growth acceleration  and a more favourable comparable base.In this context  and assuming no further deterioration of macro-economic and supply chain conditions  the Group confirms its full-year 2022 objectives:Positive top line growth  to be fine-tuned as visibility improvesAn EBIT margin around 9%FCF of EUR 65 million to 75 millionReduction of the Group’s carbon intensity: CO 2 neutrality for scopes 1 and 2Dividend pay-out ratio of 30% to 40%***Update ESG Impact Share Buy Back ProgramMaisons du Monde completed its EUR 50 million “ESG Impact” share buyback program launched last October.

The platform will incorporate the key strengths of Accor’s brands and leverage the Group’s leading market position in the luxury and premium segments. Building on Rixos’ invaluable 20+ years of experience in the luxury-all-inclusive market. The offering will look to provide exciting and memorable experiences globally.Accor entered into a joint venture with Fettah Tamince  founder of Rixos Hotels  in 2016 to develop the All-Inclusive segment. The partnership has proved to be great success with Rixos successfully tripling its network (including committed pipeline) over the last 5 years. Rixos is a leading global player in the luxury all-inclusive segment and the dominant market leader in Turkey  the Middle East and Central Asia with 24 hotels and over 10 000 rooms in operation and a further 26 hotels with over 14 000 rooms in the pipeline.Building upon the success of Rixos  Accor is significantly expanding its all-inclusive offering by including its luxury and premium brands with Fairmont  Sofitel  Pullman  Swissôtel and Mövenpick in the Collection. The objective is to leverage the strength and visibility of these brands in the key target markets for expansion for the All-Inclusive Collection.Carefully curated entertainment programmes  for both day and evening activities  will play a central role and will build on Rixos’ expertise in children’s clubs  fitness  watersports as well as in programming for outdoor activities and MICE. Guests can look forward to spectacular shows with breathtaking performances delivered by entertainers and multiple sporting activities per resort accompanied by world-class spa and wellness facilities.This will be complemented by the exceptional quality and wide breadth of restaurant  bar  beach club and nightlife concepts  creating unforgettable guest experiences. The Collection’s programming in this space will be inspired and led by Carte Blanched  Ennismore’s F&B Concept Lab with each venue providing diverse and culturally relevant cuisines and culinary experiences. Ennismore is the leading lifestyle platform established by Accor in a joint venture with Sharan Pasricha.International expansion of the all-inclusive business will be centered in Europe  Middle East Africa  Turkey  Asia and Central America and the Caribbean. These geographies have been selected for their promising growth potential in the all-inclusive segment and the strength of these brands in the target markets. The Collection will initially focus on the further expansion of Rixos’ footprint of 50 properties in the network and pipeline and will quickly scale and diversify as part of a longer term multi-branded strategy of having over 100 all-inclusive resorts in the next 5 years.The Collection is set for a strong year of openings which will include: Rixos Gulf Hotel Doha  Rixos Qetaifan Doha  which includes one of the world’s largest waterparks. Both these resorts will open in time for the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Also opening later this year the Swissôtel Sharm el Sheikh  the first non-Rixos branded property in the All-Inclusive Collection with 1 350 rooms  a water park  multiple dining  beach club and entertainment facilities.Fettah Tamince  Chairman of the Board of Rixos Hotels  said: “I am incredibly proud of the success Rixos has achieved in the five years as part of the Accor portfolio. Together  Accor and Rixos complement each other’s market-leading expertise  and the All-Inclusive Collection is the next step in accelerating their positions in the sector. This new initiative comes at a time when the demand for all-inclusive stays could not be stronger and now is the right time to leverage this positive trajectory. I am excited and pleased to continue my partnership with Accor with this expanded brand portfolio.”Gaurav Bhushan  CEO Accor Lifestyle & Entertainment  Co-CEO Ennismore  added: “The post-Covid travel market is witnessing a renewed desire for leisure stays. Accor’s strategic decision to double down on the all-inclusive segment  the fastest growing sector in this market and build upon its success with Rixos  capitalizes on this opportunity.

EBITDA for the first quarter of 2022 was $54.8 million  a 93% increase over $28.3 million in the first quarter of 2021. This also marks the seventh straight quarter of sequential growth after the pandemic low point in the second quarter of 2020.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  “With regard to COVID  we continue to apply all safety measures at our disposal with the highest degree of attention to ensure our employees are working in the lowest risk environment possible. Nothing is more important to AMG than the safety  health  and well-being of our workers and their families. All injuries and occupational illnesses are preventable  and we firmly believe that there is no job worth doing in an unsafe manner.

The higher revenue was due to the improved pricing and higher sales volumes noted above was offset by increased raw material prices  as well as the ongoing rise in energy and shipping costs.SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2022 slightly increased by $0.8 million  to $7.4 million  primarily due to higher share-based and variable compensation expense in the current quarter.The first quarter 2022 EBITDA was $1.1 million lower than the same period in the prior year  due to increased SG&A costs.AMG Critical Materials TechnologiesQ1 ‘22 Q1 ‘21 Change Revenue $153 295 $120 443 27% Gross profit 23 188 20 507 13% Gross profit before non-recurring items 23 283 20 569 13% Operating profit 3 948 3 644 8% EBITDA 9 650 9 041 7%AMG Critical Materials Technologies' first quarter 2022 revenue increased by $32.9 million  or 27%  compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was due to increased titanium alloys sales  as well as higher titanium alloy and chrome metal pricing  offset by timing delays in Engineering projects. First quarter 2022 gross profit before non-recurring items increased by $2.7 million  or 13%  to $23.3 million due to the higher volumes and prices.SG&A expenses increased by $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021  driven by an increase in professional fees and higher share-based and variable compensation expense in the current quarter.AMG Critical Materials Technologies’ EBITDA increased to $9.7 million during the quarter  compared to $9.0 million in the first quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to higher profitability in chrome metal and titanium alloys.The Company signed $61.1 million in new orders during the first quarter of 2022  driven by strong orders of remelting and heat treatment furnaces  representing a 1.09x book to bill ratio. Order backlog was $183.5 million as of March 31  2022  in line with $188.2 million as of December 31  2021.Financial ReviewExceptional ItemsAMG’s first quarter 2022 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA.A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in the first quarters of 2022 and 2021 are below:Exceptional items included in gross profitQ1 ‘22 Q1 ‘21 Change Gross profit $75 194 $46 864 60% Inventory cost adjustment — (333) N/A Restructuring expense 141 67 110% Asset impairment reversal — (136) N/A Strategic project expense 2 265 561 304% Gross profit excluding exceptional items 77 600 47 023 65%Energy CostsAMG experienced significant increases in gas and electricity costs in the first quarter of 2022. Total energy costs were $11.9 million higher in the first quarter of 2022 versus the same period in 2021. The majority of this increase was at our silicon business in Germany  but that business benefited from fully hedged power costs and increased silicon prices. Other business units benefited from long-term electricity contracts that have no price escalation clauses  and the business units that did experience energy cost increases were able to pass through most of these increased costs to their customers.SG&AAMG’s first quarter 2022 SG&A expenses were $37.5 million compared to $33.1 million in the first quarter of 2021  with the variance driven largely by an increase in professional fees due to higher strategic project costs and higher shared-based and variable compensation expense. The first quarter of 2021 personnel cost was reduced by cost reduction efforts in response to the onset of the pandemic.Net Finance CostsAMG’s first quarter 2022 net finance costs were $8.9 million compared to $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. This slight increase was mainly driven by higher borrowing rates during the quarter  which were partially offset by lower foreign exchange losses versus the prior period.TaxAMG recorded an income tax benefit of $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2022  compared to $0.9 million in the same period in 2021. This variance was mainly driven by higher pre-tax income compared to the prior period more than offset by movements in the Brazilian real versus the US dollar. The effects of the Brazilian real caused a $14.7 million non-cash deferred tax benefit in the first quarter 2022. Movements in the Brazilian real exchange rate impact the valuation of the Company’s net deferred tax positions related to our operations in Brazil.AMG paid taxes of $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2022  compared to tax payments of $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2021.LiquidityMarch 31 2022 December 31 2021 Change Senior secured debt $371 323 $371 897 —% Cash & cash equivalents 308 482 337 877 (9%) Senior secured net debt 62 841 34 020 85% Other debt 26 676 24 398 9% Net debt excluding municipal bond 89 517 58 418 53% Municipal bond debt 319 419 319 476 —% Restricted cash 62 139 93 434 (33%) Net debt 346 797 284 460 22%AMG had a net debt position of $346.8 million as of March 31  2022. This increase was mainly due to the significant investment in growth initiatives during the quarter.AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the first quarter. As of March 31  2022  the Company had $308 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $170 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $478 million of total liquidity as of March 31  2022.In January 2022  AMG Engineering entered into €140 million of long-term bilateral unsecured performance-based guarantee facility agreements. These guarantee arrangements support expected customer advanced payments and replace the existing guarantee arrangements.In November 2021  AMG entered into a new $350 million 7-year senior secured term loan B facility (“term loan”) and a $200 million 5-year senior secured revolving credit facility (“revolver”). The total facility amount of $550 million replaced AMG’s prior credit facility and extended the term loan maturity from 2025 to 2028 and revolver maturity from 2023 to 2026. Further strengthening AMG’s commitment to Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG)  annual CO 2 intensity reduction targets were built into the Revolving Credit Facility  making it a Sustainability Linked Loan. In conjunction with this loan  AMG entered into a 5-year swap agreement through 2026  which fixed interest rates for the entire term loan at the prevailing low interest rates in November 2021.OutlookAMG was able to deliver strong results despite the continuing impact of COVID-19 and the fallout from the geopolitical turbulence in recent months. EBITDA was $54.8 million in the first quarter of 2022  93% higher than the first quarter 2021 EBITDA of $28.3 million  and 25% higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. As mentioned  it was the seventh straight quarter of sequential improvement and we expect this trend to continue.In December 2021  AMG increased its 2022 EBITDA guidance from “$150 million or more” to “$175 - $200 million.”In February 2022  we further increased our EBITDA guidance for the full year 2022 to “$225 million or more.”Given the improved market conditions within our portfolio  especially the lithium and also the vanadium markets  the new guidance is that 2022 EBITDA will be in the range of $260 to $290 million.The last long-term EBITDA guidance was given in 2019  prior to the COVID period. In 2019  we said “we will reach an EBITDA of $350 million  or more  in 5 years  or earlier.”Being now much closer to the year 2023  and despite the global disruption from the coronavirus and the geopolitical turbulence  we strongly reaffirm that guidance.As to a new long-term EBITDA guidance  we will reach an EBITDA of $500 million  or more  in 5 years or earlier.Net income to EBITDA reconciliationQ1 ‘22 Q1 ‘21 Net income $29 884 $5 678 Income tax benefit (1 489) (910) Net finance cost 8 919 8 654 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 380 1 114 Restructuring expense 141 67 Inventory cost adjustment — (333) Strategic project expense (1) 4 796 2 552 Share of loss of associates 500 387 Others 102 167 EBIT 44 233 17 376 Depreciation and amortization 10 527 10 963 EBITDA 54 760 28 339(1) The Company is in the ramp-up phase for several strategic expansion projects  including AMG Vanadium’s expansion project  the joint venture with Shell  Hybrid Lithium Vanadium Redox Flow Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational.

Worldline and Algoan are dedicated to making these opportunities readily available to the market.Traditional credit assessment practises across Europe involve varying degrees of manual processes and assessments  which are subject to human error and cost both lender and borrower a lot of time to process a credit application. Following the fundamental changes in the financial services industry  the task of assessing potential borrowers is becoming more and more difficult with traditional assessment methods no longer meeting consumer expectations and not keeping pace with digital transformation or regulatory changes. The credit & risk assessment process has a lot to gain from PSD2 opportunities  as Open Banking and Open Finance continue to provide better and faster services to consumers and institutions.Unleashing the power of Open BankingThe partnership will combine Worldline’s pan-European Open Banking reach and expertise in digital banking  combined with Algoan’s credit scoring expertise that uses best-in-class machine learning algorithms  therefore offering a new Open Banking-based credit-assessment tool. This will enable banks  credit institutions  lending companies and service providers to take credit scoring to the next level  resulting in more accurate scoring  access to better data and improved processing efficiency. This innovation can be valuable for many use cases  such as Personal Finance & Consumer Lending  Auto Finance & Leasing  Retail Lending & BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later)  Insurance and Utility Providers.Benefits for both lenders and borrowersOpen Banking-based credit assessment brings significant advantages to both lenders and borrowers. As the lender receives data from the bank  the data validity is ensured which will reduce the risk of fraud. Based on a more accurate assessment  applicants can be accepted who may otherwise have been declined. With access to consumer account data  based on user consent  lenders quickly get a better view of the actual financial situation of consumers and can meet the borrower’s needs without risking over-indebtedness. In addition  the lender can provide a fast  straightforward customer journey while the borrower receives a fair credit assessment and a faster time-to-yes.At the heart of this new credit assessment tool is Worldline’s Open Banking API  which provides access to more than 3 500 banks in 19 countries across Europe. Worldline is one of the largest Open Banking providers in Europe.Michael Steinbach  Managing Director Financial Services at Worldline: “At Worldline we look for innovative partners who share our vision and enable us to enrich and expand our open banking services. As a lead and one of the largest Open Banking providers in Europe  we are committed to unlocking the full potential of Open Banking. With Algoan  we will be able to offer our customers an end-to-end and cost-efficient white-label solution to assess credit worthiness”.Michael Diguet  CEO at Algoan: “Open Banking credit scoring is experiencing momentum that big players should embrace. We are delighted to collaborate with a global leader Worldline and to power them with our best-in-class global credit scoring API.

The “Laugh Now  Cry Later” rapper reportedly completed his contractual obligations to the Young Money/Cash Money (YMCMB) label and was looking at a potential free agency reign if he decided against signing with another label. But now that won’t be the case after all.Variety has more:Since 2014  Drake has moved over 37 million album project units. He’s also the first artist ever to surpass 50 billion combined streams on Spotify. To estimate that Drake’s music brings in $50 million annually is no stretch  say sources  and that the deal could be in the vicinity of $400 million or more isn’t either. For UMG  which is traded on the Euronext exchange  the deal helps solidify its catalog holdings. The company owns 3 million sound recordings and boasts 4 of the top 5 most streamed artists of the last decade on Spotify  per a report to investors issued by UBS Research in summer 2021. That report listed Drake among UMG’s 2021 “re-signings” and noted €1.52 billion spent on catalog acquisitions and artists advances in 2020 (Drake is listed alongside Bob Dylan and Cash Money; his songs have also been ingested into the UMPG system).As HipHopDX also notes  The Weeknd also recently struck a similar deal as the 6 God—which means that UMG now houses two of the biggest artists in the industry and only further cements their status and influence.,neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,negative,0.04,0.23,0.74,True,English,"['Gigantic $400M Deal', 'Universal Music Group', 'Drake', 'UMG Chairman Sir Lucian Grainge', 'potential free agency reign', '37 million album project units', 'top 5 most streamed artists', 'Q1 earnings call', 'Certified Lover Boy', 'visual media projects', '50 billion combined streams', '3 million sound recordings', 'Universal Music Group', 'Young Money/Cash Money', 'expansive, multi-faceted deal', 'artists advances', 'biggest artists', 'contractual obligations', 'first artist', 'Euronext exchange', 'catalog holdings', 'last decade', 'UBS Research', 'catalog acquisitions', 'Bob Dylan', 'UMPG system', 'The Weeknd', 'new deal', 'similar deal', 'YMCMB) label', 'rapper Drake', 'grave', 'side', 'heaven', 'Advertisement', 'Tuesday', 'company', 'publishing', 'merchandise', 'Variety', 'Laugh', 'case', 'Spotify', 'stretch', 'sources', 'vicinity', 'report', 'investors', 'summer', '2021 “re', 'signings', 'songs', 'HipHopDX', '6 God', 'industry', 'status', 'influence']",2022-05-04,2022-05-04,theroot.com

Recurring revenues (81%) grew 8% organically; non-recurring revenues rose 9% organically. Digital & services revenues (93%) grew 9% organically; print revenues grew 4% organically. Expert solutions (56%) grew 10% organically.First-quarter adjusted operating profit margin increased  with strong operational gearing more than compensating for increased personnel expenses .First-quarter adjusted free cash flow increased 6% in constant currencies  despite higher capital expenditure and tax payments in the quarter.Net debt-to-EBITDA 1.2x as of March 31  2022.2022 share buyback: €216 million of intended buyback of up to €600 million completed in theyear through May 2  2022.Nancy McKinstry  CEO and Chair of the Executive Board  commented: “The year has started well  with improved organic growth across all four divisions  even if we exclude favorable timing and phasing effects that influenced the first quarter. We continued to invest in our people and products as we pursue opportunities to grow our expert solutions. While we face more challenging revenue comparables in the remainder of the year  weare confident in reaffirming our overall guidance for 2022.”First Quarter 2022 DevelopmentsFirst quarter revenues increased 13% in reporting currency  partly reflecting the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro compared to a year ago (average EUR/USD rate 1.12 versus 1.20 in 1Q 2021). In constant currencies  first quarter revenues increased 8%. Excluding both currency and the net effect of acquisitions and divestments  organic growth was 8% (1Q 2021: 4%). All divisions posted improved organic growth in the quarter compared to a year ago.Recurring revenues (81% of revenues)  which include subscriptions and other repeating revenue streams  increased 8% organically against a relatively weak comparable (1Q 2021: 3%). Non-recurring revenues (19% of revenues) increased 9% organically (1Q 2021: 7%) with transactional revenues in Governance  Risk & Compliance (GRC) broadly flat (1Q 2021: 11%) but other non-recurring revenues  such as software license and implementation services  up 14% organically (1Q 2021: stable). Print revenues rose 4% organically (1Q 2021: 6%)  with an 8% organic decline in Legal & Regulatory print revenues more than offset by an organic increase in Health.The adjusted operating profit margin increased in all divisions  except in Governance  Risk & Compliance. The first quarter margin benefitted from operational gearing which more than offset increased personnel costs related to hires made in recent quarters. Expenses related to travel and other activities that were reduced during the pandemic remained low in the first quarter but are expected to build over the year.Health revenues increased 9% organically (1Q 2021: 8%) in the quarter  with strong performance around the world. Clinical Solutions grew 9% organically (1Q 2021: 6%)  driven by strong subscription renewals for our decision support tool  UpToDate  and our drug information solutions  Medi-Span and Lexicomp. Health Learning  Research & Practice also grew 9% organically (1Q 2021: 11%)  buoyed by an unexpected increase in U.S. print book revenues due to favorable timing of distributor orders. Organic growth in Learning  Research & Practice digital subscriptions  advertising  and other non-recurring revenues slowed compared to a year ago due to a challenging comparable.Tax & Accounting revenues grew 9% organically (1Q 2021: 3%)  largely reflecting revenue phasing related to the timing of the U.S. tax season and a surge in demand for outsourced professional services in a tight labor market. Corporate Performance Solutions (CCH Tagetik and TeamMate) recorded mid-single digit organic growth  driven by double-digit organic growth at CCH Tagetik. Professional Tax & Accounting North America recorded double-digit organic growth  against a weak comparable which saw revenues shift into the second quarter of 2021 due to the delay in the U.S. tax season. Professional Tax & Accounting Europe delivered mid-single digit organic growth  while Asia Pacific growth moderated.Governance  Risk & Compliance revenues increased 8% organically (1Q 2021: 3%). Legal Services organic growth was 7% (1Q 2021: 2%)  mainly driven by robust renewals for CT Corporation legal representation subscription services. Financial Services recorded 8% organic growth (1Q 2021: 5%). In Compliance Solutions  subscription revenues increased  especially for eOriginal digital lending solutions  however this was offset by a decline in transactional volumes due to the absence of a Paycheck Protection Program1 in 2022 and the market-wide decline in U.S. mortgage originations. Finance  Risk & Reporting posted strong organic growth driven by non-recurring implementation services and higher license fees for OneSumX software. On April 8  2022  GRC completed the acquisition of International Document Services (IDS) for approximately $70 million in cash.Legal & Regulatory revenues grew 6% organically (1Q 2021: 2%)  benefitting from higher non-recurring license revenues for EHS/ORM2 software. Information Solutions (79% of divisional revenues) posted 3% organic growth (1Q 2021: 2%)  with digital information solutions up 7% and print formats down 8% in the quarter. Divestitures  notably the disposal of the U.S. Legal Education business in September 2021  reduced divisional revenues by 4% in constant currencies in the quarter. The sale of our legal publishing assets in Spain and France  agreed in December 2021 and expected to complete in 2022  remains subject to approval of the Spanish antitrust authorities.Cash Flow and Net DebtFirst quarter adjusted free cash flow increased 6% in constant currencies. Cash conversion was lower than a year ago due to an increase in capital expenditures and a decline in working capital inflows. Mainly as a result of new U.S. rules on the capitalization of research & development expenses  cash tax payments increased. Net cash spend on acquisitions was nil  while a total of €157 million in cash was deployed towards share repurchases during the first quarter.As of March 31  2022  net debt was €1 920 million  compared to €2 131 million at December 31  2021. Net-debt-to-EBITDA  based on rolling twelve months’ EBITDA  was 1.2x at the end of March 2022  compared to 1.4x at year-end 2021.As of March 31  2022  the number of issued ordinary shares outstanding (excluding 5.5 million shares held in treasury) was 257.1 million.Dividends and Share BuybacksAt the Annual General Meeting held on April 21  2022  shareholders approved a total dividend of €1.57 over financial year 2021. This results in a final dividend of €1.03 per share to be paid to shareholders on May 18  2022 (ADRs: May 25  2022). The interim dividend for 2022 will be set at 40% of the prior year total dividend.In the year to date  Wolters Kluwer has repurchased 2.3 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of €216 million (average share price €92.55). This includes a €46 million block trade executed on February 24  2022  to offset dilution caused by incentive share issuance. For the period starting May 5  2022  up to and including August 1  2022  we have engaged a third party to execute €140 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer’s Articles of Association. Share repurchases will be used for capital reduction purposes and to meet obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.Recent ESG and Other DevelopmentsAs of the end of April  90% of our offices have reopened and about a quarter of our global workforce was back in office for all or part of the week. At the 2022 Annual General Meeting in April  Ann Ziegler succeeded Frans Cremers as Chair of the Supervisory Board. Heleen Kersten was appointed Member  increasing the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board to 57%.Full-Year 2022 OutlookWe reiterate our overall guidance for full-year 2022 adjusted operating profit margin  adjusted free cash flow  return on invested capital (ROIC)  and diluted adjusted EPS (see table below). We continue to expect good organic growth for the full year  albeit slower than in 2021 due to challenging comparables starting in the second quarter. The recent suspension of business in Russia and Belarus is expected to have minimal impact as these countries represent less than 1% of group revenues. We maintain our full year adjusted operating profit margin guidance  although we now expect the group margin to rise in the first half of 2022. As previously indicated  we expect growth in diluted adjusted EPS to be dampened by a return to our historical tax rate.Full-Year 2022 Outlook Performance indicators 2022 Guidance 2021 Adjusted operating profit margin 25.5%-26.0% 25.3% Adjusted free cash flow €1 025-1 075 million €1 010 million ROIC Around 14% 13.7% Diluted adjusted EPS Mid-single-digit growth €3.38 Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reported currencies and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2022 of €/$1.13. Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.18). Guidance reflects share repurchases for up to €600 million in 2022.If current exchange rates persist  the U.S. dollar rate will have a positive effect on 2022 results reported in euros. In 2021  Wolters Kluwer generated more than 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2021 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 2 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS3.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We currently expect that restructuring costs will increase to within our normal range of €10-€15 million (FY 2021: €6 million). We expect adjusted net financing costs of approximately €65 million in constant currencies4  including lease interest charges. We expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to increase to approximately 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2021: 21.5%). Capital expenditure is expected to be within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2021: 5.0%). We expect the full-year cash conversion ratio to be in the range of 100%-105% (FY 2021: 112%).Any guidance we provide assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins and earnings in the near term.2022 Outlook by DivisionHealth: we expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels  mainly due to the absence of a contract win of the size of the 2021 ASCO deal. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to improve modestly.Tax & Accounting: we expect organic growth to improve slightly from 2021 levels and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Governance  Risk & Compliance: we expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels  due to slower growth in transactional revenues in the second half of the year. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to ease in the first half but to improve for the full year.Legal & Regulatory: we expect organic growth to be in line with 2021. The adjusted operating profit margin is expected to decline in the second half and for the full year due to the absence of the one-off pension amendment recorded in 2021.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

This figure was partially offset by higher taxes  financials and higher non-controlling interest  among others. EDPR now currently holds a portfolio of operating assets of 14 GW  of which 13 GW fully consolidated and 1.1 GW equity consolidated (Spain  Portugal  US  APAC and Offshore).For Q1 2022 EDPR added a total of 465 MW of wind and solar capacity  out of which 450 MW fully consolidated  specifically 46 MW in Europe  3 MW in North American and 401 MW in Asia-Pacific (APAC). Equity consolidated increased by 15 MW due to new solar projects in APAC. Capacity additions were mainly driven by the successful integration of Sunseap assets from APAC  which now represent 3% of the EDPR’s portfolio. Furthermore  in March 2022 EDPR had 2.4 GW of capacity under construction  of which 1.569 MW related to wind onshore and 805 to solar technology.In the Q1 period  EDPR produced 9.2 TWh of clean electricity (up 14% interannually)  avoiding 6mt of CO 2 emissions. This interannual evolution benefits from the capacity additions over the last 12 months along with a higher renewable resource.Also  EDPR achieved a 35% load factor (one percentage point higher than the previous financial year)  reflecting a Renewables index 2% higher than the expected long-term average Gross Capacity Factor (up 5 percentage points interannually).In the words of Miguel Stilwell d'Andrade  CEO of EDP Renewables: ""The results reflect our solid growth and our strong positioning as a global market leader. We now have platforms in all key growth regions  our team has grown stronger and more cohesive  and 50% of the capacity targeted under our strategic plan for 2021-2025 has been secured. We are prepared to carry on leading the energy transition”.Financial resultsEDPR revenues increased to 569 million euros (up 27% interannually)  i.e. up 121 million euros from the previous year. This is due to the impact from additional capacity MW (up 79 million euros interannually) along with higher renewable resource (up 20 million euros interannually)  positive forex translation and others (up 27 million euros interannually)  which were more than enough to offset the negative effect from the average selling price (down 5 million euros interannually) on the back of portfolio mix effect.Other operating income amounted to 81 million euros (up 65 million euros interannually).

With a compelling valuation versus its peers Euronext and Deutsche Börse  we confirm our buy rating. Macroeconomic environments will ...,"CHUNYIP WONG/iStock via Getty ImagesAfter our initiation of coverage with a buy rating for the London Stock Exchange Group plc (OTCPK:LDNXF  OTCPK:LNSTY)  today  we analyse its Q1 numbers. As a brief recap  our internal team believed that clearinghouses are a smart investment in uncertain times. We are positive about the following:Macroeconomic environments will drive volatility and volumes on exchanges  using VIX as a company's revenue proxy we are estimating higher results for the Q2; Strong company results and better than expected synergies from the Refinitiv integration; Limited Russia and Ukraine exposure.Q1 ResultsLooking at the CEO's comment  we see that our long-term view has been confirmed by his words: “LSEG has delivered a good first quarter  with strong underlying performance across all divisions. During the quarter we announced two acquisitions to enhance our product offerings in Trading & Banking and Customer & Third-Party Risk. We also announced the divestment of BETA+  which will simplify and refocus our Wealth Solutions business"". London Stock Exchange Group continues to be resilient. 73% of LSE income is highly recurring in nature with a diversified clientele  sector and product activities and with a high geographical footprint.Looking at the details  top-line sales were just a bit above the consensus expectations  in particular  we note that capital market sales offset the post-trade division. LSEG's total revenue stood at £1.751 billion and this was up by 6.3% compared to the previous year-end. If we include Russia / Ukraine impacts  revenue would have been up by 6.8%. For 2022  we understand £60m is the data & analytics business impact on clientele based in Russia.London Stock Exchange Group Q1 ResultsSource: London Stock Exchange Group Q1 Trading UpdateRefinitiv synergies are on track and the company achieved a £25m run-rate in Q1 stating also that they will meet all the financial targets. Looking again at the M&A  LSE will complete the other two acquisitions to reinforce post-trade solutions with Quantile and TORA  and GDC for the data & analytics businesses. BETA+ net of proceeds will return to shareholders via share repurchasing likely to happen in Q3.The CEO was pretty happy to announce that ""Our ability to invest for growth  make strategic acquisitions and return capital to shareholders demonstrates the strength of the Group and its high-quality recurring revenues. The Group is well positioned and we look forward to further progress during the rest of 2022"".Conclusion And ValuationOur internal team has high confidence in the business combination with Refinitiv. The combined company offers more resiliency for investors and a strategic logic in economies of scope. We believe that management is on track to achieve ""EBITDA >50% target by end of next year"". Looking at the valuation  we see that LSE is undervalued compared to Euronext and Deutsche Börse both at P/E and also on EV/EBITDA. We believe this is not justified and we reiterate our valuation of 8700p based on an EV/EBITDA of 18x.London Stock Exchange Group GuidanceSource: London Stock Exchange Group Q1 Trading UpdateIf you are interested in our previous articles on the European stock exchange  please have a look at our recent publications:",neutral,0.09,0.87,0.04,mixed,0.58,0.1,0.32,True,English,"['London Stock Exchange Q1 Earnings', 'Refinitiv Integration', 'Track', 'London Stock Exchange Group Q1 Trading Update', 'London Stock Exchange Group Q1 Results Source', 'London Stock Exchange Group Guidance Source', 'London Stock Exchange Group plc', 'European stock exchange', 'strong underlying performance', 'high-quality recurring revenues', 'Deutsche Börse', 'high geographical footprint', 'Strong company results', 'good first quarter', 'Wealth Solutions business', 'other two acquisitions', 'capital market sales', 'The Group', 'Q1 numbers', 'higher results', 'top-line sales', 'post-trade solutions', 'high confidence', 'business impact', 'strategic acquisitions', 'business combination', 'CHUNYIP WONG', 'Getty Images', 'buy rating', 'OTCPK:LDNXF', 'OTCPK:LNSTY', 'brief recap', 'internal team', 'smart investment', 'uncertain times', 'Macroeconomic environments', 'long-term view', 'product offerings', 'Third-Party Risk', 'product activities', 'consensus expectations', 'post-trade division', 'previous year-end', '£25m run-rate', 'financial targets', 'M&A', 'share repurchasing', 'strategic logic', 'EBITDA >50% target', 'next year', 'previous articles', 'recent publications', 'combined company', 'revenue proxy', 'Refinitiv integration', 'total revenue', 'Ukraine exposure', 'diversified clientele', 'analytics businesses', 'BETA+ net', 'Limited Russia', 'LSE income', 'Refinitiv synergies', 'iStock', 'initiation', 'coverage', 'clearinghouses', 'volatility', 'volumes', 'exchanges', 'VIX', 'Q2', 'CEO', 'comment', 'words', 'LSEG', 'divisions', 'Banking', 'Customer', 'divestment', 'nature', 'sector', 'details', 'data', 'track', 'Quantile', 'TORA', 'GDC', 'proceeds', 'shareholders', 'Q3.', 'ability', 'growth', 'strength', 'progress', 'rest', 'Conclusion', 'Valuation', 'resiliency', 'investors', 'economies', 'scope', 'management', 'Euronext', 'P/E', 'EV/EBITDA', '8700p', '18x', 'look', '2022']",2022-05-04,2022-05-04,seekingalpha.com
