For further information  please see “Other developments”Story continuesFINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS FOR JANUARY-MARCH 2022Sampo Group’s core business  P&C insurance  reported an underwriting profit of EUR 290 million (317) in January-March 2022. Excluding COVID-19 effects reported in the first quarter of 2021  underwriting profit grew 4 per cent. The Group combined ratio increased by 2.3 percentage points to 83.5 per cent (81.2)  driven mainly by the economic activity returning back to normal levels as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted during the quarter. Excluding the COVID-19 effects reported in If and Topdanmark in the first quarter of 2021  the combined ratio improved by 0.1 percentage points from 83.6 per cent a year ago. Gross written premiums increased by 7 per cent to EUR 2 833 million  supported by strong renewals and high retention. Sampo targets mid-single digit per cent underwriting profit growth on average and a combined ratio below 86 per cent for 2021-2023.If P&C continued its strong performance and achieved an underwriting profit of EUR 234 million (213)  representing a year-on-year growth of 10 per cent. The growth was driven by 0.7 percentage points improvement in the combined ratio to 80.8 per cent (81.5) and a strong 6.9 per cent currency adjusted premium growth. Premiums grew in all Business Areas and markets  supported by strong 1 January renewals with rate increases  high retention and an increase in customer count. If’s adjusted risk ratio improved by 0.7 percentage points year-on-year. Effects related to the COVID-19 pandemic were well below those observed in 2021 and have therefore not been quantified. Profit before taxes increased to EUR 283 million (257).Topdanmark’s profit before taxes decreased to EUR 37 million (137) in Sampo Group’s profit and loss account. The combined ratio was 87.8 per cent (84.7).Hastings’ performance in the first quarter was affected by challenging UK motor insurance market  with competitive pricing and elevated claims inflation. Hastings has taken a disciplined approach to pricing  leading to rate driven currency adjusted premium growth of 10 per cent and broadly stable policy count from year-end. Home insurance policies grew by 18 per cent year-on-year. The operating ratio increased to 92.5 per cent (75.1)  mainly as a result of a reduction in COVID-19 effects. Hastings profit before taxes excluding non-operational depreciation and amortisation amounted to EUR 17 million (56) and reported profit before taxes stood at EUR 2 million (46).Mandatum segment’s profit before taxes for January-March 2022 increased to EUR 80 million (76). Despite the uncertain market situation  Mandatum’s unit-linked and other client assets under management remained near record high levels at EUR 10.9 billion (11.1)  as net flows partly offset adverse market developments. Mandatum Life’s Solvency II ratio increased to 216 per cent (190)  as weak mark-to-market investment results were more than offset by increasing interest rates and a decrease in the symmetric adjustment.Holding segment’s profit before taxes increased to EUR 164 million (115)  including a dividend of EUR 157 million from Nordea and a gain of EUR 28 million from the sale of 19 million Nordea shares in the open market. During April 2022  Sampo completed the exit from Nordea and stated that management will propose that a new share buyback programme is launched after the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2022  subject to the AGM renewing the Board authorisation on share repurchases.The share buyback programme of EUR 750 million launched on October 2021 was completed on 25 March 2022. In total  Sampo repurchased 17.1 million own shares  corresponding to 3.1 per cent of all shares. The repurchased shares were cancelled on 31 March 2022. On 30 March 2022  Sampo launched a new buyback programme of up to EUR 250 million.Sampo Group’s Solvency II ratio increased to 200 per cent (185) over the quarter  net of dividend accrual based on the 2021 insurance dividend of EUR 1.70 per share and the new buyback programme of EUR 250 million. The improvement of 15 percentage points from year-end 2021 was mainly driven by rising interest rates and a decline in the symmetric adjustment. Sampo targets a solvency ratio of 170-190 per cent. The sale of Sampo's remaining Nordea shares in April is expected to add approximately 30 percentage points to the group solvency ratio.Sampo Group’s financial leverage increased to 24.8 per cent from 23.8 per cent at the end of 2021  driven by a decrease in equity. Adjusted for the proposed dividend and ongoing buyback programme  the financial leverage amounted to 29.0 per cent (27.9). Sampo targets a financial leverage below 30 per cent.Sampo plc’s Annual General Meeting will be held on 18 May 2022. The Board has proposed on 9 February 2022 to the AGM a dividend of EUR 4.10 per share  of which the insurance dividend is EUR 1.70 per share.GROUP CEO’S COMMENTSampo’s first quarter performance proved resilient to the increase in economic and geopolitical uncertainty observed during the year  most notably in relation to the tragic and unjustified war in Ukraine. We have achieved excellent P&C underwriting results and our balance sheet remains solid  allowing the launch of a new buyback programme. In addition  we continued to execute on our strategic agenda by completing the exit from Nordea during April.Taking a closer look at P&C insurance  our largest operation  If P&C  delivered an excellent quarter. Premium growth stood at 7 per cent year-on-year even though new car sales declined by around 20 per cent across the Nordic region. Underlying margins were also robust  with a record-strong combined ratio of 80.8 per cent despite above-expected large losses and loss frequencies returning close to normal levels after pandemic related restrictions ended.The rise in energy and commodity prices triggered by the war in Ukraine has increased uncertainty over the trajectory of inflation  both in terms of broader consumer prices and with regard to the cost of insurance claims. We have continued to observe claims inflation at around three per cent in the Nordic region during 2022  broadly at the same level as at the end of 2021  helped by our multi-year procurement agreements. Nonetheless  given the eternal external environment we see potential upside risk to this figure as we progress through the year. Hence  we are pricing on the basis of prudent assumptions and working closely with customers to ensure that the right coverage is in place. Premium growth and retention have both been excellent across all If P&C’s business areas in the first quarter  which gives me confidence in our ability to navigate the operating environment.The interaction between Hastings and If P&C is intensifying; I see significant cultural overlap between the two organisations that will create value over time. In the first quarter  conditions in the UK motor market have been challenging  with elevated claims inflation putting pressure on underwriting margins. Hastings has remained disciplined in its pricing  increasing rates to cover rising claims costs  which has supported premium growth of 10 per cent. Meanwhile  the home insurance book has made excellent progress as policy count grew by 18 per cent year-on-year.Capital markets were volatile in the first quarter. Higher interest rates are having a positive economic effect on our business through increased reinvestment rates and lower liability values. Due to the short duration of our fixed income portfolio  we are relatively well positioned to rotate into higher yielding instruments. On the downside  wider credit spreads and a decline in equity markets had a negative impact on investment return in the first quarter.Sampo’s balance sheet has been resilient to the increase in uncertainty  as both capital and financial leverage have remained at or above target levels. Hence  we were able to launch a new EUR 250 million share buyback programme shortly after completing the EUR 750 million programme launched last year.On 29 April  Sampo reached a key milestone in its strategy by completing the exit from Nordea  thus becoming a pure insurance group. With a clearer focus for both management and shareholders  I am confident that we have a robust foundation for even stronger operational and value creation. The exit from Nordea also further increases the Group’s resilience by reducing our exposure to market risk. Following the sale  management intends to propose to the Board that a new share buyback programme is launched after the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2022.Looking to the rest of the year  I am optimistic about the performance of our excellent P&C operations and remain committed to our P&C insurance focused strategy.Torbjörn MagnussonGroup CEO and PresidentOUTLOOKOutlook for 2022Sampo Group’s P&C insurance operations are expected to achieve underwriting margins that meet the annual targets set for 2021-2023. At Group level  Sampo targets a combined ratio of below 86 per cent  while the target for its largest subsidiary  If P&C  is below 85 per cent. Hastings targets an operating ratio of below 88 per cent. Following strong performance in the first quarter  the outlook for If P&C’s 2022 combined ratio has been improved to 82–84 per cent.The combined and operating ratios of Sampo Group’s P&C insurance operations are subject to volatility driven by  among other factors  seasonal weather patterns  large claims  prior year development and fluctuations in claims frequency related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These effects are particularly relevant for individual segments and business areas  such as the Danish and UK operations.The mark-to-market component of investment returns will be significantly influenced by capital markets’ developments  particularly in life insurance.With regard to Topdanmark  reference is made to the profit forecast model that the company publishes on a quarterly basis.The major risks and uncertainties for the Group in the near-termIn its current day-to-day business activities Sampo Group is exposed to various risks and uncertainties  mainly through its major business units.Major risks affecting the Group companies’ profitability and its variation are market  credit  insurance and operational risks. At the Group level  sources of risks are the same  although they are not directly additive due to the effects of diversification.Uncertainties in the form of major unforeseen events may have an immediate impact on the Group’s profitability. The identification of unforeseen events is easier than the estimation of their probabilities  timing  and potential outcomes. After the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic a combination of fiscal and monetary stimulus  supply chain problems and elevated demand for consumer goods have led to high levels of inflation  with energy and product prices being particularly affected. More recently the war in Ukraine has created a new negative supply shock for the global economy depressing economic growth and further pushing up the prices of commodities and energy. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine are consequently currently causing significant uncertainties on economic and capital market development. There are also a number of widely identified macroeconomic  political and other sources of uncertainty which can  in various ways  affect the financial services industry in a negative manner.Other sources of uncertainty are unforeseen structural changes in the business environment and already identified trends and potential wide-impact events. These external drivers may have a long-term impact on how Sampo Group’s business will be conducted. Examples of identified trends are demographic changes  sustainability issues  and technological developments in areas such as artificial intelligence and digitalisation including threats posed by cybercrime.OTHER DEVELOPMENTSDividend proposalOn 9 February 2022  the Sampo Board proposed to the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 4.10 per share for the 2021 financial year. The dividend is proposed to be paid to the shareholders registered in the Register of Shareholders held by Euroclear Finland Oy as at the record date of 20 May 2022. The Board proposes that the dividends be paid on 31 May 2022. The full dividend proposal is available on www.sampo.com/agm.Effects of external events on Sampo GroupThe first quarter saw an increase in geopolitical uncertainty as Russia launched an invasion into neighbouring Ukraine. The Group has limited insurance exposures in the affected region through certain Nordic industrial lines clients and coverage is subject to war exclusions. On the asset side  Sampo has no material direct investments in Russia or Ukraine.Given the limited direct exposure  the biggest risk from the war in Ukraine to Sampo relates to second order capital markets and macroeconomic effects. The Group carries substantial market risk exposures via its strategic investments and through insurance company investment portfolios and liabilities  which may be adversely affected by market shocks. This risk taking is supported by financial buffers calibrated to withstand volatility  and Sampo operated above its target financial strength levels at the end of the first quarter of 2022.Macroeconomic effects could also have an impact on Sampo’s operational business  for example by reducing economic growth  aggravating supply chain problems and inflating commodity prices. These considerations are particularly relevant as supply chain disruption and high inflation had already become established prior to the invasion following the COVID-19 pandemic and associated monetary and fiscal stimulus programmes.In the Nordic and Baltic countries  COVID-19 effects in the quarter were materially below the levels observed over 2021. Motor claims frequencies were affected by pandemic-related restrictions in the first part of the quarter but later returned toward pre-pandemic levels. In the UK  motor claims frequencies have increased as restrictions were lifted but remain below pre-COVID-19 levels. Given the limited impact of COVID-19 and the increasing difficulty in reliably estimating associated effects  Sampo has decided not to provide any quantitative disclosure of COVID-19 effects in the first quarter.EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIODShare buyback programmeSampo’s share buyback programme announced on 30 March 2022 continued after the end of the reporting period. By Friday 29 April 2022 market close  the company had bought in total 2 851 150 Sampo A shares representing 0.53 per cent of the total number of shares in Sampo plc. The progress of the buyback programme can be followed on www.sampo.com/releases.Disposals of Nordea sharesSampo sold all of its remaining Nordea holding in April  after the end of the reporting period  through an accelerated bookbuild offering of 200 million shares on 29 April and the sale of 26 million shares in the open market. The transactions generated total gross proceeds of EUR 2.1 billion and will have a positive accounting effect of approximately EUR 82 million on Sampo’s consolidated statement of profit and loss.In connection with disclosing the results of the bookbuild offering  Sampo disclosed that management intends to propose to the Board that a new share buyback programme is launched after the Annual General Meeting on 18 May 2022  subject to the AGM renewing the Board authorisation on share repurchases.SAMPO PLCBoard of DirectorsFor more information  please contactKnut Arne Alsaker  Group CFO  tel. +358 10 516 0010Sami Taipalus  Head of Investor Relations  tel. +358 10 516 0030Maria Silander  Communications Manager  Media Relations  tel. +358 10 516 0031Conference callAn English-language conference call for investors and analysts will be arranged at 4 pm Finnish time (2 pm UK time).

The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.Previous outlookSuominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2022 will decrease from 2021. The main reasons are inventory levels which still remain high at certain customers as well as operational issues in the entire supply chain due to the current COVID-19 situation  both of which will impact the result negatively especially in the first quarter. In 2021  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.Story continuesPetri Helsky  President & CEO:“For Suominen the beginning of 2022 has been challenging as was expected. Certain key customers especially in the US continued to struggle with their inventory levels. Furthermore  in the early part of the year both our and our customers’ operations were affected by the omicron variant of the COVID-19. Both of these factors impacted our sales negatively. On the cost side we have seen further sharp increases in raw material  energy and freight costs. Due to the lag in our sales pricing mechanisms our pricing in the first quarter did not fully reflect these increases.We condemn the Russian invasion of Ukraine and we feel deeply for all Ukrainians whose lives have been devastated by Russia’s incredulous aggression. The war has minor direct impact to Suominen’s business as we have had no suppliers in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine and only very few customers in Russia. Since the war started  we have stopped all sales to Russia. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the invasion which contribute to the significant cost inflation mentioned above.Our net sales were EUR 110.3 million (115.3) in the first quarter. Sales volumes decreased from the COVID-19 boom levels while sales prices increased clearly following the higher raw material prices. Our quarterly EBITDA was EUR 3.3 million (18.5). The main reasons for the decline were the lower volumes and the timing gap between our customer pricing and raw material  energy and freight costs which increased even more than the sales prices.To improve our financial performance  we have launched an EBITDA improvement program to identify both new sales opportunities and cost savings initiatives. As an example of actions taken  we implemented an energy surcharge to all our products sold in Europe in mid-March. Also  as the inventory issues in the US are mainly related to a certain product group  we have been working to widen the product portfolio at the production lines especially affected by the inventory imbalance.In line with our vision to be the frontrunner in sustainable nonwovens we are continuously developing our sustainable product offering. During the quarter  we launched our first carbon neutral product BIOLACE® Zero. Our efforts in the sustainability area were also recognized at the IDEA®22 Conference with our HYDRASPUN® Aquaflo winning the Nonwoven Product Achievement Award.The near future continues to look challenging. The war in Ukraine has worsened the inflationary pressures in raw material  energy and freight costs and increased uncertainty overall. The inventory levels at our certain US key customers have remained elevated despite a decreasing trend supported by solid end consumer demand. However  we are more optimistic about the second half of the year. We are seeing signs of the raw material cost inflation moderating from the third quarter onwards and we also expect improved demand for our products through normalization of the US inventory levels and our portfolio widening actions mentioned above.NET SALESIn January–March 2022  Suominen’s net sales decreased by 4% from the comparison period to EUR 110.3 million (115.3). Sales volumes decreased while sales prices increased following the higher raw material prices. Currencies impacted net sales positively by EUR 4.6 million.Suominen has two business areas  Americas and Europe. Net sales of the Americas business area were EUR 61.7 million (71.9) and net sales of the Europe business area were EUR 48.5 million (43.4).EBITDA  OPERATING PROFIT AND RESULTEBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) declined to EUR 3.3 million (18.5). This was driven by lower sales volumes and the timing gap between the higher raw material  energy and freight costs and sales pricing.

This can impact Suominen’s financial performance depending on how the markets develop.Regarding the war in Ukraine  the direct impact to Suominen’s business is minor as we have very few customers and no suppliers in Russia  Belarus and Ukraine. Suominen as a company is mostly affected by the indirect economic impacts of the war which contribute to the cost inflation mentioned above.Also the COVID-19 pandemic can still cause uncertainty in Suominen’s business environment. The key risks related to the virus concern the health and safety of Suominen personnel and customers  possible shortages of raw materials and issues linked to logistics  as well as potential closures of customers’ or our own plants due to virus infections. Our customers have generally performed well financially even during the pandemic and thus our customer credit risks have not materially increased.Suominen’s other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: risks related to manufacturing  competition  raw material prices and availability and customer specific volumes and credits  changes in legislation  political environment or economic conditions and investments  and financial risks.A more detailed description of risks is available in Suominen’s Annual Report 2021 at suominen.fi/investors.BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTSuominen’s nonwovens are  for the most part  used in daily consumer goods  such as wet wipes as well as in hygiene and medical products. In these target markets of Suominen  the general economic situation determines the development of consumer demand  even though the demand for consumer goods is not very cyclical in nature. North America and Europe are the largest market areas for Suominen. In addition  the company operates in the South American markets. The growth in the demand for nonwovens has typically exceeded the growth of gross domestic product by a couple of percentage points.The market expectation is that in the long run the end user demand for wipes will remain above pre-COVID levels. However  the pandemic-caused demand spike followed by moderation of said demand has led to an inventory imbalance in the whole supply chain especially in the US which still partially persists.The war in Ukraine has worsened the inflationary pressures in raw material  energy and freight costs and increased uncertainty overall. However  we are seeing signs of the raw material cost inflation moderating from the third quarter onwards and we also expect normalization of the US inventory levels going forward.OUTLOOK FOR 2022Suominen expects that its comparable EBITDA (earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) in 2022 will decrease clearly from 2021. The war in Ukraine has increased the already significant cost inflation in raw materials  energy and transportation. Also  while there has been progress in the normalization of the customer inventory levels in the US  it has been somewhat slower than expected. These factors will impact the full year result negatively even though we expect that the demand for our products will improve in the second half of the year. In 2021  Suominen’s comparable EBITDA was EUR 47.0 million.CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEMENT AND REMUNERATION REPORTSuominen has prepared a separate Corporate Governance Statement and a Remuneration Report for2021  which comply with the recommendations of the Finnish Corporate Governance Code for listedcompanies.

Ordinance of the Ministry of Finance in Finland or alternative performance measures (cash flow from operations per share).Some of the other key ratios Suominen publishes are alternative performance measures. An alternative performance measure is a key ratio which has not been defined in IFRS standards. Suominen believes that the use of alternative performance measures provides useful information for example to investors regarding the Group's financial and operating performance and makes it easier to make comparisons between the reporting periods.The link between the components of the key ratios per share and the consolidated financial statements is presented in the consolidated financial statements of 2021. The link between the components of the alternative performance measures and the consolidated financial statements is presented in Suominen’s Annual Report for 2021.Calculation of key ratios per shareEarnings per shareBasic earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period. net of tax = Share-issue adjusted average number of shares excluding treasury sharesDiluted earnings per share (EPS)Profit for the period = Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury sharesEUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the period -2 336 13 774 20 734 Average share-issue adjusted number of shares 57 323 494 57 581 245 57 579 440 Average diluted share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 419 946 57 912 920 58 023 347 Earnings per share EUR Basic -0.04 0.24 0.36 Diluted -0.04 0.24 0.36Cash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations per shareCash flow from operations = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares. end of reporting period31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Cash flow from operations  EUR thousand -2 679 15 954 11 088 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 462 142 57 599 164 57 293 235 Cash flow from operations per share  EUR -0.05 0.28 0.19Equity per shareEquity per shareTotal equity attributable to owners of the parent = Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares. end of reporting period31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent  EUR thousand 153 504 152 227 163 199 Share-issue adjusted number of shares excluding treasury shares  end of reporting period 57 462 142 57 599 164 57 293 235 Equity per share  EUR 2.67 2.64 2.85Market capitalizationMarket capitalization = Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares x share price at the end of period31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares at the end of reporting period excluding treasury shares 57 462 142 57 599 164 57 293 235 Share price at end of the period  EUR 3.55 5.74 5.18 Market capitalization  EUR million 204.0 330.6 296.8Share turnoverShare turnover = The proportion of number of shares traded during the period to weighted average number of shares excluding treasury shares31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Number of shares traded during the period 7 195 433 7 004 147 17 714 203 Average number of shares excluding treasury shares 57 323 494 57 581 245 57 579 440 Share turnover  % 12.6 12.2 30.8Calculation of key ratios and alternative performance measuresOperating profit and comparable operating profitOperating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses Comparable operating profit (EBIT) = Profit before income taxes + net financial expenses. adjusted with items affecting comparabilityIn order to improve the comparability of result between reporting periods. Suominen presents comparable operating profit as an alternative performance measure. Operating profit is adjusted with material items that are considered to affect comparability between reporting periods. These items include  among others  impairment losses or reversals of impairment losses  gains or losses from the sales of property  plant and equipment or intangible assets or other assets and restructuring costs. Suominen did not have any items affecting comparability in 2022 or 2021.EBITDA and comparable EBITDAEBITDA is an important measure that focuses on the operating performance excluding the effect of depreciation and amortization  financial items and income taxes  in other words what is the margin on net sales after deducting operating expenses.EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment lossesComparable EBITDA = EBIT + depreciation  amortization and impairment losses  adjusted with items affecting comparabilityEUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Operating profit -1 268 13 592 26 941 + Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 4 566 4 942 20 092 EBITDA 3 298 18 534 47 033Gross capital expenditureEUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Increases in intangible assets 261 19 162 Increases in property  plant and equipment 1 508 5 207 17 609 Gross capital expenditure 1 768 5 226 17 771Interest-bearing net debtIt is the opinion of Suominen that presenting interest-bearing liabilities not only at amortized cost but also at nominal value gives relevant additional information to the investors.Interest-bearing net debt = Interest-bearing liabilities at nominal value - interest-bearing receivables - cash and cash equivalentsEUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 348 100 381 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 1 451 1 845 1 794 Cash and cash equivalents -97 046 -81 999 -101 357 Interest-bearing net debt 53 753 20 227 49 570 Interest-bearing liabilities 149 348 100 381 149 134 Tender and issuance costs of the debentures 1 451 1 845 1 794 Nominal value of interest-bearing liabilities 150 799 102 226 150 927Return on equity (ROE)  %Return on equity (ROE)  % = Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) x 100 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent (quarterly average)EUR thousand 31.3.2022 31.3.2021 31.12.2021 Profit for the reporting period (rolling 12 months) 4 625 40 344 20 734 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.3.2021 / 31.3.2020 / 31.12.2020 152 227 135 868 145 882 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.6.2021 / 30.6.2020 / 31.3.2021 159 386 138 551 152 227 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 30.9.2021 / 30.9.2020 / 30.6.2021 159 682 144 074 159 386 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.12.2021 / 31.12.2020 / 30.9.2021 163 199 145 882 159 682 Total equity attributable to owners of the parent 31.3.2022 / 31.3.2021 / 31.12.2021 153 504 152 227 163 199 Average 157 600 143 320 156 075 Return on equity (ROE)  % 2.9 28.1 13.3Invested capitalInvested capital = Total equity + interest-bearing liabilities – cash and cash equivalentsThe calculation formula for invested capital has been changed.

Ever since  our key priority has been to protect our personnel’s safety in Ukraine. We have provided our Ukrainian employees and their family members with transportation to neighboring Poland and Romania  as well as accommodation. To our knowledge  none of our employees has been hurt or has died as a result of Russia’s acts of war.Story continuesAspo’s business environment is looking quite different from our estimate in our financial statements release. It is obvious that the operating environment has changed dramatically in eastern markets  and Russia’s reprehensible invasion will have an enduring impact on business opportunities in the region.As announced previously  Aspo has decided to withdraw Leipurin’s operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. We will investigate strategic alternatives  also including the possible divestment of these businesses. The more detailed schedule and implementation of the process will be evaluated  and the process will be carried out addressing the company’s employees and customers  as well as local legislation. Telko’s ability to continue its operations in Russia has deteriorated  and the stricter sanctions have accelerated the adaptation of operations. Since the war broke out in Ukraine  the capital invested in Telko’s warehouse and receivables in Russia has decreased by roughly 30%. The investigation of strategic alternatives for Telko’s operations in Russia is being actively continued. The majority of ESL Shipping’s operations related to Russia has been suspended  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. All transportation operations related to Russia are expected to stop by the end of the year. Aspo’s management is closely monitoring the progress and impact of the crisis and will assess and carry out any further measures on a business-specific basis.Aspo’s financial results for the first quarter of 2022 can be regarded as excellent. The Group’s net sales increased by 23% to EUR 162.6 million. The growth target of 5–10% was significantly exceeded. Operating profit also increased significantly from the comparative period to EUR 10.1 million and 6.2%. The operating profit of Telko and Leipurin for the first quarter was particularly affected by their warehouses in Ukraine  which were destroyed as a result of Russia’s acts of war  and credit loss provisions associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine. Considering the Group as a whole  items affecting comparability totaled EUR -4.9 million during the first quarter. This also includes ESL Shipping’s sales gains of EUR 1.5 million  attributable to the sale of the barge Espa. The Group’s comparable operating profit for the first quarter was record-high at EUR 15.0 (7.9) million. The comparable operating profit was 9.2% (6.0%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Earnings per share increased to EUR 0.21 (0.19)  with the impact of items affecting comparability on earnings per share being approximately EUR -0.13. Net cash from operating activities remained at a very strong level. All this results from our personnel’s strong commitment and our operational successes in a very challenging market environment.Our strong result during the first quarter was particularly driven by ESL Shipping’s excellent performance. The shipping company’s net sales increased by 31% to EUR 56.8 (43.4) million  and its comparable operating profit was EUR 7.9 (4.5) million and 13.9% (10.4%)  nearly achieving the target level of 14.0%.Telko also continued its strong performance. Telko’s net sales increased by 31% to EUR 75.9 million  and its comparable operating profit was EUR 8.6 (4.6) million and 11.3% (7.9%)  exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Leipurin’s net sales remained at the comparative period’s level at EUR 27.7 (28.0) million. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit during the first quarter was EUR 0.7 (0.3) million and 2.5% (1.1%). The operating profit target set for Leipurin is 5%. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit without Vulganus was EUR 1.0 (0.5) million and operating profit rate 4.0% (1.9%).On March 2  2022  Aspo canceled its guidance for 2022 due to uncertainties caused by Russia’s acts of war and the resulting sanctions. Even though the exceptional circumstances caused by the war still involve significant uncertainties  we were already able to issue a new guidance at the beginning of April  according to which Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit will be EUR 27–34 million in 2022.Even though our operating environment has undergone dramatic changes  we will continue to determinedly implement our strategy published in December. According to the strategy  Aspo will focus on expanding its business in western markets. Decisions on solutions concerning operations in Russia will be made in a controlled manner  also considering the position of employees and any restrictions set by local legislation.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsOn December 1  2021  Aspo published new long-term financial targets:Operating profit of 8%Net sales growth 5–10% per yearReturn on equity of over 20%Gearing less than 130%With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%.Aspo’s net sales increased by 24% during the first quarter of 2022. The comparable operating profit rate was 9.2% (6.0%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained high at 21.2% (21.8%). Gearing decreased to 118.8% (129.4%).Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit from continuing and discontinued operationsAspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is presented less significant items affecting comparability that are rare and deviate from normal business operations. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by the war.Aspo announced in December 2021 that the Kauko business segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  have been defined as businesses outside Aspo’s core operations. As a result  the Kauko business segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in consolidated reporting in accordance with IFRS  and its results are reported separately from the figures of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. With regard to the income statement  comparative periods’ figures have been restated to correspond to the same presentation method. The results of Vulganus are reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.Net sales and operating profit margin  Group total 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales  Group total 162.6 132.4 586.4 Net sales  continuing operations 160.4 129.4 573.3 Net sales  discontinued operations 2.2 3.0 13.1 Operating profit  Group total 10.1 7.9 33.9 Operating profit  Group total  % 6.2 6.0 5.8 Items affecting comparability*) -4.9 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 15.0 7.9 42.4 Comparable operating profit  Group total  % 9.2 6.0 7.2Comparable operating profit  Group total 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR ESL Shipping  operating profit 9.2 4.5 26.8 Telko  operating profit 4.0 4.6 20.4 Leipurin  operating profit -0.4 0.3 -2.4 Other operations  operating profit -2.5 -1.6 -7.9 Operating profit from continuing operations 10.3 7.8 36.9 Operating profit from discontinued operations -0.2 0.1 -3.0 Operating profit  Group total 10.1 7.9 33.9 Items affecting comparability*) -4.9 -8.5 Comparable operating profit  Group total 15.0 7.9 42.4*) The items affecting the comparability of the first quarter of 2022  totaling EUR -4.9 million  consist of EUR 1.5 million in sales gains from ESL Shipping barge Espa  ESL Shipping’s cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the war in Ukraine  EUR -2.6 million in losses from the destruction of Telko’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -2.0 million associated with Telko’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  EUR -0.7 million in losses from the destruction of Leipurin’s warehouse in Ukraine  a credit loss provision of EUR -0.2 million associated with Leipurin’s accounts receivable in Ukraine  and EUR -0.2 million in Leipurin’s other business adaptation expenses in Russia. The operating result of other operations included the share-based payment of EUR -0.5 million granted to Aspo’s previous CEO.The items affecting the comparability of 2021  totaling EUR -8.5 million  included the impairment loss of EUR -4.3 million recognized on Leipurin’s goodwill during the final quarter  and the impairment loss and restoration provision of EUR -0.8 million recognized on the fixed assets of Telko’s terminal in Rauma  as well as the impairment loss of EUR -3.4 million recognized on Kauko’s goodwill during the third quarter  which is reported as part of the results of the discontinued operations.SustainabilitySustainability is a key factor in guiding Aspo’s management system and the process of investigating new investment objects. Aspo’s businesses aim to be forerunners in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) targets for the Group and significant parts of its businesses. The key goal is to reduce the emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. During the past 12 months  the emission intensity continued to improve  driven by business growth  and it was 0.39 (0.42). Another key target is to improve the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIF). During the past 12 months  LTIF was 7.6 (8.8)  while the target for 2022 is 7.0. The long-term goal is zero occupational accidents.The impact of the war in Ukraine on Aspo’s operating environmentAspo’s operating environment has changed dramatically in a short period of time. The European security environment has deteriorated as a result of Russia’s armed invasion of Ukraine. The invasion has caused direct losses for Aspo’s businesses through the destruction of warehouses in Ukraine  for example. The indirect impact on Aspo’s business operations includes the significant fluctuations in prices and exchange rates. Suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The war drastically reduces operating conditions in eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  but particularly based on values. The sanctions imposed by western countries and Russia’s legislative measures prevent the transportation of goods and the transfer of payments  rapidly reducing net sales and profitability. As the level of security has decreased  vessel operations have also been restricted and Russian products cannot be transported. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight. In western markets  Russia’s acts of war have only had a minor impact at present  while the impact on financial development  production and supply chains  and inflation will be significant.Russia accounts for less than 15% of the Group’s equity  and this share will continue to be actively reduced. Aspo’s assets in Russia are mainly related to inventories and trade receivables. The financial significance of small-scale production operations is very minor for the Group. Approximately 170 employees of Aspo Group’s all personnel work in Russia.In news  the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion  but its impact can still be felt in our operating environment. The global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on certain Aspo’s businesses  decelerating trading and the completion of orders. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations and especially among crew members.Net sales by market area  continuing operations 1-3/2022 Share 1-3/2021 Share Change MEUR % MEUR % % Finland 53.3 33 42.5 33 25 Scandinavia 28.6 18 24.7 19 16 Baltic countries 15.5 10 11.9 9 30 Russia  other CIS countries and Ukraine 40.3 25 35.0 27 15 Other countries 22.7 14 15.3 12 48 Total 160.4 100 129.4 100 24The Group’s main market areas are Finland  Scandinavia  the Baltic region  and eastern markets (Russia  other CIS countries  and Ukraine). The relative share of net sales in eastern markets decreased during the first quarter of 2022  mainly due to the war in Ukraine. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at western markets.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s cash flow from operating activities in January–March was EUR 15.2 (6.6) million. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -0.6 (-7.2) million. Free cash flow during the first quarter was EUR 13.8 (5.1) million.

The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the period was 31.4%(3/2021: 31.1%; 12/2021: 32.0%).Net financial expenses in January–March totaled EUR -1.8 (-0.9) million. The impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the increase in financial expenses was EUR -0.9 million. The average rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 1.3% (1.5%).The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents were EUR 41.3 million at the end of the review period (12/2021: EUR 17.7 million). Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40.0 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. EUR 20 million of Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program were in use (3/2021: EUR 8 million; 12/2021: EUR 5 million).On March 28  2022  Aspo announced that it will exercise its right to withdraw the full hybrid loan of EUR 20 million with 8.75% interest issued on April 30  2020. The hybrid loan was repaid on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsThe tensions between Russia and Ukraine that ignited in 2014 intensified until the beginning of this year and erupted in Russia’s armed invasion of Ukraine in February. The invasion has caused considerable human suffering and devastating destruction in Ukraine. Risks classified previously as geopolitical risks have materialized in various ways as material losses and threats directed at the personnel  as well as significant decreases in business in crisis areas. As a result of different sanctions  legislative obstacles and value-driven causes  it has become more difficult to engage in business in Russia  and no relief is in sight in the foreseeable future. Aspo’s businesses in Russia will be affected by the restrictions imposed due to the war  and it is possible that this will cause financial losses for Aspo. The impact will also extend to Aspo’s operations in Belarus and Kazakhstan. At present  it is impossible to estimate the duration or extent of Russia’s acts of war in Ukraine.Globally  there are many geopolitical risk clusters  the development of which is difficult to predict. Changes in these regions may be rapid and unpredictable  which is why it is difficult to estimate their potential impact on Aspo’s businesses. International sanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. In addition  various countries have imposed import bans or other trade restrictions on each other’s products. Geopolitical tensions can escalate and cause direct damage to business  payments and even suspend business operations in a crisis area or in areas affected by it. The crisis can also lead to human  economic and monetary losses. Possible sanctions  including counter-sanctions  and any changes in them could lead to business difficulties and economic losses.Increased economic activity has caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to increase rapidly  and increased uncertainties over the functioning of logistics in certain market situations. Aspo may temporarily benefit from this increase in prices  while the prices of purchased raw materials or leased capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes in different market situations  are also increasing risks. Growing inflation and rising interest rates may decelerate general economic growth and reduce demand for Aspo’s businesses. Furthermore  any non-functioning or restricted functioning of logistics due to sanctions or other causes may restrict Aspo’s businesses  and they may also be affected by cyber risks and disruptions in information systems.In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its steady results through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial investments and consequently may reduce solvency.The coronavirus pandemic continues to have an impact on Aspo’s businesses. Any new variants of coronavirus and their rapid spread may lead to various interruptions and financial losses.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation  they involve risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESSESESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk cargo company in the Baltic Sea region. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 48 vessels with a total capacity of 456 000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (75% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 23 vessels (23%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service.1-3/2022 1-3/2021 Change  % Net sales  MEUR 56.8 43.4 31 Operating profit  MEUR 9.2 4.5 104 Operating profit  % 16.2 10.4 Items affecting comparability  MEUR 1.3 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 7.9 4.5 76 Comparable operating profit  % 13.9 10.4The first quarter was yet again the strongest in ESL Shipping’s history. Net sales increased by 31% from the comparative period to EUR 56.8 (43.4) million. During the quarter  the operating profit more than doubled to a record-high level of EUR 9.2 (4.5) million. It includes sales gains of EUR 1.5 million attributable to the sale of the barge Espa and cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the shutdown of operations in Russia. The comparable operating profit increased significantly to EUR 7.9 (4.5) million.The strong result is a good indication of the effectiveness of the shipping company’s partnership strategy  and the entire personnel’s operational success in challenging operating conditions. The comparable operating profit rate of 13.9% (10.4%) achieved during the first quarter was excellent  considering the challenging ice conditions in the Bothnian Bay compared with previous years  and the target level of 14.0% was nearly achieved.As announced previously  the majority of ESL Shipping’s operations related to Russia has been suspended  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. All transportation operations in Russia are expected to stop by the end of the year at the latest. The schedule depends on any obligations set in existing customer contracts. ESL Shipping has also suspended the start-up of its previously established Russian company.The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories was historically strong during the first quarter. In contract traffic  demand for transportation remained strong throughout the review period  and market freight rates were at a high level in all customer segments and vessel categories. With regard to ship fuels  the price of diesel doubled and that of LNG  which suffered the most from disruptions in European energy markets  was nearly four times higher than in the comparative period  but the impact of the price increases on costs are offset through long-term fuel clauses in transportation agreements.The current level of very high fuel surcharges will increase net sales and reduce the operating profit rate  used as an indicator of relative profitability  even though no actual changes would take place in the absolute operating profit. The volume of cargo transported by the shipping company during the first quarter increased from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.5) million tonnes.The program for building the shipping company’s new next-generation low emission electric hybrid vessels has proceeded as planned  and the metal construction of the first vessel started in the middle of March. The vessels are expected to start operations from the third quarter of 2023 onwards at three-month intervals. The scheduled dockage of the current fleet continued when a larger vessel was docked for roughly one week during the first quarter.The long-term development of sustainability and the maintenance of a high level of safety are characteristic to the shipping company’s operations. ESL Shipping’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The shipping company aims to halve its carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. In this  the “Virtual arrival” model deployed by the shipping company plays a significant role  in which contractual practices for ship scheduling will be updated in cooperation with customers and ports to enable environmentally friendlier vessel operations. Savings in energy costs will be distributed between the shipping company and each customer so that both parties benefit from the new policy. During the first quarter  the emission intensity of ESL Shipping’s transportation operations decreased by 17% from the comparative period to 15.8 grams of carbon dioxide per ton mile.ESL Shipping outlook for 2022Demand for transportation and the price level of sea freights in the company’s main market area in Northern Europe are at a satisfactory level in all vessel categories. Most of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements. After deliveries of Russian raw materials stopped  certain of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers were forced to seek new suppliers for part of their production input required in new geographic areas. This is expected to extend transportation distances and increase demand for sea transportation per ton mile among ESL Shipping’s largest vessels.In the short term and especially during the second quarter  the volumes of raw materials transported by Handysize vessels will decrease from previous estimates  as customers’ procurement activities shift away from Russia. The timing of transportation volumes will also be affected by maintenance stoppages at ports and railroad maintenance in Northern Sweden. Restrictions on vessel sizes at ports in the company’s main market area and at its customers’ ports  combined with the need for year-round transportation  will again secure ESL Shipping’s transportation demand starting from the second half of the year when deliveries shipped from across the oceans to replace Russian raw materials reach Europe and are shipped further to customers.In the smaller vessel category  transportation demand in contract traffic is expected to remain at a satisfactory level. However  customers’ supply chains may involve challenges in the availability of raw materials that may also have an impact on realized product transportation volumes. Vessel rents that have partly increased to an unhealthy level are starting to decrease  and the availability of additional capacity is expected to improve during the second and third quarters. The determined preventive measures will continue to protect the personnel’s health security during the coronavirus pandemic.In Northern Europe  there continues to be considerable growth in interest among customers in environmentally friendly maritime transport that produces as low carbon emissions as possible. In addition to ESL Shipping’s investments in new highly environmentally friendly vessels  the shipping company is preparing long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide sea transportation with even lower carbon emissions  and even fossil-free transportation  in the future.With regard to the order placed for the Green Coaster electric hybrid vessels and its options  the shipping company is preparing investors’ entry in the ownership and operations of vessels within a pooling arrangement  which is a common practice in international shipping operations. The aim is to accelerate ESL Shipping’s operational growth and improve its profitability and return on capital.During the rest of 2022  two larger and four smaller vessel units will be docked for a total of approximately 95 days. In total  there will be approximately 105 dockage days in 2022. In 2021  the corresponding figure was 229. After these dockages  all vessels owned by ESL Shipping will be equipped with ballast water treatment systems that meet new environmental regulations.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants.

The operating result includes items affecting comparability of EUR -4.6 million relating to the destroyed warehouse in Ukraine and a credit loss provision associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine. Sales were significantly affected by the increase in prices after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine  which also raised sales margins to an unusually high level. Then again  exchange rate losses resulting from the steep decline in the value of the Russian ruble reduced the results. Without the items affecting comparability  Telko’s operating result for the first quarter was EUR 8.6 (4.6) million  and its operating profit rate was 11.3% (7.9%). Telko has focused on assisting its employees and their families in Ukraine  helping them evacuate  and providing accommodation for those fleeing the war. While sales have decreased steeply in Ukraine  Telko is committed to continuing its operations in the country.In Russia  Telko focuses on selling its existing stocks as announced previously. After the war broke out in Ukraine  the capital invested in Telko’s warehouse and receivables in Russia has decreased by roughly 30%. Telko’s ability to continue its operations in Russia has deteriorated  and stricter sanctions have accelerated the adaptation of operations. The investigation of strategic alternatives continues.In western markets  Telko’s sales developed as planned  and the Ukrainian crisis has not had any direct impact on operations. Demand remained stable in all of Telko’s business operations  while difficulties in availability continued to restrict the development of volumes in all operations. Prices remained high in all operations and even increased in several business areas. Telko has continued its growth efforts in western markets  which has had an impact on the increase in costs.The net sales of the plastics business increased by 22% during the first quarter to EUR 39.3 (32.1) million. The price level of plastics was clearly higher than during the comparative period in all product groups  and the average price of sales increased significantly. Prices partly reached a historically unusual level. While availability problems have decreased  challenges still remain in certain product groups. Customer demand was at a normal level. However  the high price levels of raw materials and energy have forced certain customers to temporarily restrict their production.The net sales of the chemicals business increased by 53% to EUR 25.3 (16.5) million. The exceptional demand in eastern markets and high price levels are reflected in the first quarter’s figures. In general  product prices increased in nearly all product groups in all markets. Delays in deliveries have been common. In addition  transportation prices are increasing clearly in Europe. Demand in key customer segments has remained stable  even though the high cost level is starting to affect companies’ operations.The net sales of the lubricants business increased by 20% to EUR 11.3 (9.4) million. Telko acquired all shares in Estonian Mentum AS at the end of 2021. As a result of the acquisition  Telko’s sales of lubricants increased significantly from the previous year. Prices of lubricants increased clearly during the beginning of the year. Availability issues have not been as significant as in other business areas. Telko has discontinued its small-scale lubricants business in Russia.Telko outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and its consequences have a significant impact on Telko’s outlook for the rest of the year. The outlook for the second quarter is relatively strong  driven by the strong increase in prices  while the outlook for the rest of the year is very uncertain due to the geopolitical situation and its broader impact on markets.In Russia  Telko focuses on actively reducing its working capital. As a result  sales are expected to remain strong during the next few months and decline steeply towards the end of the year. Telko will continue its operations in Ukraine  while sales are expected to remain very low and operations are expected to produce a loss this year.In general  product prices are expected to remain high as a result of increases in crude oil prices and prolonged difficulties in deliveries. Demand is expected to remain fairly strong. Production difficulties due to the availability of raw materials and components independent of Telko will have a negative impact on Telko’s certain customer groups. The war in Ukraine is expected to have an indirect impact on general cost levels  logistics and goods flows.Due to the steep decline in net sales in Russia and Belarus  Telko’s net sales are expected to decrease significantly towards the end of the year. The EU’s latest sanctions will accelerate this change. Of Telko’s businesses  the chemicals business has held the highest relative share in Russia.According to its strategy  Telko will seek not only organic growth in the western markets  but also acquisition targets that accelerate the achievement of the strategic goals set for Telko.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in eight countries that have been grouped into three regional organizations  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  East  and the Baltic region. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. Leipurin’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. Leipurin uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners.Vulganus Oy manufactures and maintains refrigeration and freezing solutions for the food industry through its spiral products. Vulganus has been classified as held for sale  but its results are still reported as part of the Leipurin segment.Leipurin 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 Change % Net sales  MEUR 27.7 28.0 -1 Operating profit  MEUR -0.4 0.3 -233 Operating profit  % -1.4 1.1 Items affecting comparability  MEUR -1.1 Comparable operating profit  MEUR 0.7 0.3 133 Comparable operating profit  % 2.5 1.1Leipurin’s net sales during the first quarter remained at the comparative period’s level at EUR 27.7 (28.0) million. During the comparative period  machine sales in Russia significantly increased net sales. In Finland  net sales increased by 14% to EUR 10.4 (9.1) million. In the Baltic region  net sales increased by 19% to EUR 8.0 (6.7) million. Net sales in East developed positively until the war broke out in Ukraine and increased by 3% to EUR 6.8 million (6.6) during the quarter. During the first quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 12% to EUR 18.2 (16.3) million. Sales to the food industry fell short of the target in the Baltic region and Ukraine  being EUR 2.6 (2.6) million. At the beginning of the year  the euro-denominated increase in sales was driven by the significantly grown global market prices of raw materials but  measured in kilograms  sales also increased to the pre-pandemic level. The cost of living increased significantly in Finland and the Baltic region  strengthening the shift in consumer demand toward more affordable products.The outbreak of the war in Ukraine during the last week of February drastically changed Leipurin’s operating environment. Leipurin prioritized the security and livelihood of its personnel in Ukraine. After the period under review  Leipurin decided to withdraw its operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. Leipurin will investigate strategic alternatives  also including the possible divestment of these businesses. The more detailed schedule and implementation of the process will be evaluated  and the process will be carried out addressing the company’s employees and customers  as well as local legislation. Leipurin will continue its operations in Ukraine.The impact of the coronavirus pandemic decreased significantly during the beginning of the year. The development of the sales margin was particularly positive  with the margin also exceeding the level preceding the outbreak of the pandemic in 2019.Leipurin’s operating result for the first quarter was EUR -0.4 (0.3) million  and the operating profit rate was -1.4% (1.1%). Losses of EUR -0.7 million from Leipurin’s warehouse destroyed in Ukraine and a credit loss provision of EUR -0.2 million associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine reduced Leipurin’s operating result for the first quarter. In addition  a provision of approximately EUR -0.2 million was recognized in relation to the company’s adaptation measures in Russia. These items affecting comparability totaled EUR -1.1 million. The comparable operating profit for the first quarter stood at EUR 0.7 (0.3) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.5% (1.1%).Rising market prices for steel raw materials  slow progress in after sales during the first part of the year and cost overruns in certain projects continued to significantly reduce the profitability of Vulganus Oy’s machine manufacturing operations. Vulganus’s net sales during the first quarter stood at EUR 2.5 (1.4) million  and its operating loss was EUR -0.3 (-0.2) million.The profit management program launched during the second quarter of 2021 will develop the capability of knowledge management and help to improve the commercial performance. Key tools include Group-wide category management and the improved efficiency of the supply chain and logistics. The management model already increased financial performance during 2021. The implementation of the program was particularly reflected in the positive development of results in Finland.Availability challenges still persist in different product categories. In Finland and the Baltic region  Leipurin has succeeded in using the post-pandemic recovery in demand. Sales measured in kilograms already exceeded the 2019 level  whereas they fell short of the level of the first quarter in 2019 in eastern markets.Leipurin outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and results.Increased energy prices will have a negative impact on demand for more valuable products  at least in the Baltic region. They will also cause profitability challenges for the bakery segment’s customers.The impact of the coronavirus pandemic and extreme weather conditions on global supply chains will be emphasized  affecting the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times. Raw material prices are increasing steeply.The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Leipurin will continue its profit management program  and it will contribute to further improve financial performance in western markets. The knowledge management program helps Leipurin control rising costs and purchase prices and foresee their impact on customer prices.Vulganus’s order book for 2022 has been confirmed to be excellent.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group’s administration  the financial and ICT service center  and a small number of other functions not covered by business units. The operating result for other operations was EUR -2.5 (-1.6) million in the first quarter. The share-based payment of EUR -0.5 million granted to Aspo’s previous CEO was included in the operating result of other operations. In addition  the difference from the comparative period can be explained by expert costs associated with various projects.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

As a result  the Kauko operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in group reporting in accordance with IFRS 5 standard  and its results and balance sheet items are reported separately from the continuing operations of Aspo Group. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures of the comparative periods have been restated. On the balance sheet  the assets of the Kauko operating segment are reported under “Assets held for sale” and liabilities under “Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale”. Vulganus Oy’s assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented similarly. In the statement of comprehensive income  Vulganus is reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  and the figures of the comparative period (3/2021) have not therefore been restated.Profit from discontinued operations 1-3/2022 1-3/2021 1-12/2021 MEUR MEUR MEUR Net sales 2.2 3.0 13.1 Materials and services -1.6 -2.2 -9.6 Employee benefit expenses -0.5 -0.4 -1.7 Depreciation  amortization and impairment losses 0.0 -3.5 Depreciation  leased assets 0.0 -0.1 Other operating expenses -0.3 -0.3 -1.2 Operating profit -0.2 0.1 -3.0 Profit before taxes -0.2 0.1 -3.0 Profit for the period -0.2 0.1 -3.0Profit from discontinued operations includes the income and expenses of Kauko operating segment  insofar as they are considered to transfer outside Aspo Group in conjunction with the divestment. Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations during the first quarter is EUR 0.1 (0.1) million higher than the Kauko operating segment’s profit. Vulganus Oy’s profit is included in the Leipurin segment’s profit.Asstes and liabilities classified as held for sale 1-3/2022 12/2021 MEUR MEUR Assets of discontinued operations 5.1 5.5 Other assets held for sale 3.9 2.9 Assets classified as held for sale  total 9.0 8 4 Liabilities of discontinued operations 3.9 4 9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale 2.2 1.9 Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale  total 6.1 6.8Assets and liabilities of discontinued operations include the figures of the Kauko segment.

The classification includes the share of the assets and liabilities of Aspo Group that belong to the Kauko operating segment and Vulganus Oy  excluding internal assets and liabilities that have been eliminated. Assets and liabilities have been measured at their carrying amount.

The majority of ESL Shipping's operations in Russia have been suspended and the ship capacity has been transferred to other traffic areas. All transports related to Russia are estimated to end by the end of the year. Telko continues to focus on selling the still existing inventories in Russia. Telko's conditions for continuing to operate in Russia have weakened significantly  and the tightened sanctions have accelerated the adjustment of operations.Aspo Plc’s Annual Shareholders’ Meeting held on April 6  2022  decided  as proposed by the Board of Directors  that EUR 0.23 per share be distributed in dividends for the 2021 financial year  and that no dividend be paid for shares held by Aspo Plc.

4187,Euroclear,Google API,https://coingeek.com/belgium-fsma-releases-registration-steps-for-digital-assets-firms/,Belgium’s FSMA releases registration steps for digital assets firms,1 day ago,Belgium  the European Union (EU) and NATO headquarters  is introducing a registration regime for digital assets firms. The Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) has introduced new guidelines for Virtual Assets Service Providers (VASPs) to get licensed in the country.The guideline outlined seven conditions for digital asset companies to meet to register. The first one is that the company must at least be incorporated as either a Belgian public limited company/cooperative society  a European company  or a cooperative society and have a minimum capital of EUR 50 000 (approximately $53 700).It follows that companies seeking registration will need to have registered corporate offices and central points of contact in Belgium. They also need to have effective management and sound and prudent shareholders.Similarly  they must also comply with Belgian laws to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. Fulfilling all these  digital asset companies are also required to meet all cybersecurity standards and make payments toward the FSMA’s operating cost in carrying out their regulatory duties.In a notice  the FSMA stated that the conditions went into force last May 1  and are binding on any legal person in Belgium that provides exchange services between digital currencies and legal currencies or custody wallet services.“As from 1 May 2022  any legal person established in Belgium that wants to provide exchange services between virtual currencies and legal currencies  or custody wallet services  within Belgium will have to register with the FSMA in advance ” the FSMA notice read.It adds that providers already operating on the date must notify the FSMA of their activity before July 1 and apply for registration before September 1.Digital assets adoption in BelgiumThe digital currency industry is well represented in the Western European country  with even some level of notoriety. Back in 2018  the FSMA published a list of suspicious digital assets investment firms to protect investors.Following subsequent updates  the list has over 120 such firms included. However  the warnings have not dampened the adoption of digital assets even among government circles and among the country’s population.Earlier this year  Christophe De Beukelaer  a Belgian member of parliament representing the city of Brussels  announced that he would accept his salary in Bitcoin all through 2022. A report by Triple-A revealed that an estimated 2.36% of all Belgians held digital currencies at the end of 2021.Meanwhile  the country’s financial sector has not been left out. Per a Reuters report  the Belgium-based securities settlement house  Euroclear  joined a consortium of banks building a blockchain-backed payments system called Fnality.Watch: CoinGeek New York presentation  Integrating Business Apps with BSV Blockchain: Europe’s First Large-Scale AdoptionNew to Bitcoin?

4188,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.finextra.com/newsarticle/40186/allen--overy-announces-sixth-cohort-for-fuse-innovation-hub,Allen & Overy announces sixth cohort for Fuse Innovation Hub,1 day ago,Allen & Overy’s Fuse innovation hub has announced members of its sixth cohort  and with 16 businesses tapped to join the Hub’s ranks  this year marks the largest cohort in Fuse’s history.Shruti Ajitsaria  Allen & Overy partner and head of Fuse  explains that the quality of applicants from over 25 countries was immensely high  and expects that the talent that comes from this cohort will continue to provide valuable solutions not only for Allen & Overy  but for the firm’s financial services clients into the future.“Fuse started off looking strictly at LegalTech  but we’ve always had the great privilege of speaking with people in banks’ strategic investment teams  or innovative areas such as their digital assets  crypto or blockchain focuses. As a result  what we have realised is that all of these areas are raising new and interesting questions that we  Allen & Overy  need to be at the forefront of  because our clients are investigating these concepts.”In addition to an open application process  Fuse also welcomes a selection of applications nominated by a handful of Allen & Overy’s clients. Ajitsaria notes that “as legal advisors  we need to learn alongside our clients and learn at the same pace with the same access to information  so that when they ask to understand their ability to use new technologies  we can provide legal advice that is grounded in reality and experiential practice.”Ajitsaria furthers that while the “all-star selection committee” boasts a formidable group of external members from the likes of Goldman Sachs  Microsoft Ventures  Meta  and BT  the vital factor in the selection process is ensuring that there is strong upfront buy-in from Allen & Overy partners. “The partners need to know that the businesses we invest time and effort in  are going to make a difference to their work.”The innovation hub boasts an impressive portfolio of alumni  notable members including Avvoka  Draftwise  Definely  and the sustainable finance tech platform  Greenomy.Greenomy will be returning to Fuse for a second year as an alumni member in 2022  explains Anna Blake  sustainability analyst at the company.The Belgium-based firm is a 2021 Fuse alumni and has since won the 2021 G20 Techsprint for the ‘Data collection  verification and sharing’ category  was admitted to the FCA’s Digital Sandbox  and also received (an undisclosed) investment from Euroclear earlier this year.Blake comments: “Over the past year  the Fuse innovation hub has provided Greenomy with excellent training and growth opportunities  including administering advice on how to create and execute a successful pitch and holding conversations around the most effective ways in which to refine  develop  and promote our solution to the UK market.”Blake elaborates that as sustainable finance regulation is booming  there is a regulatory demand for corporates and financial market participants to fulfil more and more disclosure requirements. “Considering its excellent market knowledge  A&O is the best partner to understand this new segment  and Fuse offers us an experimental haven to help develop and promote solutions to corporates  asset managers  and credit institutions that are facing these new reporting burdens.”Greenomy is currently working on updating their solution to incorporate the UK Taxonomy  with the objective of introducing it to the UK market one month after the introduction of legislation  which is currently being drafted. “The fuse innovation hub has given us the exposure to trial our pilot solution with UK customers and to ensure it is ready for them to navigate the maze of the new UK Taxonomy once it is released.”From over 130 applicants  the new LegalTech companies selected to join Fuse include:CUBE - Helps regulated institutions by using AI to capture  track and analyse complex  multijurisdictional and multilingual regulatory data.Eperoto - Helps dispute resolution teams to perform risk-value assessments by utilising decision theory. It clearly shows the risks and rewards of legal proceedings compared with a negotiated settlement.Everchron - Helps litigation and arbitration teams to collaborate on matters via use of a centralised platform.Legalme - Helps claimants and their lawyers automate housing disrepair claims  improving resolution outcomes and allowing timely and effective client support.

These purposes may include  but are not limited to: •working capital; ​ •capital expenditures; ​ •acquisitions; and ​ •the repayment  refinancing  redemption or repurchase of indebtedness or other securities. ​ Pending any specific application  we may initially invest funds in short-term marketable securities or apply them to the reduction of other short-term indebtedness.5TABLE OF CONTENTS​DESCRIPTION OF CAPITAL STOCK Set forth below is a description of the material terms of our capital stock. The following description is only a summary. This summary does not purport to be complete  or to give full effect to  the provisions of statutory or common laws  and is subject to  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the terms and detailed provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designation) and our amended and restated bylaws. We urge you to read these documents. Please read “Where You Can Find More Information.” Authorized Capital Stock At May 2  2022  our authorized capital consisted of: •1 800 000 000 shares of common stock  par value $0.10 per share  of which approximately 805 805 000 were outstanding  and ​ •5 000 000 shares of preferred stock  par value $0.10 per share  issuable in series  of which no shares were issued and outstanding. ​ Common Stock Holders of common stock may receive dividends if and when declared by our board of directors. The payment of dividends on our common stock may be limited by obligations to holders of any preferred stock and covenants contained in debt agreements. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters submitted to them. Cumulative voting of shares is prohibited  meaning that the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares voting for the election of directors can elect all directors to be elected if they choose to do so. Our common stock has no preemptive rights and is not convertible  redeemable or assessable  or entitled to the benefits of any sinking fund. If we liquidate or dissolve our business  the holders of common stock will share ratably in all assets available for distribution to stockholders after creditors are paid and preferred stockholders receive their distributions. All issued and outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. Any shares of common stock we offer under this prospectus will be fully paid and nonassessable. In October 2021  in connection with the merger involving Cimarex  we effectively assumed the obligations associated with Cimarex’s preferred stock  par value $0.01 per share  designated as 8 1/8% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Cimarex Preferred Stock”). Each holder of Cimarex Preferred Stock has the right at any time  at its option  to convert any or all of such holder’s shares of Cimarex Preferred Stock at an initial conversion rate of 34.1008 shares of fully paid and nonassessable shares of our common stock and $471.3975 in cash per share of Cimarex Preferred Stock. The initial conversion rate of 34.1008 adjusts upon the occurrence of certain events  including the payment of cash dividends to our common stockholders  and is 36.24997 as of March 31  2022. Additionally  beginning on and continuing after October 15  2021  Cimarex has the right  at its option  if the closing sale price of our common stock meets certain criteria  to elect to cause all  and not part  of the outstanding shares of Cimarex Preferred Stock to be converted into that number of shares of our common stock for each eligible share of Cimarex Preferred Stock equal to the conversion rate in effect on the mandatory conversion date as such terms are defined in the Certificate of Designations for the Cimarex Preferred Stock and $471.3975 in cash per share of Cimarex Preferred Stock. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE and trades under the symbol “CTRA.” Preferred Stock The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series. Our board of directors may establish attributes of any series  including  without limitation  the designation and number of shares in the series  dividend rates6TABLE OF CONTENTS(cumulative or noncumulative)  conversion rights  redemption rights  voting rights  and any other rights and qualifications  preferences and limitations or restrictions on shares of a series. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us without any vote or action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of shares of common stock. The specific terms of a particular series of preferred stock will be described in a certificate of designation relating to that series. This summary of the undesignated preferred stock discusses terms and conditions that we expect may apply to any series of the preferred stock that may be offered under this prospectus. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the particular terms of each series of preferred stock actually offered. If indicated in the prospectus supplement  the terms of any series may differ from the terms described below. We expect the prospectus supplement for any preferred stock that we actually offer pursuant to this prospectus to include some or all of the following terms: •the designation of the series of preferred stock; ​ •the number of shares of preferred stock offered  the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of the preferred stock; ​ •the dividend rate or rates of the shares  the method or methods of calculating the dividend rate or rates  the dates on which dividends  if declared  will be payable  and whether or not the dividends are to be cumulative and  if cumulative  the circumstances in which dividends shall be cumulative; ​ •the amounts payable on shares of the preferred stock in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation  dissolution or winding up; ​ •the redemption rights and price or prices  if any  for the shares of preferred stock; ​ •the terms  and the amount  of any sinking fund or analogous fund providing for the purchase or redemption of the shares of preferred stock; ​ •any restrictions on our ability to make payments on any of our capital stock if dividend or other payments are not made on the preferred stock; ​ •any voting rights granted to the holders of the shares of preferred stock in addition to those required by Delaware law or our restated certificate of incorporation; ​ •whether the shares of preferred stock will be convertible into shares of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock  and  if convertible  the conversion price or prices  and any adjustment or other terms and conditions upon which the conversion shall be made; ​ •any other rights  preferences  restrictions  limitations or conditions relative to the shares of preferred stock permitted by Delaware law or our restated certificate of incorporation; ​ •any listing of the preferred stock on any securities exchange; and ​ •if appropriate  a discussion of material United States federal income tax considerations. ​ Subject to our restated certificate of incorporation and to any limitations imposed by any then outstanding preferred stock  we may issue additional series of preferred stock  at any time or from time to time  with such powers  preferences  rights and qualifications  limitations or restrictions as our board of directors determines  and without further action of the stockholders  including holders of our then outstanding preferred stock  if any. Limitation on Directors’ Liability Delaware has adopted a law that allows corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for breach of directors’ fiduciary duty of care. The duty of care requires that  when acting on behalf of the corporation  directors must exercise an informed business judgment based on all material information reasonably available to them. Absent the limitations allowed by the law  directors are accountable to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for acts of gross negligence. Although Delaware law does not change directors’ duty of care  it7TABLE OF CONTENTSallows corporations to limit available relief to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission. Our restated certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by this law. Specifically  our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director  except for liability: •for any breach of their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders; ​ •for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; ​ •under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; or ​ •for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. ​ This limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors  and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care  even though such an action  if successful  might otherwise have benefited our stockholders. Effects of Certain Provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware Law Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control or the removal of existing management  of deterring potential acquirors from making an offer to our stockholders and of limiting any opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices for our common stock in connection therewith. This could be the case notwithstanding that a majority of our stockholders might benefit from such a change in control or offer. Advance Notice for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations Our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions requiring that advance notice be delivered to us of any business to be brought by a stockholder before an annual meeting of stockholders and providingfor certain procedures to be followed by stockholders in nominating persons for election to our board of directors. Generally  the advance notice provisions provide that the stockholder must give written notice to our Secretary not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting  except that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date  notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting (or  if less than 100 days’ prior notice or public announcement of the scheduled meeting date is given or made  then the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which the notice of such meeting was mailed to our stockholders or the day on which such public announcement was made). The notice must set forth specific information regarding that stockholder and that business or director nominee  as described in our amended and restated bylaws. Proxy Access Our amended and restated bylaws permit a stockholder  or a group of up to 20 stockholders (with a group of any two or more funds that are under common management and investment control constituting a single stockholder)  owning 3% or more of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in our proxy materials director candidates constituting up to 20% of our board of directors (or  if such amount is not a whole number  the closest whole number below 20%)  provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the amended and restated bylaws and subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in the amended and restated bylaws. Vacancies on the Board of Directors Our amended and restated bylaws provide that vacancies on the board of directors arising through death  resignation  retirement or removal shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office whether or not the remaining directors constitute a quorum.8TABLE OF CONTENTSStockholder Action by Written Consent Our amended and restated bylaws permit stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders act by written consent must by written notice request our board of directors fix a record date. No written consent will be effective unless  within 60 days of the record date established by our board of directors  a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to us in the manner prescribed by our amended and restated bylaws. Special Meetings of Stockholders Our amended and restated bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called at any time only by our chairman  our chief executive officer  our president or our board of directors. The only business that may be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders is that business specified in the notice of the meeting. Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute As a Delaware corporation  we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”). In general  Section 203 prevents us from engaging in a business combination with an “interested stockholder” ​(generally  a person owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock) for three years following the time that person becomes a 15% stockholder unless either: •before that person became a 15% stockholder  our board of directors approved the transaction in which the stockholder became a 15% stockholder or approved the business combination; ​ •upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder’s becoming a 15% stockholder  the stockholder owns at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction began (excluding stock held by directors who are also officers and by employee stock plans that do not provide employees with the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer); or ​ •after the transaction in which that person became a 15% stockholder  the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a stockholder meeting by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the 15% stockholder. ​ Under Section 203  these restrictions also do not apply to certain business combinations proposed by a 15% stockholder following the disclosure of an extraordinary transaction with a person who was not a 15% stockholder during the previous three years or who became a 15% stockholder with the approval of a majority of our directors. This exception applies only if the extraordinary transaction is approved or not opposed by a majority of our directors who were directors before any person became a 15% stockholder in the previous three years  or the successors of these directors. Exclusive Forum for Adjudication of Disputes Our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum  the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf  (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director  officer  other employee or agent of ours to us or our stockholders  including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty  (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated bylaws or restated certificate of incorporation (as either may be amended from time to time) or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or asserting an “internal corporate claim” ​(as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL) . In addition  unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum  the Federal District Courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Under the Securities Act  federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act  and stockholders cannot waive compliance with9TABLE OF CONTENTSthe federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims  Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Although we believe these provisions are beneficial by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law or U.S. securities laws in the types of lawsuits to which they apply  the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers or against us. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws related to choice of forum. The enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings  and it is possible that  in connection with one or more actions or proceedings described above  a court could rule that this provision in our amended and restated bylaws is inapplicable or unenforceable.

A copy of the Indenture  which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part  is incorporated herein by reference.

Additional or different provisions that are applicable to a particular series of debt securities will  if material  be described in a prospectus supplement relating to the offering of debt securities of that series. These provisions may include  among other things and to the extent applicable  the following: •the title of the debt securities; ​ •the extent  if any  to which the debt securities are subordinated in right of payment to other indebtedness of Coterra; ​ •any limit on the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities; ​ •the persons to whom any interest on the debt securities will be payable  if other than the registered holders thereof on the regular record date therefor; ​ •the date or dates on which the principal of the debt securities will be payable; ​ •the rate or rates at which the debt securities will bear interest  if any  and the date or dates from which interest will accrue; ​ •the dates on which interest will be payable and the regular record dates for interest payment dates; ​ •the place or places where the principal of and any premium and interest on the debt securities will be payable; ​ •the period or periods  if any  within which  and the price or prices at which  the debt securities may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at our option; ​ •our obligation  if any  to redeem or purchase the debt securities pursuant to sinking fund or similar provisions and the terms and conditions of any such redemption or purchase; ​ •the denominations in which the debt securities will be issuable  if other than denominations of $2 000 and any integral multiple of $1 000 in excess thereof; ​ •the currency  currencies or currency units  if other than currency of the United States of America  in which payment of the principal of and any premium or interest on the debt securities will be payable  and the terms and conditions of any elections that may be made available with respect thereto; ​ •any index or formula used to determine the amount of payments of principal of and any premium or interest on the debt securities; ​ •whether the debt securities are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more global securities and  if so  the identity of the depositary  if any  for the global securities; ​ •whether the debt securities are to be issued under Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act and  in such case  any provisions unique to such issuance including any transfer restrictions or exchange and registration rights; ​ •the terms and conditions  if any  pursuant to which the debt securities are convertible into or exchangeable for the common stock or other securities of Coterra or any other person; ​ •the principal amount (or any portion of the principal amount) of the debt securities which will be payable upon any declaration of acceleration of the maturity of the debt securities pursuant to an event of default; ​12TABLE OF CONTENTS•the applicability to the debt securities of the provisions described in “— Defeasance” below; and ​ •any other terms applicable to that series in accordance with the Indenture  which could be different from those described in this prospectus. ​ We may issue debt securities at a discount from their stated principal amount. Federal income tax considerations and other special considerations applicable to any debt security issued with original issue discount (an “original issue discount security”) may be described in an applicable prospectus supplement. If the purchase price of any series of the debt securities is payable in a foreign currency or currency unit or if the principal of or any premium or interest on any series of the debt securities is payable in a foreign currency or currency unit  the restrictions  elections  general tax considerations  specific terms  and other information with respect to the debt securities and the applicable foreign currency or currency unit will be set forth in an applicable prospectus supplement. Unless otherwise indicated in an applicable prospectus supplement: •the debt securities will be issued only in fully registered form (without coupons) in denominations of $2 000 and any integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof; and ​ •payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities will be payable  and the exchange  conversion  and transfer of debt securities will be registrable  at our office or agency maintained for those purposes and at any other office or agency maintained for those purposes. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of the debt securities  but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith. ​ Form of Debt Securities We will issue each debt security only in registered form  without coupons  unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement. In addition  we will issue each debt security in global (i.e.  book-entry) form only  unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement. Debt securities in book-entry form will be represented by a global security registered in the name of a depositary  which will be the holder of all the debt securities represented by the global security. Those who own beneficial interests in a global debt security will do so through participants in the depositary’s securities clearance system  and the rights of these indirect owners will be governed solely by the applicable procedures of the depositary and its participants. References to “holders” in this section mean those who own debt securities registered in their own names  on the books that we or the Trustee maintain for this purpose  and not those who own beneficial interests in debt securities registered in street name or in debt securities issued in book-entry form through one or more depositaries. Book-Entry Procedures Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement  the following is a summary of the depositary arrangements applicable to debt securities issued in global form and for which the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) acts as a depositary. We have provided the following descriptions of the operations and procedures of DTC  Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking  société anonyme (“Clearstream”) solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of DTC  Euroclear and Clearstream and are subject to change by them from time to time. Neither we  any underwriters or the Trustee takes any responsibility for these operations or procedures  and you are urged to contact DTC  Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants directly to discuss these matters. Each global debt security will be deposited with  or on behalf of  DTC  as depositary  or its nominee  and registered in the name of a nominee of DTC. Except under the limited circumstances described below  global debt securities are not exchangeable for definitive certificated debt securities. Ownership of beneficial interests in a global debt security is limited to institutions that have accounts with DTC or its nominee  or persons that may hold interests through those participants. In addition  ownership13TABLE OF CONTENTSof beneficial interests by participants in a global debt security will be evidenced only by  and the transfer of that ownership interest will be effected only through  records maintained by DTC or its nominee for a global debt security. Ownership of beneficial interests in a global debt security by persons that hold those interests through participants will be evidenced only by  and the transfer of that ownership interest within that participant will be effected only through  records maintained by that participant. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the debt securities. Beneficial owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase  but beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction  as well as periodic statements of their holdings  from the participants through which the beneficial owners entered the transaction. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of securities they purchase in definitive form. These laws may impair your ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global debt security. We will make payment of principal of  and interest on  debt securities represented by a global debt security registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee to DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  as the registered owner and holder of the global debt security representing those debt securities. DTC has advised us that upon receipt of any payment of principal of  or interest on  a global debt security  DTC will immediately credit accounts of participants on its book-entry registration and transfer system with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective interests in the principal amount of that global debt security  as shown in the records of DTC. Payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global debt security held through those participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices  as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name ” and will be the sole responsibility of those participants  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements that may be in effect from time to time. Neither we  the Trustee nor any of our respective agents will be responsible for any aspect of the records of DTC  any nominee or any participant relating to  or payments made on account of  beneficial interests in a permanent global debt security or for maintaining  supervising or reviewing any of the records of DTC  any nominee or any participant relating to such beneficial interests. A global debt security is exchangeable for definitive debt securities registered in the name of  and a transfer of a global debt security may be registered to  any person other than DTC or its nominee  only if: •DTC notifies us that it is unwilling  unable or has ceased to be a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and we do not appoint another institution to act as depositary within 90 days; or ​ •we notify the Trustee that we wish to terminate that global security. ​ Any global debt security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence will be exchangeable in whole for definitive debt securities in registered form  of like tenor and of an equal aggregate principal amount as the global debt security  in denominations specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  if other than $2 000 and multiples of $1 000. The definitive debt securities will be registered by the registrar in the name or names instructed by DTC. We expect that these instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from its participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the global debt security. Except as provided above  owners of the beneficial interests in a global debt security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of debt securities in definitive form and will not be considered the holders of debt securities for any purpose under the Indenture. No global debt security shall be exchangeable except for another global debt security of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. Accordingly  each person owning a beneficial interest in a global debt security must rely on the procedures of DTC and  if that person is not a participant  on the procedures of the participant through which that person owns its interest  to exercise any rights of a holder under the global debt security or the Indenture. We understand that  under existing industry practices  in the event that we request any action of holders  or an owner of a beneficial interest in a global debt security desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the debt securities or the Indenture  DTC would authorize the participants14TABLE OF CONTENTSholding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action. Additionally  those participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through those participants to give or take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York  a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code  and a “clearing agency” registered under the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities of its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants in securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants. By doing so  DTC eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations  and certain other organizations. DTC is owned by a number of its participants and by the New York Stock Exchange  Inc. and NYSE Amex Equities. Access to DTC’s book-entry system is also available to others  such as banks  brokers  dealers  and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant  either directly or indirectly. The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC. Investors may hold interests in the debt securities outside the U.S. through Euroclear or Clearstream if they are participants in those systems  or indirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s names on the books of their respective depositaries  which in turn will hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Euroclear has advised us that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for participants of Euroclear (“Euroclear Participants”) and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear includes various other services  including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by the Euroclear S.A./N.V. (the “Euroclear Operator”)  under contract with Euroclear Clearance Systems S.C.  a Belgian cooperative corporation (the “Cooperative”). All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator  and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator  not the Cooperative. The Cooperative establishes policy for Euroclear on behalf of Euroclear Participants. Euroclear Participants include banks (including central banks)  securities brokers and dealers  and other professional financial intermediaries and may include any agents. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear Participant  either directly or indirectly. Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear  the related Operating Procedures of Euroclear  and applicable Belgian law (collectively  the “Terms and Conditions”). The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear  withdrawals of securities and cash within Euroclear  withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear  and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear Participants and has no record of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear Participants. Distributions with respect to debt securities held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear Participants in accordance with the Terms and Conditions  to the extent received by the U.S. depositary for Euroclear. Clearstream has advised us that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for its participating organizations (“Clearstream Participants”) and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Clearstream Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Participants  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to Clearstream Participants  among other things  services for safekeeping  administration  clearance  and settlement of internationally traded securities and15TABLE OF CONTENTSsecurities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. As a professional depositary  Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Monetary Institute. Clearstream Participants are recognized financial institutions around the world  including agents  securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations  and certain other organizations and may include any agents. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others  such as banks  brokers  dealers  and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream Participant either directly or indirectly. Distributions with respect to debt securities held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream Participants in accordance with its rules and procedures  to the extent received by the U.S. depositary for Clearstream. Secondary market trading between Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and will be settled using the procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in immediately available funds. Cross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC  on the one hand  and directly or indirectly through Euroclear or Clearstream participants  on the other  will be effected within DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its U.S. depositary; however  such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will  if the transaction meets its settlement requirements  deliver instructions to its U.S. depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving debt securities in DTC  and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective U.S. depositaries. Because of time-zone differences  credits of securities received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits  or any transactions in the securities settled during such processing  will be reported to the relevant Euroclear participants or Clearstream participants on that business day. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of securities by or through a Euroclear participant or a Clearstream participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the business day of settlement in DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC. Although DTC  Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of debt securities among participants of DTC  Euroclear and Clearstream  they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures and they may discontinue the procedures at any time. Certain Covenants Maintenance of Office or Agency We will be required to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan  City of New York  or  if different  in each place of payment for each series of debt securities for notice and demand purposes and for the purposes of presenting or surrendering debt securities for payment  registration of transfer  or exchange. Paying Agents If we act as our own paying agent with respect to any series of debt securities  on or before each due date of the principal of or interest on any of the debt securities of that series  we will be required to segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to payment a sum sufficient to pay the amount due and to notify the Trustee promptly of our action or failure to act. If we have one or more paying agents for any series of debt securities  prior to each due date of the principal of or interest on any debt securities of that16TABLE OF CONTENTSseries  we will be required to deposit with a paying agent a sum sufficient to pay the amount due and  unless the paying agent is the Trustee  to promptly notify the Trustee of our action or failure to act. All moneys paid by us to a paying agent for the payment of principal of (or premium  if any) or interest on any debt securities that remain unclaimed for two years after the principal (or premium  if any) or interest has become due and payable may be repaid to us  and thereafter the holder of those debt securities may look only to us for payment thereof. Corporate Existence We will be required to preserve and keep in full force and effect our corporate existence  charter rights  statutory rights  licenses and franchises; provided that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right  license or franchise if the Company shall determine that such preservation is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company. Compliance Certificate The Company will be required to file annually with the Trustee a certificate signed by two of its officers  stating whether or not the officers know of any default by the Company in compliance with any provision of the Indenture. Merger and Consolidation The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into  or convey  transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets on a consolidated basis to  any Person  unless: (1)the resulting  surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a company  corporation  partnership  trust or limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America  any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume  by supplemental indenture  executed and delivered to the Trustee  all the obligations of the Company under the debt securities of any series and the Indenture; provided that if the Successor Company is not a corporation  a corporate wholly owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the United States of America  any State thereof or the District of Columbia shall become a co-issuer of such debt securities; ​ (2)immediately after giving effect to such transaction  no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and ​ (3)the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel  each stating that such consolidation  merger  sale  conveyance  transfer or lease  and such supplemental indenture (if any)  comply with the Indenture and that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with. ​ For purposes of the foregoing  the sale  lease  conveyance  transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more subsidiaries of the Company  which properties and assets  if held by the Company instead of such subsidiaries  would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis  shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis. The predecessor Company will be released from its obligations under the Indenture and the Successor Company will succeed to  and be substituted for  and may exercise every right and power of  the Company under the Indenture  but  in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets  the predecessor Company will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the debt securities of any series. Events of Default The following are Events of Default under the Indenture with respect to debt securities of any series: (1)default in any payment of interest on any debt security of that series when due and the continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; ​17TABLE OF CONTENTS(2)default in the payment of principal of or premium  if any  on any debt security of that series when due at its stated maturity or by declaration of acceleration  call for redemption or otherwise; ​ (3)failure to make any sinking fund payment when and as due by the terms of any debt security of that series and the continuance of such default for a period of 60 days; ​ (4)failure by the Company to perform or comply with any other covenant (other than a covenant or a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere specifically dealt with as an event of default or which has been expressly included in the Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of debt securities other than that series) for a period of 90 days after written notice thereof has been given to us as provided in the Indenture; ​ (5)specified events of bankruptcy  insolvency  or reorganization involving the Company; and ​ (6)any other Event of Default provided with respect to debt securities of that series. ​ Pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act  the Trustee is required to give to the holders of the debt securities of that series notice of all defaults known to it within 90 days of the occurrence thereof  except that other than in the case of a default of the character contemplated in clause (1)  (2)  or (3) above  the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as it in good faith determines that the withholding of notice is in the interests of the holders of the debt securities of that series. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs  the principal of  and accrued interest  if any  on the debt securities of that series will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder of the debt securities of that series. If any other Event of Default with respect to debt securities of any series occurs and is continuing  either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may declare the principal amount of  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on all debt securities of that series to be due and payable immediately. However  at any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to debt securities of any series has been made  but before a judgment or decree based on such acceleration has been obtained  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may  under specified circumstances  rescind and annul such acceleration. See “— Amendments and Waivers” below. Subject to the duty of the Trustee to act with the requisite standard of care during an Event of Default  the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of debt securities of any series unless such holders have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs  expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal  premium  if any  or interest when due  no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the debt securities of any series unless: (1)such holder has previously given the Trustee notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of that series; ​ (2)holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy in respect of such Event of Default; ​ (3)such holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss  liability or expense; ​ (4)the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and ​ (5)the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series have not given the Trustee a direction that is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. ​ Subject to certain restrictions  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series are given the right to direct the time  method and place of conducting any proceeding18TABLE OF CONTENTSfor any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture provides that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing  the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee  however  may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture  the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Any additional Events of Default with respect to any series of debt securities  and any variations from the foregoing Events of Default applicable to any series of debt securities  will be described in an applicable prospectus supplement. An event of default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default for any other series issued under the Indenture. Subordination The prospectus supplement  if any  relating to any offering of subordinated debt securities will describe the specific subordination provisions  including the extent of subordination of payments by the Company of the principal of  premium  if any  on and interest on such subordinated debt securities. Amendments and Waivers Subject to certain exceptions  the Indenture and the debt securities of any series may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all of the debt securities at the time outstanding (voting as a single class) or  if the amendment or supplement affects the debt securities of fewer than all of such series of debt securities  by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all such series affected by the amendment or supplement  with the debt securities of all the affected series voting together as a single class for this purpose (including without limitation  consents obtained in connection with a purchase of  or tender offer or exchange offer for  such debt securities) and  subject to certain exceptions  any past default or compliance with any provisions may be waived with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the debt securities at the time outstanding (voting as a single class) or  if the waiver of compliance with provisions affects the debt securities of fewer than all of such series of debt securities  by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all such series affected by the waiver  with the debt securities of all the affected series voting together as a single class for this purpose (including waivers obtained in connection with a purchase of  or tender offer or exchange offer for  such debt securities). In addition  without the consent of any Holder  the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or any series for certain purposes as set forth in the Indenture. However  without the consent of each holder of an outstanding debt security affected  no amendment  supplement or waiver may  among other things: (1)reduce the percentage in principal amount of debt securities of such series whose holders must consent to an amendment; ​ (2)reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such debt security; ​ (3)reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such debt security; ​ (4)reduce the premium payable upon the redemption or repurchase of any such debt security or change the time at which any such debt security may be redeemed or repurchased pursuant to the Indenture or any supplemental indenture; ​ (5)change the place or currency of payment of principal of  or premium  if any  or interest on any such debt security; ​ (6)impair the right of any holder to receive payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on ​19TABLE OF CONTENTSsuch holder’s debt securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder’s debt securities; or (7)make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holder’s consent or in the waiver provisions for such securities. ​ The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or supplement. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or supplement. A consent to any amendment  supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any holder of debt securities given in connection with a tender of such holder’s debt securities will not be rendered invalid by such tender. Satisfaction and Discharge The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all notes issued thereunder  when either: (1)all such notes that have been authenticated and delivered (except lost  stolen or destroyed notes that have been replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or ​ (2)all such notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise  will become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name  and at the expense  of the Company  and the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with such Trustee  as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders  cash in U.S. dollars  U.S. Government Obligations (as defined in the Indenture)  or a combination thereof  in such amounts as will be sufficient  without consideration of any reinvestment of interest  to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal  premium  if any  and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption  as the case may be; ​ (3)the Company has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it with respect to notes under the Indenture; and ​ (4)the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the notes at maturity or the redemption date  as the case may be. ​ In addition  the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied. Defeasance The Company at any time may terminate all its obligations under the debt securities of any series and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”)  except for certain obligations  including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of such debt securities  to replace mutilated  destroyed  lost or stolen debt securities and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the debt securities of any series. The Company may at any time terminate its obligations to comply with certain covenants described above under “— Certain Covenants” and certain covenants of any outstanding series of debt securities that may be contained in any applicable prospectus supplement  and we may omit to comply with such covenants without creating an Event of Default (“covenant defeasance”). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe our ability to be released from any of our covenant obligations under the Indenture with respect to any series of debt securities.20TABLE OF CONTENTSIn order to exercise either defeasance option  the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of any series to redemption or maturity  as the case may be  and must comply with certain other conditions  including  without limitation  delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) to the effect that holders of such series will not recognize income  gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred. In the case of legal defeasance only  such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable Federal income tax law. If the Company fails to comply with its remaining obligations under the Indenture with respect to the debt securities of any series following a covenant defeasance and such debt securities are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of any undefeased Event of Default  the amount of money and U.S. Government Obligations on deposit with the Trustee may be insufficient to pay amounts due on such debt securities at the time of the acceleration resulting from such Event of Default; however  the Company will remain liable in respect of such payments. Payments We will pay interest  principal and other amounts payable with respect to the debt securities of any series to the holders of record of those debt securities as of the record dates and otherwise in the manner specified below or in the prospectus supplement for that series. We will make payments on a global debt security in accordance with the applicable policies of the depositary as in effect from time to time. Under those policies  we will pay directly to the depositary  or its nominee  and not to any indirect owners who own beneficial interests in the global debt security. An indirect owner’s right to receive those payments will be governed by the rules and practices of the depositary and its participants. We will make payments on a debt security in non-global  registered form as follows. We will pay interest that is due on an interest payment date by check mailed on the interest payment date to the holder at his or her address shown on the Trustee’s records as of the close of business on the regular record date. We will make all other payments by check at the paying agent described below  against surrender of the debt security. All payments by check will be made in next-day funds (i.e.  funds that become available on the day after the check is cashed). Alternatively  if a non-global debt security has a face amount of at least $1 000 000 and the holder asks us to do so  we will pay any amount that becomes due on the debt security by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account at a bank in New York City  on the due date. To request wire payment  the holder must give the paying agent appropriate wire transfer instructions at least five business days before the requested wire payment is due. In the case of any interest payment due on an interest payment date  the instructions must be given by the person or entity who is the holder on the relevant regular record date. In the case of any other payment  payment will be made only after the debt security is surrendered to the paying agent. Any wire instructions  once properly given  will remain in effect unless and until new instructions are given in the manner described above. Book-entry and other indirect owners should consult their banks or brokers for information on how they will receive payments on their debt securities. No Individual Liability of Incorporators  Stockholders  Officers or Directors The Indenture provides that no incorporator and no past  present or future stockholder  officer or director of the Company or any successor company  in their capacity as such  shall have any individual liability for any of our obligations under the debt securities or the Indenture. Governing Law The Indenture is  and the debt securities will be  governed by  and construed in accordance with  the laws of the State of New York.21TABLE OF CONTENTSRegarding the Trustee The Indenture does not prohibit the Trustee from serving as trustee under any other indenture to which we may be a party from time to time or from engaging in other transactions with us. If the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and there is an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities  the Trustee must eliminate the conflict or resign.22TABLE OF CONTENTS​DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS We may issue warrants to purchase any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares and purchase contracts. Each warrant will entitle the holder to purchase for cash a number of securities at the exercise price as will in each case be described in  or can be determined from  the applicable prospectus supplement relating to the offered warrants. Warrants may be issued independently or together with any securities and may be attached to or separate from the securities. The warrants will be issued under warrant agreements to be entered into between us and a bank or trust company  as warrant agent.

We may also  at our option  elect to offer fractional shares of preferred stock. If we exercise this option  we will issue receipts for depositary shares  each of which will represent a fraction of a share of a particular series of preferred stock  to be described in an applicable prospectus supplement. The shares of any series of preferred stock represented by depositary shares will be deposited under a deposit agreement between us and one or more depositaries selected by us  who we will name in an applicable prospectus supplement.

The depositary shares will be evidenced by depositary receipts issued pursuant to the deposit agreement. The particular terms of the depositary shares offered by any prospectus supplement will be described in a prospectus supplement  which will also include a discussion of certain United States federal income tax consequences. We will include a copy of the form of deposit agreement  including the form of depositary receipt  and any other instrument establishing the terms of any depositary shares we offer as exhibits to a filing we will make with the SEC in connection with that offering. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”24TABLE OF CONTENTS​DESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTS AND PURCHASE UNITS We may issue purchase contracts representing contracts obligating holders  subject to the terms of such purchase contracts  to purchase from us  and us to sell to the holders  a specified or varying number of our common stock  preferred stock or other securities described in this prospectus at a future date or dates. Alternatively  the purchase contracts may  subject to the terms of such purchase contracts  obligate us to purchase from holders  and obligate the holders to sell to us  a specified or varying number of common stock  preferred stock or other securities described in this prospectus. The price per unit of our common stock  preferred stock or other securities described in this prospectus and number of units may be fixed at the time the purchase contracts are entered into or may be determined by reference to a specific formula set forth in the purchase contracts. We may issue the purchase contracts separately or as part of units  which we refer to as “purchase units ” consisting of a purchase contract and other securities or obligations issued by us or third parties  including government securities  in each case  securing the holders’ obligations to purchase the relevant securities under the purchase contracts. The purchase contracts may require us to make periodic payments to the holders of the purchase contracts or purchase units or vice versa  and such payments may be unsecured or prefunded on some basis. Any applicable prospectus supplement will describe the terms of any purchase contract or purchase units. The description in a prospectus supplement will not necessarily be complete and will be qualified in its entirety by reference to the purchase contracts  and  if applicable  collateral arrangements and depositary arrangements  relating to the purchase contracts or purchase units.25TABLE OF CONTENTS​DESCRIPTION OF UNITS We may issue units of securities consisting of one or more of the following securities: common stock  preferred stock  rights  debt securities  warrants  depositary shares and purchase contracts. We may evidence each series of units issued by unit certificates that we will issue under a separate unit agreement. We may enter into unit agreements with a unit agent. Each unit agent will be a bank or trust company that we select. You should read the particular terms of these documents  which will be described in more detail in a prospectus supplement. If we offer any units  certain terms of that series of units will be described in a prospectus supplement  including  without limitation  the following  as applicable: •the title of the series of units; ​ •identification and description of the separate constituent securities comprising the units; ​ •the price or prices at which the units will be issued; ​ •the date  if any  on and after which the constituent securities comprising the units will be separately transferable; ​ •a description of the term of any unit agreement governing the units; ​ •a description of the provisions for the payment  settlement  transfer or exchange of the units; ​ •if appropriate  a discussion of material United States federal income tax considerations; and ​ •any other terms of the units and their constituent securities. ​26TABLE OF CONTENTS​PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We may sell the securities on a delayed or continuous basis in and outside the United States through the methods described below or through any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law  including through a combination of such methods. A prospectus supplement  if required  will set forth any required information such as the terms of the offering and the method of distribution and will include the following information: •the name or names of any underwriters or agents; ​ •the purchase price of the securities from us; ​ •the net proceeds to us from the sale of the securities; ​ •any over-allotment options under which underwriters may purchase additional securities from us; ​ •any underwriting discounts  commissions and other items constituting compensation to underwriters  dealers or agents; ​ •any public offering price; ​ •any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers; and ​ •any securities exchange or market on which the securities offered in a prospectus supplement may be listed. ​ Sale Through Underwriters or Dealers If we use underwriters in the sale of securities  the underwriters will acquire the securities for their own account. The underwriters may resell the securities from time to time in one or more transactions  including negotiated transactions  at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of sale. Underwriters may offer securities to the public either through underwriting syndicates represented by one or more managing underwriters or directly by one or more firms acting as underwriters. The obligations of the underwriters to purchase the securities may be subject to conditions  and the underwriters may in such event be obligated to purchase all the offered securities if they purchase any of them. The underwriters may change from time to time any initial public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers. Underwriters may sell our common stock under this prospectus by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act  which includes sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange  on any other existing trading market for our common stock or to or through a market maker  or in privately negotiated transactions. Unless stated otherwise in any applicable prospectus supplement  the sales agent with respect to any such at the market offering will make all sales using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices  on mutually agreeable terms between the sales agent and us. Any applicable prospectus supplement will include the amount of any compensation to be received by the sales agent.

4195,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/morgan-stanley-gets-a-dose-of-the-most-feared-woman-in-finance-1.1760808,Morgan Stanley Gets a Dose of the Most Feared Woman in Finance,1 day ago,(Bloomberg) -- The most feared woman in finance isn’t a regulator  a short-seller or a hedge fund titan. You won’t find her office in the City of London  Washington or on Wall Street.But her name resonates in the offices from Bank of America Corp. to Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley and scores of their global peers: Anne Brorhilker  the German prosecutor exacting justice for the multibillion-dollar Cum-Ex tax-trading scam that’s been called the biggest tax heist in history.Brorhilker  48  has won four convictions against bankers in the past two years in a prosecution that’s roiling global finance. Just yesterday dozens of officials descended on Morgan Stanley’s Frankfurt offices.Add that to recent raids of Barclays Plc and BofA’s Merrill Lynch Frankfurt offices and it suggests she is tightening her focus on higher-profile banks. Neither Barclays  Morgan Stanley or BofA -- or any of their employees -- has been charged.Brorhilker is expected to indict the first top executive in the next few months: Christian Olearius  once the head of M.M. Warburg & Co. and still a major shareholder  according to people familiar with the matter. Olearius has denied wrongdoing.Among the other suspects her office is probing are ex-Deutsche Bank chief executive officers Anshu Jain and Josef Ackermann and former investment banking chief Garth Ritchie  as well as Macquarie Group Ltd. CEO Shemara Wikramanayake and predecessor Nicholas Moore. None have been charged.Big GameBrorhilker  senior prosecutor and department head in Cologne  has made it clear she’s going after top executives and that big settlements aren’t enough. She is currently examining some 1 500 people she says may have played a role in deals that mostly took place between 2006 and 2012. Overall  Cum-Ex is estimated to have cost Germany at least 10 billion euros ($10.91 billion).She “worked painstakingly through an extremely complex scandal ” Konrad Duffy  adviser for financial crime prevention at the nongovernmental organization Finanzwende  said in an interview. Other prosecutors “might have quickly dropped the investigations against a few settlement payments from banks  but then the precise details of the financial industry’s involvement would never have come to light.”QuickTake: Why ‘Cum-Ex’ Tax Dodge Casts Shadow on Global BanksThis article is based on interviews with more than a dozen people involved in the Cum-Ex investigations. Most asked not to be identified because their roles in the cases don’t allow them to comment publicly. Brorhilker declined to be interviewed.In a country where prosecutors and judges are rarely known by name  Brorhilker has become the face of the Cum-Ex probe. A small woman with long  ash-blond hair and stylish glasses  she has won the respect of many defense lawyers who have worked closely with her and call her audacious  hardworking and reliable. Some admit they underestimated her.Overreaching?Her critics say she has gone too far. A lawyer for M.M. Warburg  the Hamburg bank whose deals were at the center of the first Cum-Ex trials  told Germany’s top court that prosecutors were waging “an unprecedented smear campaign” against the lender.Even those who applaud her work say Brorhilker may be overreaching  that no one can prosecute so many people and that keeping them as suspects for years can be a professional death sentence. They say it would make more sense to settle with the banks now instead of dragging the investigations out for years with unclear prospects.Thomas Fischer  a former high court judge who is representing Warburg’s Olearius in a parliamentary inquiry into Cum-Ex  is even more critical.“She is certainly qualified and a very diligent prosecutor  but she’s extremely opinionated ” Fischer said. “German rules of criminal procedure require that a prosecutor must approach each case unbiased. But she said publicly herself that right from the start she didn’t have even a shadow of a doubt that Cum-Ex was criminal. That doesn’t match.”‘With-Without’Brorhilker came to the work in 2013 more or less by accident. A colleague had reduced her hours and needed to swap cases. At the time  few outside the financial industry had ever heard of Cum-Ex  a Latin phrase that means “with-without.”How It All Started: Employees at Dozens of Big Banks Said to Face German ProbeIn the trading strategy  shares were sold around dividend day to allow more than one investor to claim a refund on a tax that was paid only once  a ploy enabled by the way Germany collected dividend taxes. The complicated structure of the deals  with elaborate strings of short sales and derivative trades through multiple parties  made it difficult to investigate them.Back then  it was still hotly contested whether the deals were criminal or just a clever strategy to take advantage of a badly built system. Initially Brorhilker was on her own  and Cum-Ex was just one of several files on her desk. She was confronted by an army of corporate lawyers ready to fiercely defend the trades and the people behind them.Brorhilker has faced critics even on her turf. In 2020  her superiors rejected her plan to raid the Hamburg tax authority. A year later the search was back on  after the justice minister in her home state intervened.Today she heads her own department  overseeing 30 prosecutors devoted to Cum-Ex. New police investigative teams have been set up. Germany even extended the prosecution period for tax crimes  giving her more time to go after the big players and hold off on settlements  at least for now.Music LoverBrorhilker  who is married  doesn’t talk much about her personal life  people who know her say. She is a passionate lover of music  plays two instruments and briefly considered becoming a teacher. Her brother  Jan Brorhilker  is chief operating officer for Germany at the Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young. Their father was a partner there.She turned to Jan  like their father an economist by training  when she started to look into Cum-Ex. While some of those who used the strategy claimed it merely took advantage of market inefficiencies  he told her the profit had to come from somewhere else. That could only be the tax angle  she concluded.Read More: The Unemployed Trader Who Became a $700 Million Cum-Ex ExileRaised in North Rhine-Westphalia  she studied law at Bochum University and jumped right into prosecution after finishing her legal education. She is known for keeping long hours and often works even during time off at her parents’ vacation home on the North Sea  according to people close to her. Defense lawyers who have worked with Brorhilker recount calls they’ve gotten from her when she’s theoretically on holiday there.Her tireless labor “is what you would wish of a prosecutor ” said Stefan Kirsch  an attorney for one of two former traders convicted at the first Cum-Ex trial. The judges rewarded their cooperation by sparing them jail time  after Brorhilker argued for that.Next Five YearsBrorhilker first got the financial world’s attention with a series of raids across Europe and in the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands in 2014. The moves required cooperation with law enforcement agencies in 14 countries. She monitored the activity in a war room set up by the police  studying lights on a huge screen that showed authorities simultaneously sweeping into banks and offices in London  Luxembourg and other financial hubs.These operations increased the pressure on the Cum-Ex community and eventually helped bring a major breakthrough: cooperating witnesses. Brorhilker spent most of 2017 interviewing suspects who agreed to help her.Read More: Bust Bank Sues Deutsche Boerse’s Clearstream Over Cum-ExSome who declined her invitations to talk have paid the consequences. The chief of a British hedge fund was arrested at her request in the South of France two summers ago when he tried to board a plane to London with his family after a vacation. He was brought to Germany and allowed to leave only after being questioned and posting bail.Brorhilker says she’s far from finished.“We’re planning for the next five years ” she said in an interview in October with the German public broadcaster ARD. “If you are talking about 1 billion euros of tax loss  like we do in some of the cases  this needs diligent preparation.”She has the patience. Hanno Berger  Germany’s most successful tax lawyer before he was dubbed the “mastermind of Cum-Ex ” went on trial on April 4 in Bonn. He spent almost a decade in his Swiss chalet before being extradited in February. Berger says what he did was legal.Meanwhile  an army of bank lawyers remain on active duty  tasked with watching every move Brorhilker makes. At this point  it seems  there are few who underestimate her.Read MoreFrom Star Performer to Star Witness -- A Cum-Ex Trader CooperatesBanker Drew Macquarie Into Cum-Ex.

The following description is only a summary. This summary does not purport to be complete  or to give full effect to  the provisions of statutory or common laws  and is subject to  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the terms and detailed provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation (including any certificate of designation) and our amended and restated bylaws. We urge you to read these documents. Please read “Where You Can Find More Information.” Authorized Capital Stock At May 2  2022  our authorized capital consisted of: •1 800 000 000 shares of common stock  par value $0.10 per share  of which approximately 805 805 000 were outstanding  and ​ •5 000 000 shares of preferred stock  par value $0.10 per share  issuable in series  of which no shares were issued and outstanding. ​ Common Stock Holders of common stock may receive dividends if and when declared by our board of directors. The payment of dividends on our common stock may be limited by obligations to holders of any preferred stock and covenants contained in debt agreements. Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote per share on matters submitted to them. Cumulative voting of shares is prohibited  meaning that the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares voting for the election of directors can elect all directors to be elected if they choose to do so. Our common stock has no preemptive rights and is not convertible  redeemable or assessable  or entitled to the benefits of any sinking fund. If we liquidate or dissolve our business  the holders of common stock will share ratably in all assets available for distribution to stockholders after creditors are paid and preferred stockholders receive their distributions. All issued and outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable. Any shares of common stock we offer under this prospectus will be fully paid and nonassessable. In October 2021  in connection with the merger involving Cimarex  we effectively assumed the obligations associated with Cimarex’s preferred stock  par value $0.01 per share  designated as 8 1/8% Series A Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Cimarex Preferred Stock”). Each holder of Cimarex Preferred Stock has the right at any time  at its option  to convert any or all of such holder’s shares of Cimarex Preferred Stock at an initial conversion rate of 34.1008 shares of fully paid and nonassessable shares of our common stock and $471.3975 in cash per share of Cimarex Preferred Stock. The initial conversion rate of 34.1008 adjusts upon the occurrence of certain events  including the payment of cash dividends to our common stockholders  and is 36.24997 as of March 31  2022. Additionally  beginning on and continuing after October 15  2021  Cimarex has the right  at its option  if the closing sale price of our common stock meets certain criteria  to elect to cause all  and not part  of the outstanding shares of Cimarex Preferred Stock to be converted into that number of shares of our common stock for each eligible share of Cimarex Preferred Stock equal to the conversion rate in effect on the mandatory conversion date as such terms are defined in the Certificate of Designations for the Cimarex Preferred Stock and $471.3975 in cash per share of Cimarex Preferred Stock. Our common stock is listed on the NYSE and trades under the symbol “CTRA.” Preferred Stock The preferred stock may be issued in one or more series. Our board of directors may establish attributes of any series  including  without limitation  the designation and number of shares in the series  dividend rates6TABLE OF CONTENTS(cumulative or noncumulative)  conversion rights  redemption rights  voting rights  and any other rights and qualifications  preferences and limitations or restrictions on shares of a series. The issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of us without any vote or action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of shares of common stock. The specific terms of a particular series of preferred stock will be described in a certificate of designation relating to that series. This summary of the undesignated preferred stock discusses terms and conditions that we expect may apply to any series of the preferred stock that may be offered under this prospectus. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe the particular terms of each series of preferred stock actually offered. If indicated in the prospectus supplement  the terms of any series may differ from the terms described below. We expect the prospectus supplement for any preferred stock that we actually offer pursuant to this prospectus to include some or all of the following terms: •the designation of the series of preferred stock; ​ •the number of shares of preferred stock offered  the liquidation preference per share and the offering price of the preferred stock; ​ •the dividend rate or rates of the shares  the method or methods of calculating the dividend rate or rates  the dates on which dividends  if declared  will be payable  and whether or not the dividends are to be cumulative and  if cumulative  the circumstances in which dividends shall be cumulative; ​ •the amounts payable on shares of the preferred stock in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation  dissolution or winding up; ​ •the redemption rights and price or prices  if any  for the shares of preferred stock; ​ •the terms  and the amount  of any sinking fund or analogous fund providing for the purchase or redemption of the shares of preferred stock; ​ •any restrictions on our ability to make payments on any of our capital stock if dividend or other payments are not made on the preferred stock; ​ •any voting rights granted to the holders of the shares of preferred stock in addition to those required by Delaware law or our restated certificate of incorporation; ​ •whether the shares of preferred stock will be convertible into shares of our common stock or any other class of our capital stock  and  if convertible  the conversion price or prices  and any adjustment or other terms and conditions upon which the conversion shall be made; ​ •any other rights  preferences  restrictions  limitations or conditions relative to the shares of preferred stock permitted by Delaware law or our restated certificate of incorporation; ​ •any listing of the preferred stock on any securities exchange; and ​ •if appropriate  a discussion of material United States federal income tax considerations. ​ Subject to our restated certificate of incorporation and to any limitations imposed by any then outstanding preferred stock  we may issue additional series of preferred stock  at any time or from time to time  with such powers  preferences  rights and qualifications  limitations or restrictions as our board of directors determines  and without further action of the stockholders  including holders of our then outstanding preferred stock  if any. Limitation on Directors’ Liability Delaware has adopted a law that allows corporations to limit or eliminate the personal liability of directors to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for breach of directors’ fiduciary duty of care. The duty of care requires that  when acting on behalf of the corporation  directors must exercise an informed business judgment based on all material information reasonably available to them. Absent the limitations allowed by the law  directors are accountable to corporations and their stockholders for monetary damages for acts of gross negligence. Although Delaware law does not change directors’ duty of care  it7TABLE OF CONTENTSallows corporations to limit available relief to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission. Our restated certificate of incorporation limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by this law. Specifically  our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director  except for liability: •for any breach of their duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders; ​ •for acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law; ​ •under provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; or ​ •for any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit. ​ This limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors  and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care  even though such an action  if successful  might otherwise have benefited our stockholders. Effects of Certain Provisions of our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and Delaware Law Certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and Delaware law could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control or the removal of existing management  of deterring potential acquirors from making an offer to our stockholders and of limiting any opportunity to realize premiums over prevailing market prices for our common stock in connection therewith. This could be the case notwithstanding that a majority of our stockholders might benefit from such a change in control or offer. Advance Notice for Stockholder Proposals and Director Nominations Our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions requiring that advance notice be delivered to us of any business to be brought by a stockholder before an annual meeting of stockholders and providingfor certain procedures to be followed by stockholders in nominating persons for election to our board of directors. Generally  the advance notice provisions provide that the stockholder must give written notice to our Secretary not less than 90 days nor more than 120 days prior to the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting  except that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is more than 30 days before or more than 60 days after such anniversary date  notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not earlier than the 120th day prior to the date of such annual meeting and not later than the 90th day prior to the date of such annual meeting (or  if less than 100 days’ prior notice or public announcement of the scheduled meeting date is given or made  then the 10th day following the earlier of the day on which the notice of such meeting was mailed to our stockholders or the day on which such public announcement was made). The notice must set forth specific information regarding that stockholder and that business or director nominee  as described in our amended and restated bylaws. Proxy Access Our amended and restated bylaws permit a stockholder  or a group of up to 20 stockholders (with a group of any two or more funds that are under common management and investment control constituting a single stockholder)  owning 3% or more of our outstanding common stock continuously for at least three years to nominate and include in our proxy materials director candidates constituting up to 20% of our board of directors (or  if such amount is not a whole number  the closest whole number below 20%)  provided that the stockholder(s) and the nominee(s) satisfy the requirements specified in the amended and restated bylaws and subject to the other terms and conditions set forth in the amended and restated bylaws. Vacancies on the Board of Directors Our amended and restated bylaws provide that vacancies on the board of directors arising through death  resignation  retirement or removal shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office whether or not the remaining directors constitute a quorum.8TABLE OF CONTENTSStockholder Action by Written Consent Our amended and restated bylaws permit stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting. Any stockholder of record seeking to have the stockholders act by written consent must by written notice request our board of directors fix a record date. No written consent will be effective unless  within 60 days of the record date established by our board of directors  a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take such action are delivered to us in the manner prescribed by our amended and restated bylaws. Special Meetings of Stockholders Our amended and restated bylaws provide that special meetings of stockholders may be called at any time only by our chairman  our chief executive officer  our president or our board of directors. The only business that may be conducted at a special meeting of stockholders is that business specified in the notice of the meeting. Delaware Anti-Takeover Statute As a Delaware corporation  we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (“DGCL”). In general  Section 203 prevents us from engaging in a business combination with an “interested stockholder” ​(generally  a person owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock) for three years following the time that person becomes a 15% stockholder unless either: •before that person became a 15% stockholder  our board of directors approved the transaction in which the stockholder became a 15% stockholder or approved the business combination; ​ •upon completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder’s becoming a 15% stockholder  the stockholder owns at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction began (excluding stock held by directors who are also officers and by employee stock plans that do not provide employees with the right to determine confidentially whether shares held subject to the plan will be tendered in a tender or exchange offer); or ​ •after the transaction in which that person became a 15% stockholder  the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a stockholder meeting by at least two-thirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the 15% stockholder. ​ Under Section 203  these restrictions also do not apply to certain business combinations proposed by a 15% stockholder following the disclosure of an extraordinary transaction with a person who was not a 15% stockholder during the previous three years or who became a 15% stockholder with the approval of a majority of our directors. This exception applies only if the extraordinary transaction is approved or not opposed by a majority of our directors who were directors before any person became a 15% stockholder in the previous three years  or the successors of these directors. Exclusive Forum for Adjudication of Disputes Our amended and restated bylaws provide that unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum  the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  be the sole and exclusive forum for (1) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf  (2) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director  officer  other employee or agent of ours to us or our stockholders  including a claim alleging the aiding and abetting of such a breach of fiduciary duty  (3) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our amended and restated bylaws or restated certificate of incorporation (as either may be amended from time to time) or (4) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or asserting an “internal corporate claim” ​(as that term is defined in Section 115 of the DGCL) . In addition  unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum  the Federal District Courts of the United States of America shall be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. Under the Securities Act  federal and state courts have concurrent jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act  and stockholders cannot waive compliance with9TABLE OF CONTENTSthe federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims  Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Although we believe these provisions are beneficial by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law or U.S. securities laws in the types of lawsuits to which they apply  the provisions may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against our directors and officers or against us. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of capital stock of the Company will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our amended and restated bylaws related to choice of forum. The enforceability of similar exclusive forum provisions in other companies’ organizational documents has been challenged in legal proceedings  and it is possible that  in connection with one or more actions or proceedings described above  a court could rule that this provision in our amended and restated bylaws is inapplicable or unenforceable.

A copy of the Indenture  which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part  is incorporated herein by reference. Except as otherwise defined in this prospectus  capitalized terms used in this summary have the meanings given to them in the Indenture. The provisions of the Indenture will generally be applicable to all of the debt securities. Selected provisions of the Indenture are described in this prospectus. Additional or different provisions that are applicable to a particular series of debt securities will  if material  be described in a prospectus supplement relating to the offering of debt securities of that series. These provisions may include  among other things and to the extent applicable  the following: •the title of the debt securities; ​ •the extent  if any  to which the debt securities are subordinated in right of payment to other indebtedness of Coterra; ​ •any limit on the aggregate principal amount of the debt securities; ​ •the persons to whom any interest on the debt securities will be payable  if other than the registered holders thereof on the regular record date therefor; ​ •the date or dates on which the principal of the debt securities will be payable; ​ •the rate or rates at which the debt securities will bear interest  if any  and the date or dates from which interest will accrue; ​ •the dates on which interest will be payable and the regular record dates for interest payment dates; ​ •the place or places where the principal of and any premium and interest on the debt securities will be payable; ​ •the period or periods  if any  within which  and the price or prices at which  the debt securities may be redeemed  in whole or in part  at our option; ​ •our obligation  if any  to redeem or purchase the debt securities pursuant to sinking fund or similar provisions and the terms and conditions of any such redemption or purchase; ​ •the denominations in which the debt securities will be issuable  if other than denominations of $2 000 and any integral multiple of $1 000 in excess thereof; ​ •the currency  currencies or currency units  if other than currency of the United States of America  in which payment of the principal of and any premium or interest on the debt securities will be payable  and the terms and conditions of any elections that may be made available with respect thereto; ​ •any index or formula used to determine the amount of payments of principal of and any premium or interest on the debt securities; ​ •whether the debt securities are to be issued in whole or in part in the form of one or more global securities and  if so  the identity of the depositary  if any  for the global securities; ​ •whether the debt securities are to be issued under Rule 144A or Regulation S under the Securities Act and  in such case  any provisions unique to such issuance including any transfer restrictions or exchange and registration rights; ​ •the terms and conditions  if any  pursuant to which the debt securities are convertible into or exchangeable for the common stock or other securities of Coterra or any other person; ​ •the principal amount (or any portion of the principal amount) of the debt securities which will be payable upon any declaration of acceleration of the maturity of the debt securities pursuant to an event of default; ​12TABLE OF CONTENTS•the applicability to the debt securities of the provisions described in “— Defeasance” below; and ​ •any other terms applicable to that series in accordance with the Indenture  which could be different from those described in this prospectus. ​ We may issue debt securities at a discount from their stated principal amount. Federal income tax considerations and other special considerations applicable to any debt security issued with original issue discount (an “original issue discount security”) may be described in an applicable prospectus supplement. If the purchase price of any series of the debt securities is payable in a foreign currency or currency unit or if the principal of or any premium or interest on any series of the debt securities is payable in a foreign currency or currency unit  the restrictions  elections  general tax considerations  specific terms  and other information with respect to the debt securities and the applicable foreign currency or currency unit will be set forth in an applicable prospectus supplement. Unless otherwise indicated in an applicable prospectus supplement: •the debt securities will be issued only in fully registered form (without coupons) in denominations of $2 000 and any integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof; and ​ •payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities will be payable  and the exchange  conversion  and transfer of debt securities will be registrable  at our office or agency maintained for those purposes and at any other office or agency maintained for those purposes. No service charge will be made for any registration of transfer or exchange of the debt securities  but we may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith. ​ Form of Debt Securities We will issue each debt security only in registered form  without coupons  unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement. In addition  we will issue each debt security in global (i.e.  book-entry) form only  unless we specify otherwise in the applicable prospectus supplement. Debt securities in book-entry form will be represented by a global security registered in the name of a depositary  which will be the holder of all the debt securities represented by the global security. Those who own beneficial interests in a global debt security will do so through participants in the depositary’s securities clearance system  and the rights of these indirect owners will be governed solely by the applicable procedures of the depositary and its participants. References to “holders” in this section mean those who own debt securities registered in their own names  on the books that we or the Trustee maintain for this purpose  and not those who own beneficial interests in debt securities registered in street name or in debt securities issued in book-entry form through one or more depositaries. Book-Entry Procedures Unless otherwise indicated in the prospectus supplement  the following is a summary of the depositary arrangements applicable to debt securities issued in global form and for which the Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) acts as a depositary. We have provided the following descriptions of the operations and procedures of DTC  Euroclear System (“Euroclear”) and Clearstream Banking  société anonyme (“Clearstream”) solely as a matter of convenience. These operations and procedures are solely within the control of DTC  Euroclear and Clearstream and are subject to change by them from time to time. Neither we  any underwriters or the Trustee takes any responsibility for these operations or procedures  and you are urged to contact DTC  Euroclear or Clearstream or their respective participants directly to discuss these matters. Each global debt security will be deposited with  or on behalf of  DTC  as depositary  or its nominee  and registered in the name of a nominee of DTC. Except under the limited circumstances described below  global debt securities are not exchangeable for definitive certificated debt securities. Ownership of beneficial interests in a global debt security is limited to institutions that have accounts with DTC or its nominee  or persons that may hold interests through those participants. In addition  ownership13TABLE OF CONTENTSof beneficial interests by participants in a global debt security will be evidenced only by  and the transfer of that ownership interest will be effected only through  records maintained by DTC or its nominee for a global debt security. Ownership of beneficial interests in a global debt security by persons that hold those interests through participants will be evidenced only by  and the transfer of that ownership interest within that participant will be effected only through  records maintained by that participant. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the debt securities. Beneficial owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase  but beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction  as well as periodic statements of their holdings  from the participants through which the beneficial owners entered the transaction. The laws of some jurisdictions require that certain purchasers of securities take physical delivery of securities they purchase in definitive form. These laws may impair your ability to transfer beneficial interests in a global debt security. We will make payment of principal of  and interest on  debt securities represented by a global debt security registered in the name of or held by DTC or its nominee to DTC or its nominee  as the case may be  as the registered owner and holder of the global debt security representing those debt securities. DTC has advised us that upon receipt of any payment of principal of  or interest on  a global debt security  DTC will immediately credit accounts of participants on its book-entry registration and transfer system with payments in amounts proportionate to their respective interests in the principal amount of that global debt security  as shown in the records of DTC. Payments by participants to owners of beneficial interests in a global debt security held through those participants will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices  as is now the case with securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in “street name ” and will be the sole responsibility of those participants  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements that may be in effect from time to time. Neither we  the Trustee nor any of our respective agents will be responsible for any aspect of the records of DTC  any nominee or any participant relating to  or payments made on account of  beneficial interests in a permanent global debt security or for maintaining  supervising or reviewing any of the records of DTC  any nominee or any participant relating to such beneficial interests. A global debt security is exchangeable for definitive debt securities registered in the name of  and a transfer of a global debt security may be registered to  any person other than DTC or its nominee  only if: •DTC notifies us that it is unwilling  unable or has ceased to be a clearing agency under the Exchange Act and we do not appoint another institution to act as depositary within 90 days; or ​ •we notify the Trustee that we wish to terminate that global security. ​ Any global debt security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence will be exchangeable in whole for definitive debt securities in registered form  of like tenor and of an equal aggregate principal amount as the global debt security  in denominations specified in the applicable prospectus supplement  if other than $2 000 and multiples of $1 000. The definitive debt securities will be registered by the registrar in the name or names instructed by DTC. We expect that these instructions may be based upon directions received by DTC from its participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the global debt security. Except as provided above  owners of the beneficial interests in a global debt security will not be entitled to receive physical delivery of debt securities in definitive form and will not be considered the holders of debt securities for any purpose under the Indenture. No global debt security shall be exchangeable except for another global debt security of like denomination and tenor to be registered in the name of DTC or its nominee. Accordingly  each person owning a beneficial interest in a global debt security must rely on the procedures of DTC and  if that person is not a participant  on the procedures of the participant through which that person owns its interest  to exercise any rights of a holder under the global debt security or the Indenture. We understand that  under existing industry practices  in the event that we request any action of holders  or an owner of a beneficial interest in a global debt security desires to give or take any action that a holder is entitled to give or take under the debt securities or the Indenture  DTC would authorize the participants14TABLE OF CONTENTSholding the relevant beneficial interests to take that action. Additionally  those participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through those participants to give or take that action or would otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners owning through them. DTC has advised us that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the laws of the State of New York  a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code  and a “clearing agency” registered under the Exchange Act. DTC was created to hold securities of its participants and to facilitate the clearance and settlement of transactions among its participants in securities through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of the participants. By doing so  DTC eliminates the need for physical movement of securities certificates. DTC’s participants include securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations  and certain other organizations. DTC is owned by a number of its participants and by the New York Stock Exchange  Inc. and NYSE Amex Equities. Access to DTC’s book-entry system is also available to others  such as banks  brokers  dealers  and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a participant  either directly or indirectly. The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC. Investors may hold interests in the debt securities outside the U.S. through Euroclear or Clearstream if they are participants in those systems  or indirectly through organizations that are participants in those systems. Euroclear and Clearstream will hold interests on behalf of their participants through customers’ securities accounts in Euroclear’s and Clearstream’s names on the books of their respective depositaries  which in turn will hold such interests in customers’ securities accounts in the depositaries’ names on the books of DTC. Euroclear has advised us that it was created in 1968 to hold securities for participants of Euroclear (“Euroclear Participants”) and to clear and settle transactions between Euroclear Participants through simultaneous electronic book-entry delivery against payment  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates and any risk from lack of simultaneous transfers of securities and cash. Euroclear includes various other services  including securities lending and borrowing and interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. Euroclear is operated by the Euroclear S.A./N.V. (the “Euroclear Operator”)  under contract with Euroclear Clearance Systems S.C.  a Belgian cooperative corporation (the “Cooperative”). All operations are conducted by the Euroclear Operator  and all Euroclear securities clearance accounts and Euroclear cash accounts are accounts with the Euroclear Operator  not the Cooperative. The Cooperative establishes policy for Euroclear on behalf of Euroclear Participants. Euroclear Participants include banks (including central banks)  securities brokers and dealers  and other professional financial intermediaries and may include any agents. Indirect access to Euroclear is also available to other firms that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Euroclear Participant  either directly or indirectly. Securities clearance accounts and cash accounts with the Euroclear Operator are governed by the Terms and Conditions Governing Use of Euroclear  the related Operating Procedures of Euroclear  and applicable Belgian law (collectively  the “Terms and Conditions”). The Terms and Conditions govern transfers of securities and cash within Euroclear  withdrawals of securities and cash within Euroclear  withdrawals of securities and cash from Euroclear  and receipts of payments with respect to securities in Euroclear. All securities in Euroclear are held on a fungible basis without attribution of specific certificates to specific securities clearance accounts. The Euroclear Operator acts under the Terms and Conditions only on behalf of Euroclear Participants and has no record of or relationship with persons holding through Euroclear Participants. Distributions with respect to debt securities held beneficially through Euroclear will be credited to the cash accounts of Euroclear Participants in accordance with the Terms and Conditions  to the extent received by the U.S. depositary for Euroclear. Clearstream has advised us that it is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as a professional depositary. Clearstream holds securities for its participating organizations (“Clearstream Participants”) and facilitates the clearance and settlement of securities transactions between Clearstream Participants through electronic book-entry changes in accounts of Clearstream Participants  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of certificates. Clearstream provides to Clearstream Participants  among other things  services for safekeeping  administration  clearance  and settlement of internationally traded securities and15TABLE OF CONTENTSsecurities lending and borrowing. Clearstream interfaces with domestic markets in several countries. As a professional depositary  Clearstream is subject to regulation by the Luxembourg Monetary Institute. Clearstream Participants are recognized financial institutions around the world  including agents  securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations  and certain other organizations and may include any agents. Indirect access to Clearstream is also available to others  such as banks  brokers  dealers  and trust companies that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Clearstream Participant either directly or indirectly. Distributions with respect to debt securities held beneficially through Clearstream will be credited to cash accounts of Clearstream Participants in accordance with its rules and procedures  to the extent received by the U.S. depositary for Clearstream. Secondary market trading between Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Euroclear and Clearstream and will be settled using the procedures applicable to conventional eurobonds in immediately available funds. Cross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC  on the one hand  and directly or indirectly through Euroclear or Clearstream participants  on the other  will be effected within DTC in accordance with DTC’s rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its U.S. depositary; however  such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will  if the transaction meets its settlement requirements  deliver instructions to its U.S. depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving debt securities in DTC  and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures. Euroclear participants and Clearstream participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective U.S. depositaries. Because of time-zone differences  credits of securities received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits  or any transactions in the securities settled during such processing  will be reported to the relevant Euroclear participants or Clearstream participants on that business day. Cash received in Euroclear or Clearstream as a result of sales of securities by or through a Euroclear participant or a Clearstream participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the business day of settlement in DTC but will be available in the relevant Euroclear or Clearstream cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC. Although DTC  Euroclear and Clearstream have agreed to the foregoing procedures in order to facilitate transfers of debt securities among participants of DTC  Euroclear and Clearstream  they are under no obligation to perform or continue to perform such procedures and they may discontinue the procedures at any time. Certain Covenants Maintenance of Office or Agency We will be required to maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan  City of New York  or  if different  in each place of payment for each series of debt securities for notice and demand purposes and for the purposes of presenting or surrendering debt securities for payment  registration of transfer  or exchange. Paying Agents If we act as our own paying agent with respect to any series of debt securities  on or before each due date of the principal of or interest on any of the debt securities of that series  we will be required to segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the persons entitled to payment a sum sufficient to pay the amount due and to notify the Trustee promptly of our action or failure to act. If we have one or more paying agents for any series of debt securities  prior to each due date of the principal of or interest on any debt securities of that16TABLE OF CONTENTSseries  we will be required to deposit with a paying agent a sum sufficient to pay the amount due and  unless the paying agent is the Trustee  to promptly notify the Trustee of our action or failure to act. All moneys paid by us to a paying agent for the payment of principal of (or premium  if any) or interest on any debt securities that remain unclaimed for two years after the principal (or premium  if any) or interest has become due and payable may be repaid to us  and thereafter the holder of those debt securities may look only to us for payment thereof. Corporate Existence We will be required to preserve and keep in full force and effect our corporate existence  charter rights  statutory rights  licenses and franchises; provided that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such right  license or franchise if the Company shall determine that such preservation is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company. Compliance Certificate The Company will be required to file annually with the Trustee a certificate signed by two of its officers  stating whether or not the officers know of any default by the Company in compliance with any provision of the Indenture. Merger and Consolidation The Company will not consolidate with or merge with or into  or convey  transfer or lease all or substantially all its assets on a consolidated basis to  any Person  unless: (1)the resulting  surviving or transferee Person (the “Successor Company”) will be a company  corporation  partnership  trust or limited liability company organized and existing under the laws of the United States of America  any State of the United States or the District of Columbia and the Successor Company (if not the Company) will expressly assume  by supplemental indenture  executed and delivered to the Trustee  all the obligations of the Company under the debt securities of any series and the Indenture; provided that if the Successor Company is not a corporation  a corporate wholly owned subsidiary organized under the laws of the United States of America  any State thereof or the District of Columbia shall become a co-issuer of such debt securities; ​ (2)immediately after giving effect to such transaction  no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and ​ (3)the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel  each stating that such consolidation  merger  sale  conveyance  transfer or lease  and such supplemental indenture (if any)  comply with the Indenture and that all conditions precedent provided for in the Indenture relating to such transaction have been complied with. ​ For purposes of the foregoing  the sale  lease  conveyance  transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of one or more subsidiaries of the Company  which properties and assets  if held by the Company instead of such subsidiaries  would constitute all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis  shall be deemed to be the transfer of all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company on a consolidated basis. The predecessor Company will be released from its obligations under the Indenture and the Successor Company will succeed to  and be substituted for  and may exercise every right and power of  the Company under the Indenture  but  in the case of a lease of all or substantially all its assets  the predecessor Company will not be released from the obligation to pay the principal of and interest on the debt securities of any series. Events of Default The following are Events of Default under the Indenture with respect to debt securities of any series: (1)default in any payment of interest on any debt security of that series when due and the continuance of such default for a period of 30 days; ​17TABLE OF CONTENTS(2)default in the payment of principal of or premium  if any  on any debt security of that series when due at its stated maturity or by declaration of acceleration  call for redemption or otherwise; ​ (3)failure to make any sinking fund payment when and as due by the terms of any debt security of that series and the continuance of such default for a period of 60 days; ​ (4)failure by the Company to perform or comply with any other covenant (other than a covenant or a default in whose performance or whose breach is elsewhere specifically dealt with as an event of default or which has been expressly included in the Indenture solely for the benefit of a series of debt securities other than that series) for a period of 90 days after written notice thereof has been given to us as provided in the Indenture; ​ (5)specified events of bankruptcy  insolvency  or reorganization involving the Company; and ​ (6)any other Event of Default provided with respect to debt securities of that series. ​ Pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act  the Trustee is required to give to the holders of the debt securities of that series notice of all defaults known to it within 90 days of the occurrence thereof  except that other than in the case of a default of the character contemplated in clause (1)  (2)  or (3) above  the Trustee may withhold notice if and so long as it in good faith determines that the withholding of notice is in the interests of the holders of the debt securities of that series. If an Event of Default described in clause (5) above occurs  the principal of  and accrued interest  if any  on the debt securities of that series will become immediately due and payable without any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any holder of the debt securities of that series. If any other Event of Default with respect to debt securities of any series occurs and is continuing  either the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may declare the principal amount of  and accrued and unpaid interest  if any  on all debt securities of that series to be due and payable immediately. However  at any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to debt securities of any series has been made  but before a judgment or decree based on such acceleration has been obtained  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the debt securities of that series may  under specified circumstances  rescind and annul such acceleration. See “— Amendments and Waivers” below. Subject to the duty of the Trustee to act with the requisite standard of care during an Event of Default  the Trustee will be under no obligation to exercise any of the rights or powers under the Indenture at the request or direction of any holders of debt securities of any series unless such holders have offered to the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the costs  expenses and liabilities that might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction. Except to enforce the right to receive payment of principal  premium  if any  or interest when due  no holder may pursue any remedy with respect to the Indenture or the debt securities of any series unless: (1)such holder has previously given the Trustee notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the debt securities of that series; ​ (2)holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series have requested the Trustee to pursue the remedy in respect of such Event of Default; ​ (3)such holders have offered the Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against any loss  liability or expense; ​ (4)the Trustee has not complied with such request within 60 days after the receipt of the request and the offer of security or indemnity; and ​ (5)the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of such series have not given the Trustee a direction that is inconsistent with such request within such 60-day period. ​ Subject to certain restrictions  the holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding debt securities of any series are given the right to direct the time  method and place of conducting any proceeding18TABLE OF CONTENTSfor any remedy available to the Trustee or of exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. The Indenture provides that in the event an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing  the Trustee will be required in the exercise of its powers to use the degree of care that a prudent person would use in the conduct of its own affairs. The Trustee  however  may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law or the Indenture or that the Trustee determines is prejudicial to the rights of any other holder or that would involve the Trustee in personal liability. Prior to taking any action under the Indenture  the Trustee will be entitled to indemnification satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against all losses and expenses caused by taking or not taking such action. Any additional Events of Default with respect to any series of debt securities  and any variations from the foregoing Events of Default applicable to any series of debt securities  will be described in an applicable prospectus supplement. An event of default for a particular series of debt securities does not necessarily constitute an event of default for any other series issued under the Indenture. Subordination The prospectus supplement  if any  relating to any offering of subordinated debt securities will describe the specific subordination provisions  including the extent of subordination of payments by the Company of the principal of  premium  if any  on and interest on such subordinated debt securities. Amendments and Waivers Subject to certain exceptions  the Indenture and the debt securities of any series may be amended or supplemented with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all of the debt securities at the time outstanding (voting as a single class) or  if the amendment or supplement affects the debt securities of fewer than all of such series of debt securities  by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all such series affected by the amendment or supplement  with the debt securities of all the affected series voting together as a single class for this purpose (including without limitation  consents obtained in connection with a purchase of  or tender offer or exchange offer for  such debt securities) and  subject to certain exceptions  any past default or compliance with any provisions may be waived with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the debt securities at the time outstanding (voting as a single class) or  if the waiver of compliance with provisions affects the debt securities of fewer than all of such series of debt securities  by the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of all such series affected by the waiver  with the debt securities of all the affected series voting together as a single class for this purpose (including waivers obtained in connection with a purchase of  or tender offer or exchange offer for  such debt securities). In addition  without the consent of any Holder  the Company and the Trustee may amend or supplement the Indenture or any series for certain purposes as set forth in the Indenture. However  without the consent of each holder of an outstanding debt security affected  no amendment  supplement or waiver may  among other things: (1)reduce the percentage in principal amount of debt securities of such series whose holders must consent to an amendment; ​ (2)reduce the stated rate of or extend the stated time for payment of interest on any such debt security; ​ (3)reduce the principal of or extend the Stated Maturity of any such debt security; ​ (4)reduce the premium payable upon the redemption or repurchase of any such debt security or change the time at which any such debt security may be redeemed or repurchased pursuant to the Indenture or any supplemental indenture; ​ (5)change the place or currency of payment of principal of  or premium  if any  or interest on any such debt security; ​ (6)impair the right of any holder to receive payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on ​19TABLE OF CONTENTSsuch holder’s debt securities on or after the due dates therefor or to institute suit for the enforcement of any payment on or with respect to such holder’s debt securities; or (7)make any change in the amendment provisions which require each holder’s consent or in the waiver provisions for such securities. ​ The consent of the holders is not necessary under the Indenture to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment or supplement. It is sufficient if such consent approves the substance of the proposed amendment or supplement. A consent to any amendment  supplement or waiver under the Indenture by any holder of debt securities given in connection with a tender of such holder’s debt securities will not be rendered invalid by such tender. Satisfaction and Discharge The Indenture will be discharged and will cease to be of further effect as to all notes issued thereunder  when either: (1)all such notes that have been authenticated and delivered (except lost  stolen or destroyed notes that have been replaced or paid and notes for whose payment money has been deposited in trust) have been delivered to the Trustee for cancellation; or ​ (2)all such notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation have become due and payable by reason of the making of a notice of redemption or otherwise  will become due and payable within one year or are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name  and at the expense  of the Company  and the Company has irrevocably deposited or caused to be deposited with such Trustee  as trust funds in trust solely for the benefit of the holders  cash in U.S. dollars  U.S. Government Obligations (as defined in the Indenture)  or a combination thereof  in such amounts as will be sufficient  without consideration of any reinvestment of interest  to pay and discharge the entire Indebtedness on the notes not theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation for principal  premium  if any  and accrued interest to the date of maturity or redemption  as the case may be; ​ (3)the Company has paid or caused to be paid all sums payable by it with respect to notes under the Indenture; and ​ (4)the Company has delivered irrevocable instructions to the Trustee to apply the deposited money toward the payment of the notes at maturity or the redemption date  as the case may be. ​ In addition  the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an Officers’ Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel (which Opinion of Counsel may be subject to customary assumptions and exclusions) each stating that all conditions precedent to satisfaction and discharge have been satisfied. Defeasance The Company at any time may terminate all its obligations under the debt securities of any series and the Indenture (“legal defeasance”)  except for certain obligations  including those respecting the defeasance trust and obligations to register the transfer or exchange of such debt securities  to replace mutilated  destroyed  lost or stolen debt securities and to maintain a registrar and paying agent in respect of the debt securities of any series. The Company may at any time terminate its obligations to comply with certain covenants described above under “— Certain Covenants” and certain covenants of any outstanding series of debt securities that may be contained in any applicable prospectus supplement  and we may omit to comply with such covenants without creating an Event of Default (“covenant defeasance”). The Company may exercise its legal defeasance option notwithstanding its prior exercise of its covenant defeasance option. The applicable prospectus supplement will describe our ability to be released from any of our covenant obligations under the Indenture with respect to any series of debt securities.20TABLE OF CONTENTSIn order to exercise either defeasance option  the Company must irrevocably deposit in trust (the “defeasance trust”) with the Trustee money or U.S. Government Obligations for the payment of principal  premium  if any  and interest on the debt securities of any series to redemption or maturity  as the case may be  and must comply with certain other conditions  including  without limitation  delivery to the Trustee of an Opinion of Counsel (subject to customary exceptions and exclusions) to the effect that holders of such series will not recognize income  gain or loss for Federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and defeasance and will be subject to Federal income tax on the same amount and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and defeasance had not occurred. In the case of legal defeasance only  such Opinion of Counsel must be based on a ruling of the Internal Revenue Service or other change in applicable Federal income tax law. If the Company fails to comply with its remaining obligations under the Indenture with respect to the debt securities of any series following a covenant defeasance and such debt securities are declared due and payable because of the occurrence of any undefeased Event of Default  the amount of money and U.S. Government Obligations on deposit with the Trustee may be insufficient to pay amounts due on such debt securities at the time of the acceleration resulting from such Event of Default; however  the Company will remain liable in respect of such payments. Payments We will pay interest  principal and other amounts payable with respect to the debt securities of any series to the holders of record of those debt securities as of the record dates and otherwise in the manner specified below or in the prospectus supplement for that series. We will make payments on a global debt security in accordance with the applicable policies of the depositary as in effect from time to time. Under those policies  we will pay directly to the depositary  or its nominee  and not to any indirect owners who own beneficial interests in the global debt security. An indirect owner’s right to receive those payments will be governed by the rules and practices of the depositary and its participants. We will make payments on a debt security in non-global  registered form as follows. We will pay interest that is due on an interest payment date by check mailed on the interest payment date to the holder at his or her address shown on the Trustee’s records as of the close of business on the regular record date. We will make all other payments by check at the paying agent described below  against surrender of the debt security. All payments by check will be made in next-day funds (i.e.  funds that become available on the day after the check is cashed). Alternatively  if a non-global debt security has a face amount of at least $1 000 000 and the holder asks us to do so  we will pay any amount that becomes due on the debt security by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account at a bank in New York City  on the due date. To request wire payment  the holder must give the paying agent appropriate wire transfer instructions at least five business days before the requested wire payment is due. In the case of any interest payment due on an interest payment date  the instructions must be given by the person or entity who is the holder on the relevant regular record date. In the case of any other payment  payment will be made only after the debt security is surrendered to the paying agent. Any wire instructions  once properly given  will remain in effect unless and until new instructions are given in the manner described above. Book-entry and other indirect owners should consult their banks or brokers for information on how they will receive payments on their debt securities. No Individual Liability of Incorporators  Stockholders  Officers or Directors The Indenture provides that no incorporator and no past  present or future stockholder  officer or director of the Company or any successor company  in their capacity as such  shall have any individual liability for any of our obligations under the debt securities or the Indenture. Governing Law The Indenture is  and the debt securities will be  governed by  and construed in accordance with  the laws of the State of New York.21TABLE OF CONTENTSRegarding the Trustee The Indenture does not prohibit the Trustee from serving as trustee under any other indenture to which we may be a party from time to time or from engaging in other transactions with us. If the Trustee acquires any conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and there is an Event of Default with respect to any series of debt securities  the Trustee must eliminate the conflict or resign.22TABLE OF CONTENTS​DESCRIPTION OF WARRANTS We may issue warrants to purchase any combination of common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  depositary shares and purchase contracts.

The depositary shares will be evidenced by depositary receipts issued pursuant to the deposit agreement. The particular terms of the depositary shares offered by any prospectus supplement will be described in a prospectus supplement  which will also include a discussion of certain United States federal income tax consequences. We will include a copy of the form of deposit agreement  including the form of depositary receipt  and any other instrument establishing the terms of any depositary shares we offer as exhibits to a filing we will make with the SEC in connection with that offering. See “Where You Can Find More Information.”24TABLE OF CONTENTS​DESCRIPTION OF PURCHASE CONTRACTS AND PURCHASE UNITS We may issue purchase contracts representing contracts obligating holders  subject to the terms of such purchase contracts  to purchase from us  and us to sell to the holders  a specified or varying number of our common stock  preferred stock or other securities described in this prospectus at a future date or dates. Alternatively  the purchase contracts may  subject to the terms of such purchase contracts  obligate us to purchase from holders  and obligate the holders to sell to us  a specified or varying number of common stock  preferred stock or other securities described in this prospectus. The price per unit of our common stock  preferred stock or other securities described in this prospectus and number of units may be fixed at the time the purchase contracts are entered into or may be determined by reference to a specific formula set forth in the purchase contracts. We may issue the purchase contracts separately or as part of units  which we refer to as “purchase units ” consisting of a purchase contract and other securities or obligations issued by us or third parties  including government securities  in each case  securing the holders’ obligations to purchase the relevant securities under the purchase contracts. The purchase contracts may require us to make periodic payments to the holders of the purchase contracts or purchase units or vice versa  and such payments may be unsecured or prefunded on some basis. Any applicable prospectus supplement will describe the terms of any purchase contract or purchase units. The description in a prospectus supplement will not necessarily be complete and will be qualified in its entirety by reference to the purchase contracts  and  if applicable  collateral arrangements and depositary arrangements  relating to the purchase contracts or purchase units.25TABLE OF CONTENTS​DESCRIPTION OF UNITS We may issue units of securities consisting of one or more of the following securities: common stock  preferred stock  rights  debt securities  warrants  depositary shares and purchase contracts. We may evidence each series of units issued by unit certificates that we will issue under a separate unit agreement. We may enter into unit agreements with a unit agent. Each unit agent will be a bank or trust company that we select. You should read the particular terms of these documents  which will be described in more detail in a prospectus supplement. If we offer any units  certain terms of that series of units will be described in a prospectus supplement  including  without limitation  the following  as applicable: •the title of the series of units; ​ •identification and description of the separate constituent securities comprising the units; ​ •the price or prices at which the units will be issued; ​ •the date  if any  on and after which the constituent securities comprising the units will be separately transferable; ​ •a description of the term of any unit agreement governing the units; ​ •a description of the provisions for the payment  settlement  transfer or exchange of the units; ​ •if appropriate  a discussion of material United States federal income tax considerations; and ​ •any other terms of the units and their constituent securities. ​26TABLE OF CONTENTS​PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION We may sell the securities on a delayed or continuous basis in and outside the United States through the methods described below or through any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law  including through a combination of such methods. A prospectus supplement  if required  will set forth any required information such as the terms of the offering and the method of distribution and will include the following information: •the name or names of any underwriters or agents; ​ •the purchase price of the securities from us; ​ •the net proceeds to us from the sale of the securities; ​ •any over-allotment options under which underwriters may purchase additional securities from us; ​ •any underwriting discounts  commissions and other items constituting compensation to underwriters  dealers or agents; ​ •any public offering price; ​ •any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers; and ​ •any securities exchange or market on which the securities offered in a prospectus supplement may be listed. ​ Sale Through Underwriters or Dealers If we use underwriters in the sale of securities  the underwriters will acquire the securities for their own account. The underwriters may resell the securities from time to time in one or more transactions  including negotiated transactions  at a fixed public offering price or at varying prices determined at the time of sale. Underwriters may offer securities to the public either through underwriting syndicates represented by one or more managing underwriters or directly by one or more firms acting as underwriters. The obligations of the underwriters to purchase the securities may be subject to conditions  and the underwriters may in such event be obligated to purchase all the offered securities if they purchase any of them. The underwriters may change from time to time any initial public offering price and any discounts or concessions allowed or reallowed or paid to dealers. Underwriters may sell our common stock under this prospectus by any method permitted by law deemed to be an “at the market” offering as defined in Rule 415 under the Securities Act  which includes sales made directly on the New York Stock Exchange  on any other existing trading market for our common stock or to or through a market maker  or in privately negotiated transactions. Unless stated otherwise in any applicable prospectus supplement  the sales agent with respect to any such at the market offering will make all sales using commercially reasonable efforts consistent with its normal trading and sales practices  on mutually agreeable terms between the sales agent and us. Any applicable prospectus supplement will include the amount of any compensation to be received by the sales agent. During and after an offering through underwriters  the underwriters may purchase and sell the securities in the open market. These transactions may include overallotment and stabilizing transactions and purchases to cover syndicate short positions created in connection with the offering. The underwriters also may impose a penalty bid  which means that selling concessions allowed to syndicate members or other broker-dealers for the offered securities sold for their account may be reclaimed by the syndicate if the offered securities are repurchased by the syndicate in stabilizing or covering transactions. These activities may stabilize  maintain or otherwise affect the market price of the offered securities  which may be higher than the price that might otherwise prevail in the open market. If commenced  the underwriters may discontinue these activities at any time. If we use dealers in the sale of securities  we will sell the securities to them as principals. They may then resell those securities to the public at varying prices determined by the dealers at the time of resale. We also may agree to sell  and the relevant underwriters or agents may agree to solicit offers to purchase  blocks of27TABLE OF CONTENTSsecurities. The terms of each such agreement will be set forth in more detail in any applicable prospectus supplement and any related free writing prospectus.

If required  we will include in any applicable prospectus supplement the names of the dealers and the terms of the transaction. Direct Sales and Sales Through Agents We may sell the securities directly. In that event  no underwriters or agents would be involved. We also may sell the securities through agents we designate from time to time to solicit offers from purchasers to purchase the securities included in this prospectus or to sell such securities in ordinary brokerage transactions on our behalf. If required  a prospectus supplement will name any agent involved in the offer or sale of the offered securities and will describe any commissions payable by us to the agent.

We may sell the securities directly to institutional investors or others who may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act with respect to any sale of those securities. We will describe the terms of any such sales in a prospectus supplement. We may also offer securities through subscription rights distributed to our stockholders on a pro rata basis  which may or may not be transferable. In any distribution of subscription rights to stockholders  if all of the underlying securities are not subscribed for  we may then sell the unsubscribed securities directly to third parties or may engage the services of one or more underwriters  dealers or agents  including standby underwriters  to sell the unsubscribed securities to third parties. Delayed Delivery Contracts We may authorize agents  underwriters or dealers to solicit offers from certain types of institutions to purchase securities from us at the public offering price under delayed delivery contracts. These contracts would provide for payment and delivery on a specified date in the future. The contracts would be subject only to those conditions described in a prospectus supplement. Such prospectus supplement will describe the commission payable for solicitation of those contracts. Remarketing We may offer and sell any of the securities in connection with a remarketing upon their purchase  in accordance with a redemption or repayment by their terms or otherwise  by one or more remarketing firms acting as principals for their own accounts or as our agents. The name of any remarketing firm  the terms of any remarketing agreement and the compensation to be paid to the remarketing firm will be included in a prospectus supplement  as required. Remarketing firms may be deemed to be underwriters within the meaning of the Securities Act. Derivative Transactions We may enter into derivative transactions with third parties  or sell securities not covered by this prospectus to third parties in privately negotiated transactions. If any applicable prospectus supplement indicates  in connection with those derivatives  the third parties may sell securities covered by this prospectus and the applicable prospectus supplement  including in short sale transactions then the third parties may use securities pledged by us or borrowed from us or others to settle those sales or to close out any related open borrowings of securities  and may use securities received from us in settlement of those derivatives to close out any related open borrowings of securities. The third parties in these sale transactions will be underwriters and will be identified in such applicable prospectus supplement or in a post-effective amendment to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part. General Information In connection with the sale of the securities  underwriters  dealers or agents may be deemed to have received compensation from us in the form of underwriting discounts or commissions and also may receive28TABLE OF CONTENTScommissions from securities purchasers for whom they may act as agent.

It is possible that one or more underwriters may make a market in a series of offered securities. However  they will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice. We cannot assure you as to the liquidity of  or the trading market for  any of our offered securities.

4202,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/morgan-stanley-gets-a-dose-of-the-most-feared-woman-in-finance-1.1760808,Morgan Stanley Gets a Dose of the Most Feared Woman in Finance,1 day ago,(Bloomberg) -- The most feared woman in finance isn’t a regulator  a short-seller or a hedge fund titan. You won’t find her office in the City of London  Washington or on Wall Street.But her name resonates in the offices from Bank of America Corp. to Deutsche Bank AG and Morgan Stanley and scores of their global peers: Anne Brorhilker  the German prosecutor exacting justice for the multibillion-dollar Cum-Ex tax-trading scam that’s been called the biggest tax heist in history.Brorhilker  48  has won four convictions against bankers in the past two years in a prosecution that’s roiling global finance. Just yesterday dozens of officials descended on Morgan Stanley’s Frankfurt offices.Add that to recent raids of Barclays Plc and BofA’s Merrill Lynch Frankfurt offices and it suggests she is tightening her focus on higher-profile banks. Neither Barclays  Morgan Stanley or BofA -- or any of their employees -- has been charged.Brorhilker is expected to indict the first top executive in the next few months: Christian Olearius  once the head of M.M. Warburg & Co. and still a major shareholder  according to people familiar with the matter. Olearius has denied wrongdoing.Among the other suspects her office is probing are ex-Deutsche Bank chief executive officers Anshu Jain and Josef Ackermann and former investment banking chief Garth Ritchie  as well as Macquarie Group Ltd. CEO Shemara Wikramanayake and predecessor Nicholas Moore. None have been charged.Big GameBrorhilker  senior prosecutor and department head in Cologne  has made it clear she’s going after top executives and that big settlements aren’t enough. She is currently examining some 1 500 people she says may have played a role in deals that mostly took place between 2006 and 2012. Overall  Cum-Ex is estimated to have cost Germany at least 10 billion euros ($10.91 billion).She “worked painstakingly through an extremely complex scandal ” Konrad Duffy  adviser for financial crime prevention at the nongovernmental organization Finanzwende  said in an interview. Other prosecutors “might have quickly dropped the investigations against a few settlement payments from banks  but then the precise details of the financial industry’s involvement would never have come to light.”QuickTake: Why ‘Cum-Ex’ Tax Dodge Casts Shadow on Global BanksThis article is based on interviews with more than a dozen people involved in the Cum-Ex investigations. Most asked not to be identified because their roles in the cases don’t allow them to comment publicly. Brorhilker declined to be interviewed.In a country where prosecutors and judges are rarely known by name  Brorhilker has become the face of the Cum-Ex probe. A small woman with long  ash-blond hair and stylish glasses  she has won the respect of many defense lawyers who have worked closely with her and call her audacious  hardworking and reliable. Some admit they underestimated her.Overreaching?Her critics say she has gone too far. A lawyer for M.M. Warburg  the Hamburg bank whose deals were at the center of the first Cum-Ex trials  told Germany’s top court that prosecutors were waging “an unprecedented smear campaign” against the lender.Even those who applaud her work say Brorhilker may be overreaching  that no one can prosecute so many people and that keeping them as suspects for years can be a professional death sentence. They say it would make more sense to settle with the banks now instead of dragging the investigations out for years with unclear prospects.Thomas Fischer  a former high court judge who is representing Warburg’s Olearius in a parliamentary inquiry into Cum-Ex  is even more critical.“She is certainly qualified and a very diligent prosecutor  but she’s extremely opinionated ” Fischer said. “German rules of criminal procedure require that a prosecutor must approach each case unbiased. But she said publicly herself that right from the start she didn’t have even a shadow of a doubt that Cum-Ex was criminal. That doesn’t match.”‘With-Without’Brorhilker came to the work in 2013 more or less by accident. A colleague had reduced her hours and needed to swap cases. At the time  few outside the financial industry had ever heard of Cum-Ex  a Latin phrase that means “with-without.”How It All Started: Employees at Dozens of Big Banks Said to Face German ProbeIn the trading strategy  shares were sold around dividend day to allow more than one investor to claim a refund on a tax that was paid only once  a ploy enabled by the way Germany collected dividend taxes. The complicated structure of the deals  with elaborate strings of short sales and derivative trades through multiple parties  made it difficult to investigate them.Back then  it was still hotly contested whether the deals were criminal or just a clever strategy to take advantage of a badly built system. Initially Brorhilker was on her own  and Cum-Ex was just one of several files on her desk. She was confronted by an army of corporate lawyers ready to fiercely defend the trades and the people behind them.Brorhilker has faced critics even on her turf. In 2020  her superiors rejected her plan to raid the Hamburg tax authority. A year later the search was back on  after the justice minister in her home state intervened.Today she heads her own department  overseeing 30 prosecutors devoted to Cum-Ex. New police investigative teams have been set up. Germany even extended the prosecution period for tax crimes  giving her more time to go after the big players and hold off on settlements  at least for now.Music LoverBrorhilker  who is married  doesn’t talk much about her personal life  people who know her say. She is a passionate lover of music  plays two instruments and briefly considered becoming a teacher. Her brother  Jan Brorhilker  is chief operating officer for Germany at the Big Four accounting firm Ernst & Young. Their father was a partner there.She turned to Jan  like their father an economist by training  when she started to look into Cum-Ex. While some of those who used the strategy claimed it merely took advantage of market inefficiencies  he told her the profit had to come from somewhere else. That could only be the tax angle  she concluded.Read More: The Unemployed Trader Who Became a $700 Million Cum-Ex ExileRaised in North Rhine-Westphalia  she studied law at Bochum University and jumped right into prosecution after finishing her legal education. She is known for keeping long hours and often works even during time off at her parents’ vacation home on the North Sea  according to people close to her. Defense lawyers who have worked with Brorhilker recount calls they’ve gotten from her when she’s theoretically on holiday there.Her tireless labor “is what you would wish of a prosecutor ” said Stefan Kirsch  an attorney for one of two former traders convicted at the first Cum-Ex trial. The judges rewarded their cooperation by sparing them jail time  after Brorhilker argued for that.Next Five YearsBrorhilker first got the financial world’s attention with a series of raids across Europe and in the British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands in 2014. The moves required cooperation with law enforcement agencies in 14 countries. She monitored the activity in a war room set up by the police  studying lights on a huge screen that showed authorities simultaneously sweeping into banks and offices in London  Luxembourg and other financial hubs.These operations increased the pressure on the Cum-Ex community and eventually helped bring a major breakthrough: cooperating witnesses. Brorhilker spent most of 2017 interviewing suspects who agreed to help her.Read More: Bust Bank Sues Deutsche Boerse’s Clearstream Over Cum-ExSome who declined her invitations to talk have paid the consequences. The chief of a British hedge fund was arrested at her request in the South of France two summers ago when he tried to board a plane to London with his family after a vacation. He was brought to Germany and allowed to leave only after being questioned and posting bail.Brorhilker says she’s far from finished.“We’re planning for the next five years ” she said in an interview in October with the German public broadcaster ARD. “If you are talking about 1 billion euros of tax loss  like we do in some of the cases  this needs diligent preparation.”She has the patience. Hanno Berger  Germany’s most successful tax lawyer before he was dubbed the “mastermind of Cum-Ex ” went on trial on April 4 in Bonn. He spent almost a decade in his Swiss chalet before being extradited in February. Berger says what he did was legal.Meanwhile  an army of bank lawyers remain on active duty  tasked with watching every move Brorhilker makes. At this point  it seems  there are few who underestimate her.Read MoreFrom Star Performer to Star Witness -- A Cum-Ex Trader CooperatesBanker Drew Macquarie Into Cum-Ex.

The product candidate’s physics-based mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering an adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly  with immune checkpoint inhibitors.NBTXR3 is being evaluated in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as the primary development pathway. The company-sponsored phase I dose escalation and dose expansion study has produced favorable safety data and early signs of efficacy. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy.Nanobiotix has also prioritized an Immuno-Oncology development program—beginning with a Company sponsored phase I clinical study  evaluating NBTXR3 activated by radiotherapy in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors for patients with locoregional recurrent or recurrent/metastatic HNSCC and for patients with lung or liver metastases from any primary cancer eligible for anti-PD-1 therapy  either naïve or resistant to prior PD-1 (either primary or secondary as per SITC criteria).Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in strategic collaborations to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies to evaluate NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2021  the Company entered into an additional strategic collaboration agreement with LianBio to support its global phase III study in Asia along with four future registrational studies.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Highlights Full-year 2022 guidance reaffirmed.First-quarter revenues u…,Wolters Kluwer N.V.May 4  2022 - Wolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL)  a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services  today released its scheduled first-quarter 2022 trading update.HighlightsFull-year 2022 guidance reaffirm ed.First-quarter revenues up 8% in constant currencies and up 8% organically. Recurring revenues (81%) grew 8% organically; non-recurring revenues rose 9% organically. Digital & services revenues (93%) grew 9% organically; print revenues grew 4% organically. Expert solutions (56%) grew 10% organically.First-quarter adjusted operating profit margin increased  with strong operational gearing more than compensating for increased personnel expenses .First-quarter adjusted free cash flow increased 6% in constant currencies  despite higher capital expenditure and tax payments in the quarter.Net debt-to-EBITDA 1.2x as of March 31  2022.2022 share buyback: €216 million of intended buyback of up to €600 million completed in the year through May 2  2022.Nancy McKinstry  CEO and Chair of the Executive Board  commented: “The year has started well  with improved organic growth across all four divisions  even if we exclude favorable timing and phasing effects that influenced the first quarter. We continued to invest in our people and products as we pursue opportunities to grow our expert solutions. While we face more challenging revenue comparables in the remainder of the year  we are confident in reaffirming our overall guidance for 2022.”First Quarter 2022 DevelopmentsFirst quarter revenues increased 13% in reporting currency  partly reflecting the significant strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro compared to a year ago (average EUR/USD rate 1.12 versus 1.20 in 1Q 2021). In constant currencies  first quarter revenues increased 8%. Excluding both currency and the net effect of acquisitions and divestments  organic growth was 8% (1Q 2021: 4%). All divisions posted improved organic growth in the quarter compared to a year ago.Story continuesRecurring revenues (81% of revenues)  which include subscriptions and other repeating revenue streams  increased 8% organically against a relatively weak comparable (1Q 2021: 3%). Non-recurring revenues (19% of revenues) increased 9% organically (1Q 2021: 7%) with transactional revenues in Governance  Risk & Compliance (GRC) broadly flat (1Q 2021: 11%) but other non-recurring revenues  such as software license and implementation services  up 14% organically (1Q 2021: stable). Print revenues rose 4% organically (1Q 2021: 6%)  with an 8% organic decline in Legal & Regulatory print revenues more than offset by an organic increase in Health.The adjusted operating profit margin increased in all divisions  except in Governance  Risk & Compliance. The first quarter margin benefitted from operational gearing which more than offset increased personnel costs related to hires made in recent quarters. Expenses related to travel and other activities that were reduced during the pandemic remained low in the first quarter but are expected to build over the year.Health revenues increased 9% organically (1Q 2021: 8%) in the quarter  with strong performance around the world. Clinical Solutions grew 9% organically (1Q 2021: 6%)  driven by strong subscription renewals for our decision support tool  UpToDate  and our drug information solutions  Medi-Span and Lexicomp. Health Learning  Research & Practice also grew 9% organically (1Q 2021: 11%)  buoyed by an unexpected increase in U.S. print book revenues due to favorable timing of distributor orders. Organic growth in Learning  Research & Practice digital subscriptions  advertising  and other non-recurring revenues slowed compared to a year ago due to a challenging comparable.Tax & Accounting revenues grew 9% organically (1Q 2021: 3%)  largely reflecting revenue phasing related to the timing of the U.S. tax season and a surge in demand for outsourced professional services in a tight labor market. Corporate Performance Solutions (CCH Tagetik and TeamMate) recorded mid-single digit organic growth  driven by double-digit organic growth at CCH Tagetik. Professional Tax & Accounting North America recorded double-digit organic growth  against a weak comparable which saw revenues shift into the second quarter of 2021 due to the delay in the U.S. tax season. Professional Tax & Accounting Europe delivered mid-single digit organic growth  while Asia Pacific growth moderated.Governance  Risk & Compliance revenues increased 8% organically (1Q 2021: 3%). Legal Services organic growth was 7% (1Q 2021: 2%)  mainly driven by robust renewals for CT Corporation legal representation subscription services. Financial Services recorded 8% organic growth (1Q 2021: 5%). In Compliance Solutions  subscription revenues increased  especially for eOriginal digital lending solutions  however this was offset by a decline in transactional volumes due to the absence of a Paycheck Protection Program1 in 2022 and the market-wide decline in U.S. mortgage originations. Finance  Risk & Reporting posted strong organic growth driven by non-recurring implementation services and higher license fees for OneSumX software. On April 8  2022  GRC completed the acquisition of International Document Services (IDS) for approximately $70 million in cash.Legal & Regulatory revenues grew 6% organically (1Q 2021: 2%)  benefitting from higher non-recurring license revenues for EHS/ORM2 software. Information Solutions (79% of divisional revenues) posted 3% organic growth (1Q 2021: 2%)  with digital information solutions up 7% and print formats down 8% in the quarter. Divestitures  notably the disposal of the U.S. Legal Education business in September 2021  reduced divisional revenues by 4% in constant currencies in the quarter. The sale of our legal publishing assets in Spain and France  agreed in December 2021 and expected to complete in 2022  remains subject to approval of the Spanish antitrust authorities.Cash Flow and Net DebtFirst quarter adjusted free cash flow increased 6% in constant currencies. Cash conversion was lower than a year ago due to an increase in capital expenditures and a decline in working capital inflows. Mainly as a result of new U.S. rules on the capitalization of research & development expenses  cash tax payments increased. Net cash spend on acquisitions was nil  while a total of €157 million in cash was deployed towards share repurchases during the first quarter.As of March 31  2022  net debt was €1 920 million  compared to €2 131 million at December 31  2021. Net-debt-to-EBITDA  based on rolling twelve months’ EBITDA  was 1.2x at the end of March 2022  compared to 1.4x at year-end 2021.As of March 31  2022  the number of issued ordinary shares outstanding (excluding 5.5 million shares held in treasury) was 257.1 million.Dividends and Share BuybacksAt the Annual General Meeting held on April 21  2022  shareholders approved a total dividend of €1.57 over financial year 2021. This results in a final dividend of €1.03 per share to be paid to shareholders on May 18  2022 (ADRs: May 25  2022). The interim dividend for 2022 will be set at 40% of the prior year total dividend.In the year to date  Wolters Kluwer has repurchased 2.3 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of €216 million (average share price €92.55). This includes a €46 million block trade executed on February 24  2022  to offset dilution caused by incentive share issuance. For the period starting May 5  2022  up to and including August 1  2022  we have engaged a third party to execute €140 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer’s Articles of Association. Share repurchases will be used for capital reduction purposes and to meet obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.Recent ESG and Other DevelopmentsAs of the end of April  90% of our offices have reopened and about a quarter of our global workforce was back in office for all or part of the week. At the 2022 Annual General Meeting in April  Ann Ziegler succeeded Frans Cremers as Chair of the Supervisory Board. Heleen Kersten was appointed Member  increasing the proportion of women on the Supervisory Board to 57%.Full-Year 202 2 OutlookWe reiterate our overall guidance for full-year 2022 adjusted operating profit margin  adjusted free cash flow  return on invested capital (ROIC)  and diluted adjusted EPS (see table below). We continue to expect good organic growth for the full year  albeit slower than in 2021 due to challenging comparables starting in the second quarter. The recent suspension of business in Russia and Belarus is expected to have minimal impact as these countries represent less than 1% of group revenues. We maintain our full year adjusted operating profit margin guidance  although we now expect the group margin to rise in the first half of 2022. As previously indicated  we expect growth in diluted adjusted EPS to be dampened by a return to our historical tax rate.Full-Year 2022 Outlook Performance indicators 2022 Guidance 2021 Adjusted operating profit margin 25.5%-26.0% 25.3% Adjusted free cash flow €1 025-1 075 million €1 010 million ROIC Around 14% 13.7% Diluted adjusted EPS Mid-single-digit growth €3.38 Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reported currencies and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2022 of €/$1.13. Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.18). Guidance reflects share repurchases for up to €600 million in 2022.If current exchange rates persist  the U.S. dollar rate will have a positive effect on 2022 results reported in euros. In 2021  Wolters Kluwer generated more than 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2021 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 2 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS3.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We currently expect that restructuring costs will increase to within our normal range of €10-€15 million (FY 2021: €6 million). We expect adjusted net financing costs of approximately €65 million in constant currencies4  including lease interest charges. We expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to increase to approximately 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2021: 21.5%). Capital expenditure is expected to be within our normal range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2021: 5.0%). We expect the full-year cash conversion ratio to be in the range of 100%-105% (FY 2021: 112%).Any guidance we provide assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins and earnings in the near term.2022 Outlook by DivisionHealth: we expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels  mainly due to the absence of a contract win of the size of the 2021 ASCO deal. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to improve modestly.Tax & Accounting: we expect organic growth to improve slightly from 2021 levels and the adjusted operating profit margin to improve.Governance  Risk & Compliance: we expect organic growth to slow from 2021 levels  due to slower growth in transactional revenues in the second half of the year. We expect the adjusted operating profit margin to ease in the first half but to improve for the full year.Legal & Regulatory: we expect organic growth to be in line with 2021. The adjusted operating profit margin is expected to decline in the second half and for the full year due to the absence of the one-off pension amendment recorded in 2021.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in professional information  software solutions  and services for the healthcare; tax and accounting; governance  risk and compliance; and legal and regulatory sectors.

The platform will incorporate the key strengths of Accor’s brands and leverage the Group’s leading market position in the luxury and premium segments. Building on Rixos’ invaluable 20+ years of experience in the luxury-all-inclusive market. The offering will look to provide exciting and memorable experiences globally.Accor entered into a joint venture with Fettah Tamince  founder of Rixos Hotels  in 2016 to develop the All-Inclusive segment. The partnership has proved to be great success with Rixos successfully tripling its network (including committed pipeline) over the last 5 years. Rixos is a leading global player in the luxury all-inclusive segment and the dominant market leader in Turkey  the Middle East and Central Asia with 24 hotels and over 10 000 rooms in operation and a further 26 hotels with over 14 000 rooms in the pipeline.Building upon the success of Rixos  Accor is significantly expanding its all-inclusive offering by including its luxury and premium brands with Fairmont  Sofitel  Pullman  Swissôtel and Mövenpick in the Collection. The objective is to leverage the strength and visibility of these brands in the key target markets for expansion for the All-Inclusive Collection.Carefully curated entertainment programmes  for both day and evening activities  will play a central role and will build on Rixos’ expertise in children’s clubs  fitness  watersports as well as in programming for outdoor activities and MICE. Guests can look forward to spectacular shows with breathtaking performances delivered by entertainers and multiple sporting activities per resort accompanied by world-class spa and wellness facilities.This will be complemented by the exceptional quality and wide breadth of restaurant  bar  beach club and nightlife concepts  creating unforgettable guest experiences. The Collection’s programming in this space will be inspired and led by Carte Blanched  Ennismore’s F&B Concept Lab with each venue providing diverse and culturally relevant cuisines and culinary experiences. Ennismore is the leading lifestyle platform established by Accor in a joint venture with Sharan Pasricha.International expansion of the all-inclusive business will be centered in Europe  Middle East Africa  Turkey  Asia and Central America and the Caribbean. These geographies have been selected for their promising growth potential in the all-inclusive segment and the strength of these brands in the target markets. The Collection will initially focus on the further expansion of Rixos’ footprint of 50 properties in the network and pipeline and will quickly scale and diversify as part of a longer term multi-branded strategy of having over 100 all-inclusive resorts in the next 5 years.The Collection is set for a strong year of openings which will include: Rixos Gulf Hotel Doha  Rixos Qetaifan Doha  which includes one of the world’s largest waterparks. Both these resorts will open in time for the FIFA World Cup in Qatar. Also opening later this year the Swissôtel Sharm el Sheikh  the first non-Rixos branded property in the All-Inclusive Collection with 1 350 rooms  a water park  multiple dining  beach club and entertainment facilities.Fettah Tamince  Chairman of the Board of Rixos Hotels  said: “I am incredibly proud of the success Rixos has achieved in the five years as part of the Accor portfolio. Together  Accor and Rixos complement each other’s market-leading expertise  and the All-Inclusive Collection is the next step in accelerating their positions in the sector. This new initiative comes at a time when the demand for all-inclusive stays could not be stronger and now is the right time to leverage this positive trajectory. I am excited and pleased to continue my partnership with Accor with this expanded brand portfolio.”Gaurav Bhushan  CEO Accor Lifestyle & Entertainment  Co-CEO Ennismore  added: “The post-Covid travel market is witnessing a renewed desire for leisure stays. Accor’s strategic decision to double down on the all-inclusive segment  the fastest growing sector in this market and build upon its success with Rixos  capitalizes on this opportunity.

The higher revenue was due to the improved pricing and higher sales volumes noted above was offset by increased raw material prices  as well as the ongoing rise in energy and shipping costs.SG&A expenses in the first quarter of 2022 slightly increased by $0.8 million  to $7.4 million  primarily due to higher share-based and variable compensation expense in the current quarter.The first quarter 2022 EBITDA was $1.1 million lower than the same period in the prior year  due to increased SG&A costs.AMG Critical Materials TechnologiesQ1 ‘22 Q1 ‘21 Change Revenue $153 295 $120 443 27% Gross profit 23 188 20 507 13% Gross profit before non-recurring items 23 283 20 569 13% Operating profit 3 948 3 644 8% EBITDA 9 650 9 041 7%AMG Critical Materials Technologies' first quarter 2022 revenue increased by $32.9 million  or 27%  compared to the same period in 2021. This increase was due to increased titanium alloys sales  as well as higher titanium alloy and chrome metal pricing  offset by timing delays in Engineering projects. First quarter 2022 gross profit before non-recurring items increased by $2.7 million  or 13%  to $23.3 million due to the higher volumes and prices.SG&A expenses increased by $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period in 2021  driven by an increase in professional fees and higher share-based and variable compensation expense in the current quarter.AMG Critical Materials Technologies’ EBITDA increased to $9.7 million during the quarter  compared to $9.0 million in the first quarter of 2021. This was primarily due to higher profitability in chrome metal and titanium alloys.The Company signed $61.1 million in new orders during the first quarter of 2022  driven by strong orders of remelting and heat treatment furnaces  representing a 1.09x book to bill ratio. Order backlog was $183.5 million as of March 31  2022  in line with $188.2 million as of December 31  2021.Financial ReviewExceptional ItemsAMG’s first quarter 2022 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of EBITDA.A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in the first quarters of 2022 and 2021 are below:Exceptional items included in gross profitQ1 ‘22 Q1 ‘21 Change Gross profit $75 194 $46 864 60% Inventory cost adjustment — (333) N/A Restructuring expense 141 67 110% Asset impairment reversal — (136) N/A Strategic project expense 2 265 561 304% Gross profit excluding exceptional items 77 600 47 023 65%Energy CostsAMG experienced significant increases in gas and electricity costs in the first quarter of 2022. Total energy costs were $11.9 million higher in the first quarter of 2022 versus the same period in 2021. The majority of this increase was at our silicon business in Germany  but that business benefited from fully hedged power costs and increased silicon prices. Other business units benefited from long-term electricity contracts that have no price escalation clauses  and the business units that did experience energy cost increases were able to pass through most of these increased costs to their customers.SG&AAMG’s first quarter 2022 SG&A expenses were $37.5 million compared to $33.1 million in the first quarter of 2021  with the variance driven largely by an increase in professional fees due to higher strategic project costs and higher shared-based and variable compensation expense. The first quarter of 2021 personnel cost was reduced by cost reduction efforts in response to the onset of the pandemic.Net Finance CostsAMG’s first quarter 2022 net finance costs were $8.9 million compared to $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. This slight increase was mainly driven by higher borrowing rates during the quarter  which were partially offset by lower foreign exchange losses versus the prior period.TaxAMG recorded an income tax benefit of $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2022  compared to $0.9 million in the same period in 2021. This variance was mainly driven by higher pre-tax income compared to the prior period more than offset by movements in the Brazilian real versus the US dollar. The effects of the Brazilian real caused a $14.7 million non-cash deferred tax benefit in the first quarter 2022. Movements in the Brazilian real exchange rate impact the valuation of the Company’s net deferred tax positions related to our operations in Brazil.AMG paid taxes of $3.9 million in the first quarter of 2022  compared to tax payments of $2.0 million in the first quarter of 2021.LiquidityMarch 31 2022 December 31 2021 Change Senior secured debt $371 323 $371 897 —% Cash & cash equivalents 308 482 337 877 (9%) Senior secured net debt 62 841 34 020 85% Other debt 26 676 24 398 9% Net debt excluding municipal bond 89 517 58 418 53% Municipal bond debt 319 419 319 476 —% Restricted cash 62 139 93 434 (33%) Net debt 346 797 284 460 22%AMG had a net debt position of $346.8 million as of March 31  2022. This increase was mainly due to the significant investment in growth initiatives during the quarter.AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the first quarter. As of March 31  2022  the Company had $308 million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and $170 million available on its revolving credit facility. As such  AMG had $478 million of total liquidity as of March 31  2022.In January 2022  AMG Engineering entered into €140 million of long-term bilateral unsecured performance-based guarantee facility agreements. These guarantee arrangements support expected customer advanced payments and replace the existing guarantee arrangements.In November 2021  AMG entered into a new $350 million 7-year senior secured term loan B facility (“term loan”) and a $200 million 5-year senior secured revolving credit facility (“revolver”). The total facility amount of $550 million replaced AMG’s prior credit facility and extended the term loan maturity from 2025 to 2028 and revolver maturity from 2023 to 2026. Further strengthening AMG’s commitment to Environmental  Social and Governance (ESG)  annual CO 2 intensity reduction targets were built into the Revolving Credit Facility  making it a Sustainability Linked Loan. In conjunction with this loan  AMG entered into a 5-year swap agreement through 2026  which fixed interest rates for the entire term loan at the prevailing low interest rates in November 2021.OutlookAMG was able to deliver strong results despite the continuing impact of COVID-19 and the fallout from the geopolitical turbulence in recent months. EBITDA was $54.8 million in the first quarter of 2022  93% higher than the first quarter 2021 EBITDA of $28.3 million  and 25% higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. As mentioned  it was the seventh straight quarter of sequential improvement and we expect this trend to continue.In December 2021  AMG increased its 2022 EBITDA guidance from “$150 million or more” to “$175 - $200 million.”In February 2022  we further increased our EBITDA guidance for the full year 2022 to “$225 million or more.”Given the improved market conditions within our portfolio  especially the lithium and also the vanadium markets  the new guidance is that 2022 EBITDA will be in the range of $260 to $290 million.The last long-term EBITDA guidance was given in 2019  prior to the COVID period. In 2019  we said “we will reach an EBITDA of $350 million  or more  in 5 years  or earlier.”Being now much closer to the year 2023  and despite the global disruption from the coronavirus and the geopolitical turbulence  we strongly reaffirm that guidance.As to a new long-term EBITDA guidance  we will reach an EBITDA of $500 million  or more  in 5 years or earlier.Net income to EBITDA reconciliationQ1 ‘22 Q1 ‘21 Net income $29 884 $5 678 Income tax benefit (1 489) (910) Net finance cost 8 919 8 654 Equity-settled share-based payment transactions 1 380 1 114 Restructuring expense 141 67 Inventory cost adjustment — (333) Strategic project expense (1) 4 796 2 552 Share of loss of associates 500 387 Others 102 167 EBIT 44 233 17 376 Depreciation and amortization 10 527 10 963 EBITDA 54 760 28 339(1) The Company is in the ramp-up phase for several strategic expansion projects  including AMG Vanadium’s expansion project  the joint venture with Shell  Hybrid Lithium Vanadium Redox Flow Battery System  and the lithium expansion in Germany  which incurred project expenses during the quarter but are not yet operational.

Worldline and Algoan are dedicated to making these opportunities readily available to the market.Traditional credit assessment practises across Europe involve varying degrees of manual processes and assessments  which are subject to human error and cost both lender and borrower a lot of time to process a credit application. Following the fundamental changes in the financial services industry  the task of assessing potential borrowers is becoming more and more difficult with traditional assessment methods no longer meeting consumer expectations and not keeping pace with digital transformation or regulatory changes. The credit & risk assessment process has a lot to gain from PSD2 opportunities  as Open Banking and Open Finance continue to provide better and faster services to consumers and institutions.Unleashing the power of Open BankingThe partnership will combine Worldline’s pan-European Open Banking reach and expertise in digital banking  combined with Algoan’s credit scoring expertise that uses best-in-class machine learning algorithms  therefore offering a new Open Banking-based credit-assessment tool. This will enable banks  credit institutions  lending companies and service providers to take credit scoring to the next level  resulting in more accurate scoring  access to better data and improved processing efficiency. This innovation can be valuable for many use cases  such as Personal Finance & Consumer Lending  Auto Finance & Leasing  Retail Lending & BNPL (Buy Now Pay Later)  Insurance and Utility Providers.Benefits for both lenders and borrowersOpen Banking-based credit assessment brings significant advantages to both lenders and borrowers. As the lender receives data from the bank  the data validity is ensured which will reduce the risk of fraud. Based on a more accurate assessment  applicants can be accepted who may otherwise have been declined. With access to consumer account data  based on user consent  lenders quickly get a better view of the actual financial situation of consumers and can meet the borrower’s needs without risking over-indebtedness. In addition  the lender can provide a fast  straightforward customer journey while the borrower receives a fair credit assessment and a faster time-to-yes.At the heart of this new credit assessment tool is Worldline’s Open Banking API  which provides access to more than 3 500 banks in 19 countries across Europe. Worldline is one of the largest Open Banking providers in Europe.Michael Steinbach  Managing Director Financial Services at Worldline: “At Worldline we look for innovative partners who share our vision and enable us to enrich and expand our open banking services. As a lead and one of the largest Open Banking providers in Europe  we are committed to unlocking the full potential of Open Banking. With Algoan  we will be able to offer our customers an end-to-end and cost-efficient white-label solution to assess credit worthiness”.Michael Diguet  CEO at Algoan: “Open Banking credit scoring is experiencing momentum that big players should embrace. We are delighted to collaborate with a global leader Worldline and to power them with our best-in-class global credit scoring API.

In a forward-thinking move that challenges the algorithms and search mechanics of key websites  Heineken® is today unveiling Fresher Football – a new webpage in partnership with GOAL that provides correct responses to the most popular questions asked online about the UEFA Champions League  where answers tend to overlook key data around the women's game.The aim of Fresher Football is to encourage search engines and fan sites to recognise  amend and their current information to the accurate answers  regardless of gender.To achieve this Heineken® is committing to intercepting online searches  buying key AdWords around popular football questions  and correcting the current answers with accurate statistics based on the men's and women's game  allowing female achievements in football to be celebrated and not forgotten.Link to the Heineken® Fresher Football website: https://www.goal.com/story/fresherfootball/To further support its mission in tackling inclusivity in football  Heineken® have created a new TVC and Digital campaign  entitled Cheers to All Fans  Men Included  highlighting the misconception that you must be a man to be a football fan. From sneaking to the bathroom during a date and checking the score  to screaming loudly with their friends in the living room  Cheers to All Fans  Men Included features men and women fans throughout  rewriting the stereotype and showing the reality that gender doesn't dictate someone's passion for football.Link to the Cheers to All Fans  Men Included: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0m85z3mzVxQIn addition to the above acts and ads  Heineken® will be partnering with its first women football ambassador with its partnership with English football legend and broadcaster  Alex Scott.

Everyone has a right to take part in the sport they love  whether they're a fan or a player. At the end of the day  sport is sport  and no one should be left out. That's why I'm excited to work with Heineken® to challenge the stereotypes  football should be for everyone.""Bram Westenbrink  Global Head Heineken® Brand  says: ""Heineken® is a brand for the fans and we've always been passionate about bringing people together to celebrate the things they love. Now  on our journey to improve inclusivity in football through our sponsorships  we're committed to ensuring the sport is a safe and welcoming space for everyone.""Nadine Keßler  UEFA's Chief of Women's Football  says: ""We are delighted to see our long-standing partner Heineken® taking a bold stance with their campaign to support women's football. UEFA has set up the UEFA Women's EURO and UEFA Women's Champions League competitions to not only showcase the best of the women's game but to engage the next generation of players and fans. Heineken®'s campaign will help promote the importance of equality in the sport and we look forward to supporting them with their movement.""Heineken® has been a partner of the UEFA Women's Champions League and UEFA Women's EUROs since 2021  when the brand made the decision to mirror its men's and women's sponsorships across both football and motorsport.Editorial information:Please find the high-resolution campaign images and credits here* Women in Football's biggest ever survey in 2020 about discrimination in the sport (see here)About Cheers to All Fans  Men Included TVC:Even with 4 in 10 football fans identifying as women (Statista)  there remains an enduring stereotype that football is a sport exclusively for men.

The “Laugh Now  Cry Later” rapper reportedly completed his contractual obligations to the Young Money/Cash Money (YMCMB) label and was looking at a potential free agency reign if he decided against signing with another label. But now that won’t be the case after all.Variety has more:Since 2014  Drake has moved over 37 million album project units. He’s also the first artist ever to surpass 50 billion combined streams on Spotify. To estimate that Drake’s music brings in $50 million annually is no stretch  say sources  and that the deal could be in the vicinity of $400 million or more isn’t either. For UMG  which is traded on the Euronext exchange  the deal helps solidify its catalog holdings. The company owns 3 million sound recordings and boasts 4 of the top 5 most streamed artists of the last decade on Spotify  per a report to investors issued by UBS Research in summer 2021. That report listed Drake among UMG’s 2021 “re-signings” and noted €1.52 billion spent on catalog acquisitions and artists advances in 2020 (Drake is listed alongside Bob Dylan and Cash Money; his songs have also been ingested into the UMPG system).As HipHopDX also notes  The Weeknd also recently struck a similar deal as the 6 God—which means that UMG now houses two of the biggest artists in the industry and only further cements their status and influence.,neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,negative,0.04,0.23,0.74,True,English,"['Gigantic $400M Deal', 'Universal Music Group', 'Drake', 'UMG Chairman Sir Lucian Grainge', 'potential free agency reign', '37 million album project units', 'top 5 most streamed artists', 'Q1 earnings call', 'Certified Lover Boy', 'visual media projects', '50 billion combined streams', '3 million sound recordings', 'Universal Music Group', 'Young Money/Cash Money', 'expansive, multi-faceted deal', 'artists advances', 'biggest artists', 'contractual obligations', 'first artist', 'Euronext exchange', 'catalog holdings', 'last decade', 'UBS Research', 'catalog acquisitions', 'Bob Dylan', 'UMPG system', 'The Weeknd', 'new deal', 'similar deal', 'YMCMB) label', 'rapper Drake', 'grave', 'side', 'heaven', 'Advertisement', 'Tuesday', 'company', 'publishing', 'merchandise', 'Variety', 'Laugh', 'case', 'Spotify', 'stretch', 'sources', 'vicinity', 'report', 'investors', 'summer', '2021 “re', 'signings', 'songs', 'HipHopDX', '6 God', 'industry', 'status', 'influence']",2022-05-04,2022-05-05,theroot.com

This figure was partially offset by higher taxes  financials and higher non-controlling interest  among others. EDPR now currently holds a portfolio of operating assets of 14 GW  of which 13 GW fully consolidated and 1.1 GW equity consolidated (Spain  Portugal  US  APAC and Offshore).For Q1 2022 EDPR added a total of 465 MW of wind and solar capacity  out of which 450 MW fully consolidated  specifically 46 MW in Europe  3 MW in North American and 401 MW in Asia-Pacific (APAC). Equity consolidated increased by 15 MW due to new solar projects in APAC. Capacity additions were mainly driven by the successful integration of Sunseap assets from APAC  which now represent 3% of the EDPR’s portfolio. Furthermore  in March 2022 EDPR had 2.4 GW of capacity under construction  of which 1.569 MW related to wind onshore and 805 to solar technology.In the Q1 period  EDPR produced 9.2 TWh of clean electricity (up 14% interannually)  avoiding 6mt of CO 2 emissions. This interannual evolution benefits from the capacity additions over the last 12 months along with a higher renewable resource.Also  EDPR achieved a 35% load factor (one percentage point higher than the previous financial year)  reflecting a Renewables index 2% higher than the expected long-term average Gross Capacity Factor (up 5 percentage points interannually).In the words of Miguel Stilwell d'Andrade  CEO of EDP Renewables: ""The results reflect our solid growth and our strong positioning as a global market leader. We now have platforms in all key growth regions  our team has grown stronger and more cohesive  and 50% of the capacity targeted under our strategic plan for 2021-2025 has been secured. We are prepared to carry on leading the energy transition”.Financial resultsEDPR revenues increased to 569 million euros (up 27% interannually)  i.e. up 121 million euros from the previous year. This is due to the impact from additional capacity MW (up 79 million euros interannually) along with higher renewable resource (up 20 million euros interannually)  positive forex translation and others (up 27 million euros interannually)  which were more than enough to offset the negative effect from the average selling price (down 5 million euros interannually) on the back of portfolio mix effect.Other operating income amounted to 81 million euros (up 65 million euros interannually). Operating Costs (Opex) totalled 241 million euros (up 62 million euros interannually) given higher capacity in operation and upfront costs to cope with accelerate growth. In comparable terms  Core Opex per average MW adjusted by offshore costs  service fees  one-offs and forex increased 13% interannually.EBITDA summed 394 million euros (a 46% interannual increase) and EBIT 232 million euros (up 83% interannually)  a result which was mainly driven by a better top line evolution on the back of excellence operational performance from base portfolio. Net financial expenses increased to 74 million euros (up 20 million euros interannually)  with YoY comparison mainly affected by higher debt  higher average cost of debt YoY along with forex translation.Net profit summed 66 million euros (up 75% interannually)  being partially offset by higher taxes  financials and higher non-controlling interests at 61 million euros (up 51 million euros interannually) as a result of positive top-line performance in NCI portfolio.At the close of March 2022 the Net Debt totalled 4.217 million euros (up 1.282 million euros compared to December 2021)  reflecting EDPR's investment strategy and the recent acquisition of Sunseap  that offsets 365 million euros of asset rotation proceeds cashed in January from a transaction in Portugal.Institutional Partnership Liabilities summed 1.517 million euros (down 20 million euros compared to December 2021) reflecting benefits captured by the projects.",neutral,0.08,0.87,0.05,mixed,0.32,0.27,0.42,True,English,"['EDP Renováveis', 'net profit', '66 million euros', 'previous year', 'EDPR', 'fourth largest renewable energy producer', 'long-term average Gross Capacity Factor', ""Miguel Stilwell d'Andrade"", 'average selling price', 'higher renewable resource', 'global market leader', 'excellence operational performance', 'positive top-line performance', 'asset rotation proceeds', 'Institutional Partnership Liabilities', 'higher average cost', 'higher non-controlling interest', 'top line evolution', 'Other operating income', 'key growth regions', 'Net financial expenses', 'positive forex translation', 'new solar projects', 'previous financial year', 'portfolio mix effect', 'EBIT 232 million euros', 'additional capacity MW', '35% load factor', 'energy transition', 'higher capacity', 'previous year', 'solar capacity', 'average MW', 'higher taxes', 'higher debt', 'interannual evolution', 'negative effect', 'operating assets', 'solar technology', 'Operating Costs', 'net profit', 'Capacity additions', 'Net Debt', 'Financial results', '66 million euros', '569 million euros', '20 million euros', '5 million euros', '241 million euros', '74 million euros', '61 million euros', '51 million euros', '4.217 million euros', '82 million euros', 'EDP Renewables', 'first quarter', 'North American', 'successful integration', 'clean electricity', 'CO 2 emissions', 'last 12 months', 'Renewables index', 'solid growth', 'strong positioning', 'strategic plan', 'upfront costs', 'comparable terms', 'service fees', '46% interannual increase', 'YoY comparison', 'debt YoY', 'investment strategy', 'recent acquisition', 'base portfolio', 'NCI portfolio', 'Sunseap assets', 'Q1 period', 'Core Opex', 'offshore costs', 'EDPR revenues', '1.1 GW equity', '81 million', 'Q1 2022', '465 MW', '450 MW', '46 MW', '3 MW', '401 MW', '15 MW', '1.569 MW', '14 GW', '13 GW', '2.4 GW', 'Euronext', 'world', 'figure', 'financials', 'others', 'Spain', 'Portugal', 'total', 'wind', 'Europe', 'Asia-Pacific', 'March', 'construction', '9.2 TWh', '6mt', 'words', 'CEO', 'platforms', 'team', 'impact', 'back', 'one-offs', 'EBITDA', 'close', 'December', 'January', 'transaction', 'benefits', '394']",2022-05-04,2022-05-05,edpr.com

4254,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.risk.net/commodities/7946921/trade-finance-house-of-the-year-tramontana-asset-management,Trade finance house of the year: Tramontana Asset Management,6 hours ago,In the increasingly volatile market conditions of 2021  Tramontana Asset Management developed and deployed trade finance solutions to satisfy corporate demand for financing. These solutions have simultaneously provided a growing number of institutional investors with the opportunity to participate in the energy transition. For its innovative work in making the carbon markets accessible to mainstream investors and providing corporates with better access to financing  Tramontana has won Energy Risk’s 2022 Trade finance house of the year award.As a specialist investment company  Tramontana develops hedging and financing solutions for corporate clients  partnering with large institutional investors to fund these transactions. The team of eight people has built up more than $5 billion in assets under management since its 2014 launch  focusing on the energy transition and carbon-backed financing.Managing directors and co-founders of Tramontana  Paul Jackman and Bharath Manium  believe a successful transition to a low-carbon economy requires the full support of global capital markets. The company took a large step towards that goal last year when it completed a significant financing transaction that served both a corporate hedger and a large financial institution looking for exposure to the energy transition space.Tramontana works with corporate clients to help implement effective hedging strategies that are unconstrained by the liquidity limitations of futures markets based on the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme. This particular solution was developed to minimise hedging slippage and reduce the balance sheet burden of managing the margining requirements of on-exchange hedge positions.“Our solution involves issuing secured ring-fenced notes  purchased by our financing partners  and acquiring carbon from the market  says Jackman. “The carbon certificates are held in a registry account for the duration of the note – this could be a three-  five- or seven-year note  depending on the transaction. The corporate client then buys the carbon certificates at the end of that tenor.”The solution  which Jackman describes as “a scalable  multi-issuance programme”  repackages energy transition-related assets as standard notes so they can be held in clearing systems such as Euroclear and Clearstream. Physical energy assets cannot be held in clearing systems  an issue that has traditionally left many institutional investors reluctant to participate in this growing market. This solution solves the accounting  regulatory and management challenges of holding such assets.Furthermore  to provide investors such as pension funds and insurers with pure-play investments in this space  Tramontana mitigates non-carbon-specific risks such as credit risk via hedging and various collateralisation solutions.As a result  Tramontana has been able to build a deeper and wider liquidity pool to fund such transactions by attracting wider investor interest  such as the specialist UK pension firm it worked with for the first time last year. According to Manium and Jackman  the growth in investor interest has seen Tramontana’s typical transaction size increase by more than 40% year on year.“Our financing partners are sophisticated institutions who are familiar with structured finance and comfortable with the associated documentation and operational complexity ” explains Manium. “The key objective in our attempt to widen market participation in our products  was to make them more accessible to insurance and pension fund investors  who have traditionally been less active in structured finance linked to the energy transition.”Although interest in green investments has undoubtedly grown in recent years  Tramontana’s trade finance solution aims to enable greater access to the market  boosting opportunities for corporate hedgers.“The energy transition is a topic everyone is discussing. Many companies are putting targets in place for investing in environmental  social and governance strategies  and so investments like these are integral to that kind of strategy ” says Manium. “But I think the situation we currently find ourselves in is that there is a lot of demand from investors but not enough assets.”Jackman adds: “Tramontana’s carbon-backed securities programme enables non-specialist investors to access energy transition markets and has opened the door to a significantly deeper pool of investor capital to be deployed in the energy transition space.”The investment firm has clearly achieved its aim of boosting access to carbon markets for the wider capital markets  in turn significantly increasing its corporate clients’ access to capital for trade finance and risk management activities.,neutral,0.11,0.86,0.03,negative,0.01,0.05,0.94,True,English,"['Trade finance house', 'Tramontana Asset Management', 'year', 'specialist UK pension firm', 'Emissions Trading Scheme', 'balance sheet burden', 'exchange hedge positions', 'scalable, multi-issuance programme', 'large financial institution', 'secured ring-fenced notes', 'carbon-backed securities programme', 'typical transaction size', '2022 Trade finance house', 'various collateralisation solutions', 'pension fund investors', 'specialist investment company', 'wider liquidity pool', 'volatile market conditions', 'global capital markets', 'wider capital markets', 'risk management activities', 'trade finance solutions', 'energy transition-related assets', 'Physical energy assets', 'large institutional investors', 'energy transition markets', 'wider investor interest', 'many institutional investors', 'effective hedging strategies', 'energy transition space', 'significant financing transaction', 'Tramontana Asset Management', 'corporate clients’ access', 'investment firm', 'pension funds', 'Energy Risk', 'large step', 'investor capital', 'liquidity limitations', 'futures markets', 'standard notes', 'structured finance', 'Many companies', 'governance strategies', 'successful transition', 'carbon-backed financing', 'credit risk', 'carbon markets', 'management challenges', 'corporate hedger', 'mainstream investors', 'non-specialist investors', 'financing solutions', 'growing number', 'innovative work', 'eight people', 'Managing directors', 'low-carbon economy', 'full support', 'European Union', 'margining requirements', 'registry account', 'clearing systems', 'accounting, regulatory', 'carbon-specific risks', 'first time', 'sophisticated institutions', 'associated documentation', 'operational complexity', 'key objective', 'recent years', 'enough assets', 'deeper pool', 'financing partners', 'carbon certificates', 'growing market', 'market participation', 'hedging slippage', 'greater access', 'pure-play investments', 'green investments', 'corporate demand', 'particular solution', 'seven-year note', 'year award', 'Bharath Manium', 'Paul Jackman', 'opportunity', 'corporates', 'transactions', 'team', '2014 launch', 'founders', 'goal', 'exposure', 'duration', 'end', 'tenor', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'issue', 'insurers', 'result', 'growth', 'attempt', 'products', 'insurance', 'opportunities', 'topic', 'everyone', 'targets', 'place', 'social', 'kind', 'strategy', 'situation', 'lot', 'door', 'aim', 'turn']",2022-05-05,2022-05-05,risk.net

The operating profit rate was 6.4% (6.0%).• The operating profit of ESL Shipping was EUR 9.2 (4.5) million  Telko EUR 4.0 (4.6) million  and Leipurin EUR -0.4 (0.3) million.• Earnings per share increased to EUR 0.22 (0.19).• Net cash from operating activities was EUR 15.2 (6.6) million. Free cash flow was EUR 13.8 (5.1) million.Guidance for 2022Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit will be EUR 27–34 (42.4) million in 2022.Rolf Jansson  CEO of Aspo Group  comments on the first quarter of 2022:Peace in Eastern Europe was tragically disturbed after Russia invaded Ukraine at the end of February. Ever since  our key priority has been to protect our personnel’s safety in Ukraine. We have provided our Ukrainian employees and their family members with transportation to neighboring Poland and Romania  as well as accommodation. To our knowledge  none of our employees has been hurt or has died as a result of Russia’s acts of war.Aspo’s business environment is looking quite different from our estimate in our financial statements release. It is obvious that the operating environment has changed dramatically in eastern markets  and Russia’s reprehensible invasion will have an enduring impact on business opportunities in the region.As announced previously  Aspo has decided to withdraw Leipurin’s operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. We will investigate strategic alternatives  also including the possible divestment of these businesses. The more detailed schedule and implementation of the process will be evaluated  and the process will be carried out addressing the company’s employees and customers  as well as local legislation. Telko’s ability to continue its operations in Russia has deteriorated  and the stricter sanctions have accelerated the adaptation of operations. Since the war broke out in Ukraine  the capital invested in Telko’s warehouse and receivables in Russia has decreased by roughly 30%. The investigation of strategic alternatives for Telko’s operations in Russia is being actively continued. The majority of ESL Shipping’s operations related to Russia has been suspended  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. All transportation operations related to Russia are expected to stop by the end of the year. Aspo’s management is closely monitoring the progress and impact of the crisis and will assess and carry out any further measures on a business-specific basis.Aspo’s financial results for the first quarter of 2022 can be regarded as excellent. The Group’s net sales increased by 23% to EUR 162.6 million. The growth target of 5–10% was significantly exceeded. Operating profit also increased significantly from the comparative period to EUR 10.1 million and 6.2%. The operating profit of Telko and Leipurin for the first quarter was particularly affected by their warehouses in Ukraine  which were destroyed as a result of Russia’s acts of war  and credit loss provisions associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine. Considering the Group as a whole  items affecting comparability totaled EUR -4.9 million during the first quarter. This also includes ESL Shipping’s sales gains of EUR 1.5 million  attributable to the sale of the barge Espa. The Group’s comparable operating profit for the first quarter was record-high at EUR 15.0 (7.9) million. The comparable operating profit was 9.2% (6.0%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Earnings per share increased to EUR 0.21 (0.19)  with the impact of items affecting comparability on earnings per share being approximately EUR -0.13. Net cash from operating activities remained at a very strong level. All this results from our personnel’s strong commitment and our operational successes in a very challenging market environment.Our strong result during the first quarter was particularly driven by ESL Shipping’s excellent performance. The shipping company’s net sales increased by 31% to EUR 56.8 (43.4) million  and its comparable operating profit was EUR 7.9 (4.5) million and 13.9% (10.4%)  nearly achieving the target level of 14.0%.Telko also continued its strong performance. Telko’s net sales increased by 31% to EUR 75.9 million  and its comparable operating profit was EUR 8.6 (4.6) million and 11.3% (7.9%)  exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Leipurin’s net sales remained at the comparative period’s level at EUR 27.7 (28.0) million. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit during the first quarter was EUR 0.7 (0.3) million and 2.5% (1.1%). The operating profit target set for Leipurin is 5%. Leipurin’s comparable operating profit without Vulganus was EUR 1.0 (0.5) million and operating profit rate 4.0% (1.9%).On March 2  2022  Aspo canceled its guidance for 2022 due to uncertainties caused by Russia’s acts of war and the resulting sanctions. Even though the exceptional circumstances caused by the war still involve significant uncertainties  we were already able to issue a new guidance at the beginning of April  according to which Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit will be EUR 27–34 million in 2022.Even though our operating environment has undergone dramatic changes  we will continue to determinedly implement our strategy published in December. According to the strategy  Aspo will focus on expanding its business in western markets. Decisions on solutions concerning operations in Russia will be made in a controlled manner  also considering the position of employees and any restrictions set by local legislation.ASPO GROUPFinancial results and targetsOn December 1  2021  Aspo published new long-term financial targets:• Operating profit of 8%• Net sales growth 5–10% per year• Return on equity of over 20%• Gearing less than 130%With regard to Aspo’s businesses  ESL Shipping’s operating profit target is 14%  Telko’s 8% and Leipurin’s 5%.Aspo’s net sales increased by 24% during the first quarter of 2022. The comparable operating profit rate was 9.2% (6.0%)  clearly exceeding the target level of 8.0%. Return on equity remained high at 21.2% (21.8%). Gearing decreased to 118.8% (129.4%).Aspo Group’s comparable operating profit from continuing and discontinued operationsAspo Group’s comparable operating profit includes results for continuing and discontinued operations. The comparable operating profit is presented less significant items affecting comparability that are rare and deviate from normal business operations. These include impairment losses  sales gains from vessels  and financial losses caused by the war.Aspo announced in December 2021 that the Kauko business segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  have been defined as businesses outside Aspo’s core operations. As a result  the Kauko business segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in consolidated reporting in accordance with IFRS  and its results are reported separately from the figures of Aspo Group’s continuing operations. With regard to the income statement  comparative periods’ figures have been restated to correspond to the same presentation method. The results of Vulganus are reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations.SustainabilitySustainability is a key factor in guiding Aspo’s management system and the process of investigating new investment objects. Aspo’s businesses aim to be forerunners in sustainability in their respective sectors. To support the sustainability commitments  Aspo published new environmental  social and corporate governance (ESG) targets for the Group and significant parts of its businesses. The key goal is to reduce the emission intensity  CO2e (tn) per net sales (EUR thousand)  by 30% by 2025. The starting point (2020) is 0.44  while the target level (2025) is 0.30. During the past 12 months  the emission intensity continued to improve  driven by business growth  and it was 0.39 (0.42). Another key target is to improve the Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate (LTIF). During the past 12 months  LTIF was 7.6 (8.8)  while the target for 2022 is 7.0. The long-term goal is zero occupational accidents.The impact of the war in Ukraine on Aspo’s operating environmentAspo’s operating environment has changed dramatically in a short period of time. The European security environment has deteriorated as a result of Russia’s armed invasion of Ukraine. The invasion has caused direct losses for Aspo’s businesses through the destruction of warehouses in Ukraine  for example. The indirect impact on Aspo’s business operations includes the significant fluctuations in prices and exchange rates. Suspended business operations in Ukraine due to the war have caused financial losses. The war drastically reduces operating conditions in eastern markets as a result of operational challenges and regulations  but particularly based on values. The sanctions imposed by western countries and Russia’s legislative measures prevent the transportation of goods and the transfer of payments  rapidly reducing net sales and profitability. As the level of security has decreased  vessel operations have also been restricted and Russian products cannot be transported. The operating environment is expected to become even more challenging  and no rapid solution is in sight. In western markets  Russia’s acts of war have only had a minor impact at present  while the impact on financial development  production and supply chains  and inflation will be significant.Russia accounts for less than 15% of the Group’s equity  and this share will continue to be actively reduced. Aspo’s assets in Russia are mainly related to inventories and trade receivables. The financial significance of small-scale production operations is very minor for the Group. Approximately 170 employees of Aspo Group’s all personnel work in Russia.In news  the coronavirus pandemic has been overshadowed by Russia’s invasion  but its impact can still be felt in our operating environment. The global shortage of components  caused by the pandemic  has an impact on certain Aspo’s businesses  decelerating trading and the completion of orders. The risk of infections must still be taken into account in daily operations and especially among crew members.The Group’s main market areas are Finland  Scandinavia  the Baltic region  and eastern markets (Russia  other CIS countries  and Ukraine). The relative share of net sales in eastern markets decreased during the first quarter of 2022  mainly due to the war in Ukraine. According to the previously announced strategy  the company will direct its growth investments at western markets.Cash flow and financingThe Group’s cash flow from operating activities in January–March was EUR 15.2 (6.6) million. The impact of the change in working capital on cash flow during the review period was EUR -0.6 (-7.2) million. Free cash flow during the first quarter was EUR 13.8 (5.1) million. Investments mainly consisted of the dockage of ESL Shipping’s vessels.Net interest-bearing debt decreased to EUR 159.5 million  and gearing fell to 118.8% (3/2021: 139.0%; 12/2021: 129.4%). The Group’s equity ratio at the end of the period was 31.4%(3/2021: 31.1%; 12/2021: 32.0%).Net financial expenses in January–March totaled EUR -1.8 (-0.9) million. The impact of exchange rate fluctuations on the increase in financial expenses was EUR -0.9 million. The average rate of interest-bearing liabilities  excluding lease liabilities  was 1.3% (1.5%).The Group’s liquidity position remained strong. Cash and cash equivalents were EUR 41.3 million at the end of the review period (12/2021: EUR 17.7 million). Committed revolving credit facilities  totaling EUR 40.0 million  were fully unused  as in the comparative period. EUR 20 million of Aspo’s EUR 80 million commercial paper program were in use (3/2021: EUR 8 million; 12/2021: EUR 5 million).On March 28  2022  Aspo announced that it will exercise its right to withdraw the full hybrid loan of EUR 20 million with 8.75% interest issued on April 30  2020. The hybrid loan was repaid on May 2  2022.Short-term risks and uncertainties in business operationsThe tensions between Russia and Ukraine that ignited in 2014 intensified until the beginning of this year and erupted in Russia’s armed invasion of Ukraine in February. The invasion has caused considerable human suffering and devastating destruction in Ukraine. Risks classified previously as geopolitical risks have materialized in various ways as material losses and threats directed at the personnel  as well as significant decreases in business in crisis areas. As a result of different sanctions  legislative obstacles and value-driven causes  it has become more difficult to engage in business in Russia  and no relief is in sight in the foreseeable future. Aspo’s businesses in Russia will be affected by the restrictions imposed due to the war  and it is possible that this will cause financial losses for Aspo. The impact will also extend to Aspo’s operations in Belarus and Kazakhstan. At present  it is impossible to estimate the duration or extent of Russia’s acts of war in Ukraine.Globally  there are many geopolitical risk clusters  the development of which is difficult to predict. Changes in these regions may be rapid and unpredictable  which is why it is difficult to estimate their potential impact on Aspo’s businesses. International sanctions have been imposed  which may also affect Aspo’s businesses directly or indirectly. In addition  various countries have imposed import bans or other trade restrictions on each other’s products. Geopolitical tensions can escalate and cause direct damage to business  payments and even suspend business operations in a crisis area or in areas affected by it. The crisis can also lead to human  economic and monetary losses. Possible sanctions  including counter-sanctions  and any changes in them could lead to business difficulties and economic losses.Increased economic activity has caused the prices of many raw materials  components and logistics services to increase rapidly  and increased uncertainties over the functioning of logistics in certain market situations. Aspo may temporarily benefit from this increase in prices  while the prices of purchased raw materials or leased capacity  such as leased vessels  are increasing at the same time. Longer delivery times for spare parts  components and raw materials  and any rapid price changes in different market situations  are also increasing risks. Growing inflation and rising interest rates may decelerate general economic growth and reduce demand for Aspo’s businesses. Furthermore  any non-functioning or restricted functioning of logistics due to sanctions or other causes may restrict Aspo’s businesses  and they may also be affected by cyber risks and disruptions in information systems.In line with its renewed strategy  Aspo aims to increase its steady results through acquisitions. Strategy execution may lead to a temporary deterioration in the balance sheet and capital structure in situations where acquisitions require financial investments and consequently may reduce solvency.The coronavirus pandemic continues to have an impact on Aspo’s businesses. Any new variants of coronavirus and their rapid spread may lead to various interruptions and financial losses.Because the future estimates presented in this interim report are based on the current situation  they involve risks and other uncertainties  due to which actual future outcomes may differ from the estimates.ASPO’S BUSINESSESESL ShippingESL Shipping is the leading dry bulk cargo company in the Baltic Sea region. ESL Shipping’s operations are mainly based on long-term customer contracts and established customer relationships. At the end of the review period  the shipping company’s fleet consisted of 48 vessels with a total capacity of 456 000 deadweight tonnage (dwt). Of these  23 were wholly owned (75% of the tonnage)  two were minority owned (2%) and the remaining 23 vessels (23%) were time chartered. ESL Shipping’s competitive edge is based on its pioneering role and ability to responsibly secure product and raw material transportation for industries and energy production year-round  even in difficult conditions. The shipping company loads and unloads large ocean liners at sea as a special service.The first quarter was yet again the strongest in ESL Shipping’s history. Net sales increased by 31% from the comparative period to EUR 56.8 (43.4) million. During the quarter  the operating profit more than doubled to a record-high level of EUR 9.2 (4.5) million. It includes sales gains of EUR 1.5 million attributable to the sale of the barge Espa and cost provisions of approximately EUR -0.2 million related to the shutdown of operations in Russia. The comparable operating profit increased significantly to EUR 7.9 (4.5) million.The strong result is a good indication of the effectiveness of the shipping company’s partnership strategy  and the entire personnel’s operational success in challenging operating conditions. The comparable operating profit rate of 13.9% (10.4%) achieved during the first quarter was excellent  considering the challenging ice conditions in the Bothnian Bay compared with previous years  and the target level of 14.0% was nearly achieved.As announced previously  the majority of ESL Shipping’s operations related to Russia has been suspended  and the released vessel capacity has been transferred to other operating areas. All transportation operations in Russia are expected to stop by the end of the year at the latest. The schedule depends on any obligations set in existing customer contracts. ESL Shipping has also suspended the start-up of its previously established Russian company.The profitability of all the shipping company’s vessel categories was historically strong during the first quarter. In contract traffic  demand for transportation remained strong throughout the review period  and market freight rates were at a high level in all customer segments and vessel categories. With regard to ship fuels  the price of diesel doubled and that of LNG  which suffered the most from disruptions in European energy markets  was nearly four times higher than in the comparative period  but the impact of the price increases on costs are offset through long-term fuel clauses in transportation agreements.The current level of very high fuel surcharges will increase net sales and reduce the operating profit rate  used as an indicator of relative profitability  even though no actual changes would take place in the absolute operating profit. The volume of cargo transported by the shipping company during the first quarter increased from the comparative period to 3.8 (3.5) million tonnes.The program for building the shipping company’s new next-generation low emission electric hybrid vessels has proceeded as planned  and the metal construction of the first vessel started in the middle of March. The vessels are expected to start operations from the third quarter of 2023 onwards at three-month intervals. The scheduled dockage of the current fleet continued when a larger vessel was docked for roughly one week during the first quarter.The long-term development of sustainability and the maintenance of a high level of safety are characteristic to the shipping company’s operations. ESL Shipping’s long-term environmental activities focus on minimizing emissions to the sea and air. The shipping company aims to halve its carbon dioxide emissions per transportation unit by the end of the decade. In this  the “Virtual arrival” model deployed by the shipping company plays a significant role  in which contractual practices for ship scheduling will be updated in cooperation with customers and ports to enable environmentally friendlier vessel operations. Savings in energy costs will be distributed between the shipping company and each customer so that both parties benefit from the new policy. During the first quarter  the emission intensity of ESL Shipping’s transportation operations decreased by 17% from the comparative period to 15.8 grams of carbon dioxide per ton mile.ESL Shipping outlook for 2022Demand for transportation and the price level of sea freights in the company’s main market area in Northern Europe are at a satisfactory level in all vessel categories. Most of the shipping company’s transportation capacity has been secured through long-term agreements. After deliveries of Russian raw materials stopped  certain of the shipping company’s significant contractual customers were forced to seek new suppliers for part of their production input required in new geographic areas. This is expected to extend transportation distances and increase demand for sea transportation per ton mile among ESL Shipping’s largest vessels.In the short term and especially during the second quarter  the volumes of raw materials transported by Handysize vessels will decrease from previous estimates  as customers’ procurement activities shift away from Russia. The timing of transportation volumes will also be affected by maintenance stoppages at ports and railroad maintenance in Northern Sweden. Restrictions on vessel sizes at ports in the company’s main market area and at its customers’ ports  combined with the need for year-round transportation  will again secure ESL Shipping’s transportation demand starting from the second half of the year when deliveries shipped from across the oceans to replace Russian raw materials reach Europe and are shipped further to customers.In the smaller vessel category  transportation demand in contract traffic is expected to remain at a satisfactory level. However  customers’ supply chains may involve challenges in the availability of raw materials that may also have an impact on realized product transportation volumes. Vessel rents that have partly increased to an unhealthy level are starting to decrease  and the availability of additional capacity is expected to improve during the second and third quarters. The determined preventive measures will continue to protect the personnel’s health security during the coronavirus pandemic.In Northern Europe  there continues to be considerable growth in interest among customers in environmentally friendly maritime transport that produces as low carbon emissions as possible. In addition to ESL Shipping’s investments in new highly environmentally friendly vessels  the shipping company is preparing long-term cooperation with leading energy suppliers to provide sea transportation with even lower carbon emissions  and even fossil-free transportation  in the future.With regard to the order placed for the Green Coaster electric hybrid vessels and its options  the shipping company is preparing investors’ entry in the ownership and operations of vessels within a pooling arrangement  which is a common practice in international shipping operations. The aim is to accelerate ESL Shipping’s operational growth and improve its profitability and return on capital.During the rest of 2022  two larger and four smaller vessel units will be docked for a total of approximately 95 days. In total  there will be approximately 105 dockage days in 2022. In 2021  the corresponding figure was 229. After these dockages  all vessels owned by ESL Shipping will be equipped with ballast water treatment systems that meet new environmental regulations.TelkoTelko is a leading expert in and supplier of plastic raw materials  industrial chemicals and lubricants. It operates as a sustainable partner in the value chain  bringing well-known international principals and customers together. Its competitive edge is based on strong technical support  efficient logistics and local expert service both in the east and the west. Telko operates in Finland  the Baltic countries  Scandinavia  Poland  Romania  Russia  Belarus  Ukraine  Kazakhstan  Uzbekistan  and China.Kauko has been defined as a business outside Aspo’s core operations. As a result  Kauko’s figures are no longer reported as part of Telko. Kauko’s figures have been removed from all of Telko’s figures.During the first quarter  Telko’s net sales grew strongly to EUR 75.9 (58.0) million. Its operating profit for the first quarter decreased to EUR 4.0 (4.6) million. The operating profit rate was 5.3% (7.9%). The operating result includes items affecting comparability of EUR -4.6 million relating to the destroyed warehouse in Ukraine and a credit loss provision associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine. Sales were significantly affected by the increase in prices after the outbreak of the war in Ukraine  which also raised sales margins to an unusually high level. Then again  exchange rate losses resulting from the steep decline in the value of the Russian ruble reduced the results. Without the items affecting comparability  Telko’s operating result for the first quarter was EUR 8.6 (4.6) million  and its operating profit rate was 11.3% (7.9%). Telko has focused on assisting its employees and their families in Ukraine  helping them evacuate  and providing accommodation for those fleeing the war. While sales have decreased steeply in Ukraine  Telko is committed to continuing its operations in the country.In Russia  Telko focuses on selling its existing stocks as announced previously. After the war broke out in Ukraine  the capital invested in Telko’s warehouse and receivables in Russia has decreased by roughly 30%. Telko’s ability to continue its operations in Russia has deteriorated  and stricter sanctions have accelerated the adaptation of operations. The investigation of strategic alternatives continues.In western markets  Telko’s sales developed as planned  and the Ukrainian crisis has not had any direct impact on operations. Demand remained stable in all of Telko’s business operations  while difficulties in availability continued to restrict the development of volumes in all operations. Prices remained high in all operations and even increased in several business areas. Telko has continued its growth efforts in western markets  which has had an impact on the increase in costs.The net sales of the plastics business increased by 22% during the first quarter to EUR 39.3 (32.1) million. The price level of plastics was clearly higher than during the comparative period in all product groups  and the average price of sales increased significantly. Prices partly reached a historically unusual level. While availability problems have decreased  challenges still remain in certain product groups. Customer demand was at a normal level. However  the high price levels of raw materials and energy have forced certain customers to temporarily restrict their production.The net sales of the chemicals business increased by 53% to EUR 25.3 (16.5) million. The exceptional demand in eastern markets and high price levels are reflected in the first quarter’s figures. In general  product prices increased in nearly all product groups in all markets. Delays in deliveries have been common. In addition  transportation prices are increasing clearly in Europe. Demand in key customer segments has remained stable  even though the high cost level is starting to affect companies’ operations.The net sales of the lubricants business increased by 20% to EUR 11.3 (9.4) million. Telko acquired all shares in Estonian Mentum AS at the end of 2021. As a result of the acquisition  Telko’s sales of lubricants increased significantly from the previous year. Prices of lubricants increased clearly during the beginning of the year. Availability issues have not been as significant as in other business areas. Telko has discontinued its small-scale lubricants business in Russia.Telko outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and its consequences have a significant impact on Telko’s outlook for the rest of the year. The outlook for the second quarter is relatively strong  driven by the strong increase in prices  while the outlook for the rest of the year is very uncertain due to the geopolitical situation and its broader impact on markets.In Russia  Telko focuses on actively reducing its working capital. As a result  sales are expected to remain strong during the next few months and decline steeply towards the end of the year. Telko will continue its operations in Ukraine  while sales are expected to remain very low and operations are expected to produce a loss this year.In general  product prices are expected to remain high as a result of increases in crude oil prices and prolonged difficulties in deliveries. Demand is expected to remain fairly strong. Production difficulties due to the availability of raw materials and components independent of Telko will have a negative impact on Telko’s certain customer groups. The war in Ukraine is expected to have an indirect impact on general cost levels  logistics and goods flows.Due to the steep decline in net sales in Russia and Belarus  Telko’s net sales are expected to decrease significantly towards the end of the year. The EU’s latest sanctions will accelerate this change. Of Telko’s businesses  the chemicals business has held the highest relative share in Russia.According to its strategy  Telko will seek not only organic growth in the western markets  but also acquisition targets that accelerate the achievement of the strategic goals set for Telko.LeipurinLeipurin operates as part of the food chain  acquiring raw materials in global markets and from domestic companies and supplying them through its effective logistics chain according to customer needs. Leipurin operates in eight countries that have been grouped into three regional organizations  each being responsible for their financial performance: Finland  East  and the Baltic region. Leipurin serves bakery  food industry and foodservice customers by providing raw materials and by supporting research and development and recipes for new products. Leipurin’s other product categories include various supplies and machines for the same customer segments. Leipurin uses leading international manufacturers as its raw material and machinery supply partners.Vulganus Oy manufactures and maintains refrigeration and freezing solutions for the food industry through its spiral products. Vulganus has been classified as held for sale  but its results are still reported as part of the Leipurin segment.Leipurin’s net sales during the first quarter remained at the comparative period’s level at EUR 27.7 (28.0) million. During the comparative period  machine sales in Russia significantly increased net sales. In Finland  net sales increased by 14% to EUR 10.4 (9.1) million. In the Baltic region  net sales increased by 19% to EUR 8.0 (6.7) million. Net sales in East developed positively until the war broke out in Ukraine and increased by 3% to EUR 6.8 million (6.6) during the quarter. During the first quarter  sales to bakeries increased by 12% to EUR 18.2 (16.3) million. Sales to the food industry fell short of the target in the Baltic region and Ukraine  being EUR 2.6 (2.6) million. At the beginning of the year  the euro-denominated increase in sales was driven by the significantly grown global market prices of raw materials but  measured in kilograms  sales also increased to the pre-pandemic level. The cost of living increased significantly in Finland and the Baltic region  strengthening the shift in consumer demand toward more affordable products.The outbreak of the war in Ukraine during the last week of February drastically changed Leipurin’s operating environment. Leipurin prioritized the security and livelihood of its personnel in Ukraine. After the period under review  Leipurin decided to withdraw its operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. Leipurin will investigate strategic alternatives  also including the possible divestment of these businesses. The more detailed schedule and implementation of the process will be evaluated  and the process will be carried out addressing the company’s employees and customers  as well as local legislation. Leipurin will continue its operations in Ukraine.The impact of the coronavirus pandemic decreased significantly during the beginning of the year. The development of the sales margin was particularly positive  with the margin also exceeding the level preceding the outbreak of the pandemic in 2019.Leipurin’s operating result for the first quarter was EUR -0.4 (0.3) million  and the operating profit rate was -1.4% (1.1%). Losses of EUR -0.7 million from Leipurin’s warehouse destroyed in Ukraine and a credit loss provision of EUR -0.2 million associated with accounts receivable in Ukraine reduced Leipurin’s operating result for the first quarter. In addition  a provision of approximately EUR -0.2 million was recognized in relation to the company’s adaptation measures in Russia. These items affecting comparability totaled EUR -1.1 million. The comparable operating profit for the first quarter stood at EUR 0.7 (0.3) million  and the comparable operating profit rate was 2.5% (1.1%).Rising market prices for steel raw materials  slow progress in after sales during the first part of the year and cost overruns in certain projects continued to significantly reduce the profitability of Vulganus Oy’s machine manufacturing operations. Vulganus’s net sales during the first quarter stood at EUR 2.5 (1.4) million  and its operating loss was EUR -0.3 (-0.2) million.The profit management program launched during the second quarter of 2021 will develop the capability of knowledge management and help to improve the commercial performance. Key tools include Group-wide category management and the improved efficiency of the supply chain and logistics. The management model already increased financial performance during 2021. The implementation of the program was particularly reflected in the positive development of results in Finland.Availability challenges still persist in different product categories. In Finland and the Baltic region  Leipurin has succeeded in using the post-pandemic recovery in demand. Sales measured in kilograms already exceeded the 2019 level  whereas they fell short of the level of the first quarter in 2019 in eastern markets.Leipurin outlook for 2022The war in Ukraine and the decision to withdraw operations from Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan will have a significant impact on Leipurin’s net sales and results.Increased energy prices will have a negative impact on demand for more valuable products  at least in the Baltic region. They will also cause profitability challenges for the bakery segment’s customers.The impact of the coronavirus pandemic and extreme weather conditions on global supply chains will be emphasized  affecting the availability of certain raw materials and general delivery times. Raw material prices are increasing steeply.The management of payment defaults and claims has succeeded well at present. Profitability challenges will increase risks of payment defaults and bankruptcies among customers and suppliers.Leipurin will continue its profit management program  and it will contribute to further improve financial performance in western markets. The knowledge management program helps Leipurin control rising costs and purchase prices and foresee their impact on customer prices.Vulganus’s order book for 2022 has been confirmed to be excellent.Other operationsOther operations include Aspo Group’s administration  the financial and ICT service center  and a small number of other functions not covered by business units. The operating result for other operations was EUR -2.5 (-1.6) million in the first quarter. The share-based payment of EUR -0.5 million granted to Aspo’s previous CEO was included in the operating result of other operations. In addition  the difference from the comparative period can be explained by expert costs associated with various projects.COMPANY INFORMATIONAspo aims to achieve sustainable long-term growth by re-investing earned profits in profitable investment objects and by taking steps towards a compounder profile.

In other respects  the same accounting and measurement principles have been applied as in the consolidated financial statements of December 31  2021. The information in this interim report is unaudited.Aspo Plc applies the guidance on alternative key figures issued by ESMA. In addition to IFRS figures  the company releases other commonly used key figures  which are mainly derived from the statement of comprehensive income and balance sheet. According to the management  key figures clarify the view drawn by the statement of comprehensive income and balance sheet of Aspo’s financial performance and financial position. The calculation principles of key figures are explained on page 71 of the Aspo’s Year 2021 publication.PersonnelAt the end of the review period  Aspo Group had 927 employees (944 at the end of 2021)  of which discontinued operations accounted for 23 (22) employees.Segment informationAspo Group’s reportable segments are ESL Shipping  Telko and Leipurin.Investment commitmentAtoBatC Shipping AB  reported in the ESL Shipping segment  is building a series of six highly energy-efficient electric hybrid vessels. The new vessels of ice class 1A will be top of the line in terms of their cargo capacity  technology and innovation. The total value of the six-vessel investment is approximately EUR 70 million  and its cash flows will be divided mainly for the years 2023 and 2024. The new vessels will be built at the Chowgule and Company Private Limited shipyard in India  and they will start operating from the third quarter of 2023.Discontinued operations and other disposal groups held for saleThe Kauko operating segment and Vulganus Oy  part of the Leipurin segment  were defined as non-core businesses for Aspo in December 2021. As a result  the Kauko operating segment has been classified as a discontinued operation in group reporting in accordance with IFRS 5 standard  and its results and balance sheet items are reported separately from the continuing operations of Aspo Group. In the statement of comprehensive income  the figures of the comparative periods have been restated. On the balance sheet  the assets of the Kauko operating segment are reported under “Assets held for sale” and liabilities under “Liabilities directly associated with assets classified as held for sale”. Vulganus Oy’s assets and liabilities classified as held for sale are presented similarly. In the statement of comprehensive income  Vulganus is reported as part of the Leipurin segment’s figures and Aspo Group’s continuing operations. The reporting of balance sheet items on separate rows starts at the time of classification  and the figures of the comparative period (3/2021) have not therefore been restated.Profit from discontinued operations includes the income and expenses of Kauko operating segment  insofar as they are considered to transfer outside Aspo Group in conjunction with the divestment. Therefore  the profit from discontinued operations does not include all internal administrative charges of Aspo Group allocated to Kauko operating segment. As a result  the profit from discontinued operations during the first quarter is EUR 0.1 (0.1) million higher than the Kauko operating segment’s profit. Vulganus Oy’s profit is included in the Leipurin segment’s profit.Assets and liabilities of discontinued operations include the figures of the Kauko segment. The other assets held for sale with associated liabilities pertain to Vulganus Oy. The classification includes the share of the assets and liabilities of Aspo Group that belong to the Kauko operating segment and Vulganus Oy  excluding internal assets and liabilities that have been eliminated. Assets and liabilities have been measured at their carrying amount. The recognition of depreciation ended at the time of classification as held for sale on December 1  2021.Net cash flows of discontinued operations consist of the Kauko operating segment’s share of Aspo Group’s cash flows.Events after the review periodOn April 22  2022  Aspo announced that Leipurin will withdraw from operations in Russia  Belarus and Kazakhstan. The majority of ESL Shipping’s operations in Russia have been suspended and the ship capacity has been transferred to other traffic areas. All transports related to Russia are estimated to end by the end of the year. Telko continues to focus on selling the still existing inventories in Russia. Telko’s conditions for continuing to operate in Russia have weakened significantly  and the tightened sanctions have accelerated the adjustment of operations.Aspo Plc’s Annual Shareholders’ Meeting held on April 6  2022  decided  as proposed by the Board of Directors  that EUR 0.23 per share be distributed in dividends for the 2021 financial year  and that no dividend be paid for shares held by Aspo Plc. The dividend was paid on April 19  2022.On March 28  2022  Aspo announced that it will exercise its right to withdraw in full the hybrid loan of EUR 20 million with 8.75% interest issued on April 30  2020. The hybrid loan was repaid on May 2  2022.Source: Aspo Plc,negative,0.05,0.37,0.58,mixed,0.24,0.17,0.6,True,English,"['Aspo Group Interim Report', 'Comparable operating profit', 'Strong start', 'March', 'year', 'uncertainty', 'Aspo Group Interim Report', 'credit loss provisions', 'other operating areas', 'financial statements release', 'Free cash flow', 'challenging market environment', 'Comparable operating profit', 'operating profit rate', 'Group total level', 'operating environment', 'operating activities', 'financial results', 'The Group', 'Net cash', 'business environment', 'target level', 'strong level', 'Strong start', 'corresponding period', 'net sales', 'ESL Shipping', 'Rolf Jansson', 'first quarter', 'Eastern Europe', 'key priority', 'family members', 'neighboring Poland', 'eastern markets', 'reprehensible invasion', 'business opportunities', 'strategic alternatives', 'possible divestment', 'detailed schedule', 'local legislation', 'stricter sanctions', 'vessel capacity', 'business-specific basis', 'growth target', 'comparative period', 'accounts receivable', 'sales gains', 'barge Espa', 'strong commitment', 'operational successes', 'excellent performance', 'strong performance', 'shipping company', 'Ukrainian employees', 'enduring impact', 'strong result', 'continuing operations', 'January–March', 'transportation operations', 'year', 'uncertainty', 'Figures', 'brackets', 'Telko', 'Leipurin', 'Items', 'comparability', 'Earnings', 'share', 'Guidance', 'CEO', 'comments', 'Peace', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'personnel', 'safety', 'Romania', 'accommodation', 'knowledge', 'none', 'acts', 'war', 'estimate', 'region', 'Belarus', 'Kazakhstan', 'businesses', 'implementation', 'process', 'customers', 'adaptation', 'capital', 'receivables', 'investigation', 'majority', 'management', 'progress', 'crisis', 'measures', '2021', '2022']",2022-05-05,2022-05-05,hellenicshippingnews.com

A “Business Day” means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York  New York or Hartford  Connecticut are authorized or required by law or executive order to close or a day on which the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee’s corporate trust office is closed for business.RedemptionThe Junior Subordinated Notes may not be redeemed prior to maturity.Events of DefaultThe events of default and related provisions set forth under “Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes — Events of Default” in the accompanying Prospectus will apply to the Junior Subordinated Notes.Modification of IndentureIn addition to the purposes set forth under “Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes—Modification” in the accompanying Prospectus  the Company and the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee may from time to time  without the consent of any holders of Junior Subordinated Notes  amend and/or supplement the Subordinated Note Indenture for the following purposes:• following the Purchase Contract settlement date (August 1  2022)  to supplement any of the provisions of the Junior Subordinated Notes to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of the Junior Subordinated Notes pursuant to the Subordinated Note Indenture  provided that any such action will not adversely affect the interests of any holder of any Junior Subordinated Note in any material respect;• to set forth the terms of any series of Junior Subordinated Notes following a successful remarketing to incorporate the reset interest rate  incorporate semi-annual interest payment dates  to eliminate the optional redemption provision in the Series 2019B JSNs and to eliminate the interest deferral provisions in the Junior Subordinated Notes; and• to conform the terms of the Subordinated Note Indenture and the Junior Subordinated Notes to the descriptions thereof contained in the “Description of the Remarketable Junior Subordinated Notes ” “Description of the Equity Units ” “Description of the Purchase Contracts” and “Certain Provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement” sections in the preliminary prospectus supplement for the Equity Units  dated August 12  2019  as supplemented and/or amended by the related pricing term sheet.Agreement by Holders to Certain Tax TreatmentEach holder of the Junior Subordinated Notes will  by accepting the Junior Subordinated Notes or a beneficial interest therein  be deemed to have agreed that the holder will treat the Junior Subordinated Notes as indebtedness for United States federal  state and local tax purposes.Book-Entry Issuance—The Depository Trust CompanyEach series of Junior Subordinated Notes will be evidenced by one or more global notes registered in the name of DTC’s nominee  Cede & Co.  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. Such global notes will be deposited with the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee as custodian for DTC.DTC advises that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law  a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the 1934 Act. DTC holds securities that its participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between participants’ accounts  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include United States and Non-United States securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC  National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation  all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC isS-9owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others  including securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies and clearing corporations that clear transactions through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant  either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC.Purchases of the Junior Subordinated Notes under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants  which will receive a credit for the Junior Subordinated Notes on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Junior Subordinated Note (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchases  but Beneficial Owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transactions  as well as periodic statements of their holdings  from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which they purchased the Junior Subordinated Notes. Transfers of ownership interests on the Junior Subordinated Notes are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Junior Subordinated Notes  except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Junior Subordinated Notes is discontinued. To facilitate subsequent transfers  all Junior Subordinated Notes deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s nominee  Cede & Co.  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of the Junior Subordinated Notes with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Junior Subordinated Notes; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts the Junior Subordinated Notes are credited  which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants  by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Notices will be sent to DTC.Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s procedures. Under its usual procedures  DTC mails an omnibus proxy to the Company as soon as possible after the Record Date. The omnibus proxy assigns the voting or consenting rights of Cede & Co. to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Junior Subordinated Notes are credited on the Record Date. The Company believes that these arrangements will enable the Beneficial Owners to exercise rights equivalent in substance to the rights that can be directly exercised by a registered holder of the Junior Subordinated Notes.Payments of principal and interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes will be made to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee of DTC). DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the Company or the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of each participant and not of DTC  the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee or the Company  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal and interest to Cede & Co. (or other such nominee of DTC) is the Company’s responsibility. Disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC  and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners is the responsibility of Direct Participants and Indirect Participants.In a few special situations described below  a book-entry security representing the Company’s securities will terminate and interests in it will be exchanged for physical certificates representing the securities. After that exchange  the choice of whether to hold securities directly or in street name will be up to each Beneficial Owner. Each Beneficial Owner must consult its bank  broker or other financial institution to find out how to have its interests in the securities transferred to its name  so that it will be a direct holder.The special situations for termination of a Global Security representing the Junior Subordinated Notes are:• DTC notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for that Global Security or DTC ceases to be a “clearing agency” registered under the 1934 Act and the Company is unable to find a qualified replacement for DTC within 90 days; or• any event of default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes has occurred and is continuing  or any other event has occurred and is continuing  which after notice or lapse of time  would become an event of default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes  and any Beneficial Owner requests that its beneficial interest be exchanged for a physical certificate.S-10DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes at any time by giving the Company or the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee reasonable notice. In the event no successor securities depository is obtained  certificates for the Junior Subordinated Notes will be printed and delivered.The information in this section concerning DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that the Company believes to be reliable  but neither the Company nor any remarketing agent takes any responsibility for the accuracy thereof.The Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor  determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under the Subordinated Note Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Junior Subordinated Note (including any transfers between or among Direct Participants of DTC or Beneficial Owners of interests in any Junior Subordinated Note) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by  and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of  the Subordinated Note Indenture  and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.Neither the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee nor any agent shall have any responsibility or liability for any actions taken or not taken by DTC.Global Clearance and Settlement ProceduresSecondary market trading between Clearstream Banking  société anonyme   Luxembourg (“Clearstream”) participants and/or Euroclear system participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and the Euroclear system  as applicable. Cross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC  on the one hand  and directly or indirectly through Clearstream participants or Euroclear system participants  on the other  will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its United States depositary; however  such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will  if the transaction meets its settlement requirements  deliver instructions to its United States depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving securities in DTC  and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream participants and Euroclear system participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective United States depositaries. Because of time-zone differences  credits of Junior Subordinated Notes received in Clearstream or the Euroclear system as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or any transactions in such Junior Subordinated Notes settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Euroclear system participant or Clearstream participant on such business day. Cash received in Clearstream or the Euroclear system as a result of sales of the Junior Subordinated Notes by or through a Clearstream participant or a Euroclear system participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or the Euroclear system cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC.MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONSThe following is a general discussion of the material United States federal income tax considerations relevant to the acquisition  ownership and disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes  and insofar as it relates to matters of United States federal income tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto  constitutes the opinion of the Company’s tax counsel  Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP. Except where noted  this discussion only applies to Junior Subordinated Notes that are held as capital assets by holders who purchase the Junior Subordinated Notes in the remarketing for cash at the offering price. This discussion does not describe all of the material tax considerations that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules  such as certain financial institutions  regulated investment companies  real estate investment trusts  banks  insurance companies  tax-exempt entities  certain former citizens or residents of the United States  dealers in securities  traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting  partnerships and other pass-through entities (and persons holding the Junior Subordinated Notes through a partnership or other pass-through entity)  holders whose functional currency is not the United States dollar  passive foreign investment companies  controlled foreign corporations and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid United States federal income tax or persons holding the Junior Subordinated Notes as part of a hedge  straddle or other integrated transaction. In addition  this discussion does not address the effect of any state  local  foreign or other tax laws or any United States federal estate  gift or alternative minimum tax considerations. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the “Code”)  administrative pronouncements  judicial decisions and final  temporary and proposed Treasury regulations  all as in effect on the date hereof  and all of which are subject to change or differingS-11interpretations  possibly with retroactive effect  so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below.As used in this Prospectus Supplement  the term “United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Junior Subordinated Note that is for United States federal income tax purposes:• an individual citizen or resident of the United States;• a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States  any state thereof or the District of Columbia;• an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or• a trust (i) with respect to which a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (ii) that was in existence on August 20  1996  and has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a domestic trust.The term “Non-United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Junior Subordinated Note that is neither a United States Holder nor a partnership (or other pass-through entity).If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership) holds Junior Subordinated Notes  the tax treatment of the partnership and its partners will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership and its partners. If a holder of Junior Subordinated Notes is a partnership or a partner in such a partnership  such holder should consult with its own tax advisors regarding the United States federal income tax considerations of the purchase  ownership and disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes.Persons considering purchasing the Junior Subordinated Notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the United States federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase  ownership and disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes in light of their particular circumstances  as well as the effect of any state  local  foreign or other tax laws.The Company has treated and will continue to treat  and  by purchasing the Junior Subordinated Notes  each holder agrees to treat  the Junior Subordinated Notes as indebtedness for United States federal income tax purposes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Junior Subordinated Notes will be so treated.United States HoldersTreatment of the Junior Subordinated Notes and Interest ThereonFrom their issuance  the Company has treated the Junior Subordinated Notes as “variable rate debt instruments” that are subject to applicable United States Treasury regulations that apply to “reset bonds ” and stated interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes as taxable to a United States Holder as ordinary interest income at the time such interest is received or accrued  in accordance with such United States Holder’s regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.Upon the remarketing of the Junior Subordinated Notes  the Junior Subordinated Notes will no longer be linked to an agreement for the purchase of the Company’s common stock. Each of the remarketed Junior Subordinated Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate. The Series 2019A JSNs and the Series 2019B JSNs have fixed maturity dates of August 1  2024  and August 1  2027  respectively. There are no contingent interest payments or terms. Accordingly  the remarketed Junior Subordinated Notes will be treated as debt for United States federal income tax purposes and stated interest payments on the remarketed Junior Subordinated Notes generally will be taxable to a United States Holder as ordinary income at the time received or accrued  in accordance with the United States Holder’s regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.Pre-Acquisition Accrued InterestThe purchase price of the Junior Subordinated Notes sold in this remarketing will include an amount of interest attributable to interest accrued for the period prior to this remarketing. Under general United States federal income tax accounting principles  the portion of the first interest payment on the Junior Subordinated Notes equal to the amount of such pre-acquisition accrued interest should be treated as a return of such pre-acquisition accrued interest  rather than as an amount payable on the Junior SubordinatedS-12Notes. Accordingly  the portion of the first interest payment on the Junior Subordinated Notes equal to the pre-acquisition accrued interest should not be treated as taxable interest income and a holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Junior Subordinated Notes should be reduced by a corresponding amount. This discussion assumes that this treatment is correct  and references in this discussion to stated interest do not include such portion of the first interest payment equal to the pre-acquisition accrued interest. United States Holders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors concerning the particular tax treatment to them of any pre-acquisition accrued interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes.Bond PremiumIf the amount paid by a United States Holder for a Junior Subordinated Note pursuant to this offering (excluding any amount attributable to pre-acquisition accrued interest) is greater than its principal amount  such United States Holder will generally be considered to have purchased the Junior Subordinated Note with “bond premium” in the amount equal to such excess. A United States Holder generally may be able to elect to amortize this bond premium  using a constant-yield method  over the remaining term of the Junior Subordinated Note by offsetting the interest income on such Junior Subordinated Note allocable to an accrual period with the premium allocable to such accrual period. If a United States Holder makes such an election  such United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Junior Subordinated Note will be reduced by the amount of premium amortized. If a United States Holder does not elect to amortize the premium  the premium will decrease the gain or increase the loss such United States Holder would otherwise recognize on a disposition of such Junior Subordinated Note. An election to amortize bond premium applies to all taxable debt obligations owned or acquired by the United States Holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year for which the election is made and may be revoked only with the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). United States Holders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the effect of an election to amortize bond premium on their particular circumstances.Sale  Exchange  Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of the Junior Subordinated NotesA United States Holder generally will recognize gain or loss upon the sale  exchange  redemption or other taxable disposition of a Junior Subordinated Note equal to the difference  if any  between (a) the sum of the cash and the fair market value of any property received on such disposition (other than amounts properly attributable to accrued but unpaid interest  which amounts (excluding any amount attributable to pre-acquisition accrued interest) will be treated as interest income as described above under “—Treatment of the Junior Subordinated Notes and Interest Thereon”) and (b) such United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Junior Subordinated Note. A United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Junior Subordinated Note generally will be equal to the amount that such United States Holder paid for the Junior Subordinated Note (excluding any amount attributable to pre-acquisition accrued interest)  reduced by the amount of any bond premium previously amortized by such United States Holder with respect to the Junior Subordinated Note and any payments on the Junior Subordinated Note other than payments of qualified stated interest. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale  exchange  redemption or other taxable disposition of a Junior Subordinated Note generally will be capital gain or loss  and will be long-term capital gain or loss  if  at the time of such disposition  the United States Holder will have held the Junior Subordinated Note for a period of more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.Medicare TaxCertain United States Holders that are individuals  estates or trusts are subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax on all or a portion of their “net investment income ” which may include all or a portion of their interest income and net gains from the disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Each United States Holder that is an individual  estate or trust is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the applicability of this Medicare tax to its income and gains in respect of its investment in the Junior Subordinated Notes.Backup Withholding and Information ReportingInformation reporting requirements generally apply in connection with payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes to  and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes by  non-corporate United States Holders. A United States Holder will be subject to backup withholding on these payments if the United States Holder fails to provide its taxpayer identification number to the paying agent and fails to comply with certain certification procedures or otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding. Any backup withholding from a payment to a United States Holder will be allowed as a credit against such United States federal income tax liability  or may entitle such United States Holder to a refund  provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. United States Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of backup withholding in their particular situation  the availability of an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption  if available.S-13Non-United States HoldersPayments of InterestSubject to the discussions below under “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” and “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Withholding ” no withholding of United States federal income tax will apply to a payment of interest on a Junior Subordinated Note to a Non-United States Holder under the “Portfolio Interest Exemption ” provided that:• such payment is not effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States;• the Non-United States Holder does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of the Company’s stock entitled to vote;• the Non-United States Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related directly or constructively to the Company through stock ownership;• the Non-United States Holder is not a bank that acquired the Junior Subordinated Notes in consideration for an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business; and• the Non-United States Holder provides the withholding agent  in accordance with specified procedures  with a statement to the effect that such holder is not a United States person (generally by providing a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E).If a Non-United States Holder cannot satisfy the requirements of the “Portfolio Interest Exemption” described above  payments of interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes made to such Non-United States Holder will be subject to a 30% United States federal withholding tax  unless that holder provides the paying agent with a properly executed statement: (i) claiming an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty (generally on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E); or (ii) stating that the payment on the Junior Subordinated Notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected to that holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (generally on an IRS Form W-8ECI).If a Non-United States Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States (and  if an applicable United States income tax treaty applies  if the Non-United States Holder maintains a permanent establishment within the United States) and the interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and  if an applicable United States income tax treaty applies  attributable to that permanent establishment)  that Non-United States Holder will be subject to United States federal income tax on the interest on a net income basis in the same manner as if that Non-United States Holder were a United States Holder. In addition  if such Non-United States Holder is a foreign corporation  it may also  under certain circumstances  be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty.Sale  Exchange  Redemption or other Taxable Disposition of the Junior Subordinated NotesSubject to the discussions below under “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding ” any gain realized by a Non-United States Holder on the sale  exchange  redemption or other taxable disposition of a Junior Subordinated Note generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax unless:• such gain is effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and  if an applicable United States income tax treaty applies  is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-United States Holder within the United States); or• the Non-United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are met.Information Reporting And Backup WithholdingThe amount of interest paid on the Junior Subordinated Notes to Non-United States Holders generally must be reported annually to the IRS. These reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced or eliminated by any applicable income tax treaty. Copies of the information returns reflecting income in respect of the Junior Subordinated Notes mayS-14also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the Non-United States Holder is a resident under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or information sharing agreement.A Non-United States Holder will generally not be subject to additional information reporting or to backup withholding (currently at a 24% rate) with respect to payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes or to information reporting or backup withholding with respect to proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes to or through a United States office of any broker  as long as the Non-United States Holder:• has furnished to the payor or broker a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E certifying  under penalties of perjury  the Non-United States Holder’s status as a non-United States person;• has furnished to the payor or broker other documentation upon which it may rely to treat the payments as made to a non-United States person in accordance with applicable Treasury regulations; or• otherwise establishes an exemption.The payment of the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes to or through a foreign office of a broker will generally not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding. However  a sale or disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes will be subject to information reporting  but not backup withholding  if it is to or through a foreign office of a United States broker or a non-United States broker with certain enumerated connections with the United States unless the documentation requirements described above are met or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption.Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a Non-United States Holder will be allowed as a credit against such holder’s United States federal income tax liability  if any  or will otherwise be refundable  provided that the requisite procedures are followed and the proper information is filed with the IRS on a timely basis. Non-United States Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such exemption  if applicable.Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act WithholdingA withholding tax of 30% will apply to interest income paid on Junior Subordinated Notes held by a Non-United States Holder where the Non-United States Holder is (i) a foreign financial institution (as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary)  unless such institution enters into an agreement with the United States government to collect and provide to the United States tax authorities substantial information regarding United States account holders of such institution (which would include certain equity and debt holders of such institution  as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with United States owners)  or (ii) a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary)  unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the substantial United States owners of the entity  which generally includes any United States person who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain circumstances  a Non-United States Holder of Junior Subordinated Notes might be eligible for a refund or credit of such taxes  and a Non-United States Holder might be required to file a United States federal income tax return to claim such refund or credit. The Company will not pay any additional amounts to “gross up” payments to holders as a result of any withholding or deduction for such taxes. Non-United States Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these withholding requirements on their investment in the Junior Subordinated Notes.THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX DISCUSSION SET FORTH ABOVE IS INCLUDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE DEPENDING UPON A HOLDER’S PARTICULAR SITUATION. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE ACQUISITION  OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES  INCLUDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE  LOCAL  FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS.S-15REMARKETINGSubject to the terms and conditions of a remarketing agreement (the “Remarketing Agreement”) among the Company  Barclays Capital Inc.  Citigroup Global Markets Inc.  Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC  J.P. Morgan Securities LLC  Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Wells Fargo Securities  LLC  as the remarketing agents (the “Remarketing Agents”)  and U.S. Bank Trust Company  National Association  solely in its capacity as Purchase Contract Agent and as attorney-in-fact of the holders of Purchase Contracts  the Remarketing Agents have agreed to use their commercially reasonable efforts to remarket the Series 2019A RSNs and the Series 2019B RSNs at public offering prices that will result in aggregate proceeds sufficient to purchase the Treasury Portfolio  as required by the terms of the Corporate Units.The Remarketing Agents have no obligation to purchase any of the Junior Subordinated Notes. The Remarketing Agreement provides that the remarketing is subject to customary conditions precedent  including the delivery of legal opinions.The offering of the Junior Subordinated Notes by the Remarketing Agents is subject to the Remarketing Agents’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.In connection with the remarketing  the Remarketing Agents have reset the rate of interest payable on the Series 2019A JSNs to the reset rate of % per annum and have reset the rate of interest payable on the Series 2019B JSNs to the reset rate of % per annum  in each case  effective on and after May   2022  the expected delivery date for the Junior Subordinated Notes.The Junior Subordinated Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or on any automated deal er quotation system.The Remarketing Agents may make a market in the Junior Subordinated Notes after completion of the offering  but will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the Junior Subordinated Notes or that an active public market for the Junior Subordinated Notes will develop. If an active public trading market for the Junior Subordinated Notes does not develop  the market price and liquidity of the Junior Subordinated Notes may be adversely affected.The Company has agreed to indemnify the several Remarketing Agents against certain liabilities  including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933  as amended.The Company will pay a remarketing fee equal to % of the principal amount of the Series 2019A JSNs and % of the principal amount of the Series 2019B JSNs. The Company’s expenses associated with the offer and sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes (not including the remarketing fee) are estimated to be $ .In order to facilitate the offering of the Junior Subordinated Notes  the Remarketing Agents may engage in transactions that stabilize  maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Specifically  the Remarketing Agents may over-allot in connection with this remarketing  creating short positions in the Junior Subordinated Notes for their own accounts. In addition  to cover over-allotments or to stabilize the price of the Junior Subordinated Notes  the Remarketing Agents may bid for  and purchase  Junior Subordinated Notes in the open market. Finally  the Remarketing Agents may reclaim selling concessions allowed to the Remarketing Agents or dealers for distributing Junior Subordinated Notes in this remarketing  if the Remarketing Agents repurchase previously distributed Junior Subordinated Notes in transactions to cover short positions  in stabilization transactions or otherwise. Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the Junior Subordinated Notes above independent market levels. The Remarketing Agents are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time without notice.In general  purchases of a security for the purpose of stabilization or to reduce a short position could cause the price of the security to be higher than it might be in the absence of such purchases. The imposition of a penalty bid might also have an effect on the price of a security to the extent that it were to discourage resales of the security.Neither the Company nor any Remarketing Agent makes any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Junior Subordinated Notes. In addition  neither the Company nor any Remarketing Agent makes any representation that the Remarketing Agents will engage in such transactions or that such transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice.It is expected that delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes will be made  against payment for the Junior Subordinated Notes  on or about May   2022  which will be the business day following the pricing of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Under Rule 15c6-1 under the 1934 Act  purchases or sales of securities in the secondary market generally are required to settle within two business days (T+2)  unless the parties to any such transactions expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers of the Junior Subordinated Notes who wish to trade the Junior Subordinated Notes on the date of this Prospectus Supplement or theS-16next succeeding business day(s) will be required  because the Junior Subordinated Notes will settle within business days (T+ )  to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Junior Subordinated Notes who wish to trade on the date of this Prospectus Supplement or the next succeeding business day(s) should consult their own legal advisors.In the ordinary course of business  the Remarketing Agents and their respective affiliates have from time to time performed and may in the future perform various financial advisory  commercial banking  investment banking  sales and trading  investment research  principal investment  hedging  market making  asset leasing treasury services and other financial and non-financial activities and services for the Company and its affiliates  for which they received  or will continue to receive  customary fees or compensation.In addition  in the ordinary course of their business activities  the Remarketing Agents and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)  loans  commodities  currencies  credit default swaps and other financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Company or its affiliates.

Board members may not participate in the proposed program.1. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  belong to the Company.2. The company is given the right to transfer the warrants to participants in the program with the highest number of warrants per individual in each personnel category as follows:- CEO: 100 000 warrants- senior management: 50 000 warrants- key persons and other employees: 30 000 warrants  and- key persons with particular strategic importance: 100 000 warrants.The number of options that a person can be offered shall be determined by the board  whereby the criteria below must be taken into account.- Education- Experience- Expected significance for the Company's operations- Level of responsibility3. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights is that the issue forms part of the introduction of the incentive program  whereby the persons who are given the opportunity to acquire warrants are given the opportunity to take part in a positive development in the Company. The existence of such a program is considered to increase the possibility of attracting and retaining qualified employees.4. Subscription of the warrants shall take place by subscription on subscription list no later than 15 June 2022 . The Board shall have the right to extend the subscription period.5. The warrants are issued free of charge. However  if they are subsequently transferred to participants in incentive programs  the market value of the warrants must be paid by the acquirer  calculated according to the Black & Scholes warrant valuation model. The calculation must be made by a person with the required competence for that type of warrant valuation. The basis for and calculation of the market value must be documented. The usual documentation for the transfer must be prepared. Furthermore  if the warrants are transferred to participants  the participants shall enter into an agreement of offer of first refusal  according to which the option holder shall be obliged to offer the Company to acquire the warrants  or a certain part of these  under certain conditions.6. Each warrant shall entail a right to subscribe for one new share in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 10 . To the extent that the subscription price exceeds the quota value of the shares  the excess amount shall be included in the free share premium fund.7. Subscription of shares with the support of the warrants shall take place in accordance with the terms of the warrants from and including 1 July 2025 to and including 31 December 2025 .8. If all warrants are exercised for subscription of shares  the Company's registered share capital will increase by SEK 30 000 (taking into account the current quota value of 6 öre / share and provided that no recalculation takes place in accordance with the warrant terms).9. Shares that have been added due to a new subscription entail the right to a dividend for the first time on the record date for dividends that falls immediately after the new subscription has been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and the shares have been entered in the share register at Euroclear Sweden AB .10. For the warrants  the conditions set out in a separate appendix (Appendix Terms and Conditions) shall otherwise apply.DilutionThe company currently has 15 103 602 registered shares and votes. Upon full exercise of the warrants  the number of shares in the Company will increase by a total of 500 000 and the share capital by SEK 30 000 . The dilution as a result of the proposed incentive program will  upon full utilization  amount to 3.2 percent of the shares and votes in the Company.The company has two ongoing previously decided incentive programs  both of which were decided at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one share at a price of SEK 13.51 . The exercise period is 2023-08-17 to 2023-08-312020/2023 A: 381 365 warrants2020/2023 B: 41 856 warrantsCosts for the now proposed incentive programThe incentive program has been designed in consultation with external legal advisers and the costs for this advice are estimated to amount to a maximum of SEK 50 000 (excluding VAT).In addition to the advisory costs  the board estimates that the incentive program will entail certain administrative costs in connection with share subscription with the support of the warrants and registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Since the warrants will be transferred to the participants at market value  it is estimated that no costs in the form of social security contributions or the like will arise for the Company as a result of the incentive program.MiscellaneousThe CEO  or the person appointed by the Board  shall have the right to make the minor adjustments that may be required in connection with the execution of the decision and in connection with the registration of the decision with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB .Item 14 - Resolution on a general authorization to the board of directorsThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board of directors  for the time until the next annual general meeting  whether on one or several occasions  shall be entitled to resolve on issues of shares  warrants and/or convertible instruments (or combinations thereof  so-called units). If the board exercises the authorization  this may also be done with a deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and/or with provisions on non-cash or set-off.An issue of securities in accordance with this authorizations shall be on market conditions. The board of directors shall be authorized to decide on the terms and conditions regarding issues under this authorizations and what persons shall be entitled to subscribe for the shares  warrants and/or convertible instruments. The reason to propose that the board of directors shall be authorized to resolve on issues with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rights and/or to resolve on issues in kind or by way of set-off  is that the Company shall be able to issue shares  warrants and/or convertible instruments in order to raise capital to the Company  carry out strategically motivated collaborations or in connection with acquisitions of companies or businesses by carrying out directed issues in order to strengthen the Company's financial position.The CEO shall have the right to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB .Majority requirementsResolutions in accordance with the Board's proposal in accordance with item 13 (option program) above requires  for its validity shareholders with at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting is required.Resolutions in accordance with item 14 (authorizations) above requires  for its validity  that a minimum of two thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting.Handling of personal dataFor information regarding the processing of your personal data  please refer to https://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Integritetspolicy_for_deltagare_pa_bolagsstammor_20181023.pdfQuestions to the board of directors and the CEOThe board of directors and the CEO shall  up request by any shareholder  and where the board of directors believes that such may take place without significant harm to the Company  provide information in respect of any circumstances which may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda or the Company's financial position.

Net profit increased +11% to EUR 134 million.Operating income was up +10% year-on-year to EUR 438 million driven by strong business income growth  up +9% to EUR 405 million and Interest  Banking and Other income up 39% to EUR 32 million.We increased our investments in technology in line with our strategy. Operating expenses increased to EUR 260 million  up 11% compared to Q1 2021.Sanctions related to the invasion of Ukraine have led to increased cash held on our balance sheet  which are explained further below.Infographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1805340/Euroclear_1.jpgNote: 2021 figures have been restated to include MFEX pro forma  in order to allow for like-for-like comparison.Operational highlightsThroughout the first quarter  Euroclear continued to make strategic progress  while remaining focused on our responsibilities as a critical financial market infrastructure. This is reflected in the key operating metrics shown below:Q1 total % change vs Q1 2021 Assets under Custody EUR 37 trillion +8% Number of Transactions 80 million +5% Turnover EUR 270 trillion +13% Fund assets under custody EUR 3 trillion +12% Collateral Highway EUR 2 trillion +18%The integration of MFEX is progressing to plan as we combine MFEX's established fund distribution platforms with Euroclear's post-trade expertise to create a new end-to-end funds offering.We have also made two strategic investments during the first quarter.Firstly  we have further advanced Euroclear's digital strategy through our investment in Fnality  an international consortium of global banks and financial market infrastructures focused on building regulated payment systems to support the adoption of tokenised assets and marketplaces.Secondly  we have progressed our sustainable finance and ESG strategy through an investment in Greenomy  a Belgium based sustainable finance technology platform. Greenomy helps corporates  credit institutions and asset managers comply with new European Union sustainable finance legislation by digitalising the data capturing and reporting processes.As part of our commitment to ESG  we are pleased to announce that Euroclear has taken the important step to reduce its global carbon footprint by committing to the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We will now set CO2 reduction actions with the commitment to achieve net-zero value chain Green House Gas (GHG) emissions by no later than 2050.Implications from the invasion of Ukraine and SanctionsOur thoughts are with those affected by the humanitarian crisis resulting from the invasion of Ukraine. We have focused on supporting our staff  especially those of Ukrainian and Russian origin  as well as those in bordering countries.Euroclear is complying with the international sanctions imposed in response to the invasion of Ukraine and has suspended all transactions with sanctioned entities since 28 February. In addition to ensuring all the sanctions are applied immediately and completely  our teams are supporting clients diligently in managing the exceptional situation. We are working closely with clients to apply all new rules fully and according to the spirit of the sanctions.A consequence of the sanctions is that assets owned by sanctioned parties are blocked in the respective financial market infrastructures  including Euroclear. As the assets mature through their lifecycle  cashflows (e.g. coupons and redemptions) that are normally transferred to the underlying parties accumulate on our balance sheet for as long as the sanctions remain in place. We do not expect these sanctions to affect our financial performance. During the first quarter  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet increased by â¬23 billion year-on-year  for which the company is working on the mitigation of potential regulatory capital requirements.In light of these circumstances  the Board of Euroclear considers it to be prudent to wait until the second half of 2022 to formally decide on the dividend payment of EUR 88.5 per share (equating to a total of EUR 279 million) as announced in its full year results.Commenting on the results  Lieve Mostrey  Chief Executive Officer  said:""The invasion of Ukraine is deeply troubling and our thoughts are with all who are impacted. As a financial market infrastructure  we have an important role to play in a turbulent world. I am proud of the staff response as our people mobilised swiftly to apply the sanctions; to support clients during the exceptional circumstances; and to contribute to relief efforts for those affected. From a financial and operational perspective  Euroclear continues to perform very well  achieving another strong quarter as we continue to deliver on our strategy.""Appendix: Financial Statements for Euroclear Bank and Euroclear InvestmentsInfographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/1805341/Euroclear_2.jpgAbout EuroclearEuroclear Group is the financial industry's trusted provider of post trade services.

(“ClearStream” or the ""Company"") (TSX: CSM) today announced its results for the three months ended March 31  2022. All amounts are in Canadian dollars and expressed in thousands of dollars unless otherwise noted.“EBITDAS” and “Adjusted EBITDAS” are not standard measures under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of these items and limitations of their use.“Activity levels in the first quarter were strong as revenues grew by 8% from the fourth quarter of 2021 and represented the highest level for quarterly revenue since the first quarter of 2020  which was largely unaffected by the pandemic. We are actively working with our customers and suppliers to manage both the inflationary and labour supply pressures in the current market ” said Barry Card  Interim Chief Executive Officer.“The pricing for commodities in the end markets we serve continues to be strong and is anticipated to remain that way throughout the year. This is providing our customers with the confidence to increase their spending on both maintenance and capital projects  as evidenced by the 17 turnaround projects that we have scheduled for the second quarter. We are proud to partner with our customers on these important projects to build and maintain the integrity of their production infrastructure ” added Mr. Card.HIGHLIGHTSRevenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $109.8 million  representing an increase of $27.6 million or 33.6% from Q1 2021.Gross profit for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $9.7 million  representing an increase of $1.7 million or 21.1% from Q1 2021.Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 8.9%  as compared to 9.8% in Q1 2021.Adjusted EBITDAS for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $3.0 million  representing an increase of $0.8 million or 34.9% from Q1 2021.Adjusted EBITDAS margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 2.7%  unchanged from Q1 2021.Selling  general and administrative expenses for three months ended March 31  2022 were $8.1 million  representing an increase of $2.1 million or 34.9% from Q1 2021. Consistent with the last three quarters in 2021  the increase is largely due to investments being made to support our enterprise systems and digital strategy to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness. As well our business has recovered and stabilized in 2022  therefore  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work in 2022.Liquidity remained strong with total cash and available credit facilities of $37.4 million at March 31  2022  as compared to $33.7 million at December 31  2021.New project awards and contract renewals were $96 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 and $36 million for the month of April 2022. Approximately 80% of that work is expected to be completed in 2022.Maintenance and Construction ServicesRevenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $99.4 million  representing an increase of 34.3% or $25.4 million from Q1 2021 and $5.4 million or 5.7% from Q4 2021. The increase was due to our customers increasing their spending on both maintenance and capital projects. We expect activity levels to remain high in the second quarter with 17 turnaround projects scheduled. We continue to focus on consolidating various scopes of work with existing or new customers by bundling our services in order to enable more efficient execution and lower costs for our customers on each work site.Wear Technology Overlay ServicesRevenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $12.3 million  representing an increase of 43.0% or $3.7 million from Q1 2021 and 36.7% or $3.3 million from Q4 2021. Gross profit margin was lower as we completed more fabrication work  which has a lower margin than the specialty weld overlay products that we market under the brand name AssetArmor™. With the continued rise in global energy demand and commodity prices  we are seeing our customers in the oil sands operating at full production levels  which has started to increase the demand for our AssetArmor™ products.Environmental ServicesWe continue to grow our capabilities by adding staff within our professional services. During the first quarter  we completed a large decommissioning project. We are seeing our customers continue to allocate expenditures for the closure  reclamation and remediation of oil and gas wells  pipelines and facilities in Western Canada. We expect this trend to continue with our clients regardless of the expiry of the government funded programs at the end of 2022 given the increased focus on ESG (environmental  social and governance) matters.FIRST QUARTER 2022 FINANCIAL RESULTS($ millions  except per share amounts)Three months ended March 31  2022 2021 % Change Revenue Maintenance and Construction Services 99.4 74.0 34.3 % Wear Technology Overlay Services 12.3 8.6 44.1 % Total 109.8 82.2 33.6 % Gross Profit Maintenance and Construction Services 7.4 5.9 24.9 % Wear Technology Overlay Services 2.4 2.2 10.6 % Total 9.7 8.0 21.1 % Gross Profit Margin (% of revenue) Maintenance and Construction Services 7.4 % 8.0 % (0.6 )% Wear Technology Overlay Services 19.3 % 25.1 % (5.8 )% Total 8.9 % 9.8 % (0.9 )%Selling  general and administrative expenses 8.1 6.0 34.9 % % of revenue 7.3 % 7.3 % — % Adjusted EBITDAS * Maintenance and Construction Services 7.2 5.8 24.5 % Wear Technology Overlay Services 2.3 2.1 10.9 % Corporate (6.5 ) (5.7 ) (15.4 )% Total 3.0 2.2 34.9 % % of revenue 2.7 % 2.7 % — % Loss from continuing operations (7.8 ) (7.6 ) 2.8 % Net loss per share (dollars) from continuing operations (basic and diluted) (0.07 ) (0.07 ) — %* “Adjusted EBITDAS” is not a standard measure under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of this measure and limitations of its use.Revenue for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $109 848 compared to $82 204 for the three months ended March 31  2021  representing an increase of 33.6%. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong market momentum in the first quarter in 2022  with an increase in activity across all areas of the business.Gross profit for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $9 740 compared to $8 045 for the three months ended March 31  2021  representing an increase of 21.1%. Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 8.9% compared to 9.8% for the three months ended March 31  2021. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven by a few factors including a change in the mix of services and products provided with lower gross profit margins as well as inflationary pressures on labour  equipment and materials. The recovery of these increases in costs are being built into contracts collaboratively with our customers on a go forward basis.Selling  general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $8 052  in comparison to $5 969 for the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 34.9%. As a percentage of revenue  SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31  2022 were 7.3%  unchanged from the same period in 2021. The increase in SG&A expenses is largely due to the ongoing investments being made to support the Company's enterprise systems and digital strategy. These investments  which will extend throughout 2022  are expected to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness. In addition  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work anticipated in 2022.For the three months ended March 31  2022  Adjusted EBITDAS was $3 006 compared to $2 229 for the three months ended March 31  2021. As a percentage of revenue  Adjusted EBITDAS was 2.7% for the three months ended March 31  2022 unchanged from the same period in 2021.Income from government subsidies includes the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (""CERS"") received from the Government of Canada to assist with the payment of employee wages and rent as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CEWS and CERS programs ended in 2021. Therefore  the Company did not have any income from government subsidies during the three months ended March 31  2022  compared to$6 755 for the three months ended March 31  2021.Loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $7 783 compared to loss of $7 569 for the three months ended March 31  2021. The loss variance was driven by the reduction in government subsidies in 2022  an increase in SG&A expenses and an increase in restructuring expenses  partially offset by an increase in gross profit and the impairment of right-of-use assets recognized in 2021.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESClearStream has an asset-based lending facility (the “ABL Facility”) comprised of (i) a revolving credit facility providing for maximum borrowings up to $15.0 million (the “Revolving Facility”) and (ii) a term loan facility providing for maximum borrowings of up to $40.5 million (the “Term Loan Facility”). As at March 31  2022  the Company had $12.0 million of available capacity under the Revolving Facility  $40.5 million drawn on the Term Loan Facility and $25.4 million of cash on hand.On March 30  2022  the Company amended its Revolving Facility  extending the maturity date of the facility to April 14  2022 from March 31  2022.On April 14  2022  ClearStream completed the refinancing of its ABL facility (the “Refinancing”). ClearStream established a new $25 million asset-based revolving credit facility with a three-year term (the “New ABL Facility”) to replace the Revolving Facility.The New ABL Facility provides for maximum borrowings up to $25 million with a Canadian chartered bank. The amount available under the New ABL Facility will vary from time to time based on the borrowing base determined with reference to the accounts receivable and inventories of ClearStream. The obligations under the New ABL Facility are secured by  among other things  a first ranking lien on all of the existing and after acquired accounts receivable and inventories of the Company and the other guarantors  being certain of the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries. The maturity date of the New ABL Facility is April 14  2025. The interest rate on the New ABL Facility is prime plus 2.5%.The financial covenants applicable under the New ABL Facility are:The Company must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.00:1.00 for each twelve month period calculated and tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter; and The Company must not expend or become obligated for any capital expenditures in an aggregate amount exceeding $10 million during any fiscal year.As part of the Refinancing  the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility was extended from September 30  2022 to October 14  2025 and the interest rate was changed to a fixed rate of 8.0%.The Company anticipates that its liquidity (cash on hand and available credit facilities) and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short-term contractual obligations and maintain compliance with its financial covenants through March 31  2023.As at March 31  2022  issued and outstanding share capital included 110 001 239 common shares  127 732 Series 1 preferred shares  and 40 111 Series 2 preferred shares.The Series 1 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $127.732 million) are convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a price of $0.35/share and the Series 2 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $40.111 million) are convertible into common shares at a price of $0.10/share.The Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares have a 10% fixed cumulative preferential cash dividend payable when the Company has sufficient monies to be able to do so  including under the provisions of applicable law and contracts affecting the Company. The board of directors of the Company does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends until such times as the Company's balance sheet and liquidity position supports the payment. As at March 31  2022  the accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series 1 and Series 2 shares totaled $64.0 million. Any accrued and unpaid dividends are convertible in certain circumstances at the option of the holder into additional Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares.OUTLOOKThe continued rise in energy demand and commodity prices continues to provide strong fundamentals for our customers in the energy industry. While these customers have been prioritizing debt repayment and returns to shareholders  they are starting to increase spending on both maintenance projects (to enhance operational reliability) and capital projects (to maintain/expand productive capacity). We expect activity levels to continue to recover throughout 2022.Due to the war in Ukraine and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic  growth in our served markets continues to drive some near-term challenges  including inflationary pressure on labour  equipment and materials as well as supply chain disruptions. We are working closely with our customers and suppliers to manage these challenges. We are also enhancing our programs to attract  retain and develop our number one resource  our employees.With energy transition and environmental considerations becoming increasingly important for all stakeholders in all industrial end markets  we expect that our customers will continue to focus on improving their operational processes for greater efficiencies and reliability  which aligns well with our service offerings.To better support our customers  ClearStream has continued to add new service offerings that encompass the full asset lifecycle and is now offering a suite of more than 40 services. Through the extensive regional coverage provided by our 19 operating facilities  we believe that ClearStream is well-positioned to further consolidate the services required at various operating sites while generating efficiencies and cost reductions for its customers.ClearStream's business model continues to prove its resilience as we are working closely with our customers everyday in helping them to effectively manage their operations.Additional InformationOur unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended March 31  2022 and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of the operating and financial results can be accessed on our website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca and will be available shortly through SEDAR at www.sedar.com.About ClearStream Energy Services Inc.With a legacy of excellence and experience stretching back more than 50 years  ClearStream provides solutions for the Energy and Industrial markets including: Oil & Gas  Petrochemical  Mining  Power  Agriculture  Forestry  Infrastructure and Water Treatment.

A number of factors could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events and results discussed in the forward-looking information including  but not limited to  the success of our response to the COVID-19 global pandemic  compliance with debt covenants  access to credit facilities and other sources of capital for working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs  availability of labour  dependence on key personnel  economic conditions  commodity prices  interest rates  regulatory change  weather and risks related to the integration of acquired businesses. These factors should not be considered exhaustive. Risks and uncertainties about ClearStream’s business are more fully discussed in ClearStream’s disclosure materials  including its annual information form and management’s discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results  filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada and available at www.sedar.com. In formulating the forward-looking information  management has assumed that business and economic conditions affecting ClearStream will continue substantially in the ordinary course  including  without limitation  with respect to general levels of economic activity  regulations  taxes and interest rates. Although the forward-looking information is based on what management of ClearStream consider to be reasonable assumptions based on information currently available to it  there can be no assurance that actual events or results will be consistent with this forward-looking information  and management’s assumptions may prove to be incorrect.This forward-looking information is made as of the date of this press release  and ClearStream does not assume any obligation to update or revise it to reflect new events or circumstances except as required by law. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is provided for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.Advisory regarding Non-Standard MeasuresThe terms ‘‘EBITDAS’’ and “Adjusted EBITDAS” (collectively  the ‘‘Non-standard measures’’) are financial measures used in this press release that are not standard measures under IFRS. ClearStream’s method of calculating the Non-Standard Measures may differ from the methods used by other issuers. Therefore  ClearStream’s Non-Standard Measures  as presented may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.EBITDAS refers to net earnings determined in accordance with IFRS  before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  income tax expense (recovery)  and other long-term incentive plan expenses. EBITDAS is used by management and the directors of ClearStream as well as many investors to determine the ability of an issuer to generate cash from operations. Management also uses EBITDAS to monitor the performance of ClearStream’s reportable segments and believes that in addition to net income or loss and cash provided by operating activities  EBITDAS is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures and income taxes. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31  2022.Adjusted EBITDAS refers to EBITDAS excluding impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring expense  gain (loss) on sale of property  plant and equipment  recovery of contingent consideration liability  one time incurred expenses  impairment of right-of-use assets  and government subsidies. ClearStream has used Adjusted EBITDAS as the basis for the analysis of its past operating financial performance.

4271,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.risk.net/commodities/7946921/trade-finance-house-of-the-year-tramontana-asset-management,Trade finance house of the year: Tramontana Asset Management,7 hours ago,In the increasingly volatile market conditions of 2021  Tramontana Asset Management developed and deployed trade finance solutions to satisfy corporate demand for financing. These solutions have simultaneously provided a growing number of institutional investors with the opportunity to participate in the energy transition. For its innovative work in making the carbon markets accessible to mainstream investors and providing corporates with better access to financing  Tramontana has won Energy Risk’s 2022 Trade finance house of the year award.As a specialist investment company  Tramontana develops hedging and financing solutions for corporate clients  partnering with large institutional investors to fund these transactions. The team of eight people has built up more than $5 billion in assets under management since its 2014 launch  focusing on the energy transition and carbon-backed financing.Managing directors and co-founders of Tramontana  Paul Jackman and Bharath Manium  believe a successful transition to a low-carbon economy requires the full support of global capital markets. The company took a large step towards that goal last year when it completed a significant financing transaction that served both a corporate hedger and a large financial institution looking for exposure to the energy transition space.Tramontana works with corporate clients to help implement effective hedging strategies that are unconstrained by the liquidity limitations of futures markets based on the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme. This particular solution was developed to minimise hedging slippage and reduce the balance sheet burden of managing the margining requirements of on-exchange hedge positions.“Our solution involves issuing secured ring-fenced notes  purchased by our financing partners  and acquiring carbon from the market  says Jackman. “The carbon certificates are held in a registry account for the duration of the note – this could be a three-  five- or seven-year note  depending on the transaction. The corporate client then buys the carbon certificates at the end of that tenor.”The solution  which Jackman describes as “a scalable  multi-issuance programme”  repackages energy transition-related assets as standard notes so they can be held in clearing systems such as Euroclear and Clearstream. Physical energy assets cannot be held in clearing systems  an issue that has traditionally left many institutional investors reluctant to participate in this growing market. This solution solves the accounting  regulatory and management challenges of holding such assets.Furthermore  to provide investors such as pension funds and insurers with pure-play investments in this space  Tramontana mitigates non-carbon-specific risks such as credit risk via hedging and various collateralisation solutions.As a result  Tramontana has been able to build a deeper and wider liquidity pool to fund such transactions by attracting wider investor interest  such as the specialist UK pension firm it worked with for the first time last year. According to Manium and Jackman  the growth in investor interest has seen Tramontana’s typical transaction size increase by more than 40% year on year.“Our financing partners are sophisticated institutions who are familiar with structured finance and comfortable with the associated documentation and operational complexity ” explains Manium. “The key objective in our attempt to widen market participation in our products  was to make them more accessible to insurance and pension fund investors  who have traditionally been less active in structured finance linked to the energy transition.”Although interest in green investments has undoubtedly grown in recent years  Tramontana’s trade finance solution aims to enable greater access to the market  boosting opportunities for corporate hedgers.“The energy transition is a topic everyone is discussing. Many companies are putting targets in place for investing in environmental  social and governance strategies  and so investments like these are integral to that kind of strategy ” says Manium. “But I think the situation we currently find ourselves in is that there is a lot of demand from investors but not enough assets.”Jackman adds: “Tramontana’s carbon-backed securities programme enables non-specialist investors to access energy transition markets and has opened the door to a significantly deeper pool of investor capital to be deployed in the energy transition space.”The investment firm has clearly achieved its aim of boosting access to carbon markets for the wider capital markets  in turn significantly increasing its corporate clients’ access to capital for trade finance and risk management activities.,neutral,0.11,0.86,0.03,negative,0.01,0.05,0.94,True,English,"['Trade finance house', 'Tramontana Asset Management', 'year', 'specialist UK pension firm', 'Emissions Trading Scheme', 'balance sheet burden', 'exchange hedge positions', 'scalable, multi-issuance programme', 'large financial institution', 'secured ring-fenced notes', 'carbon-backed securities programme', 'typical transaction size', '2022 Trade finance house', 'various collateralisation solutions', 'pension fund investors', 'specialist investment company', 'wider liquidity pool', 'volatile market conditions', 'global capital markets', 'wider capital markets', 'risk management activities', 'trade finance solutions', 'energy transition-related assets', 'Physical energy assets', 'large institutional investors', 'energy transition markets', 'wider investor interest', 'many institutional investors', 'effective hedging strategies', 'energy transition space', 'significant financing transaction', 'Tramontana Asset Management', 'corporate clients’ access', 'investment firm', 'pension funds', 'Energy Risk', 'large step', 'investor capital', 'liquidity limitations', 'futures markets', 'standard notes', 'structured finance', 'Many companies', 'governance strategies', 'successful transition', 'carbon-backed financing', 'credit risk', 'carbon markets', 'management challenges', 'corporate hedger', 'mainstream investors', 'non-specialist investors', 'financing solutions', 'growing number', 'innovative work', 'eight people', 'Managing directors', 'low-carbon economy', 'full support', 'European Union', 'margining requirements', 'registry account', 'clearing systems', 'accounting, regulatory', 'carbon-specific risks', 'first time', 'sophisticated institutions', 'associated documentation', 'operational complexity', 'key objective', 'recent years', 'enough assets', 'deeper pool', 'financing partners', 'carbon certificates', 'growing market', 'market participation', 'hedging slippage', 'greater access', 'pure-play investments', 'green investments', 'corporate demand', 'particular solution', 'seven-year note', 'year award', 'Bharath Manium', 'Paul Jackman', 'opportunity', 'corporates', 'transactions', 'team', '2014 launch', 'founders', 'goal', 'exposure', 'duration', 'end', 'tenor', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'issue', 'insurers', 'result', 'growth', 'attempt', 'products', 'insurance', 'opportunities', 'topic', 'everyone', 'targets', 'place', 'social', 'kind', 'strategy', 'situation', 'lot', 'door', 'aim', 'turn']",2022-05-05,2022-05-05,risk.net

In the first three months of 2022  SAF-HOLLAND SE's Group sales of EUR 369.7 million were 29.4% higher than the previous year's figure of EUR 285.6 million due to demand.High steel prices as well as high freight and energy costs  which are passed on with a time lag  had a strong impact on the cost of sales ratio  primarily in Europe  while the administrative and research and development cost ratios declined significantly. In total  this led to an adjusted EBIT of EUR 23.5 million (previous year EUR 22.0 million). This corresponds to an adjusted EBIT margin of 6.4 % (previous year 7.7 %).Based on the figures for the first quarter of 2022  the Management Board of SAF HOLLAND SE has today decided to raise the forecast for Group sales for the 2022 financial year and to specify the forecast for the adjusted EBIT margin.Based on the expected macroeconomic and industry-specific framework conditions and weighing up the potential risks and opportunities  the Management Board now expects Group sales for the 2022 financial year to be in a range of EUR 1.2 billion to EUR 1.35 billion (previously EUR 1.15 billion to EUR 1.3 billion).Based on this assumption  SAF HOLLAND also expects an adjusted EBIT margin of 6.5% to 7.0% for the 2022 financial year (previously: significantly below the previous year).In order to support the strategic goals  the company continues to plan investments in the range of 2% to 2.5% for the 2022 financial year. The investments will focus on the continuation of the capacity expansions already started in Turkey and Mexico as well as a capacity expansion in India. Furthermore  the company plans to invest in efficiency-enhancing measures  especially in Germany and the USA.The publication of the quarterly statement for the first quarter of 2022 is still scheduled for May 10  2022.Additional Information:ISIN: DE000SAFH001WKN: SAFH00Deutsche Boerse: SFQTrading: Amtlicher Markt (Prime Standard)  Frankfurter WertpapierboerseContactPetra MüllerHead of Investor Relations  Corporate und ESG CommunicationsTel: +49 (0) 6095 301 918ir@safholland.deAbout SAF-HOLLAND SAF-HOLLAND SE is a leading international manufacturer of chassis-related assemblies and components for trailers  trucks and buses.

All geographies grew strongly with North America and Asia-Pacific above Q1 2019 revenues.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group  operating data of the companies under joint control will continue to be proportionately integrated in the operating management reports used by directors to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data prior to 2014  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q1 2022  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€54.4 million (-€37.6 million in Q1 2021)  leaving IFRS revenue at €628.5 million (€416.7 million in Q1 2021).ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 2021 adjusted revenue (a) 454.3 2022 IFRS revenue (b) 628.5 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 54.4 2022 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 683.0 Currency impacts (e) -20.9 2022 adjusted revenue at 2021 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 662.1 Change in scope (g) 0.0 2022 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 662.1 Organic growth (i) = (h) / (a) – 1 +45.7%€m Impact of currency as of March 31st  2022 RMB -6.7 USD -3.7 GBP -2.8 HKD -1.5 Other -6.2 Total -20.9Average exchange rate Q1 2022 Q1 2021 RMB 0.1404 0.1281 USD 0.8915 0.8300 GBP 1.1956 1.1443 HKD 0.1142 0.1070Forward looking statementsThis news release may contain some forward-looking statements.

Working with Medidata will help biotechnology and pharma sponsors take a comprehensive approach and leverage innovative approaches such as Patient Cloud and others to help sponsors and patients overcome barriers and challenges in the rare disease drug development.”Patient Cloud’s suite of powerful solutions increases patient engagement while reducing participation burdens  thereby enabling the Center to address a common challenge of enrolling patients with rare diseases in clinical trials. Built into the Medidata Clinical Cloud platform  Patient Cloud solutions combine Medidata’s leading clinical trial technology with unmatched patient centricity by design.Intelligent Trials provides advanced analytics to improve the speed  success  and quality of trials. Built on a foundation of industry-leading data from more than 27 000 clinical trials and 8+ million patients across more than 140 countries  Intelligent Trials help to optimize trial planning  site selection  and enrollment decisions  and provide live insights into clinical studies.Synthetic Control Arm (SCA) matches patients treated with a new investigational therapy to anonymized clinical trial patients from Medidata’s extensive repository of historical clinical trials. SCAs are especially advantageous where the standard of care control treatment is considered undesirable by some patients and physicians  as is the case with rare disease trials.“ Medidata continues to expand its patient-centric offerings by delivering comprehensive solutions for the development of therapeutics for some of the world’s most rare and difficult to treat diseases ” said Joan Shaiman  senior vice president  Partners at Medidata. “ The expansion of our partnership with Ergomed will not only improve their trial reach and scope  but enable them to attract additional sponsor business.”More than 7 000 rare diseases have been identified in the U.S. alone  but only 500 therapies have been approved.

The launch  combined with becoming a sponsor of the Celiac Disease Foundation  puts empowerDX in a unique position to help a large population of Americans in debilitating physical and mental pain without clear answers. The Celiac Disease Foundation leads the fight to increase the rate of diagnosis  improve treatments  and find a cure.Celiac disease is a genetic autoimmune condition where the body’s immune system attacks the small intestine when gluten is consumed. More than 99% of people who develop celiac disease carry one of the genetic variants identified in our test. Symptoms can range from abdominal issues and joint pain to brain fog  depressed mood  and concentration issues. If left untreated  celiac disease can lead to serious health complications including heart disease  intestinal cancers  and fertility issues.An estimated three million Americans have celiac disease. With increased risk awareness and accessible testing  more of these individuals can be properly diagnosed. Currently  60-70% of individuals with celiac disease are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. On average  it takes 6-10 years for a symptomatic individual to be diagnosed with celiac disease. Celiac disease can present with a spectrum of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms which can make early diagnosis challenging. Knowledge of disease risk facilitates the path to proper diagnosis for physicians and healthcare providers. The empowerDX Celiac Risk Gene Test provides access to high quality HLA genetic testing  which requires specialized equipment and rare expertise  at a remarkable value.Unlike most blood-based celiac disease genetic tests  the empowerDX assay uses a sample taken from two non-invasive mouth swabs to analyze HLA markers. Results for each marker are provided to individuals through a secure online portal ten business days after sample-receipt at the company’s CLIA-certified lab. The test is $199 and available for ages 3+.Susceptibility to celiac disease is strongly associated with the HLA alleles DQA1*05:02 and DQB1*02:01  but these markers alone do not necessarily mean people have or will develop the disease. Individuals with the presence of genetic markers should consult with their physician on how to monitor for celiac disease and improve their overall gut health. Testing negative for all three markers means the lifetime risk of developing celiac disease is less than one percent.The revolutionary at-home Celiac Risk Gene Test is characteristic of the ethos defining the mission of empowerDX. Celiac disease affects the lives of millions of people in the US  and this test bridges to the gap between demand and access to a test critical to lifetime risk assessment. Eurofins Donor & Product Testing  Inc. performs the molecular testing and carries extensive experience to test and interpret HLA results.Boston-area based  empowerDX  now has a robust portfolio of more than 20 products  including the first at-home PFAS test as well as MTHFR  CoQ10  vitamin D  APOE  and one of the most sensitive at-home COVID PCR tests on the market. The start-up strives to make testing for a wide range of issues  including heart  sexual and mental health  thyroid  and vitamin-deficiencies  affordable and accessible to the consumer.For more information on the empowerDX Celiac Risk Gene Test  please visit empowerDXlab.com.ABOUT EMPOWERDXLaunched in 2019 empowerDX is the online shop for easy at-home health testing. empowerDX specializes in FDA-authorized COVID-19 testing  women’s health  men’s health  sexual health  and general wellness testing.

ADVANCE met its primary endpoint demonstrating that a higher proportion of chronic ITP patients receiving VYVGART achieved a sustained platelet count response compared to placebo. ADVANCE is the first Phase 3 clinical trial of a neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in ITP.“Immune thrombocytopenia is a rare  debilitating autoimmune disease that can be very difficult to treat  especially in patients who have an insufficient response to previous ITP therapies. There is no clear standard of care and many patients continue to experience significant symptoms and decreased quality of life ” said Catherine Broome  M.D.  Associate Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center  and Principal Investigator in the ADVANCE study. “These data are very promising as they show that platelet counts can rapidly improve to clinically meaningful levels following VYVGART treatment in a proportion of a heavily pretreated patient population. We are excited that targeting pathogenic IgG autoantibodies could represent a new  potential approach to help alleviate the disease burden in this patient community.”Story continuesThe ADVANCE trial enrolled 131 adult patients with chronic and persistent ITP. Patients were heavily pretreated and 67% of patients had received three or more prior ITP therapies  including 59% who had prior thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RAs) experience  34% with prior rituximab experience and 37% with a history of splenectomy. Patients were insufficiently controlled at baseline with mean platelet counts of 17x109/L across all patients. Of patients who completed the full ADVANCE study  94% (63/67) of VYVGART-treated patients and 97% (38/39) of placebo patients continued to the ADVANCE+ open-label extension study.Highlights of Phase 3 ADVANCE DataPrimary endpoint metADVANCE met its primary endpoint demonstrating a significantly higher proportion of patients with chronic ITP receiving VYVGART (17/78; 21.8%) compared to placebo (2/40; 5%) achieved a sustained platelet response (p=0.0316)  defined as having platelet counts greater than or equal to 50x109/L on at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24 of treatment.Primary endpoint responders were observed across patient types regardless of age  disease severity  time since diagnosis  prior ITP treatment or background medication.Key platelet-derived secondary endpoints demonstrated statistical significanceKey platelet-derived secondary endpoints showed VYVGART-treated patients had a statistically significant benefit compared to placebo on (1) cumulative number of weeks where platelet counts were at least 50x109/L in the chronic ITP population (p=0.0009) and (2) sustained platelet response in the overall population  including both chronic and persistent ITP patients (p=0.0108). Numerically fewer WHO-classified bleeding events occurred in treated patients throughout the trial but the difference from placebo was not statistically significant. A higher proportion of treated patients in the overall population achieved a durable  sustained platelet response compared to placebo  defined as a sustained platelet response on at least six of the last eight scheduled visits between weeks 17 and 24 of treatment (p=0.0265)  but was not considered statistically significant based on hierarchical testing.Additional secondary endpoints provided clinically meaningful data on platelet count responses throughout 24-week trialAdditional secondary endpoint data from the ADVANCE trial are consistent with primary and secondary platelet-derived endpoints and provide additional context on metrics that often drive treatment decisions.International Working Group (IWG) responder status : 51.2% of VYVGART-treated patients were classified as IWG responders and 27.9% as complete responders compared to 20% of placebo patients as IWG responders and 4.4% as complete responders. IWG responders are defined as having a platelet count of at least 30x10 9 /L  a two-fold increase in platelet count from baseline  and the absence of bleeding for two separate  consecutive weekly visits. Complete responders are patients with platelet counts of 100x10 9 /L and the absence of bleeding for two separate  consecutive weekly visits.Mean platelet count change from baseline : VYVGART-treated patients demonstrated a rapid onset of platelet count improvement with statistically significant separation from placebo observed at week one and maintained through 20 out of 24 weeks of the trial.Switch to biweekly dosing: Ten VYVGART-treated patients switched to a biweekly (every two weeks) dosing schedule after achieving platelet counts of 100x109/L for three out of four consecutive visits  compared to one placebo patient. Nine of the ten treated patients achieved a sustained platelet response.Consistent safety and tolerability profileADVANCE is the second registrational trial of VYVGART and the first to evaluate chronic weekly dosing. VYVGART was well-tolerated in this 24-week study and the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous clinical trials.“In listening to and learning from people in the ITP community  we understand the impact of living with this disease can extend beyond physical signs  taking a serious toll on a person’s quality of life. These compelling preliminary data emphasize the potential for VYVGART to drive responses in ITP regardless of prior lines of therapy  history of splenectomy or time from diagnosis. We look forward to learning more about the potential approach of targeting pathogenic IgGs in ITP through our ADVANCE-SC trial  which is on track to read out in the first quarter of next year ” said Luc Truyen  MD  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at argenx. “The totality of data generated thus far continue to support the key attributes of VYVGART  including its onset of action and safety profile. These data further reinforce our confidence in FcRn blockade as a precision tool with the potential to reach a broad spectrum of IgG-mediated severe autoimmune diseases.”The Phase 3 ADVANCE trial is the first of two registrational trials being conducted as part of the ongoing ITP development program. ADVANCE-SC is evaluating subcutaneous efgartigimod for the treatment of primary ITP. Topline data from the ADVANCE-SC study are expected in the first quarter of 2023.Phase 3 ADVANCE Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADVANCE trial was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicenter  global trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of VYVGART in adult patients with chronic or persistent primary ITP. ​A total of 131 adult patients with primary ITP in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial and received VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Enrolled patients had a confirmed ITP diagnosis and a mean entry platelet count of less than 30x109/L. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one ITP treatment prior to randomization and had received at least one prior therapy. Concomitant medications permitted included corticosteroids  nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  fostamatinib or TPO-RAs. If patients were on 'watch and wait' at baseline  they had to have received at least 2 prior treatments for ITP. ​Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Randomized patients received weekly infusions from weeks 1-4 and were eligible to adjust frequency to bi-weekly depending on platelet count. Administration frequency was fixed from study visits 16-24. ​The primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of patients with chronic ITP with a sustained platelet count response defined as achieving platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50x109/L for at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24. Patients who received rescue therapy at week 12 or later  or for whom dose and/or frequency of concurrent ITP therapies increased at week 12 or later  were considered non-responders. ​Key secondary endpoints included extent of disease control over 24-week treatment period  proportion of overall population with sustained platelet count response  incidence and severity of WHO-classified bleeding events and an extended primary endpoint analysis between weeks 17 and 24.About Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies destroy platelets and reduce platelet production  which can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. In severe cases  frequent bleeding events can cause anemia or even brain hemorrhage in rare cases. ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health  including anxiety  fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so there remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options.About VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is being studied in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and other IgG autoantibody-mediated diseases.Important Safety Information for VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) intravenous (IV) formulation (U.S. prescribing information) for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.What is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).What is the most important information I should know about VYVGART?VYVGART may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health  including anxiety  fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so there remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options.About ITP in ChinaThe prevalence of ITP in Greater China is estimated at 120 000 patients. Current first-line treatments are corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). However  there are concerns about side effects of corticosteroids  and there is limited access to IVIg therapy. Second-line treatment options are primarily thrombopoietic agents  rituximab  and splenectomy. Despite availability of these treatments with differing mechanisms of action  many patients develop resistance to treatment and are prone to relapse. There remains a significant need for new treatment options.About VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies.

More recently  receiving conditional approval from the UK MHRA is a great recognition for our inactivated COVID-19 vaccine and we are now focused on making it available to additional people in geographical Europe and other regions of the world. The first quarter was also marked by tangible signs of a travel industry recovery which has already started to positively impact our travel vaccine sales. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders  partners and employees for their ongoing support and contribution.”Clinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesLYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Further positive Phase 2 results reported including first pediatric dataValneva and Pfizer2 are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. The vaccine candidate covers the six OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe.In April 2022  Valneva and Pfizer reported first pediatric results for VLA15. In the Phase 2 study  VLA15 was found to be more immunogenic in pediatric participants (5-17 years old) than in adults with both two-dose or three-dose vaccination schedules. These positive data build on the strong immunogenicity profile reported for adult participants (18-65 years old) in February 2022. Based on these latest Phase 2 immunogenicity and safety data  Valneva and Pfizer plan to proceed with a three-dose primary series vaccination schedule for both adult and pediatric participants in a Phase 3 clinical trial planned to start in the third quarter of 2022.SARS-CoV-2 INACTIVATED VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA2001UK MHRA Conditional Marketing Authorization grantedVLA2001 is currently the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine candidate that has received an approval in geographical Europe. It is produced using Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for the Company’s commercial Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®.Valneva recently initiated a heterologous booster trial of VLA2001 to provide booster data following primary vaccination with an mRNA vaccine or natural COVID-19 infection3. These data  if positive  could support potential use of VLA2001 as heterologous booster  subject to applicable regulatory recommendations and approvals. Topline results are expected in the third quarter of 2022.In April 2022  VLA2001 was granted Conditional Marketing Authorization by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for primary immunization in adults 18 to 50 years of age4. This authorization followed emergency use authorization from the Bahraini NHRA in March 20225.Valneva remains focused on achieving a Conditional Marketing Authorization for VLA2001 within the European Union. The Company is still in a rolling review process with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Following its April meeting  the CHMP provided another List of Questions  to which Valneva has already responded. If the CHMP accepts these responses  the Company would expect a Conditional Marketing Authorization this quarter.The Company signed a supply agreement with the European Commission (EC) in November 20216.CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1553Final Positive Phase 3 Results reportedValneva is developing a single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to over 100 countries.In March 2022  Valneva announced successful completion of the Phase 3 pivotal trial of VLA15537. The final six-month analysis confirmed the very high level of seroprotection reported in August 2021. Six months after receiving a single vaccination  96.3% of participants showed protective chikungunya virus-neutralizing antibody titers. VLA1553’s safety and tolerability profile was also consistent with topline Phase 3 data. Valneva has initiated pre-submission discussions with the US FDA and expects to submit its Biologics License Application (BLA) in the second half of 2022.The Company also previously reported positive topline lot-to-lot manufacturing consistency trial results for VLA15538. This is one of the standard requirements for vaccine licensure  and final lot-to-lot results are expected in the second quarter of 2022.Valneva also initiated a Phase 3 trial in adolescents in January 2022. The trial  conducted in Brazil by Instituto Butantan  is designed to support label extension to this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults in the US9. Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations  the trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic region.Commercial VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is the only Japanese encephalitis vaccine licensed and available in the US  Canada and Europe.IXIARO®/JESPECT® product sales decreased by 68.6% (70.5% at constant exchange rates) to €4.2 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €13.3 million in the first quarter of 2021. Sales to the private travel markets showed significant recovery with IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales reaching €3.9 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €1.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 while sales to the US Government’s Department of Defense (DoD) were lower in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period last year as per the planned delivery schedule.CHOLERA / ETEC10-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.DUKORAL® product sales increased significantly to €2.5 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €0.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 equally attributable to a recovery of the travel business across all markets.First Quarter 2022 Financial Review(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €21.8 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €23.2 million in the first quarter of 2021  a decrease of 5.9%.Product sales  including first COVID-19 vaccine sales  increased by 0.2% to €16.2 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €16.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. On a constant exchange rate (CER) basis  product sales decreased by 4.8% in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021. Product sales excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales amounted to €12.4 million in the first quarter of 2022  a decrease of 23.3% (27.2% at CER) compared to the first quarter of 2021.IXIARO®/JESPECT® product sales decreased by 68.6% (70.5% at CER) to €4.2 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €13.3 million in the first quarter of 2021. Sales to the private travel markets showed significant recovery while sales to the US Government’s Department of Defense (DoD) were lower in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period last year as per the planned delivery schedule. DUKORAL® also benefited from the travel market recovery as sales increased significantly to €2.5 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €0.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. COVID-19 product vaccine sales amounted to €3.8 million resulting from first shipments of VLA2001 to Bahrain. Third Party product sales more than doubled to €5.6 million in the first quarter of 2022 from €2.7 million in the first quarter of 2021 driven by growth related to Valneva’s distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic for the sales of Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur®.Other revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services amounted to €5.6 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €7.1 million in the first quarter of 2021.Operating Result and EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €13.9 million in the first quarter of 2022. Gross margin on product sales excluding COVID-19 sales was 68.5% compared to 41.7% in the first quarter of 2021. Both IXIARO® and DUKORAL®’s gross margins  of 99.3% and 92.0% respectively  were affected by inventory revaluation gains and releases of write-off provisions resulting from increased sales projections as well as the positive effect from the Company’s share price development on the employee share-based compensation programs. Of the remaining COGS for the first quarter of 2022  €3.7 million were related to the Third-Party product distribution business  €8.0 million to the COVID-19 business and €1.9 million to cost of services. In the first quarter of 2021  overall COGS were €14.7 million  of which €9.6 million related to cost of goods and €5.1 million related to cost of services.Research and development investments amounted to €20.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €27.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by the progression of Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine program  VLA1553  towards BLA submission and the lower clinical trial costs resulting from it as well as lower investments in Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate VLA2001. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first quarter of 2022 amounted to €2.0 million compared to €4.9 million in the first quarter of 2021. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first quarter of 2022 notably included €0.9 million of expenses related to the launch preparation costs of the chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  (compared to €1.2 million in the first quarter of 2021). In the first quarter of 2022  general and administrative expenses declined to €5.8 million from €10.0 million in the first quarter of 2021. COGS  research and development  marketing and distribution as well as general and administrative expenses benefited from a provision release of €11.7 million related to the positive effect of the Company’s share price development on the employee share-based compensation programs. This income compares to a cost of €4.8 million in the first quarter of 2021.Other income  net of other expenses  reduced to €2.1 million in the first quarter of 2022 from €3.0 million in the first quarter of 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by reduced R&D tax credits directly resulting from lower R&D spending.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €18.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to an operating loss of €31.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA loss in the first quarter of 2022 was €12.7 million compared to an EBITDA loss of €28.3 million in the first quarter of 2021.Net ResultIn the first quarter of 2022  Valneva generated a net loss of €26.0 million compared to a net loss of €27.7 million in the first quarter of 2021.Finance expense and currency effects in the first quarter of 2022 resulted in a net finance expense of €7.1 million  compared to a net finance income of €3.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. This was mainly a result of a foreign exchange loss amounting to €2.4 million in the first quarter of 2022  primarily driven by revaluation results of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €7.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. Interest charges slightly increased to €4.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €4.6 million in the first quarter of 2021.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €26.9 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €47.6 million of cash generated in operating activities in the first quarter of 2021. Cash outflows in the first quarter of 2022 were mainly related to the operating loss generated in the period  while during the first quarter of 2021 cash inflows mainly resulted from pre-payments related to the vaccine supply agreement signed with the UK government.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €9.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €16.9 million in the first quarter of 2021  both mainly as a result of COVID-19-related construction activities across production sites in Scotland and Sweden  as well as equipment purchases.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €1.0 million in the first quarter of 2022  which was mainly a result of proceeds from the issuance of new shares in relation to employee stock option and free share programs. Cash outflows in the first quarter of 2021 amounted to €1.6 million and mainly consisted of payments related to interest and lease liabilities.Liquid funds decreased to €311.3 million as of March 31  2022  compared to €346.7 million as of December 31  2021. The cash decrease mainly resulted from ongoing COVID-19-related investments into fixed assets and R&D expenses.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results  as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provide additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating loss  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million 3 months ending March 31 (unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS) 2022 2021 Operating Loss (18.4) (31.1) Add: Amortization 1.6 1.5 Depreciation 3.6 1.3 Impairment of Tangible Assets - - Adjusted EBITDA (13.3) (28.3)About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  production and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

This information has not been audited.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars’ net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document. The terms “Revenues” or “Net Banking Income” are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar’s net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the “Operating Expenses” as presented in note 8.1 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at December 31st  2021 (pages 482 et seq. of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document). The term “costs” is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (« SRF ») are part of IFRIC21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 – Exceptional items – Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar’s activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings.The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below:Q1 22 (In EURm) OperatingExpenses Cost of risk Net profit orlosses fromother assets Incometax Group netincome Business Reported (5 329) (561) 2 (353) 842 (+) IFRIC 21 linearisation 860 (218) 626 (+) Transformation charges* 143 (37) 106 Corporate Center(1) Underlying (4 325) (561) 2 (608) 1 574 Q1 21 (In EURm) OperatingExpenses Cost of risk Net profit orlosses fromother assets Incometax Group netincome Business Reported (4 748) (276) 6 (283) 814 (+) IFRIC 21 linearisation 601 (141) 448 (+) Transformation charges* 50 (14) 36 Corporate Center(2) Underlying (4 097) (276) 6 (438) 1 298(*) Exceptional item(1) Q1 22 transformation charges related to French Retail Banking (EUR 104m)  Global Banking & Investor Solutions (EUR 14m) and Corporate Centre (EUR 25m)(2) Q1 21 transformation charges related to French Retail Banking (EUR 38m)  Global Banking and Investor Solutions (EUR 1m) and Corporate Center (EUR 11m)6 - Cost of risk in basis points  coverage ratio for doubtful outstandingsThe cost of risk is defined on pages 43 and 663 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document. This indicator makes it possible to assess the level of risk of each of the pillars as a percentage of balance sheet loan commitments  including operating leases.In EURm Q1 22 Q1 21 French Retail BankingNet Cost Of Risk 47 129 Gross loan Outstandings 242 645 233 953 Cost of Risk in bp 8 22 International Retail Banking and Financial ServicesNet Cost Of Risk 325 142 Gross loan Outstandings 140 547 130 196 Cost of Risk in bp 92 44 Global Banking and Investor SolutionsNet Cost Of Risk 194 3 Gross loan Outstandings 170 749 138 305 Cost of Risk in bp 45 1 Corporate CentreNet Cost Of Risk (5) 2 Gross loan Outstandings 14 413 12 963 Cost of Risk in bp (12) 4 Societe Generale GroupNet Cost Of Risk 561 276 Gross loan Outstandings 568 354 515 416 Cost of Risk in bp 39 21The gross coverage ratio for doubtful outstandings is calculated as the ratio of provisions recognised in respect of the credit risk to gross outstandings identified as in default within the meaning of the regulations  without taking account of any guarantees provided. This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (“doubtful”).7 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on page 43 and 44 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document. This measure makes it possible to assess Societe Generale’s return on equity and return on tangible equity.RONE (Return on Normative Equity) determines the return on average normative equity allocated to the Group’s businesses  according to the principles presented on page 44 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document.Group net income used for the ratio numerator is book Group net income adjusted for “interest net of tax payable on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  interest paid to holders of deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations” and “unrealised gains/losses booked under shareholders’ equity  excluding conversion reserves” (see methodology note No. 9). For ROTE  income is also restated for goodwill impairment.Details of the corrections made to book equity in order to calculate ROE and ROTE for the period are given in the table below:ROTE calculation: calculation methodologyEnd of period (in EURm) Q1 22 Q1 21 Shareholders' equity Group share 65 852 62 920 Deeply subordinated notes (8 178) (9 179) Undated subordinated notes - (273) Interest of deeeply & undated subodinated notes  issue premium amortisations(1) (65) (51) OCI excluding conversion reserves 120 (723) Dividend provision(2) (415) (353) ROE equity end-of-period 55 029 52 340 Average ROE equity 54 669 51 771 Average Goodwill (3 624) (3 928) Average Intangible Assets (2 753) (2 506) Average ROTE equity 48 292 45 337 Group net Income (a) 842 814 Underlying Group net income (b) 1 574 1 298 Interest on deeply subordinated notes and undated subordinated notes (c) (119) (144) Cancellation of goodwill impairment (d) 2 - Ajusted Group net Income (e) = (a)+ (c)+(d) 725 670 Ajusted Underlying Group net Income (f)=(b)+(c) 1 457 1 154 Average ROTE equity (g) 48 292 45 337 ROTE [quarter: (4*e/g)] 6.0% 5.9% Average ROTE equity (underlying) (h) 49 024 45 821 Underlying ROTE [quarter: (4*f/h)] 11.9% 10.1%(1) Interest net of tax  payable or paid to holders of deeply subordinated notes & undated subordinated notes  issue premium amortisations(2) The dividend to be paid is calculated based on a pay-out ratio of 50% of the underlying Group net income  after deduction of deeply subordinated notes and on undated subordinated notesRONE calculation: Average capital allocated to Core BusinessesIn EURm Q1 22 Q1 21 Change French Retail Banking 11 822 12 208 -3.2% International Retail Banking and Financial Services 11 018 9 963 +10.6% Global Banking and Investor Solutions 14 128 13 404 +5.4% Core Businesses 36 968 35 576 +3.9% Corporate Center 17 701 15 975 +10.8% Group 54 669 51 550 +6.1%NB: Amounts restated in Q1 22 to take into account the transfer of Private Banking activities (French and international) to the French Retail Banking.

This demonstrates once again the rebound capacity and the growth potential of JCDecaux.Digital Out-Of-Home (DOOH) grew very strongly  doubling year-on-year  at +103.1% in reported growth and +95.2% organically in Q1 2022  to reach 29.1% of Group revenue vs 21.5% in Q1 2021. We continued to accelerate our digital transformation and maintained our focus on the roll-out of digital screens and on the development of our automated data-driven planning and trading solutions. Programmatic advertising continued to gain good momentum via the VIOOH platform now trading in 15 countries including its launch in US airports in February. VIOOH is the most connected programmatic trading platform of the OOH industry with 36 DSPs (Demand Side Platforms) connected.By activity  Street Furniture was strong at +52.6% organically in Q1 2022 and was above Q1 2019 levels in Europe (including France and UK) and in North America; Billboard grew significantly as well at +25.6% on an organic basis in Q1 2022  above 2019 in Asia-Pacific and North-America; Transport grew strongly at +46.1% but remained meaningfully impacted by ongoing restrictions on global international air passenger traffic and by lower commuter traffic in public transport than pre-pandemic.All geographies grew strongly in Q1 2022. Europe (including France and UK)  North America and Rest of the World were the main growth drivers  while Asia-Pacific grew at a lower pace due to its Transport exposure and to local mobility restrictions in China.As far as Q2 2022 is concerned  we continue to have a solid trading momentum but given increased mobility restrictions in China since the beginning of the quarter including extended lockdowns in several provinces  we expect an organic revenue growth of above +15%.As the most digitised global OOH company with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet and the high quality of our teams across the world  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to support the economic recovery as well as to drive positive changes.”Following the adoption of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014  the operating data presented below is adjusted to include our prorata share in companies under joint control. Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros. The sum of the rounded amounts or variations calculations may differ  albeit to an insignificant extent  from the reported values.Adjusted revenue for the first quarter 2022 increased by +50.3% to €683 million compared to €454.3 million in the first quarter of 2021.Excluding the positive impact from foreign exchange variations (no impact from changes in perimeter)  adjusted revenue increased by +45.7%.Adjusted advertising revenue  excluding revenue related to sale  rental and maintenance of street furniture and advertising displays  increased by +51.4% on an organic basis in the first quarter of 2022.Q1 adjusted revenue 2022 (€m) 2021 (€m) Reported growth Organic growth(a) Street Furniture 347.5 223.8 +55.3% +52.6% Transport 234.9 151.6 +54.9% +46.1% Billboard 100.6 78.9 +27.5% +25.6% Total 683.0 454.3 +50.3% +45.7%a.

All geographies performed strongly compared to Q1 2021  Europe (including France and UK)  the Rest of the World and North America were the drivers of growth while Asia-Pacific was also up double-digit but at a lower pace as it remained affected by mobility restrictions. Europe (including France and UK) and North America were above the Q1 2019 revenue levels.First quarter adjusted advertising revenue  excluding revenue related to sale  rental and maintenance of street furniture was up +60.8% on an organic basis compared to the first quarter of 2021.TRANSPORTFirst quarter adjusted revenue increased by +54.9% to €234.9 million (+46.1% on an organic basis)  reflecting a rebound in both air passenger traffic and public transport commuting. While China was up single-digit impacted by local mobility restrictions including partial to full lockdowns in several provinces  all other regions grew very significantly year-on-year.BILLBOARDFirst quarter adjusted revenue increased by +27.5% to €100.6 million (+25.6% on an organic basis). All geographies grew strongly with North America and Asia-Pacific above Q1 2019 revenues.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group  operating data of the companies under joint control will continue to be proportionately integrated in the operating management reports used by directors to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data prior to 2014  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q1 2022  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€54.4 million (-€37.6 million in Q1 2021)  leaving IFRS revenue at €628.5 million (€416.7 million in Q1 2021).ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 2021 adjusted revenue (a) 454.3 2022 IFRS revenue (b) 628.5 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 54.4 2022 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 683.0 Currency impacts (e) -20.9 2022 adjusted revenue at 2021 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 662.1 Change in scope (g) 0.0 2022 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 662.1 Organic growth (i) = (h) / (a) – 1 +45.7%€m Impact of currency as of March 31st  2022 RMB -6.7 USD -3.7 GBP -2.8 HKD -1.5 Other -6.2 Total -20.9Average exchange rate Q1 2022 Q1 2021 RMB 0.1404 0.1281 USD 0.8915 0.8300 GBP 1.1956 1.1443 HKD 0.1142 0.1070Next information:Annual General Meeting of Shareholders: May 11th  20222022 half year results : July 28th  2022 (before market)Key Figures for JCDecaux2021 revenue: €2 745m (a)N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of more than 850 million people in more than 80 countries957 706 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 518 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants10 720 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexesJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (4.2/5) CDP (A Leadership) MSCI (AAA) and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100 (committed to 100% renewable energy)Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (530 143 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 154 airports and 215 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (340 753 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (72 611 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (596 831 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (232 268 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (64 893 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (20 808 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (14 177 advertising panels)(a) Adjusted revenueFor more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com.Join us on Twitter  LinkedIn  Facebook  Instagram and YouTube.Forward looking statementsThis news release may contain some forward-looking statements.

As a brief recap  our internal team believed that clearinghouses are a smart investment in uncertain times. We are positive about the following:Macroeconomic environments will drive volatility and volumes on exchanges  using VIX as a company's revenue proxy we are estimating higher results for the Q2; Strong company results and better than expected synergies from the Refinitiv integration; Limited Russia and Ukraine exposure.Q1 ResultsLooking at the CEO's comment  we see that our long-term view has been confirmed by his words: “LSEG has delivered a good first quarter  with strong underlying performance across all divisions. During the quarter we announced two acquisitions to enhance our product offerings in Trading & Banking and Customer & Third-Party Risk. We also announced the divestment of BETA+  which will simplify and refocus our Wealth Solutions business"". London Stock Exchange Group continues to be resilient. 73% of LSE income is highly recurring in nature with a diversified clientele  sector and product activities and with a high geographical footprint.Looking at the details  top-line sales were just a bit above the consensus expectations  in particular  we note that capital market sales offset the post-trade division. LSEG's total revenue stood at £1.751 billion and this was up by 6.3% compared to the previous year-end. If we include Russia / Ukraine impacts  revenue would have been up by 6.8%. For 2022  we understand £60m is the data & analytics business impact on clientele based in Russia.London Stock Exchange Group Q1 ResultsSource: London Stock Exchange Group Q1 Trading UpdateRefinitiv synergies are on track and the company achieved a £25m run-rate in Q1 stating also that they will meet all the financial targets. Looking again at the M&A  LSE will complete the other two acquisitions to reinforce post-trade solutions with Quantile and TORA  and GDC for the data & analytics businesses. BETA+ net of proceeds will return to shareholders via share repurchasing likely to happen in Q3.The CEO was pretty happy to announce that ""Our ability to invest for growth  make strategic acquisitions and return capital to shareholders demonstrates the strength of the Group and its high-quality recurring revenues. The Group is well positioned and we look forward to further progress during the rest of 2022"".Conclusion And ValuationOur internal team has high confidence in the business combination with Refinitiv. The combined company offers more resiliency for investors and a strategic logic in economies of scope. We believe that management is on track to achieve ""EBITDA >50% target by end of next year"". Looking at the valuation  we see that LSE is undervalued compared to Euronext and Deutsche Börse both at P/E and also on EV/EBITDA. We believe this is not justified and we reiterate our valuation of 8700p based on an EV/EBITDA of 18x.London Stock Exchange Group GuidanceSource: London Stock Exchange Group Q1 Trading UpdateIf you are interested in our previous articles on the European stock exchange  please have a look at our recent publications:",neutral,0.09,0.87,0.04,mixed,0.58,0.1,0.32,True,English,"['London Stock Exchange Q1 Earnings', 'Refinitiv Integration', 'Track', 'London Stock Exchange Group Q1 Trading Update', 'London Stock Exchange Group Q1 Results Source', 'London Stock Exchange Group Guidance Source', 'London Stock Exchange Group plc', 'European stock exchange', 'strong underlying performance', 'high-quality recurring revenues', 'Deutsche Börse', 'high geographical footprint', 'Strong company results', 'good first quarter', 'Wealth Solutions business', 'other two acquisitions', 'capital market sales', 'The Group', 'Q1 numbers', 'higher results', 'top-line sales', 'post-trade solutions', 'high confidence', 'business impact', 'strategic acquisitions', 'business combination', 'CHUNYIP WONG', 'Getty Images', 'buy rating', 'OTCPK:LDNXF', 'OTCPK:LNSTY', 'brief recap', 'internal team', 'smart investment', 'uncertain times', 'Macroeconomic environments', 'long-term view', 'product offerings', 'Third-Party Risk', 'product activities', 'consensus expectations', 'post-trade division', 'previous year-end', '£25m run-rate', 'financial targets', 'M&A', 'share repurchasing', 'strategic logic', 'EBITDA >50% target', 'next year', 'previous articles', 'recent publications', 'combined company', 'revenue proxy', 'Refinitiv integration', 'total revenue', 'Ukraine exposure', 'diversified clientele', 'analytics businesses', 'BETA+ net', 'Limited Russia', 'LSE income', 'Refinitiv synergies', 'iStock', 'initiation', 'coverage', 'clearinghouses', 'volatility', 'volumes', 'exchanges', 'VIX', 'Q2', 'CEO', 'comment', 'words', 'LSEG', 'divisions', 'Banking', 'Customer', 'divestment', 'nature', 'sector', 'details', 'data', 'track', 'Quantile', 'TORA', 'GDC', 'proceeds', 'shareholders', 'Q3.', 'ability', 'growth', 'strength', 'progress', 'rest', 'Conclusion', 'Valuation', 'resiliency', 'investors', 'economies', 'scope', 'management', 'Euronext', 'P/E', 'EV/EBITDA', '8700p', '18x', 'look', '2022']",2022-05-05,2022-05-05,seekingalpha.com
