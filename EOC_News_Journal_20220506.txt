4254,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.risk.net/commodities/7946921/trade-finance-house-of-the-year-tramontana-asset-management,Trade finance house of the year: Tramontana Asset Management,1 day ago,In the increasingly volatile market conditions of 2021  Tramontana Asset Management developed and deployed trade finance solutions to satisfy corporate demand for financing. These solutions have simultaneously provided a growing number of institutional investors with the opportunity to participate in the energy transition. For its innovative work in making the carbon markets accessible to mainstream investors and providing corporates with better access to financing  Tramontana has won Energy Risk’s 2022 Trade finance house of the year award.As a specialist investment company  Tramontana develops hedging and financing solutions for corporate clients  partnering with large institutional investors to fund these transactions. The team of eight people has built up more than $5 billion in assets under management since its 2014 launch  focusing on the energy transition and carbon-backed financing.Managing directors and co-founders of Tramontana  Paul Jackman and Bharath Manium  believe a successful transition to a low-carbon economy requires the full support of global capital markets. The company took a large step towards that goal last year when it completed a significant financing transaction that served both a corporate hedger and a large financial institution looking for exposure to the energy transition space.Tramontana works with corporate clients to help implement effective hedging strategies that are unconstrained by the liquidity limitations of futures markets based on the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme. This particular solution was developed to minimise hedging slippage and reduce the balance sheet burden of managing the margining requirements of on-exchange hedge positions.“Our solution involves issuing secured ring-fenced notes  purchased by our financing partners  and acquiring carbon from the market  says Jackman. “The carbon certificates are held in a registry account for the duration of the note – this could be a three-  five- or seven-year note  depending on the transaction. The corporate client then buys the carbon certificates at the end of that tenor.”The solution  which Jackman describes as “a scalable  multi-issuance programme”  repackages energy transition-related assets as standard notes so they can be held in clearing systems such as Euroclear and Clearstream. Physical energy assets cannot be held in clearing systems  an issue that has traditionally left many institutional investors reluctant to participate in this growing market. This solution solves the accounting  regulatory and management challenges of holding such assets.Furthermore  to provide investors such as pension funds and insurers with pure-play investments in this space  Tramontana mitigates non-carbon-specific risks such as credit risk via hedging and various collateralisation solutions.As a result  Tramontana has been able to build a deeper and wider liquidity pool to fund such transactions by attracting wider investor interest  such as the specialist UK pension firm it worked with for the first time last year. According to Manium and Jackman  the growth in investor interest has seen Tramontana’s typical transaction size increase by more than 40% year on year.“Our financing partners are sophisticated institutions who are familiar with structured finance and comfortable with the associated documentation and operational complexity ” explains Manium. “The key objective in our attempt to widen market participation in our products  was to make them more accessible to insurance and pension fund investors  who have traditionally been less active in structured finance linked to the energy transition.”Although interest in green investments has undoubtedly grown in recent years  Tramontana’s trade finance solution aims to enable greater access to the market  boosting opportunities for corporate hedgers.“The energy transition is a topic everyone is discussing. Many companies are putting targets in place for investing in environmental  social and governance strategies  and so investments like these are integral to that kind of strategy ” says Manium. “But I think the situation we currently find ourselves in is that there is a lot of demand from investors but not enough assets.”Jackman adds: “Tramontana’s carbon-backed securities programme enables non-specialist investors to access energy transition markets and has opened the door to a significantly deeper pool of investor capital to be deployed in the energy transition space.”The investment firm has clearly achieved its aim of boosting access to carbon markets for the wider capital markets  in turn significantly increasing its corporate clients’ access to capital for trade finance and risk management activities.,neutral,0.11,0.86,0.03,negative,0.01,0.05,0.94,True,English,"['Trade finance house', 'Tramontana Asset Management', 'year', 'specialist UK pension firm', 'Emissions Trading Scheme', 'balance sheet burden', 'exchange hedge positions', 'scalable, multi-issuance programme', 'large financial institution', 'secured ring-fenced notes', 'carbon-backed securities programme', 'typical transaction size', '2022 Trade finance house', 'various collateralisation solutions', 'pension fund investors', 'specialist investment company', 'wider liquidity pool', 'volatile market conditions', 'global capital markets', 'wider capital markets', 'risk management activities', 'trade finance solutions', 'energy transition-related assets', 'Physical energy assets', 'large institutional investors', 'energy transition markets', 'wider investor interest', 'many institutional investors', 'effective hedging strategies', 'energy transition space', 'significant financing transaction', 'Tramontana Asset Management', 'corporate clients’ access', 'investment firm', 'pension funds', 'Energy Risk', 'large step', 'investor capital', 'liquidity limitations', 'futures markets', 'standard notes', 'structured finance', 'Many companies', 'governance strategies', 'successful transition', 'carbon-backed financing', 'credit risk', 'carbon markets', 'management challenges', 'corporate hedger', 'mainstream investors', 'non-specialist investors', 'financing solutions', 'growing number', 'innovative work', 'eight people', 'Managing directors', 'low-carbon economy', 'full support', 'European Union', 'margining requirements', 'registry account', 'clearing systems', 'accounting, regulatory', 'carbon-specific risks', 'first time', 'sophisticated institutions', 'associated documentation', 'operational complexity', 'key objective', 'recent years', 'enough assets', 'deeper pool', 'financing partners', 'carbon certificates', 'growing market', 'market participation', 'hedging slippage', 'greater access', 'pure-play investments', 'green investments', 'corporate demand', 'particular solution', 'seven-year note', 'year award', 'Bharath Manium', 'Paul Jackman', 'opportunity', 'corporates', 'transactions', 'team', '2014 launch', 'founders', 'goal', 'exposure', 'duration', 'end', 'tenor', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'issue', 'insurers', 'result', 'growth', 'attempt', 'products', 'insurance', 'opportunities', 'topic', 'everyone', 'targets', 'place', 'social', 'kind', 'strategy', 'situation', 'lot', 'door', 'aim', 'turn']",2022-05-05,2022-05-06,risk.net

Except for the covenants described under “Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes—Consolidation  Merger and Sale” in the accompanying Prospectus  the Subordinated Note Indenture does not contain provisions that afford holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes protection in the event the Company is involved in a highly leveraged transaction or other similar transaction that may adversely affect such holders. The Subordinated Note Indenture does not limit the Company’s ability to issue or incur other debt or issue preferred stock.Each series of Junior Subordinated Notes is limited in an aggregate principal amount to $862 500 000.The Company will not pay any additional amounts to holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes in respect of any tax  assessment or governmental charge.Ranking; SubordinationThe Company’s obligations under the Junior Subordinated Notes are unsecured and rank junior in right of payment to all of the Company’s “Senior Indebtedness ” whether presently existing or from time to time hereafter incurred  created  assumed or existing  as defined under “Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes—Subordination” in the accompanying Prospectus.

The first interest payment following this remarketing will be made on August 1  2022 and will include interest accrued (i) at an annual rate of 2.70% from  and including  May 1  2022 to  but excluding May   2022  the expected date of delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes  and (ii) (A) at an annual rate of % from  and including  May   2022 to  but excluding  August 1  2022  in the case of the Series 2019A JSNs  and (B) at an annual rate of % from  and including  May   2022 to  but excluding  August 1  2022  in the case of the Series 2019B JSNs.

The “Record Date” means the 15th day of the calendar month immediately preceding the calendar month in which the applicable Interest Payment Date falls (or  if such day is not a Business Day  the next preceding Business Day); provided that if any of the Junior Subordinated Notes are held by a securities depository in book-entry form  the Record Date for the Junior Subordinated Notes will be the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date.

Such global notes will be deposited with the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee as custodian for DTC.DTC advises that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law  a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the 1934 Act. DTC holds securities that its participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between participants’ accounts  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include United States and Non-United States securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC  National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation  all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC isS-9owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others  including securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies and clearing corporations that clear transactions through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant  either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC.Purchases of the Junior Subordinated Notes under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants  which will receive a credit for the Junior Subordinated Notes on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Junior Subordinated Note (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchases  but Beneficial Owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transactions  as well as periodic statements of their holdings  from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which they purchased the Junior Subordinated Notes. Transfers of ownership interests on the Junior Subordinated Notes are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Junior Subordinated Notes  except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Junior Subordinated Notes is discontinued. To facilitate subsequent transfers  all Junior Subordinated Notes deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s nominee  Cede & Co.  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of the Junior Subordinated Notes with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Junior Subordinated Notes; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts the Junior Subordinated Notes are credited  which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants  by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Notices will be sent to DTC.Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s procedures. Under its usual procedures  DTC mails an omnibus proxy to the Company as soon as possible after the Record Date. The omnibus proxy assigns the voting or consenting rights of Cede & Co. to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Junior Subordinated Notes are credited on the Record Date. The Company believes that these arrangements will enable the Beneficial Owners to exercise rights equivalent in substance to the rights that can be directly exercised by a registered holder of the Junior Subordinated Notes.Payments of principal and interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes will be made to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee of DTC). DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the Company or the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of each participant and not of DTC  the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee or the Company  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal and interest to Cede & Co. (or other such nominee of DTC) is the Company’s responsibility. Disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC  and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners is the responsibility of Direct Participants and Indirect Participants.In a few special situations described below  a book-entry security representing the Company’s securities will terminate and interests in it will be exchanged for physical certificates representing the securities. After that exchange  the choice of whether to hold securities directly or in street name will be up to each Beneficial Owner. Each Beneficial Owner must consult its bank  broker or other financial institution to find out how to have its interests in the securities transferred to its name  so that it will be a direct holder.The special situations for termination of a Global Security representing the Junior Subordinated Notes are:• DTC notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for that Global Security or DTC ceases to be a “clearing agency” registered under the 1934 Act and the Company is unable to find a qualified replacement for DTC within 90 days; or• any event of default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes has occurred and is continuing  or any other event has occurred and is continuing  which after notice or lapse of time  would become an event of default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes  and any Beneficial Owner requests that its beneficial interest be exchanged for a physical certificate.S-10DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes at any time by giving the Company or the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee reasonable notice. In the event no successor securities depository is obtained  certificates for the Junior Subordinated Notes will be printed and delivered.The information in this section concerning DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that the Company believes to be reliable  but neither the Company nor any remarketing agent takes any responsibility for the accuracy thereof.The Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor  determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under the Subordinated Note Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Junior Subordinated Note (including any transfers between or among Direct Participants of DTC or Beneficial Owners of interests in any Junior Subordinated Note) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by  and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of  the Subordinated Note Indenture  and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.Neither the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee nor any agent shall have any responsibility or liability for any actions taken or not taken by DTC.Global Clearance and Settlement ProceduresSecondary market trading between Clearstream Banking  société anonyme   Luxembourg (“Clearstream”) participants and/or Euroclear system participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and the Euroclear system  as applicable. Cross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC  on the one hand  and directly or indirectly through Clearstream participants or Euroclear system participants  on the other  will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its United States depositary; however  such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will  if the transaction meets its settlement requirements  deliver instructions to its United States depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving securities in DTC  and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream participants and Euroclear system participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective United States depositaries. Because of time-zone differences  credits of Junior Subordinated Notes received in Clearstream or the Euroclear system as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or any transactions in such Junior Subordinated Notes settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Euroclear system participant or Clearstream participant on such business day. Cash received in Clearstream or the Euroclear system as a result of sales of the Junior Subordinated Notes by or through a Clearstream participant or a Euroclear system participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or the Euroclear system cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC.MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONSThe following is a general discussion of the material United States federal income tax considerations relevant to the acquisition  ownership and disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes  and insofar as it relates to matters of United States federal income tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto  constitutes the opinion of the Company’s tax counsel  Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP. Except where noted  this discussion only applies to Junior Subordinated Notes that are held as capital assets by holders who purchase the Junior Subordinated Notes in the remarketing for cash at the offering price. This discussion does not describe all of the material tax considerations that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules  such as certain financial institutions  regulated investment companies  real estate investment trusts  banks  insurance companies  tax-exempt entities  certain former citizens or residents of the United States  dealers in securities  traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting  partnerships and other pass-through entities (and persons holding the Junior Subordinated Notes through a partnership or other pass-through entity)  holders whose functional currency is not the United States dollar  passive foreign investment companies  controlled foreign corporations and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid United States federal income tax or persons holding the Junior Subordinated Notes as part of a hedge  straddle or other integrated transaction. In addition  this discussion does not address the effect of any state  local  foreign or other tax laws or any United States federal estate  gift or alternative minimum tax considerations. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the “Code”)  administrative pronouncements  judicial decisions and final  temporary and proposed Treasury regulations  all as in effect on the date hereof  and all of which are subject to change or differingS-11interpretations  possibly with retroactive effect  so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below.As used in this Prospectus Supplement  the term “United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Junior Subordinated Note that is for United States federal income tax purposes:• an individual citizen or resident of the United States;• a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States  any state thereof or the District of Columbia;• an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or• a trust (i) with respect to which a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (ii) that was in existence on August 20  1996  and has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a domestic trust.The term “Non-United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Junior Subordinated Note that is neither a United States Holder nor a partnership (or other pass-through entity).If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership) holds Junior Subordinated Notes  the tax treatment of the partnership and its partners will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership and its partners. If a holder of Junior Subordinated Notes is a partnership or a partner in such a partnership  such holder should consult with its own tax advisors regarding the United States federal income tax considerations of the purchase  ownership and disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes.Persons considering purchasing the Junior Subordinated Notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the United States federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase  ownership and disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes in light of their particular circumstances  as well as the effect of any state  local  foreign or other tax laws.The Company has treated and will continue to treat  and  by purchasing the Junior Subordinated Notes  each holder agrees to treat  the Junior Subordinated Notes as indebtedness for United States federal income tax purposes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Junior Subordinated Notes will be so treated.United States HoldersTreatment of the Junior Subordinated Notes and Interest ThereonFrom their issuance  the Company has treated the Junior Subordinated Notes as “variable rate debt instruments” that are subject to applicable United States Treasury regulations that apply to “reset bonds ” and stated interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes as taxable to a United States Holder as ordinary interest income at the time such interest is received or accrued  in accordance with such United States Holder’s regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.Upon the remarketing of the Junior Subordinated Notes  the Junior Subordinated Notes will no longer be linked to an agreement for the purchase of the Company’s common stock. Each of the remarketed Junior Subordinated Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate. The Series 2019A JSNs and the Series 2019B JSNs have fixed maturity dates of August 1  2024  and August 1  2027  respectively. There are no contingent interest payments or terms. Accordingly  the remarketed Junior Subordinated Notes will be treated as debt for United States federal income tax purposes and stated interest payments on the remarketed Junior Subordinated Notes generally will be taxable to a United States Holder as ordinary income at the time received or accrued  in accordance with the United States Holder’s regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.Pre-Acquisition Accrued InterestThe purchase price of the Junior Subordinated Notes sold in this remarketing will include an amount of interest attributable to interest accrued for the period prior to this remarketing. Under general United States federal income tax accounting principles  the portion of the first interest payment on the Junior Subordinated Notes equal to the amount of such pre-acquisition accrued interest should be treated as a return of such pre-acquisition accrued interest  rather than as an amount payable on the Junior SubordinatedS-12Notes. Accordingly  the portion of the first interest payment on the Junior Subordinated Notes equal to the pre-acquisition accrued interest should not be treated as taxable interest income and a holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Junior Subordinated Notes should be reduced by a corresponding amount. This discussion assumes that this treatment is correct  and references in this discussion to stated interest do not include such portion of the first interest payment equal to the pre-acquisition accrued interest. United States Holders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors concerning the particular tax treatment to them of any pre-acquisition accrued interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes.Bond PremiumIf the amount paid by a United States Holder for a Junior Subordinated Note pursuant to this offering (excluding any amount attributable to pre-acquisition accrued interest) is greater than its principal amount  such United States Holder will generally be considered to have purchased the Junior Subordinated Note with “bond premium” in the amount equal to such excess. A United States Holder generally may be able to elect to amortize this bond premium  using a constant-yield method  over the remaining term of the Junior Subordinated Note by offsetting the interest income on such Junior Subordinated Note allocable to an accrual period with the premium allocable to such accrual period. If a United States Holder makes such an election  such United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Junior Subordinated Note will be reduced by the amount of premium amortized. If a United States Holder does not elect to amortize the premium  the premium will decrease the gain or increase the loss such United States Holder would otherwise recognize on a disposition of such Junior Subordinated Note. An election to amortize bond premium applies to all taxable debt obligations owned or acquired by the United States Holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year for which the election is made and may be revoked only with the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). United States Holders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the effect of an election to amortize bond premium on their particular circumstances.Sale  Exchange  Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of the Junior Subordinated NotesA United States Holder generally will recognize gain or loss upon the sale  exchange  redemption or other taxable disposition of a Junior Subordinated Note equal to the difference  if any  between (a) the sum of the cash and the fair market value of any property received on such disposition (other than amounts properly attributable to accrued but unpaid interest  which amounts (excluding any amount attributable to pre-acquisition accrued interest) will be treated as interest income as described above under “—Treatment of the Junior Subordinated Notes and Interest Thereon”) and (b) such United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Junior Subordinated Note. A United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Junior Subordinated Note generally will be equal to the amount that such United States Holder paid for the Junior Subordinated Note (excluding any amount attributable to pre-acquisition accrued interest)  reduced by the amount of any bond premium previously amortized by such United States Holder with respect to the Junior Subordinated Note and any payments on the Junior Subordinated Note other than payments of qualified stated interest. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale  exchange  redemption or other taxable disposition of a Junior Subordinated Note generally will be capital gain or loss  and will be long-term capital gain or loss  if  at the time of such disposition  the United States Holder will have held the Junior Subordinated Note for a period of more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.Medicare TaxCertain United States Holders that are individuals  estates or trusts are subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax on all or a portion of their “net investment income ” which may include all or a portion of their interest income and net gains from the disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Each United States Holder that is an individual  estate or trust is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the applicability of this Medicare tax to its income and gains in respect of its investment in the Junior Subordinated Notes.Backup Withholding and Information ReportingInformation reporting requirements generally apply in connection with payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes to  and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes by  non-corporate United States Holders. A United States Holder will be subject to backup withholding on these payments if the United States Holder fails to provide its taxpayer identification number to the paying agent and fails to comply with certain certification procedures or otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding. Any backup withholding from a payment to a United States Holder will be allowed as a credit against such United States federal income tax liability  or may entitle such United States Holder to a refund  provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. United States Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of backup withholding in their particular situation  the availability of an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption  if available.S-13Non-United States HoldersPayments of InterestSubject to the discussions below under “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” and “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Withholding ” no withholding of United States federal income tax will apply to a payment of interest on a Junior Subordinated Note to a Non-United States Holder under the “Portfolio Interest Exemption ” provided that:• such payment is not effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States;• the Non-United States Holder does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of the Company’s stock entitled to vote;• the Non-United States Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related directly or constructively to the Company through stock ownership;• the Non-United States Holder is not a bank that acquired the Junior Subordinated Notes in consideration for an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business; and• the Non-United States Holder provides the withholding agent  in accordance with specified procedures  with a statement to the effect that such holder is not a United States person (generally by providing a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E).If a Non-United States Holder cannot satisfy the requirements of the “Portfolio Interest Exemption” described above  payments of interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes made to such Non-United States Holder will be subject to a 30% United States federal withholding tax  unless that holder provides the paying agent with a properly executed statement: (i) claiming an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty (generally on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E); or (ii) stating that the payment on the Junior Subordinated Notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected to that holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (generally on an IRS Form W-8ECI).If a Non-United States Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States (and  if an applicable United States income tax treaty applies  if the Non-United States Holder maintains a permanent establishment within the United States) and the interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and  if an applicable United States income tax treaty applies  attributable to that permanent establishment)  that Non-United States Holder will be subject to United States federal income tax on the interest on a net income basis in the same manner as if that Non-United States Holder were a United States Holder. In addition  if such Non-United States Holder is a foreign corporation  it may also  under certain circumstances  be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty.Sale  Exchange  Redemption or other Taxable Disposition of the Junior Subordinated NotesSubject to the discussions below under “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding ” any gain realized by a Non-United States Holder on the sale  exchange  redemption or other taxable disposition of a Junior Subordinated Note generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax unless:• such gain is effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and  if an applicable United States income tax treaty applies  is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-United States Holder within the United States); or• the Non-United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are met.Information Reporting And Backup WithholdingThe amount of interest paid on the Junior Subordinated Notes to Non-United States Holders generally must be reported annually to the IRS. These reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced or eliminated by any applicable income tax treaty. Copies of the information returns reflecting income in respect of the Junior Subordinated Notes mayS-14also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the Non-United States Holder is a resident under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or information sharing agreement.A Non-United States Holder will generally not be subject to additional information reporting or to backup withholding (currently at a 24% rate) with respect to payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes or to information reporting or backup withholding with respect to proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes to or through a United States office of any broker  as long as the Non-United States Holder:• has furnished to the payor or broker a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E certifying  under penalties of perjury  the Non-United States Holder’s status as a non-United States person;• has furnished to the payor or broker other documentation upon which it may rely to treat the payments as made to a non-United States person in accordance with applicable Treasury regulations; or• otherwise establishes an exemption.The payment of the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes to or through a foreign office of a broker will generally not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding. However  a sale or disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes will be subject to information reporting  but not backup withholding  if it is to or through a foreign office of a United States broker or a non-United States broker with certain enumerated connections with the United States unless the documentation requirements described above are met or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption.Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a Non-United States Holder will be allowed as a credit against such holder’s United States federal income tax liability  if any  or will otherwise be refundable  provided that the requisite procedures are followed and the proper information is filed with the IRS on a timely basis. Non-United States Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such exemption  if applicable.Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act WithholdingA withholding tax of 30% will apply to interest income paid on Junior Subordinated Notes held by a Non-United States Holder where the Non-United States Holder is (i) a foreign financial institution (as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary)  unless such institution enters into an agreement with the United States government to collect and provide to the United States tax authorities substantial information regarding United States account holders of such institution (which would include certain equity and debt holders of such institution  as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with United States owners)  or (ii) a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary)  unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the substantial United States owners of the entity  which generally includes any United States person who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain circumstances  a Non-United States Holder of Junior Subordinated Notes might be eligible for a refund or credit of such taxes  and a Non-United States Holder might be required to file a United States federal income tax return to claim such refund or credit. The Company will not pay any additional amounts to “gross up” payments to holders as a result of any withholding or deduction for such taxes. Non-United States Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these withholding requirements on their investment in the Junior Subordinated Notes.THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX DISCUSSION SET FORTH ABOVE IS INCLUDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE DEPENDING UPON A HOLDER’S PARTICULAR SITUATION. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE ACQUISITION  OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES  INCLUDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE  LOCAL  FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS.S-15REMARKETINGSubject to the terms and conditions of a remarketing agreement (the “Remarketing Agreement”) among the Company  Barclays Capital Inc.  Citigroup Global Markets Inc.  Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC  J.P. Morgan Securities LLC  Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Wells Fargo Securities  LLC  as the remarketing agents (the “Remarketing Agents”)  and U.S. Bank Trust Company  National Association  solely in its capacity as Purchase Contract Agent and as attorney-in-fact of the holders of Purchase Contracts  the Remarketing Agents have agreed to use their commercially reasonable efforts to remarket the Series 2019A RSNs and the Series 2019B RSNs at public offering prices that will result in aggregate proceeds sufficient to purchase the Treasury Portfolio  as required by the terms of the Corporate Units.The Remarketing Agents have no obligation to purchase any of the Junior Subordinated Notes. The Remarketing Agreement provides that the remarketing is subject to customary conditions precedent  including the delivery of legal opinions.The offering of the Junior Subordinated Notes by the Remarketing Agents is subject to the Remarketing Agents’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.In connection with the remarketing  the Remarketing Agents have reset the rate of interest payable on the Series 2019A JSNs to the reset rate of % per annum and have reset the rate of interest payable on the Series 2019B JSNs to the reset rate of % per annum  in each case  effective on and after May   2022  the expected delivery date for the Junior Subordinated Notes.The Junior Subordinated Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or on any automated deal er quotation system.The Remarketing Agents may make a market in the Junior Subordinated Notes after completion of the offering  but will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the Junior Subordinated Notes or that an active public market for the Junior Subordinated Notes will develop. If an active public trading market for the Junior Subordinated Notes does not develop  the market price and liquidity of the Junior Subordinated Notes may be adversely affected.The Company has agreed to indemnify the several Remarketing Agents against certain liabilities  including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933  as amended.The Company will pay a remarketing fee equal to % of the principal amount of the Series 2019A JSNs and % of the principal amount of the Series 2019B JSNs. The Company’s expenses associated with the offer and sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes (not including the remarketing fee) are estimated to be $ .In order to facilitate the offering of the Junior Subordinated Notes  the Remarketing Agents may engage in transactions that stabilize  maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Specifically  the Remarketing Agents may over-allot in connection with this remarketing  creating short positions in the Junior Subordinated Notes for their own accounts. In addition  to cover over-allotments or to stabilize the price of the Junior Subordinated Notes  the Remarketing Agents may bid for  and purchase  Junior Subordinated Notes in the open market. Finally  the Remarketing Agents may reclaim selling concessions allowed to the Remarketing Agents or dealers for distributing Junior Subordinated Notes in this remarketing  if the Remarketing Agents repurchase previously distributed Junior Subordinated Notes in transactions to cover short positions  in stabilization transactions or otherwise. Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the Junior Subordinated Notes above independent market levels. The Remarketing Agents are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time without notice.In general  purchases of a security for the purpose of stabilization or to reduce a short position could cause the price of the security to be higher than it might be in the absence of such purchases. The imposition of a penalty bid might also have an effect on the price of a security to the extent that it were to discourage resales of the security.Neither the Company nor any Remarketing Agent makes any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Junior Subordinated Notes. In addition  neither the Company nor any Remarketing Agent makes any representation that the Remarketing Agents will engage in such transactions or that such transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice.It is expected that delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes will be made  against payment for the Junior Subordinated Notes  on or about May   2022  which will be the business day following the pricing of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Under Rule 15c6-1 under the 1934 Act  purchases or sales of securities in the secondary market generally are required to settle within two business days (T+2)  unless the parties to any such transactions expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers of the Junior Subordinated Notes who wish to trade the Junior Subordinated Notes on the date of this Prospectus Supplement or theS-16next succeeding business day(s) will be required  because the Junior Subordinated Notes will settle within business days (T+ )  to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Junior Subordinated Notes who wish to trade on the date of this Prospectus Supplement or the next succeeding business day(s) should consult their own legal advisors.In the ordinary course of business  the Remarketing Agents and their respective affiliates have from time to time performed and may in the future perform various financial advisory  commercial banking  investment banking  sales and trading  investment research  principal investment  hedging  market making  asset leasing treasury services and other financial and non-financial activities and services for the Company and its affiliates  for which they received  or will continue to receive  customary fees or compensation.In addition  in the ordinary course of their business activities  the Remarketing Agents and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)  loans  commodities  currencies  credit default swaps and other financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Company or its affiliates. Certain of the Remarketing Agents or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Company routinely hedge  and certain other of the Remarketing Agents or their affiliates may hedge  their credit exposure to the Company consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically  such Remarketing Agents and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in the Company’s securities  including potentially the Junior Subordinated Notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Junior Subordinated Notes. The Remarketing Agents and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold  or recommend to clients that they acquire  long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.Selling RestrictionsCanadaEach Remarketing Agent has represented and agreed that the Junior Subordinated Notes may be sold in Canada only to purchasers purchasing  or deemed to be purchasing  as principal that are accredited investors  as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario)  and are permitted clients  as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements  Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. Any resale of the Junior Subordinated Notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from  or in a transaction not subject to  the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws.Securities legislation in certain provinces or territories of Canada may provide a purchaser with remedies for rescission or damages if this Prospectus Supplement or the accompanying Prospectus (including any amendment thereto) contains a misrepresentation  provided that the remedies for rescission or damages are exercised by the purchaser within the time limit prescribed by the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory. The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (“NI 33-105”)  the Remarketing Agents are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.European Economic AreaThe Junior Subordinated Notes are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). For these purposes  a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended  “MiFID II”); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 as amended where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (as amended  the “Prospectus Regulation”). Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended  the “PRIIPs Regulation”) for offering or selling the Junior Subordinated Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Junior Subordinated Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA  may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.This Prospectus Supplement and the accompanying Prospectus have been prepared on the basis that any offer of the Junior Subordinated Notes in any member state of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the Prospectus Regulation fromS-17the requirement to publish a prospectus for offers of the Junior Subordinated Notes. This Prospectus Supplement and the accompanying Prospectus are not a prospectus for the purposes of the Prospectus Regulation.Hong KongEach Remarketing Agent has represented and agreed that the Junior Subordinated Notes have not been and may not be offered or sold by means of any document other than (i) in circumstances which do not constitute an offer to the public within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32  Laws of Hong Kong)  (ii) to “professional investors” within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571  Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder or (iii) in other circumstances which do not result in the document being a “prospectus” within the meaning of the Companies Ordinance (Cap. 32  Laws of Hong Kong)  and no advertisement  invitation or document relating to the Junior Subordinated Notes may be issued or may be in the possession of any person for the purpose of issue (in each case whether in Hong Kong or elsewhere)  which is directed at  or the contents of which are likely to be accessed or read by  the public in Hong Kong (except if permitted to do so under the laws of Hong Kong) other than with respect to Junior Subordinated Notes which are or are intended to be disposed of only to persons outside Hong Kong or only to “professional investors” within the meaning of the Securities and Futures Ordinance (Cap. 571  Laws of Hong Kong) and any rules made thereunder.JapanThe Junior Subordinated Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law of Japan (the “Financial Instruments and Exchange Law”) and each Remarketing Agent has represented and agreed that it will not offer or sell any Junior Subordinated Notes  directly or indirectly  in Japan or to  or for the benefit of  any resident of Japan (which term as used in this paragraph means any person resident in Japan  including any corporation or other entity organized under the laws of Japan)  or to others for re-offering or resale  directly or indirectly  in Japan or to a resident of Japan  except pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of  and otherwise in compliance with  the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law and any other applicable laws  regulations and ministerial guidelines of Japan.KoreaThe Junior Subordinated Notes have not been and will not be registered with the Financial Services Commission of Korea under the Financial Investment Services and Capital Markets Act of Korea.

4271,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.risk.net/commodities/7946921/trade-finance-house-of-the-year-tramontana-asset-management,Trade finance house of the year: Tramontana Asset Management,1 day ago,In the increasingly volatile market conditions of 2021  Tramontana Asset Management developed and deployed trade finance solutions to satisfy corporate demand for financing. These solutions have simultaneously provided a growing number of institutional investors with the opportunity to participate in the energy transition. For its innovative work in making the carbon markets accessible to mainstream investors and providing corporates with better access to financing  Tramontana has won Energy Risk’s 2022 Trade finance house of the year award.As a specialist investment company  Tramontana develops hedging and financing solutions for corporate clients  partnering with large institutional investors to fund these transactions. The team of eight people has built up more than $5 billion in assets under management since its 2014 launch  focusing on the energy transition and carbon-backed financing.Managing directors and co-founders of Tramontana  Paul Jackman and Bharath Manium  believe a successful transition to a low-carbon economy requires the full support of global capital markets. The company took a large step towards that goal last year when it completed a significant financing transaction that served both a corporate hedger and a large financial institution looking for exposure to the energy transition space.Tramontana works with corporate clients to help implement effective hedging strategies that are unconstrained by the liquidity limitations of futures markets based on the European Union’s Emissions Trading Scheme. This particular solution was developed to minimise hedging slippage and reduce the balance sheet burden of managing the margining requirements of on-exchange hedge positions.“Our solution involves issuing secured ring-fenced notes  purchased by our financing partners  and acquiring carbon from the market  says Jackman. “The carbon certificates are held in a registry account for the duration of the note – this could be a three-  five- or seven-year note  depending on the transaction. The corporate client then buys the carbon certificates at the end of that tenor.”The solution  which Jackman describes as “a scalable  multi-issuance programme”  repackages energy transition-related assets as standard notes so they can be held in clearing systems such as Euroclear and Clearstream. Physical energy assets cannot be held in clearing systems  an issue that has traditionally left many institutional investors reluctant to participate in this growing market. This solution solves the accounting  regulatory and management challenges of holding such assets.Furthermore  to provide investors such as pension funds and insurers with pure-play investments in this space  Tramontana mitigates non-carbon-specific risks such as credit risk via hedging and various collateralisation solutions.As a result  Tramontana has been able to build a deeper and wider liquidity pool to fund such transactions by attracting wider investor interest  such as the specialist UK pension firm it worked with for the first time last year. According to Manium and Jackman  the growth in investor interest has seen Tramontana’s typical transaction size increase by more than 40% year on year.“Our financing partners are sophisticated institutions who are familiar with structured finance and comfortable with the associated documentation and operational complexity ” explains Manium. “The key objective in our attempt to widen market participation in our products  was to make them more accessible to insurance and pension fund investors  who have traditionally been less active in structured finance linked to the energy transition.”Although interest in green investments has undoubtedly grown in recent years  Tramontana’s trade finance solution aims to enable greater access to the market  boosting opportunities for corporate hedgers.“The energy transition is a topic everyone is discussing. Many companies are putting targets in place for investing in environmental  social and governance strategies  and so investments like these are integral to that kind of strategy ” says Manium. “But I think the situation we currently find ourselves in is that there is a lot of demand from investors but not enough assets.”Jackman adds: “Tramontana’s carbon-backed securities programme enables non-specialist investors to access energy transition markets and has opened the door to a significantly deeper pool of investor capital to be deployed in the energy transition space.”The investment firm has clearly achieved its aim of boosting access to carbon markets for the wider capital markets  in turn significantly increasing its corporate clients’ access to capital for trade finance and risk management activities.,neutral,0.11,0.86,0.03,negative,0.01,0.05,0.94,True,English,"['Trade finance house', 'Tramontana Asset Management', 'year', 'specialist UK pension firm', 'Emissions Trading Scheme', 'balance sheet burden', 'exchange hedge positions', 'scalable, multi-issuance programme', 'large financial institution', 'secured ring-fenced notes', 'carbon-backed securities programme', 'typical transaction size', '2022 Trade finance house', 'various collateralisation solutions', 'pension fund investors', 'specialist investment company', 'wider liquidity pool', 'volatile market conditions', 'global capital markets', 'wider capital markets', 'risk management activities', 'trade finance solutions', 'energy transition-related assets', 'Physical energy assets', 'large institutional investors', 'energy transition markets', 'wider investor interest', 'many institutional investors', 'effective hedging strategies', 'energy transition space', 'significant financing transaction', 'Tramontana Asset Management', 'corporate clients’ access', 'investment firm', 'pension funds', 'Energy Risk', 'large step', 'investor capital', 'liquidity limitations', 'futures markets', 'standard notes', 'structured finance', 'Many companies', 'governance strategies', 'successful transition', 'carbon-backed financing', 'credit risk', 'carbon markets', 'management challenges', 'corporate hedger', 'mainstream investors', 'non-specialist investors', 'financing solutions', 'growing number', 'innovative work', 'eight people', 'Managing directors', 'low-carbon economy', 'full support', 'European Union', 'margining requirements', 'registry account', 'clearing systems', 'accounting, regulatory', 'carbon-specific risks', 'first time', 'sophisticated institutions', 'associated documentation', 'operational complexity', 'key objective', 'recent years', 'enough assets', 'deeper pool', 'financing partners', 'carbon certificates', 'growing market', 'market participation', 'hedging slippage', 'greater access', 'pure-play investments', 'green investments', 'corporate demand', 'particular solution', 'seven-year note', 'year award', 'Bharath Manium', 'Paul Jackman', 'opportunity', 'corporates', 'transactions', 'team', '2014 launch', 'founders', 'goal', 'exposure', 'duration', 'end', 'tenor', 'Euroclear', 'Clearstream', 'issue', 'insurers', 'result', 'growth', 'attempt', 'products', 'insurance', 'opportunities', 'topic', 'everyone', 'targets', 'place', 'social', 'kind', 'strategy', 'situation', 'lot', 'door', 'aim', 'turn']",2022-05-05,2022-05-06,risk.net

In the first three months of 2022  SAF-HOLLAND SE's Group sales of EUR 369.7 million were 29.4% higher than the previous year's figure of EUR 285.6 million due to demand.High steel prices as well as high freight and energy costs  which are passed on with a time lag  had a strong impact on the cost of sales ratio  primarily in Europe  while the administrative and research and development cost ratios declined significantly. In total  this led to an adjusted EBIT of EUR 23.5 million (previous year EUR 22.0 million). This corresponds to an adjusted EBIT margin of 6.4 % (previous year 7.7 %).Based on the figures for the first quarter of 2022  the Management Board of SAF HOLLAND SE has today decided to raise the forecast for Group sales for the 2022 financial year and to specify the forecast for the adjusted EBIT margin.Based on the expected macroeconomic and industry-specific framework conditions and weighing up the potential risks and opportunities  the Management Board now expects Group sales for the 2022 financial year to be in a range of EUR 1.2 billion to EUR 1.35 billion (previously EUR 1.15 billion to EUR 1.3 billion).Based on this assumption  SAF HOLLAND also expects an adjusted EBIT margin of 6.5% to 7.0% for the 2022 financial year (previously: significantly below the previous year).In order to support the strategic goals  the company continues to plan investments in the range of 2% to 2.5% for the 2022 financial year. The investments will focus on the continuation of the capacity expansions already started in Turkey and Mexico as well as a capacity expansion in India. Furthermore  the company plans to invest in efficiency-enhancing measures  especially in Germany and the USA.The publication of the quarterly statement for the first quarter of 2022 is still scheduled for May 10  2022.Additional Information:ISIN: DE000SAFH001WKN: SAFH00Deutsche Boerse: SFQTrading: Amtlicher Markt (Prime Standard)  Frankfurter WertpapierboerseContactPetra MüllerHead of Investor Relations  Corporate und ESG CommunicationsTel: +49 (0) 6095 301 918ir@safholland.deAbout SAF-HOLLAND SAF-HOLLAND SE is a leading international manufacturer of chassis-related assemblies and components for trailers  trucks and buses.

This detailed assessment measures the maturity of policies as well as the actions undertaken based on 21 criteria grouped into four main themes: Environment  Labour and Human Rights  Ethics and Sustainable Procurement. This year’s Gold Medal awarded to JCDecaux puts it in the Top 3% of the best performing companies assessed by EcoVadis. Indeed  the company is just two percentage points away from the Platinum Medal  the highest distinction awarded by EcoVadis. JCDecaux is now among the Top 1% of companies assessed by EcoVadis in the ‘Advertising and Market Research’ category  having obtained a score greater than or equal to 71/100.JCDecaux SA announced it has successfully placed on January 31st 8-year notes for a principal amount of €500 million  maturing on February 7th 2030. The spread has been fixed at 135 basis points above the swap rate leading to a coupon of 1 625%. Subscribed more than 3 times  this note has been placed with investors of high quality. The success of this new issuance highlights both the quality of JCDecaux’s signature and the investor’s confidence in the rebound capacity and in the growth potential of the Group.FIRST QUARTER 20 2 2 AND OUTLOOKCommenting on the 2022 first quarter revenue  Jean-François Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said:“Our Q1 2022 Group revenue grew by +50.3%  +45.7% on an organic basis  to reach €683 million  a strong start of the year above our expectations  driven by a very strong digital revenue growth and a solid trading momentum despite local mobility restrictions in China  including partial to full lockdowns in several provinces and the outbreak of the war in Ukraine. This demonstrates once again the rebound capacity and the growth potential of JCDecaux.Story continuesDigital Out-Of-Home (DOOH) grew very strongly  doubling year-on-year  at +103.1% in reported growth and +95.2% organically in Q1 2022  to reach 29.1% of Group revenue vs 21.5% in Q1 2021. We continued to accelerate our digital transformation and maintained our focus on the roll-out of digital screens and on the development of our automated data-driven planning and trading solutions. Programmatic advertising continued to gain good momentum via the VIOOH platform now trading in 15 countries including its launch in US airports in February. VIOOH is the most connected programmatic trading platform of the OOH industry with 36 DSPs (Demand Side Platforms) connected.By activity  Street Furniture was strong at +52.6% organically in Q1 2022 and was above Q1 2019 levels in Europe (including France and UK) and in North America; Billboard grew significantly as well at +25.6% on an organic basis in Q1 2022  above 2019 in Asia-Pacific and North-America; Transport grew strongly at +46.1% but remained meaningfully impacted by ongoing restrictions on global international air passenger traffic and by lower commuter traffic in public transport than pre-pandemic.All geographies grew strongly in Q1 2022. Europe (including France and UK)  North America and Rest of the World were the main growth drivers  while Asia-Pacific grew at a lower pace due to its Transport exposure and to local mobility restrictions in China.As far as Q2 2022 is concerned  we continue to have a solid trading momentum but given increased mobility restrictions in China since the beginning of the quarter including extended lockdowns in several provinces  we expect an organic revenue growth of above +15%.As the most digitised global OOH company with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet and the high quality of our teams across the world  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to support the economic recovery as well as to drive positive changes.”Following the adoption of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014  the operating data presented below is adjusted to include our prorata share in companies under joint control.

The launch  combined with becoming a sponsor of the Celiac Disease Foundation  puts empowerDX in a unique position to help a large population of Americans in debilitating physical and mental pain without clear answers. The Celiac Disease Foundation leads the fight to increase the rate of diagnosis  improve treatments  and find a cure.Celiac disease is a genetic autoimmune condition where the body’s immune system attacks the small intestine when gluten is consumed. More than 99% of people who develop celiac disease carry one of the genetic variants identified in our test. Symptoms can range from abdominal issues and joint pain to brain fog  depressed mood  and concentration issues. If left untreated  celiac disease can lead to serious health complications including heart disease  intestinal cancers  and fertility issues.An estimated three million Americans have celiac disease. With increased risk awareness and accessible testing  more of these individuals can be properly diagnosed. Currently  60-70% of individuals with celiac disease are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. On average  it takes 6-10 years for a symptomatic individual to be diagnosed with celiac disease. Celiac disease can present with a spectrum of gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms which can make early diagnosis challenging. Knowledge of disease risk facilitates the path to proper diagnosis for physicians and healthcare providers. The empowerDX Celiac Risk Gene Test provides access to high quality HLA genetic testing  which requires specialized equipment and rare expertise  at a remarkable value.Unlike most blood-based celiac disease genetic tests  the empowerDX assay uses a sample taken from two non-invasive mouth swabs to analyze HLA markers. Results for each marker are provided to individuals through a secure online portal ten business days after sample-receipt at the company’s CLIA-certified lab. The test is $199 and available for ages 3+.Susceptibility to celiac disease is strongly associated with the HLA alleles DQA1*05:02 and DQB1*02:01  but these markers alone do not necessarily mean people have or will develop the disease. Individuals with the presence of genetic markers should consult with their physician on how to monitor for celiac disease and improve their overall gut health. Testing negative for all three markers means the lifetime risk of developing celiac disease is less than one percent.The revolutionary at-home Celiac Risk Gene Test is characteristic of the ethos defining the mission of empowerDX. Celiac disease affects the lives of millions of people in the US  and this test bridges to the gap between demand and access to a test critical to lifetime risk assessment. Eurofins Donor & Product Testing  Inc. performs the molecular testing and carries extensive experience to test and interpret HLA results.Boston-area based  empowerDX  now has a robust portfolio of more than 20 products  including the first at-home PFAS test as well as MTHFR  CoQ10  vitamin D  APOE  and one of the most sensitive at-home COVID PCR tests on the market. The start-up strives to make testing for a wide range of issues  including heart  sexual and mental health  thyroid  and vitamin-deficiencies  affordable and accessible to the consumer.For more information on the empowerDX Celiac Risk Gene Test  please visit empowerDXlab.com.ABOUT EMPOWERDXLaunched in 2019 empowerDX is the online shop for easy at-home health testing. empowerDX specializes in FDA-authorized COVID-19 testing  women’s health  men’s health  sexual health  and general wellness testing.

ADVANCE met its primary endpoint demonstrating that a higher proportion of chronic ITP patients receiving VYVGART achieved a sustained platelet count response compared to placebo. ADVANCE is the first Phase 3 clinical trial of a neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in ITP.“Immune thrombocytopenia is a rare  debilitating autoimmune disease that can be very difficult to treat  especially in patients who have an insufficient response to previous ITP therapies. There is no clear standard of care and many patients continue to experience significant symptoms and decreased quality of life ” said Catherine Broome  M.D.  Associate Professor of Medicine at Georgetown University Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center  and Principal Investigator in the ADVANCE study. “These data are very promising as they show that platelet counts can rapidly improve to clinically meaningful levels following VYVGART treatment in a proportion of a heavily pretreated patient population. We are excited that targeting pathogenic IgG autoantibodies could represent a new  potential approach to help alleviate the disease burden in this patient community.”Story continuesThe ADVANCE trial enrolled 131 adult patients with chronic and persistent ITP. Patients were heavily pretreated and 67% of patients had received three or more prior ITP therapies  including 59% who had prior thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RAs) experience  34% with prior rituximab experience and 37% with a history of splenectomy. Patients were insufficiently controlled at baseline with mean platelet counts of 17x109/L across all patients. Of patients who completed the full ADVANCE study  94% (63/67) of VYVGART-treated patients and 97% (38/39) of placebo patients continued to the ADVANCE+ open-label extension study.Highlights of Phase 3 ADVANCE DataPrimary endpoint metADVANCE met its primary endpoint demonstrating a significantly higher proportion of patients with chronic ITP receiving VYVGART (17/78; 21.8%) compared to placebo (2/40; 5%) achieved a sustained platelet response (p=0.0316)  defined as having platelet counts greater than or equal to 50x109/L on at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24 of treatment.Primary endpoint responders were observed across patient types regardless of age  disease severity  time since diagnosis  prior ITP treatment or background medication.Key platelet-derived secondary endpoints demonstrated statistical significanceKey platelet-derived secondary endpoints showed VYVGART-treated patients had a statistically significant benefit compared to placebo on (1) cumulative number of weeks where platelet counts were at least 50x109/L in the chronic ITP population (p=0.0009) and (2) sustained platelet response in the overall population  including both chronic and persistent ITP patients (p=0.0108). Numerically fewer WHO-classified bleeding events occurred in treated patients throughout the trial but the difference from placebo was not statistically significant. A higher proportion of treated patients in the overall population achieved a durable  sustained platelet response compared to placebo  defined as a sustained platelet response on at least six of the last eight scheduled visits between weeks 17 and 24 of treatment (p=0.0265)  but was not considered statistically significant based on hierarchical testing.Additional secondary endpoints provided clinically meaningful data on platelet count responses throughout 24-week trialAdditional secondary endpoint data from the ADVANCE trial are consistent with primary and secondary platelet-derived endpoints and provide additional context on metrics that often drive treatment decisions.International Working Group (IWG) responder status : 51.2% of VYVGART-treated patients were classified as IWG responders and 27.9% as complete responders compared to 20% of placebo patients as IWG responders and 4.4% as complete responders. IWG responders are defined as having a platelet count of at least 30x10 9 /L  a two-fold increase in platelet count from baseline  and the absence of bleeding for two separate  consecutive weekly visits. Complete responders are patients with platelet counts of 100x10 9 /L and the absence of bleeding for two separate  consecutive weekly visits.Mean platelet count change from baseline : VYVGART-treated patients demonstrated a rapid onset of platelet count improvement with statistically significant separation from placebo observed at week one and maintained through 20 out of 24 weeks of the trial.Switch to biweekly dosing: Ten VYVGART-treated patients switched to a biweekly (every two weeks) dosing schedule after achieving platelet counts of 100x109/L for three out of four consecutive visits  compared to one placebo patient. Nine of the ten treated patients achieved a sustained platelet response.Consistent safety and tolerability profileADVANCE is the second registrational trial of VYVGART and the first to evaluate chronic weekly dosing. VYVGART was well-tolerated in this 24-week study and the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous clinical trials.“In listening to and learning from people in the ITP community  we understand the impact of living with this disease can extend beyond physical signs  taking a serious toll on a person’s quality of life. These compelling preliminary data emphasize the potential for VYVGART to drive responses in ITP regardless of prior lines of therapy  history of splenectomy or time from diagnosis. We look forward to learning more about the potential approach of targeting pathogenic IgGs in ITP through our ADVANCE-SC trial  which is on track to read out in the first quarter of next year ” said Luc Truyen  MD  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at argenx. “The totality of data generated thus far continue to support the key attributes of VYVGART  including its onset of action and safety profile. These data further reinforce our confidence in FcRn blockade as a precision tool with the potential to reach a broad spectrum of IgG-mediated severe autoimmune diseases.”The Phase 3 ADVANCE trial is the first of two registrational trials being conducted as part of the ongoing ITP development program. ADVANCE-SC is evaluating subcutaneous efgartigimod for the treatment of primary ITP. Topline data from the ADVANCE-SC study are expected in the first quarter of 2023.Phase 3 ADVANCE Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADVANCE trial was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicenter  global trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of VYVGART in adult patients with chronic or persistent primary ITP. ​A total of 131 adult patients with primary ITP in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial and received VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Enrolled patients had a confirmed ITP diagnosis and a mean entry platelet count of less than 30x109/L. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one ITP treatment prior to randomization and had received at least one prior therapy. Concomitant medications permitted included corticosteroids  nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  fostamatinib or TPO-RAs. If patients were on 'watch and wait' at baseline  they had to have received at least 2 prior treatments for ITP. ​Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Randomized patients received weekly infusions from weeks 1-4 and were eligible to adjust frequency to bi-weekly depending on platelet count. Administration frequency was fixed from study visits 16-24. ​The primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of patients with chronic ITP with a sustained platelet count response defined as achieving platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50x109/L for at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24. Patients who received rescue therapy at week 12 or later  or for whom dose and/or frequency of concurrent ITP therapies increased at week 12 or later  were considered non-responders. ​Key secondary endpoints included extent of disease control over 24-week treatment period  proportion of overall population with sustained platelet count response  incidence and severity of WHO-classified bleeding events and an extended primary endpoint analysis between weeks 17 and 24.About Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies destroy platelets and reduce platelet production  which can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. In severe cases  frequent bleeding events can cause anemia or even brain hemorrhage in rare cases. ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health  including anxiety  fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so there remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options.About VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is being studied in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and other IgG autoantibody-mediated diseases.Important Safety Information for VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) intravenous (IV) formulation (U.S. prescribing information) for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.What is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)?VYVGART is a prescription medicine used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).What is the most important information I should know about VYVGART?VYVGART may cause serious side effects  including:Infection. VYVGART may increase the risk of infection. In a clinical study  the most common infections were urinary tract and respiratory tract infections. More patients on VYVGART vs placebo had below normal levels for white blood cell counts  lymphocyte counts  and neutrophil counts. The majority of infections and blood side effects were mild to moderate in severity. Your health care provider should check you for infections before starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with VYVGART. Tell your health care provider if you have any history of infections. Tell your health care provider right away if you have signs or symptoms of an infection during treatment with VYVGART such as fever  chills  frequent and/or painful urination  cough  pain and blockage of nasal passages/sinus  wheezing  shortness of breath  fatigue  sore throat  excess phlegm  nasal discharge  back pain  and/or chest pain.Undesirable immune reactions (hypersensitivity reactions). VYVGART can cause the immune system to have undesirable reactions such as rashes  swelling under the skin  and shortness of breath. In clinical studies  the reactions were mild or moderate and occurred within 1 hour to 3 weeks of administration  and the reactions did not lead to VYVGART discontinuation. Your health care provider should monitor you during and after treatment and discontinue VYVGART if needed. Tell your health care provider immediately about any undesirable reactions.Before taking VYVGART  tell your health care provider about all of your medical conditions  including if you:Have a history of infection or you think you have an infection.Have received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine (immunization). Discuss with your health care provider whether you need to receive age-appropriate immunizations before initiation of a new treatment cycle with VYVGART. The use of vaccines during VYVGART treatment has not been studied  and the safety with live or live-attenuated vaccines is unknown. Administration of live or live-attenuated vaccines is not recommended during treatment with VYVGART.Are pregnant or plan to become pregnant and are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed.Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take  including prescription and over-the-counter medicines  vitamins  and herbal supplements.What are the common side effects of VYVGART?The most common side effects of VYVGART are respiratory tract infection  headache  and urinary tract infection.These are not all the possible side effects of VYVGART. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the US Food and Drug Administration at 1-800-FDA-1088.Please see the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART and talk to your doctor.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

May 05  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ: ZLAB; HKEX: 9688) today announced that the company’s partner argenx (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX) reported positive data from the Phase 3 ADVANCE trial of VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab).In adults with primary ITP  ADVANCE met its primary endpoint demonstrating that a higher proportion of chronic ITP patients receiving VYVGART achieved a sustained platelet count response compared to placebo. ADVANCE is the first Phase 3 clinical trial of a neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in ITP.The ADVANCE trial enrolled 131 adult patients with chronic and persistent ITP. Patients were heavily pretreated and 67% of patients had received three or more prior ITP therapies  including 59% who had prior thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RAs) experience  34% with prior rituximab experience and 37% with a history of splenectomy. Patients were insufficiently controlled at baseline with mean platelet counts of 17x109/L across all patients. Of patients who completed the full ADVANCE study  94% (63/67) of VYVGART-treated patients and 97% (38/39) of placebo patients continued to the ADVANCE+ open-label extension study.Highlights of Phase 3 ADVANCE DataPrimary endpoint metADVANCE met its primary endpoint demonstrating a significantly higher proportion of patients with chronic ITP receiving VYVGART (17/78; 21.8%) compared to placebo (2/40; 5%) achieved a sustained platelet response (p=0.0316)  defined as having platelet counts greater than or equal to 50x109/L on at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24 of treatment.Story continuesPrimary endpoint responders were observed across patient types regardless of age  disease severity  time since diagnosis  prior ITP treatment or background medication.Key platelet-derived secondary endpoints demonstrated statistical significanceKey platelet-derived secondary endpoints showed VYVGART-treated patients had a statistically significant benefit compared to placebo on (1) cumulative number of weeks where platelet counts were at least 50x109/L in the chronic ITP population (p=0.0009) and (2) sustained platelet response in the overall population  including both chronic and persistent ITP patients (p=0.0108). Numerically fewer WHO-classified bleeding events occurred in treated patients throughout the trial but the difference from placebo was not statistically significant. A higher proportion of treated patients in the overall population achieved a durable  sustained platelet response compared to placebo  defined as a sustained platelet response on at least six of the last eight scheduled visits between weeks 17 and 24 of treatment (p=0.0265)  but was not considered statistically significant based on hierarchical testing.Additional secondary endpoints provided clinically meaningful data on platelet count responses throughout 24-week trialAdditional secondary endpoint data from the ADVANCE trial are consistent with primary and secondary platelet-derived endpoints and provide additional context on metrics that often drive treatment decisions.International Working Group (IWG) responder status : 51.2% of VYVGART-treated patients were classified as IWG responders and 27.9% as complete responders compared to 20% of placebo patients as IWG responders and 4.4% as complete responders. IWG responders are defined as having a platelet count of at least 30x109/L  a two-fold increase in platelet count from baseline  and the absence of bleeding for two separate  consecutive weekly visits. Complete responders are patients with platelet counts of 100x109/L and the absence of bleeding for two separate  consecutive weekly visits.Mean platelet count change from baseline : VYVGART-treated patients demonstrated a rapid onset of platelet count improvement with statistically significant separation from placebo observed at week one and maintained through 20 out of 24 weeks of the trial.Switch to biweekly dosing: Ten VYVGART-treated patients switched to a biweekly (every two weeks) dosing schedule after achieving platelet counts of 100x109/L for three out of four consecutive visits  compared to one placebo patient. Nine of the ten treated patients achieved a sustained platelet response.Consistent safety and tolerability profileADVANCE is the second registrational trial of VYVGART and the first to evaluate chronic weekly dosing. VYVGART was well-tolerated in this 24-week study and the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous clinical trials.The Phase 3 ADVANCE trial is the first of two registrational trials being conducted as part of the ongoing ITP development program. ADVANCE-SC is evaluating subcutaneous efgartigimod for the treatment of primary ITP.In November 2021  Zai Lab announced that the first patient with primary ITP was treated with efgartigimod in Greater China (mainland China  Hong Kong  Macau  and Taiwan) as part of the global registrational ADVANCE-SC Phase 3 study.Topline data from the ADVANCE-SC study are expected in the first quarter of 2023.Phase 3 ADVANCE Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADVANCE trial was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicenter  global trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of VYVGART in adult patients with chronic or persistent primary ITP. ​A total of 131 adult patients with primary ITP in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial and received VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Enrolled patients had a confirmed ITP diagnosis and a mean entry platelet count of less than 30x109/L. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one ITP treatment prior to randomization and had received at least one prior therapy. Concomitant medications permitted included corticosteroids  nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  fostamatinib or TPO-RAs. If patients were on 'watch and wait' at baseline  they had to have received at least 2 prior treatments for ITP. ​Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Randomized patients received weekly infusions from weeks 1-4 and were eligible to adjust frequency to bi-weekly depending on platelet count. Administration frequency was fixed from study visits 16-24. ​The primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of patients with chronic ITP with a sustained platelet count response defined as achieving platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50x109/L for at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24. Patients who received rescue therapy at week 12 or later  or for whom dose and/or frequency of concurrent ITP therapies increased at week 12 or later  were considered non-responders. ​Key secondary endpoints included extent of disease control over 24-week treatment period  proportion of overall population with sustained platelet count response  incidence and severity of WHO-classified bleeding events and an extended primary endpoint analysis between weeks 17 and 24.About Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies destroy platelets and reduce platelet production  which can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising.

ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health  including anxiety  fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so there remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options.About ITP in ChinaThe prevalence of ITP in Greater China is estimated at 120 000 patients. Current first-line treatments are corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). However  there are concerns about side effects of corticosteroids  and there is limited access to IVIg therapy. Second-line treatment options are primarily thrombopoietic agents  rituximab  and splenectomy. Despite availability of these treatments with differing mechanisms of action  many patients develop resistance to treatment and are prone to relapse. There remains a significant need for new treatment options.About VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies.

No product sales were recognized during the comparable prior period.Collaboration revenue for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $2.2 million  compared to $158.2 million for three months ended March 31  2021  resulting in a decrease of $155.9 million. The collaboration revenue for the three months ended March 31  2021 was primarily attributable to the closing of the strategic collaboration for efgartigimod with Zai Lab  resulting in the recognition of $151.9 million in collaboration revenue.Other operating income for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $8.1 million  compared to $20.4 million for three months ended March 31  2021  resulting in a decrease of $12.3 million. During the three months ended March 31  2021  the fair value of the argenx profit share in AgomAb Therapeutics NV increased by $11.2 million. There was no change in the fair value during the three months ended March 31  2022.Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $254.2 million  compared to $178.6 million for the three months ended March 31  2021  and consists of:Cost of sales for the three months ended March 31  2022 amounted to $1.4 million. The cost of sales was recognized with respect to the sale of VYVGART in the U.S. during the first quarter of 2022. There was no cost of sales recognized in the comparable prior period.Research and development expenses increased by $29.6 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 to $152.0 million  compared to $122.3 million for the three months ended March 31  2021. The increase resulted primarily from higher external research and development expenses  mainly related to the efgartigimod program in various indications and other clinical and preclinical programs.Selling  general and administrative expenses totaled $100.9 million for the three months ended March 31  2022  compared to $56.3 million for the three months ended March 31  2021. The increase resulted primarily from higher professional and marketing fees linked to the commercialization of VYVGART in the U.S. and Japan and higher personnel expenses increased due to a planned increase in headcount.Exchange losses totaled $7.2 million for the three months ended March 31  2022  compared to $28.9 million for the three months ended March 31  2021 and are mainly attributable to unrealized exchange rate losses on cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets position in Euro.Income tax totaled $2.9 million of tax income for the three months ended March 31  2022  compared to $11.2 million of tax expense for the comparable prior period. Tax income for the three months ended March 31  2022 consists of $5.0 million of income tax expense and $7.9 million of deferred tax income  compared to $6.2 million of income tax expense and $5 million of deferred tax expense for the comparable prior period.Net loss for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $227.2 million compared to $40.4 million for the comparable prior year period. On a per weighted average share basis  the net loss was $4.36 and $0.81 for the three months ended March 31  2022 and 2021  respectively.Cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets totaled $2 855.4 million as of March 31  2022  compared to $2 336.7 million as of December 31  2021. The increase in cash and cash equivalents and current financial assets resulted primarily from the closing of a global offering of shares  including a U.S. offering and a European private placement  which resulted in the receipt of $761.0 million in net proceeds in March 2022  partially offset by the net cash flows used in operating activities  primarily towards the commercial launch of VYVGART in the U.S. and Japan and continued investment in pipeline expansion.FINANCIAL GUIDANCEAs of March 31  2022  argenx had $2.9 billion in cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets. Based on current plans to fund anticipated operating expenses and capital expenditures  argenx expects to utilize approximately $1 billion of its available cash in 2022. The increased spend will support the global VYVGART launches  clinical development of efgartigimod in 10 indications and ARGX-117 in two indications  investment in the global supply chain  and continued focus on pipeline expansion through the Immunology Innovation Program.EXPECTED 2022 FINANCIAL CALENDARJuly 28  2022: HY 2022 financial results and business updateOctober 27  2022: Q3 2022 financial results and business updateCONFERENCE CALL DETAILSThe first quarter 2022 business update will be discussed during a conference call and webcast presentation today at 2:30 pm CEST/8:30 am ET.

The condensed consolidated interim financial results are available on the Company’s website (Financial Reports – Valneva).Story continuesValneva will provide a live webcast of its first quarter financial results conference call beginning at3 p.m. CEST or 9 a.m. EDT today. This webcast will also be available on the Company’s website. Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/pykk7aepPeter Bühler  Valneva’s Chief Financial Officer  commented  “Valneva continued to achieve significant milestones in the first quarter of the year with the first approval and first sales of our COVID-19 vaccine  successful completion of the pivotal Phase 3 trial of our chikungunya vaccine candidate and further positive Phase 2 results for our Lyme disease vaccine candidate. More recently  receiving conditional approval from the UK MHRA is a great recognition for our inactivated COVID-19 vaccine and we are now focused on making it available to additional people in geographical Europe and other regions of the world. The first quarter was also marked by tangible signs of a travel industry recovery which has already started to positively impact our travel vaccine sales. I would like to take this opportunity to thank our shareholders  partners and employees for their ongoing support and contribution.”Clinical Stage Vaccine CandidatesLYME DISEASE VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA15Further positive Phase 2 results reported including first pediatric dataValneva and Pfizer2 are developing VLA15  a Lyme disease vaccine candidate that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. The vaccine candidate covers the six OspA serotypes expressed by Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe.In April 2022  Valneva and Pfizer reported first pediatric results for VLA15. In the Phase 2 study  VLA15 was found to be more immunogenic in pediatric participants (5-17 years old) than in adults with both two-dose or three-dose vaccination schedules. These positive data build on the strong immunogenicity profile reported for adult participants (18-65 years old) in February 2022. Based on these latest Phase 2 immunogenicity and safety data  Valneva and Pfizer plan to proceed with a three-dose primary series vaccination schedule for both adult and pediatric participants in a Phase 3 clinical trial planned to start in the third quarter of 2022.SARS-CoV-2 INACTIVATED VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA2001UK MHRA Conditional Marketing Authorization grantedVLA2001 is currently the only whole virus  inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine candidate that has received an approval in geographical Europe. It is produced using Valneva’s established Vero-cell platform  leveraging the manufacturing technology for the Company’s commercial Japanese encephalitis vaccine  IXIARO®.Valneva recently initiated a heterologous booster trial of VLA2001 to provide booster data following primary vaccination with an mRNA vaccine or natural COVID-19 infection3. These data  if positive  could support potential use of VLA2001 as heterologous booster  subject to applicable regulatory recommendations and approvals. Topline results are expected in the third quarter of 2022.In April 2022  VLA2001 was granted Conditional Marketing Authorization by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for primary immunization in adults 18 to 50 years of age4. This authorization followed emergency use authorization from the Bahraini NHRA in March 20225.Valneva remains focused on achieving a Conditional Marketing Authorization for VLA2001 within the European Union. The Company is still in a rolling review process with the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Following its April meeting  the CHMP provided another List of Questions  to which Valneva has already responded. If the CHMP accepts these responses  the Company would expect a Conditional Marketing Authorization this quarter.The Company signed a supply agreement with the European Commission (EC) in November 20216.CHIKUNGUNYA VACCINE CANDIDATE – VLA1553Final Positive Phase 3 Results reportedValneva is developing a single-dose vaccine candidate against the chikungunya virus  a mosquito-borne virus that has spread to over 100 countries.In March 2022  Valneva announced successful completion of the Phase 3 pivotal trial of VLA15537. The final six-month analysis confirmed the very high level of seroprotection reported in August 2021. Six months after receiving a single vaccination  96.3% of participants showed protective chikungunya virus-neutralizing antibody titers. VLA1553’s safety and tolerability profile was also consistent with topline Phase 3 data. Valneva has initiated pre-submission discussions with the US FDA and expects to submit its Biologics License Application (BLA) in the second half of 2022.The Company also previously reported positive topline lot-to-lot manufacturing consistency trial results for VLA15538. This is one of the standard requirements for vaccine licensure  and final lot-to-lot results are expected in the second quarter of 2022.Valneva also initiated a Phase 3 trial in adolescents in January 2022. The trial  conducted in Brazil by Instituto Butantan  is designed to support label extension to this age group following a potential initial regulatory approval in adults in the US9. Funded by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations  the trial is also expected to support licensure of the vaccine in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic region.Commercial VaccinesJAPANESE ENCEPHALITIS VACCINE (IXIARO®/JESPECT®)IXIARO® is the only Japanese encephalitis vaccine licensed and available in the US  Canada and Europe.IXIARO®/JESPECT® product sales decreased by 68.6% (70.5% at constant exchange rates) to €4.2 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €13.3 million in the first quarter of 2021. Sales to the private travel markets showed significant recovery with IXIARO®/JESPECT® sales reaching €3.9 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €1.0 million in the first quarter of 2021 while sales to the US Government’s Department of Defense (DoD) were lower in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period last year as per the planned delivery schedule.CHOLERA / ETEC10-DIARRHEA VACCINE (DUKORAL®)DUKORAL® is an oral vaccine for the prevention of diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and/or heat-labile toxin producing ETEC  the leading cause of travelers’ diarrhea. DUKORAL® is authorized for use in the European Union and Australia to protect against cholera and in Canada  Switzerland  New Zealand and Thailand to protect against cholera and ETEC.DUKORAL® product sales increased significantly to €2.5 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €0.1 million in the first quarter of 2021 equally attributable to a recovery of the travel business across all markets.First Quarter 2022 Financial Review(Unaudited  consolidated under IFRS)RevenuesValneva’s total revenues were €21.8 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €23.2 million in the first quarter of 2021  a decrease of 5.9%.Product sales  including first COVID-19 vaccine sales  increased by 0.2% to €16.2 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €16.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. On a constant exchange rate (CER) basis  product sales decreased by 4.8% in the first quarter of 2022 as compared to the first quarter of 2021. Product sales excluding COVID-19 vaccine sales amounted to €12.4 million in the first quarter of 2022  a decrease of 23.3% (27.2% at CER) compared to the first quarter of 2021.IXIARO®/JESPECT® product sales decreased by 68.6% (70.5% at CER) to €4.2 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €13.3 million in the first quarter of 2021. Sales to the private travel markets showed significant recovery while sales to the US Government’s Department of Defense (DoD) were lower in the first quarter of 2022 compared to the same period last year as per the planned delivery schedule. DUKORAL® also benefited from the travel market recovery as sales increased significantly to €2.5 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €0.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. COVID-19 product vaccine sales amounted to €3.8 million resulting from first shipments of VLA2001 to Bahrain. Third Party product sales more than doubled to €5.6 million in the first quarter of 2022 from €2.7 million in the first quarter of 2021 driven by growth related to Valneva’s distribution agreement with Bavarian Nordic for the sales of Rabipur®/RabAvert® and Encepur®.Other revenues  including revenues from collaborations  licensing and services amounted to €5.6 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €7.1 million in the first quarter of 2021.Operating Result and EBITDACosts of goods and services sold (COGS) were €13.9 million in the first quarter of 2022. Gross margin on product sales excluding COVID-19 sales was 68.5% compared to 41.7% in the first quarter of 2021. Both IXIARO® and DUKORAL®’s gross margins  of 99.3% and 92.0% respectively  were affected by inventory revaluation gains and releases of write-off provisions resulting from increased sales projections as well as the positive effect from the Company’s share price development on the employee share-based compensation programs. Of the remaining COGS for the first quarter of 2022  €3.7 million were related to the Third-Party product distribution business  €8.0 million to the COVID-19 business and €1.9 million to cost of services. In the first quarter of 2021  overall COGS were €14.7 million  of which €9.6 million related to cost of goods and €5.1 million related to cost of services.Research and development investments amounted to €20.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €27.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by the progression of Valneva’s chikungunya vaccine program  VLA1553  towards BLA submission and the lower clinical trial costs resulting from it as well as lower investments in Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate VLA2001. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first quarter of 2022 amounted to €2.0 million compared to €4.9 million in the first quarter of 2021. Marketing and distribution expenses in the first quarter of 2022 notably included €0.9 million of expenses related to the launch preparation costs of the chikungunya vaccine candidate  VLA1553  (compared to €1.2 million in the first quarter of 2021). In the first quarter of 2022  general and administrative expenses declined to €5.8 million from €10.0 million in the first quarter of 2021. COGS  research and development  marketing and distribution as well as general and administrative expenses benefited from a provision release of €11.7 million related to the positive effect of the Company’s share price development on the employee share-based compensation programs. This income compares to a cost of €4.8 million in the first quarter of 2021.Other income  net of other expenses  reduced to €2.1 million in the first quarter of 2022 from €3.0 million in the first quarter of 2021. This decrease was mainly driven by reduced R&D tax credits directly resulting from lower R&D spending.Valneva recorded an operating loss of €18.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to an operating loss of €31.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted EBITDA loss in the first quarter of 2022 was €12.7 million compared to an EBITDA loss of €28.3 million in the first quarter of 2021.Net ResultIn the first quarter of 2022  Valneva generated a net loss of €26.0 million compared to a net loss of €27.7 million in the first quarter of 2021.Finance expense and currency effects in the first quarter of 2022 resulted in a net finance expense of €7.1 million  compared to a net finance income of €3.1 million in the first quarter of 2021. This was mainly a result of a foreign exchange loss amounting to €2.4 million in the first quarter of 2022  primarily driven by revaluation results of non-Euro denominated balance sheet positions  compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €7.7 million in the first quarter of 2021. Interest charges slightly increased to €4.7 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €4.6 million in the first quarter of 2021.Cash Flow and LiquidityNet cash used in operating activities amounted to €26.9 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €47.6 million of cash generated in operating activities in the first quarter of 2021. Cash outflows in the first quarter of 2022 were mainly related to the operating loss generated in the period  while during the first quarter of 2021 cash inflows mainly resulted from pre-payments related to the vaccine supply agreement signed with the UK government.Cash outflows from investing activities amounted to €9.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 compared to €16.9 million in the first quarter of 2021  both mainly as a result of COVID-19-related construction activities across production sites in Scotland and Sweden  as well as equipment purchases.Net cash generated from financing activities amounted to €1.0 million in the first quarter of 2022  which was mainly a result of proceeds from the issuance of new shares in relation to employee stock option and free share programs. Cash outflows in the first quarter of 2021 amounted to €1.6 million and mainly consisted of payments related to interest and lease liabilities.Liquid funds decreased to €311.3 million as of March 31  2022  compared to €346.7 million as of December 31  2021. The cash decrease mainly resulted from ongoing COVID-19-related investments into fixed assets and R&D expenses.Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresManagement uses and presents IFRS results  as well as the non-IFRS measure of Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate and communicate its performance. While non-IFRS measures should not be construed as alternatives to IFRS measures  management believes non-IFRS measures are useful to further understand Valneva’s current performance  performance trends  and financial condition.Adjusted EBITDA is a common supplemental measure of performance used by investors and financial analysts. Management believes this measure provide additional analytical tools. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings (loss) from continuing operations before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization.A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to operating loss  which is the most directly comparable IFRS measure  is set forth below:€ in million 3 months ending March 31 (unaudited results  consolidated per IFRS) 2022 2021 Operating Loss (18.4) (31.1) Add: Amortization 1.6 1.5 Depreciation 3.6 1.3 Impairment of Tangible Assets - - Adjusted EBITDA (13.3) (28.3)About Valneva SEValneva is a specialty vaccine company focused on the development  production and commercialization of prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases with significant unmet medical need.

The various restatements enabling the transition from underlying data to published data are presented in the methodology notes (section 10.5).As announced on April 11th  2022  an agreement has been signed to sell Rosbank and its Russian insurance subsidiaries. This operation is expected to be closed in the few coming weeks.As a reminder the impact of the disposal of Rosbank and the Group’s Russian insurance activities on the Group's CET1 ratio is expected to be around -20 basis points(2)  including around - 6 basis points of residual net impact expected at closing after reversal of rating migrations recorded in Q1 22 on the related Russian assets. This contemplated disposal would lead to the accounting in the Group’s income statement(3) of the write-off of the net book value of the divested activities (~EUR 2 billion(4) and an exceptional non-cash item with no impact on the Group’s capital ratio (~EUR 1.1 billion(4))  which corresponds to the normative reversal of the conversion reserve in the Group’s income statement.Net banking incomeNet banking income was substantially higher in Q1 22  up +16.6% (+16.1%*) vs. Q1 21  driven by a very good momentum in all the businesses.French Retail Banking’s performance was substantially higher  with net banking income (excluding PEL/CEL provision) up +6.4% vs. Q1 21  reflecting an upward momentum on net interest income as well as financial and service commissions.International Retail Banking & Financial Services enjoyed strong revenue growth (+19.3%* vs.Q1 21). Financial Services (+43.6%* vs. Q1 21) and Insurance (+6.0%* vs. Q1 21) enjoyed an excellent momentum. International Retail Banking also benefited from a strong rebound in its activities (+13.1%* vs. Q1 21).Global Banking & Investor Solutions delivered an excellent performance  with revenues up +18.1% (+16.9%*) vs. Q1 21. Financing & Advisory enjoyed a very good momentum  with revenues up +24.4% (+20.9%*) vs. Q1 21  while the revenues of Global Markets & Investor Services were substantially higher (+19.1%  +15.4%*) than in Q1 21.Operating expensesIn Q1 22  operating expenses totalled EUR 5 329 million on a reported basis and EUR 4 325 million on an underlying basis (restated for transformation costs and the linearisation of IFRIC 21)  an increase of +5.6% vs. Q1 21. This increase can be explained primarily by the rise in variable costs linked to the growth in revenues (EUR +93 million)  the increase in the contribution to the Single Resolution Fund (EUR +69 million)  currency effects and the increase in other expenses (EUR +31 million).Driven by a very positive jaws effect  underlying gross operating income grew substantially (+38%) to EUR 2 956 million and the underlying cost to income ratio  excluding the Single Resolution Fund  improved by nearly 7 points (56.4% vs. 63.3% in Q1 21).Cost of riskIn Q1 22  the cost of risk stood at 39 basis points  an increase vs. Q1 21 (21 basis points) due primarily to the consequences of the crisis in Ukraine on Russian exposure  or EUR 561 million (vs. EUR 276 million in Q1 21). It breaks down into a provision on non-performing loans of EUR 313 million and a provision on performing loans of EUR 248 million.Excluding Russian activities which are currently being sold  the cost of risk remains limited at 31 basis points and breaks down into a provision on non-performing loans of EUR 277 million and a provision on performing loans of EUR 148 million.Moreover  the Societe Generale Group has offshore international exposure (exposure at default) to Russian counterparties amounting to EUR 2.8 billion at March 31st  2022.

This information has not been audited.2 - Net banking incomeThe pillars’ net banking income is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document. The terms “Revenues” or “Net Banking Income” are used interchangeably. They provide a normalised measure of each pillar’s net banking income taking into account the normative capital mobilised for its activity.3 - Operating expensesOperating expenses correspond to the “Operating Expenses” as presented in note 8.1 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements as at December 31st  2021 (pages 482 et seq. of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document). The term “costs” is also used to refer to Operating Expenses. The Cost/Income Ratio is defined on page 41 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document.4 - IFRIC 21 adjustmentThe IFRIC 21 adjustment corrects the result of the charges recognised in the accounts in their entirety when they are due (generating event) so as to recognise only the portion relating to the current quarter  i.e. a quarter of the total. It consists in smoothing the charge recognised accordingly over the financial year in order to provide a more economic idea of the costs actually attributable to the activity over the period analysed.The contributions to Single Resolution Fund (« SRF ») are part of IFRIC21 adjusted charges  they include contributions to national resolution funds within the EU.5 – Exceptional items – Transition from accounting data to underlying dataIt may be necessary for the Group to present underlying indicators in order to facilitate the understanding of its actual performance. The transition from published data to underlying data is obtained by restating published data for exceptional items and the IFRIC 21 adjustment.Moreover  the Group restates the revenues and earnings of the French Retail Banking pillar for PEL/CEL provision allocations or write-backs. This adjustment makes it easier to identify the revenues and earnings relating to the pillar’s activity  by excluding the volatile component related to commitments specific to regulated savings.The reconciliation enabling the transition from published accounting data to underlying data is set out in the table below:Q1 22 (In EURm) OperatingExpenses Cost of risk Net profit orlosses fromother assets Incometax Group netincome Business Reported (5 329) (561) 2 (353) 842 (+) IFRIC 21 linearisation 860 (218) 626 (+) Transformation charges* 143 (37) 106 Corporate Center(1) Underlying (4 325) (561) 2 (608) 1 574 Q1 21 (In EURm) OperatingExpenses Cost of risk Net profit orlosses fromother assets Incometax Group netincome Business Reported (4 748) (276) 6 (283) 814 (+) IFRIC 21 linearisation 601 (141) 448 (+) Transformation charges* 50 (14) 36 Corporate Center(2) Underlying (4 097) (276) 6 (438) 1 298(*) Exceptional item(1) Q1 22 transformation charges related to French Retail Banking (EUR 104m)  Global Banking & Investor Solutions (EUR 14m) and Corporate Centre (EUR 25m)(2) Q1 21 transformation charges related to French Retail Banking (EUR 38m)  Global Banking and Investor Solutions (EUR 1m) and Corporate Center (EUR 11m)6 - Cost of risk in basis points  coverage ratio for doubtful outstandingsThe cost of risk is defined on pages 43 and 663 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document. This indicator makes it possible to assess the level of risk of each of the pillars as a percentage of balance sheet loan commitments  including operating leases.In EURm Q1 22 Q1 21 French Retail BankingNet Cost Of Risk 47 129 Gross loan Outstandings 242 645 233 953 Cost of Risk in bp 8 22 International Retail Banking and Financial ServicesNet Cost Of Risk 325 142 Gross loan Outstandings 140 547 130 196 Cost of Risk in bp 92 44 Global Banking and Investor SolutionsNet Cost Of Risk 194 3 Gross loan Outstandings 170 749 138 305 Cost of Risk in bp 45 1 Corporate CentreNet Cost Of Risk (5) 2 Gross loan Outstandings 14 413 12 963 Cost of Risk in bp (12) 4 Societe Generale GroupNet Cost Of Risk 561 276 Gross loan Outstandings 568 354 515 416 Cost of Risk in bp 39 21The gross coverage ratio for doubtful outstandings is calculated as the ratio of provisions recognised in respect of the credit risk to gross outstandings identified as in default within the meaning of the regulations  without taking account of any guarantees provided. This coverage ratio measures the maximum residual risk associated with outstandings in default (“doubtful”).7 - ROE  ROTE  RONEThe notions of ROE (Return on Equity) and ROTE (Return on Tangible Equity)  as well as their calculation methodology  are specified on page 43 and 44 of Societe Generale’s 2022 Universal Registration Document.

This demonstrates once again the rebound capacity and the growth potential of JCDecaux.Digital Out-Of-Home (DOOH) grew very strongly  doubling year-on-year  at +103.1% in reported growth and +95.2% organically in Q1 2022  to reach 29.1% of Group revenue vs 21.5% in Q1 2021. We continued to accelerate our digital transformation and maintained our focus on the roll-out of digital screens and on the development of our automated data-driven planning and trading solutions. Programmatic advertising continued to gain good momentum via the VIOOH platform now trading in 15 countries including its launch in US airports in February. VIOOH is the most connected programmatic trading platform of the OOH industry with 36 DSPs (Demand Side Platforms) connected.By activity  Street Furniture was strong at +52.6% organically in Q1 2022 and was above Q1 2019 levels in Europe (including France and UK) and in North America; Billboard grew significantly as well at +25.6% on an organic basis in Q1 2022  above 2019 in Asia-Pacific and North-America; Transport grew strongly at +46.1% but remained meaningfully impacted by ongoing restrictions on global international air passenger traffic and by lower commuter traffic in public transport than pre-pandemic.All geographies grew strongly in Q1 2022. Europe (including France and UK)  North America and Rest of the World were the main growth drivers  while Asia-Pacific grew at a lower pace due to its Transport exposure and to local mobility restrictions in China.As far as Q2 2022 is concerned  we continue to have a solid trading momentum but given increased mobility restrictions in China since the beginning of the quarter including extended lockdowns in several provinces  we expect an organic revenue growth of above +15%.As the most digitised global OOH company with our new data-led audience targeting and programmatic solutions  our well diversified portfolio  our ability to win new contracts  the strength of our balance sheet and the high quality of our teams across the world  we believe we are well positioned to benefit from the rebound. We are more than ever confident in the power of our media in an advertising landscape increasingly fragmented and more and more digital and in the role it will play to support the economic recovery as well as to drive positive changes.”Following the adoption of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014  the operating data presented below is adjusted to include our prorata share in companies under joint control.

All geographies grew strongly with North America and Asia-Pacific above Q1 2019 revenues.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group  operating data of the companies under joint control will continue to be proportionately integrated in the operating management reports used by directors to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data prior to 2014  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q1 2022  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€54.4 million (-€37.6 million in Q1 2021)  leaving IFRS revenue at €628.5 million (€416.7 million in Q1 2021).ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 2021 adjusted revenue (a) 454.3 2022 IFRS revenue (b) 628.5 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 54.4 2022 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 683.0 Currency impacts (e) -20.9 2022 adjusted revenue at 2021 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 662.1 Change in scope (g) 0.0 2022 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 662.1 Organic growth (i) = (h) / (a) – 1 +45.7%€m Impact of currency as of March 31st  2022 RMB -6.7 USD -3.7 GBP -2.8 HKD -1.5 Other -6.2 Total -20.9Average exchange rate Q1 2022 Q1 2021 RMB 0.1404 0.1281 USD 0.8915 0.8300 GBP 1.1956 1.1443 HKD 0.1142 0.1070Next information:Annual General Meeting of Shareholders: May 11th  20222022 half year results : July 28th  2022 (before market)Key Figures for JCDecaux2021 revenue: €2 745m (a)N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of more than 850 million people in more than 80 countries957 706 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 518 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants10 720 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexesJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (4.2/5) CDP (A Leadership) MSCI (AAA) and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100 (committed to 100% renewable energy)Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (530 143 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 154 airports and 215 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (340 753 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (72 611 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (596 831 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (232 268 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (64 893 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (20 808 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (14 177 advertising panels)(a) Adjusted revenueFor more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com.Join us on Twitter  LinkedIn  Facebook  Instagram and YouTube.Forward looking statementsThis news release may contain some forward-looking statements.

4338,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/publications/html/ecb.targetsecar202205.en.html,TARGET2-Securities Annual Report 2021,11 hours ago,Financial market infrastructures (FMIs) are the backbone of the financial system. They provide the networks through which financial institutions and financial markets connect with each other and through which financial transactions are cleared and settled. Therefore  it is essential to ensure that market infrastructures are safe and efficient  and that they provide for a stable and well-functioning economy. The Eurosystem is closely involved in this work as the conduct of monetary policy depends on the availability of reliable and effective FMIs  such as TARGET2 (the real-time gross settlement system)  TARGET2-Securities (the securities settlement platform) and TIPS (the instant payment settlement service).TARGET2-Securities (T2S)  in particular  was conceived as an initiative to address the highly fragmented securities settlement landscape in Europe. It was launched in June 2015 as an integrated platform for processing securities transactions against central bank money. T2S revolutionised securities settlement in Europe by offering a solution to simplify cross-border settlement procedures and to the difficulties caused by different settlement practices among countries.T2S provides harmonised and commoditised securities settlement to central securities depositories (CSDs)  and applies a single set of rules  standards and tariffs to all participant CSDs. This allows the securities settlement platform to lay the foundations for a single market for securities settlement and  as a result  contributes to achieving greater integration of Europe’s financial market. Today  the T2S platform connects 20 CSDs and processes on average over 700 000 securities transactions per day against both euro and Danish kroner.The report and its structureThis is the 11th edition of the TARGET2-Securities Annual Report  which now covers the fourth full year after the end of the T2S migration period. The first edition was published in 2011  a pivotal year for the finalisation of the legal and technical documentation of T2S and for the CSDs to prepare their T2S adaptation plans.This year the report presents the evolution of T2S settlement data  while confirming the continuity of operational stability and efficiency. It describes the developments which took place in T2S in 2021 as well as some of the main incidents that had an impact on the platform throughout the previous year. The report is mainly addressed to decision-makers  practitioners  lawyers  and academics wishing to acquire an in-depth understanding of T2S and how it works. In addition  it will serve the public with an interest in market infrastructure matters and T2S in particular.In addition to the core content  three boxes are included in this year’s publication. They provide in-depth information on the Market Settlement Efficiency Workshop V  the survey on on-hold functionality and late matching transactions  and the CSD Regulation (CSDR) and the settlement discipline regime that entered into force on 1 February 2022.1 Evolution of T2S traffic in 2021Table 1 provides an overview of traffic developments in T2S in 2021 compared with 2020. In 2021 T2S settled 187 377 873 transactions  with a total value of €178.30 trillion. This corresponded to a daily average volume of 726 271 transactions  with a daily average value of €691.10 billion. Compared with the previous year  there was an increase of 3.16% in the value settled  and of 6.05% in the volume settled. Settlement efficiency in 2021 was 94.07% in terms of value and 94.34% in terms of volume. This represented a minor decrease of 0.30% in terms of value and 0.18% in terms of volume compared with 2020.Table 1 Evolution of T2S settlement data and settlement efficiency Source: T2S.Notes: There were 257 operating days in 2020 and 258 operating days in 2021. EoD: end of day.1.1 Volume of settlements in T2SChart 1 shows the evolution of the volumes settled in T2S and settlement efficiency at the end of the day since the first migration wave was completed in 2015. As a result of the migration waves  the monthly total T2S settlement volumes increased from 1 815 790 transactions in September 2015 to 11 804 649 transactions in October 2017. Between November 2018 and December 2019  total T2S settlement volumes averaged 12 819 952 transactions per month. In March 2020  following the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic  total monthly traffic peaked at 20 232 528 transactions. In 2021 T2S settled on average 15 614 823 transactions per month. Compared with 2020  the average monthly volumes were 6.05% higher in 2021. Monthly volumes peaked at over 18 million transactions in March 2021  although this was lower than the peak in March 2020. As traffic in T2S stabilised in its first few years of operation  settlement efficiency in volume terms became less volatile and averaged 96.85% between November 2018 and December 2019. Following the introduction of the new T2S statistical framework [1] settlement efficiency in volume terms decreased to 94.81% in January 2020. The particularly high volumes settled in T2S in March 2020 affected settlement efficiency  which declined to 92.81%. Between that date and the end of 2021  settlement efficiency in volume terms averaged 94.50%.Chart 1 Evolution of volumes settled in T2S and settlement efficiency at end of day (left-hand scale: number of transactions  monthly totals; right-hand scale: settlement efficiency  percentages) Source: T2S.Notes: Migration wave 1 refers to 22 June‑31 August 2015; wave 2 refers to 29 March 2016; wave 3 refers to 12 September 2016; wave 4 refers to 6 February 2017; and final wave refers to 18 September 2017. NCDCP (Slovakian CSD) joined on 27 October 2017; settlement in Danish kroner (DKK) available  and ID2S (French CSD) joined on 29 October 2018.In 2021 T2S settled on average 726 271 transactions per day. Chart 2 shows the evolution of the daily average T2S traffic in volume terms. The daily average volume per month ranged from 639 876 (in August) to 798 571 (in February). The highest daily volume settled was on 30 November (1 061 928 transactions) and the lowest was on 28 December (245 181 transactions).The minimum occurred in a period of lower traffic owing to seasonality  with the closing of the German stock market on 24 December as a key driver for the volumes settled two business days later. The maximum was likely influenced by the market conditions at the time. Overall  the number of transactions settled in T2S on a daily average basis in 2021 was higher than in 2020 (687 476 transactions)  despite the market volatility caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.Chart 2 Volumes of T2S transactions settled in 2021 (number of transactions (thousands)  daily averages) Source: T2S.1.1.1 Real-time settlement and night-time settlementIn T2S  the new business day starts at 18:45 CET with the preparation for night-time settlement (NTS). NTS processing starts at 20:00 CET and is completed before 22:00 CET. It consists of two cycles. The first cycle is subdivided into five sequences and the second cycle into four sequences. Within the different sequences  a pre-defined set of transaction or instruction types is settled. At the end of the second cycle T2S submits  for partial settlement  all eligible transactions for which settlement failed in an earlier attempt in the same evening.After the end of NTS there is a short preparation period for real-time settlement (RTS)  followed by the RTS process. RTS is concluded by the end of the RTS process at 18:00 CET  but may be interrupted by the maintenance window. T2S Release 5.0 in June 2021 made the daily maintenance window optional. Additionally  the time of the weekly maintenance window has changed from Saturday at 03:00 CET to Monday at 05:00 CET. Since June the mandatory weekly maintenance window has been activated every weekend from Saturday 02:30 CET on Saturday to 02:30 CET on Monday. During the week the maintenance window is activated on an optional basis. When activated  it starts at 03:00 CET and ends at 05:00 CET. During the maintenance window T2S is closed for all settlement activities.RTS includes five partial settlement windows  at 08:00 CET  10:00 CET  12:00 CET  14:00 CET and 15:45 CET. In each partial settlement window  T2S partially settles new settlement instructions arriving in T2S that are eligible for partial settlement  as well as previously unprocessed or partially processed settlement instructions eligible for partial settlement. The first and the last partial settlement windows have a duration of 30 minutes each  while the others each have a duration of 15 minutes. The real-time settlement closure period starts with the DVP cut-off  which is harmonised at 16:00 CET for all currencies.In 2021 15 614 823 transactions were settled on average each month  compared with 14 723 437 in 2020. Chart 3 shows the total monthly volumes of traffic  broken down by NTS and RTS. The total monthly traffic ranged between a low of 14 077 269 transactions in August and a high of 18 249 070 transactions in March. This is in line with 2020  as total monthly traffic reached its minimum (12 487 334 transactions) and maximum (20 232 528 transactions) levels in the same months.Chart 3 NTS and RTS volumes in 2021 (number of transactions (millions)  monthly totals) Source: T2S.As depicted in the chart  there is little variation in the share of the total volume settled in NTS and RTS each month in 2021. NTS accounted for 52.63% of the overall volume  while RTS accounted for 47.37%  which is in line with the 2020 statistics (52.98% and 47.02%  respectively). In absolute terms  the monthly volumes settled in NTS and RTS both peaked in March  at 9 543 443 and 8 705 627 transactions respectively. Conversely  in percentage terms  the peak volume settled in NTS was seen in February (53.32%)  while the peak volume settled in RTS was seen in December (48.70%). In volume terms  delivery versus payment (DVP) transactions  which account for the majority of the T2S traffic  were largely settled during the NTS cycles (62.44%).1.1.2 Settlement volume by transaction typeFive transaction categories make up T2S volumes: DVP  free-of-payment (FOP)  payment-free-of-delivery (PFOD)  settlement restrictions on securities (SRSE) and delivery-with-payment (DWP).[2] Chart 4 displays total T2S traffic broken down by transaction type.Chart 4 Settlement volume by transaction type in 2021 (percentages  yearly totals) Source: T2S.Note: The category “Other” includes PFOD  SRSE and DWP.In 2021 DVP and FOP transactions were the largest contributors to T2S traffic  together representing around 96.56% of the total settled volume  compared with 97.24% in 2020. DVP transactions accounted for most of the total T2S volumes  with 72.66% (corresponding to a daily average of 527 732 transactions). FOP transactions represented 23.90% of the total T2S volumes (corresponding to a daily average of 173 590 transactions). PFOD transactions  SRSE transactions and DWP transactions together accounted for 3.44% of the total volumes (corresponding to a daily average of 24 949 transactions). The percentage contribution of each transaction type relative to the overall volume is consistent with the pattern observed in previous years.1.1.3 Settlement volume by transaction categoriesThe three largest securities categories contributing to T2S traffic in terms of volume are equities  entitlements (rights) and debt instruments. Chart 5 shows the daily average volume settled for each of these three categories. In line with previous years  in 2021 equities represented the largest share of overall T2S traffic with a daily average volume of 382 204 transactions (52.63%)  followed by entitlements (rights) with 195 235 transactions (26.88%) and debt instruments with 64 432 transactions (8.87%). The remaining share (11.62%) is attributable to other types of security. In 2020 the weight of equities and debt instruments was higher (58.52% and 9.57%  respectively)  whereas the weight of entitlements (rights) was slightly lower (26.26%).Chart 5 Volume by securities category in 2021 (number of transactions  daily averages) Source: T2S.The daily average volume of equity transactions in 2021 ranged between a low of 335 271 (in August) and a high of 423 261 transactions (in February). The daily average volume of entitlements (rights) ranged between 161 328 transactions (in June) and 232 520 (in November). The daily average volume of debt instruments ranged between 53 547 transactions (in August) and 72 778 (in April). Throughout the year equities consistently accounted for by far the largest volume  followed by entitlements and then debt instruments.1.2 Value of settlements in T2SChart 6 shows the evolution of the value settled in T2S and of settlement efficiency at the end of the day since the first migration wave was completed in 2015. Following the migration waves  monthly total T2S settled values increased from €10.14 trillion in September 2015 to €19.14 trillion in October 2017. Between November 2018 and December 2019  total T2S settled values averaged €22.98 trillion per month. The introduction of the new T2S statistical framework considerably affected settled values  which dropped to €14.76 trillion in January 2020 (i.e. a decrease of 32.38% compared with December 2019). Similar to the trend in volumes  values also saw a notable increase in March 2020  reaching €16.74 trillion. Compared with 2020  average monthly volumes were 3.16% higher in 2021. Unlike volumes  in March 2021 values were higher than at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic  standing at €17.06 trillion. Settlement efficiency in value terms averaged 97.52% between November 2018 and December 2019  largely in line with the average of 97.95% observed between September 2015 and October 2018. Following the methodological changes  the decrease in settlement efficiency between December 2019 and January 2020 was slightly larger in value terms than in volume terms (-2.33 percentage points compared with -1.73 percentage points). In line with volumes  settlement efficiency in value terms also dropped  falling to 88.95% in March 2020. From that date to the end of 2021  settlement efficiency in value terms averaged 94.40%.Chart 6 Evolution of value settled in T2S and settlement efficiency at end of day (left-hand scale: EUR billions  monthly totals; right-hand scale: settlement efficiency  percentages) Source: T2S.Notes: Migration wave 1: 22 June-31 August 2015; wave 2: 29 March 2016; wave 3: 12 September 2016; wave 4: 6 February 2017; final wave: 18 September 2017; NCDCP: 27 October 2017; DKK  ID2S: 29 October 2018.In 2021 T2S settled an average of €691.10 billion per day. Chart 7 shows the evolution of daily average T2S traffic in value terms.[3] The daily average value ranged from €620.04 billion (in August) to €741.88 billion (in March). The highest daily value was recorded on 10 March (€955.75 billion) and the lowest on 29 December (€438.34 billion). In line with volumes  the minimum was reached in a period of lower traffic owing to seasonality. Overall  the daily average value settled in T2S in 2021 was higher than in 2020 (€672.53 billion). The range of the daily average volume per month was narrower than in 2020  when it fluctuated between €567.31 billion in August and €931.42 billion in March.Chart 7 Values of settled T2S transactions in 2021 (EUR billions  daily averages) Source: T2S.Comparing Chart 7 with Chart 2  the highest daily traffic is seen in different months for volume (November) and value (March). This is not the case for the lowest daily traffic (which was recorded in December for both volume and value).1.2.1 Real-time settlement and night-time settlementIn 2021 T2S settled transactions with an average monthly value of €14.86 trillion  compared with €14.40 trillion in 2020. Chart 8 depicts total monthly traffic in terms of value  broken down by NTS and RTS. Total monthly traffic ranged from a low of €13.64 trillion in August and a high of €17.06 trillion in March. This is in line with 2020  when minimum (€11.91 trillion) and maximum (€16.78 trillion) levels were reached in the same months.Chart 8 NTS and RTS values in 2021 (EUR billions  monthly totals) Source: T2S.On average  RTS accounted for 65.09% of overall traffic in value terms in 2021 (61.67% in 2020)  compared with 34.91% settled in NTS (38.33% in 2020). As shown in Chart 4  settlement was more evenly balanced between RTS and NTS in volume terms (47.37% and 52.63% respectively). This indicates that the RTS phases were more value-intensive than volume-intensive and featured transactions with a higher average value than in the NTS cycles. In contrast  the NTS cycles were more volume-intensive than value-intensive.In absolute terms  the monthly values settled in both NTS and RTS in 2021 peaked in March  at €5 787.09 billion and €11 276.20 billion respectively. As a percentage of the total monthly value  the peak value settled in NTS was in February (37.52%)  while the peak value settled in RTS was in December (67.31%). 65.20% of the total value of DVP transactions  which represented the majority of overall T2S traffic  was settled in RTS.1.2.2 Settlement value by transaction typeThree transaction categories make up settlement values in T2S  namely DVP  DWP and PFOD  compared with five categories for volumes.[4] Chart 9 illustrates the total value settled in T2S by transaction type in 2021.Chart 9 Settlement value by transaction type in 2021 (percentages  yearly totals) Source: T2S.Note: The category “Other” includes PFOD and DWP.As for volumes (see Chart 5)  DVP represented the largest transaction type in value terms in 2021. DVP transactions were on average the largest contributor to T2S traffic  accounting for 95.52% (corresponding to a daily average of €660.15 billion)  compared with 96.38% in 2020. PFOD and DWP transactions together accounted for only 4.48% (corresponding to a daily average of €30.95 billion) of the total value settled  compared with 3.62% in 2020.1.2.3 Settlement value by transaction categoriesAs in the case of volumes  the three largest securities categories contributing to T2S traffic in terms of value are equities  entitlements (rights) and debt instruments. Chart 10 shows the daily average value settled for these three types of security in 2021. Debt instruments were by far the largest securities category in overall T2S traffic in value terms  with a daily average of €587.28 billion (84.98%)  followed by equities with €67.18 billion (9.72%) and entitlements (rights) with €1.14 billion (0.16%). The remaining share (5.14%) is attributable to other types of security. In 2020 the weight of debt instruments and equities was higher (85.55% and 10.02% respectively)  whereas the weight of entitlements (rights) was largely unchanged (0.15%).Chart 10 Value by securities category in 2021 (EUR billions  daily averages) Source: T2S.Note: Owing to the much lower values of entitlements (rights) settlements compared with the other two categories  the amounts are barely visible on the chart.Unlike in Chart 6  where equities are the largest securities category in volume terms  they are the second largest in value terms  whereas debt instruments are by far the largest category in value terms but are the third largest in volume terms. This suggests that equity transactions have a much lower average value than debt instrument transactions. Like equities  entitlements (rights) contribute far more to settlement volumes than to values.1.3 Settlement efficiencySettlement efficiency measures the efficiency of the settlement engine of the T2S platform. It compares the volume (or value) of transactions that are settled on a given day with the total volume (or value) of transactions eligible for settlement on that day.[5]Charts 11 and 12 show the evolution of settlement efficiency in T2S in 2021  at end of day (EOD) and after NTS respectively.Chart 11 Settlement efficiency at end of day in 2021 (percentages  at end of day) Source: T2S.In 2021 settlement efficiency at end of day reached on average 94.34% in volume terms and 94.07% in value terms. This is in line with the 2020 calculations  when settlement efficiency at end of day averaged 94.51% in volume terms and 94.35% in value terms. In 2021 settlement efficiency in volume terms ranged between 93.18% and 94.79%  as illustrated in Chart 11. In value terms  it displayed more volatility  ranging between 92.78% and 96.20%. The minimum level was reached in December and the maximum level was reached in August  in both volume and value terms. During the fourth quarter of 2021 T2S recorded a significant increase in both the volume and the value of on-hold transactions  mainly owing to external reasons  such as volatility on financial markets. This  combined with the lower traffic typically seen in the month of December  negatively affected settlement efficiency. In this period the average settlement efficiency at end of day stood at 93.83% in volume terms and 93.31% in value terms.In 2021 average settlement efficiency after NTS reached 67.89% in volume terms and 41.82% in value terms (see Chart 12). This compares with a level of 67.85% in volume terms and 46.75% in value terms in 2020. In line with the end of day  settlement efficiency after NTS displayed more volatility in value than in volume terms. The minimum level was reached in December in both volume and value terms (66.09% and 38.53% respectively)  whereas the maximum level was reached in February in volume terms (69.54%) and in January in value terms (46.51%).Chart 12 Settlement efficiency after NTS in 2021 (percentages  after NTS) Source: T2S.It is important to emphasize that the settlement efficiency is in line with market expectations and its evolution is discussed with the key stakeholders via dedicated Market Settlement Efficiency (MSE) workshops. See also Box 1.Box 1Settlement efficiency according to CSDR guidelines The analysis of settlement efficiency topics continued in 2021. A fifth dedicated Market Settlement Efficiency (MSE) workshop was organised in June. The main purpose was to improve on the calculation of the settlement efficiency indicator computed in accordance with the CSDR guidelines prepared for the fourth workshop  to support the CSDs in their preparation for the new regulatory framework. The enhancements encompassed aligning the treatment of partially settled transactions[6] with CSDR requirements and including late matching transactions (LMT)[7] in additional breakdowns compared with the fourth workshop. The indicators were provided at the global level  as well as by time of day  type of settlement instruction and type of asset. Moreover  a set of intraday settlement efficiency indicators was developed following contacts with the market. The CSRD settlement efficiency indicator (CSDR SEI) is based on the principle that transactions eligible for settlement that are not settled at end of day  irrespective of the reason  have to be considered as failures  thus having a negative impact on the settlement efficiency. In line with past results  the analysis showed that on-hold transactions were the main fail reason in volume terms in the reference month of February 2021  whereas in value terms lack of securities and on-hold transactions were the main fail reasons (see Table A). The asymmetric impact of the on-hold fail reason in the CSDR SEI for volume and value is mainly because the on-hold transactions are usually FOP transactions  which do not imply cash movements. Table A Main fail reasons in T2S Source: T2S.Notes: Calculations are for February 2021. Fail reasons are computed as a percentage of total failed transactions in value and volume terms. Particular attention has been paid to the intraday evolution of the CSDR settlement efficiency indicator  both in volume and value terms  with the aim of investigating liquidity usage and identifying settlement best practices to optimise settlement efficiency. The analysis looked at different points in time of the T2S business day  including the end of the two NTS cycles  the start of day-time at 07:00 CET  the end of all partial settlement windows (at 08:30 CET  10:15 CET  12:15 CET  14:15 CET and 16:00 CET) and the end of RTS at 18:00 CET. The intraday evolution of the CSDR settlement efficiency indicator in value terms showed two main increases throughout the business day: the first during the two cycles of the NTS phase and the second during the first partial settlement window scheduled for 08:00 CET. The CSDR SEI reached 33.97% in value terms at the end of NTS Cycle 1 and then jumped by 12.70 percentage points to 46.67% in a short time during NTS Cycle 2 (see Chart A). The increase was less pronounced afterwards (+3.90 percentage points to 50.57% in seven hours  from the end of NTS to 03:00 CET). The plateau observed between 03:00 CET and 05:00 CET was due to the maintenance window.[8] The CSDR SEI marked significant increases at each partial settlement window and reached 94.21% at the end of RTS  including the impact of LMTs. It is worth noting that the inclusion of LMTs has a negative effect on the CSDR SEI at the end of RTS  because it increases the number of transactions that are considered to be unsettled. Excluding the impact of LMTs  the CSDR SEI would increase to 94.78%. Chart A Evolution of the intraday settlement efficiency indicator in T2S in value terms (left-hand scale: settlement efficiency in percentages; right-hand scale: total value in EUR billions) Source: T2S.Note: Calculations relative to February 2021. The blue shaded area represents the NTS phase and the yellow shaded areas represent the partial settlement windows throughout the T2S business day. The intraday evolution of the CSDR settlement efficiency indicator in volume terms showed that the indicator reached 58.12% at the end of NTS Cycle 1 and grew by 3.04 percentage points to 61.16% during NTS Cycle 2 (see Chart B). The CSDR SEI showed a further slight increase of 6.72% in seven hours (to 67.88%) from the end of NTS to 03:00 CET. It then rose consistently throughout the day  mainly from 05:00 CET to 09:00 CET  when the settlement ratio increased by 14.03 percentage points  from 67.88% to 81.91%. The CSDR SEI reached 89.57% at end of RTS  including LMTs. Excluding the impact of LMTs  the CSDR SEI would increase to 91.25%. Chart B Evolution of the intraday settlement efficiency indicator in T2S in volume terms (left-hand scale: settlement efficiency in percentages; right-hand scale: number of transactions in thousands) Source: T2S.Note: Calculations relative to February 2021. The blue shaded area represents the NTS phase and the yellow shaded areas represent the partial settlement windows throughout the T2S business day. In conclusion  the analysis showed that the settlement efficiency indicator based on CSDR guidelines reached an average of 94.78% in value terms and 89.57% in volume terms  including the impact of LMT  at the end of the day  thus leaving room for further improvement. No critical points in time during the T2S operational day emerged  as the main causes of settlement fails are related to certain market-oriented practices  such as on-hold transactions [9] and to a lack of securities. In addition  the analysis confirmed that the possibility of using multiple partial settlement windows during the day helps to increase settlement efficiency in T2S.1.4 Unsettled transactionsNot all transactions submitted for processing in T2S are settled on the intended settlement day. This may be because the resources (cash and/or securities) needed for settlement are not available  one of the two instructions underlying the transaction is set to on-hold or the instruction is submitted late. Unsettled transactions negatively impact settlement efficiency (see Section 1.3).Chart 13 illustrates the daily average volume of unsettled transactions in T2S at the end of the day in 2021. The calculations comprise of DVP  DWP  PFOD  FOP and SRSE transactions.Chart 13 Volume of unsettled transactions in 2021 (number of transactions  daily averages) Source: T2S.In 2021 the daily average number of unsettled transactions was 14 170  which is slightly lower than the 14 418 transactions reported in 2020. This means that  on a daily average basis  of the total number of transactions processed by T2S  5.66% were unsettled at the end of the day. Unsettled transactions reached a high of 16 449 in November and a low of 11 486 in August  thus mirroring the volume trends illustrated in Chart 3. In line with the results observed for settled transactions  DVP and FOP represented around 98.64% of all unsettled transactions in volume terms.Chart 14 shows the daily average value of unsettled transactions in T2S in 2021. The transaction types contributing to the value are DVP  DWP and PFOD.Chart 14 Value of unsettled transactions in 2021 (EUR billions  daily averages) Source: T2S.The daily average value of unsettled transactions in T2S in 2021 ranged between €14.75 billion in August and €34.52 billion in November. These figures are significantly lower than in 2020  when they ranged between €22.49 billion in October and €63.92 billion in March. In 2021 DVP represented 99.36% of all unsettled transactions in value terms  followed by PFOD with 0.64%. Once again  these results reflect the composition of settled traffic in value terms.At the end of each day  the unsettled transactions are not deleted but automatically postponed by T2S (“recycled” in technical terms) to the following business day(s). T2S attempts to recycle them for a period of time referred to as the “recycling period” before they are automatically cancelled. In other words  the recycling period can be defined as the number of days during which a transaction remains unsettled. Chart 15 shows the share of unsettled transactions and the recycling days required before settling.Chart 15 Average unsettled transactions per number of recycling days in 2021 (percentages  number of recycling days) Source: T2S.Chart 15 shows that on average 24.93% of unsettled transactions sent for recycling were settled on the following business day in 2021 (first column) and less than half of those (11.50% in total) were pending for two days before settlement. Only 1.11% were pending for 16 days (last bar). In 2020 these averages were slightly higher at 26.28%  12.51% and 1.16%  respectively.Box 2Survey on on-hold and late matching transactions Following the fourth workshop on settlement efficiency topics held in October 2020  a survey was carried out among the CSDs in T2S to investigate the reasons behind on-hold and late matching transactions in their markets. A total of 17 responses  covering 19 markets  were received. The results were grouped by the size of the reporting CSD and presented at the fifth workshop held in June 2021 (see Box 1). This box provides some key takeaways. On-hold transactions The on-hold functionality is a risk management tool aimed at ensuring the availability of the necessary resources before settlement is attempted in T2S. It comprises four types: party-on-hold  CSD-on-hold  CSD-validation-on-hold and CoSD (conditional securities delivery)-on-hold. Most CSDs  irrespective of their size  indicated that “party-on-hold” is the most widely used functionality  followed by 40% or more that use CSD-on-hold (see Chart A). Conversely  a minority of CSDs indicated that they use the CSD-validation-on-hold option  and only less than half of the medium and large CSDs reported usage of CoSD-on-hold. These results are in line with expectations  as T2S actors can set out the first two types of on-hold functionality  while the last two are automatically set by T2S in line with specific rules and conditions drawn up by the CSDs. Chart A Usage of the on-hold functionality in T2S by type (percentages  share of respondents) Source: ECB calculations.Note: The size of the reporting CSD is determined by its volumes in T2S. The results showed that the on-hold functionality is used for several reasons. First  it provides support for managing and optimising the settlement of specific instruction types and client resources. For instance  it can help prevent settlement fails that are due to a lack of securities when segregated accounts are involved and it supports ownership and position checks in the case of omnibus accounts. Second  the functionality supports the timely matching of transactions and helps prevent the settlement of cancelled transactions that are still awaiting the counterparty’s cancellation. Third  it helps manage settlement involving communities or markets outside T2S  where the partial release implementation may not be completed. At the same time  the survey highlighted that inefficiencies in the usage of the on-hold functionality can arise owing to the lack of straight-through processing (STP) and the presence of interdependencies  also with markets outside T2S. These may cause the unavailability of resources by actors along the settlement chain. Moreover  it was noted that the system design means that transactions are not prioritised by their recycling period in T2S. Owing to regulatory requirements  T2S actors may thus set transactions with an intended settlement date (ISD) less than 4 days on-hold. Late matching transactions As discussed in Box 1  LMTs are matched either after their cut-off on the ISD has been reached or after their ISD  and thus count as unsettled at the end of the day. The survey results indicated different potential reasons for LMTs in T2S. First  the need for information from own clients or counterparties and the submission of incomplete  invalid or incorrect instructions on either side can cause the late submission of instructions to T2S. Second  transactions in T2S can be matched late because the client submits the instruction to the CSD late. Third  business process dependencies  such as internal dependencies before submission to T2S  linkages between transaction flows or long intermediary chains also play a role. Overall  the survey offered interesting insights into on-hold and LMTs from a market perspective. This can help the T2S operator better understand the way T2S actors make use of the available functionalities and consider implementing changes to address potential issues. It can also be considered a stock-taking exercise for the market  which may result in guiding and encouraging clients in the use of specific functionalities  promoting information sharing between counterparties or developing market practices.1.5 Use of auto-collateralisationAuto-collateralisation in T2S is an intraday credit operation granted by a central bank which is triggered when a T2S dedicated cash account (DCA) holder does not have enough funds to settle securities transactions. Its ultimate purpose is to improve the buyer’s cash position and secure the funds necessary to settle the transaction. Auto-collateralisation is an automatic process which is aimed at facilitating smooth real-time DVP settlement in central bank money.Two types of auto-collateralisation are available in T2S:auto-collateralisation on-flow refers to the use of the securities which are about to be purchased as collateral to secure the necessary credit to complete the transaction;auto-collateralisation on-stock is the use of other securities already held by the buyer as collateral to complete the transaction.In 2021 the overall use of auto-collateralisation reached a daily average value of €115.79 billion  compared with €103.45 billion in 2020. Chart 16 shows the daily average value of auto-collateralisation per month  broken down by type. The daily average use of auto-collateralisation ranged between €106.00 billion in June and €126.41 billion in March.Chart 16 Auto-collateralisation use by type in 2021 (left-hand scale: EUR billions  daily averages; right-hand scale: number of transactions  daily averages) Source: T2S.Note: The chart shows use of auto-collateralisation by national central banks.The use of auto-collateralisation largely follows a similar pattern to that observed for daily DVP transactions settled throughout the year.On average  83.15% of the total value of auto-collateralisation was represented by auto-collateralisation on-flow (corresponding to €96.27 billion) and 16.85% by auto-collateralisation on-stock (corresponding to €19.51 billion). As in 2020  the use of auto-collateralisation on-stock remained relatively stable in 2021. In contrast  the use of auto-collateralisation on-flow displayed a more volatile pattern reaching a peak of €103.89 billion in March. The total monthly number of auto-collateralisation transactions ranged between 193 565 (in April) and 265 977 (in March).In 2021 the overall use of auto-collateralisation on a monthly basis ranged between €2 310.47 billion in May and €2 907.20 billion in March. Chart 17 shows the monthly total value of auto-collateralisation  broken down by RTS and NTS  and the value of auto-collateralisation as a share of DVP transactions.Chart 17 Real-time and night-time use of auto-collateralisation in 2021 (left-hand scale: EUR billions; right-hand scale: percentages  monthly totals) Source: T2S.Note: The chart shows use of auto-collateralisation by national central banks.On average  83.08% of auto-collateralisation transactions took place during RTS (corresponding to €2 068.28 billion) and 16.92% took place during NTS (€421.10 billion) in 2021. This compares to 78.61% and 21.39% respectively in 2020. The use of auto-collateralisation in RTS and NTS follows a similar pattern to that of the daily average value of transactions settled in T2S (see Chart 8). Auto-collateralisation use during RTS peaked in March (at €2 452.80 billion)  while its use during NTS peaked in January (at €515.79 billion).In 2021 the use of auto-collateralisation represented on average 17.54% of the total monthly value of DVP transactions settled and remained broadly stable over the year. This represents an increase compared with 2020 when this figure was 15.96%. As the chart shows  auto-collateralisation use as a share of DVP transactions reached its highest point in December (18.44%).1.6 Other aspects related to settlement in T2S1.6.1 Internally and externally matched settlement instructionsIn order to settle a securities transaction  the delivering and receiving parties provide the necessary details in the form of settlement instructions. The two settlement instructions have to be compared to ensure that both parties agree on the terms of the transaction. If the comparison is successful  the two settlement instructions are matched  generating a new settlement transaction in T2S. This process can take place either inside T2S in the module performing the validation and matching of individual settlement instructions (life cycle management and matching – LCMM) or outside T2S. In the first case  the settlement instructions are defined as internally matched. In the second case  they are referred to as externally matched.In 2021 728 354 settlement instructions were matched daily in T2S on average  compared with an average of 805 148 daily settlement instructions that were matched outside T2S. This represents an increase of 5.25% and 3.89% respectively compared with 2020. Chart 18 compares the daily average number of instructions that were internally and externally matched each month.Chart 18 Internally and externally matched settlement instructions in 2021 (number of instructions  daily averages) Source: T2S.Overall  47.50% of settlement instructions were internally matched  suggesting that slightly more than half (52.50%) reached T2S as already matched.1.6.2 Intra-  cross- and external-CSD settlementInvestors can access different markets linked to T2S through multiple technical channels. Depending on the number of CSDs involved  it is possible to distinguish between intra-CSD  cross-CSD and external-CSD traffic.Intra-CSD traffic refers to securities transfers where the delivering and receiving parties belong to the same CSDCross-CSD traffic takes place when the delivering and receiving parties belong to different CSDsExternal-CSD traffic occurs when the delivering and receiving parties belong to different CSDs  one of which is not in T2SIn T2S  intra-CSD transactions represent the majority of all settled transactions in terms of both volume and value.As illustrated in Chart 19  in 2021 the daily average volume of intra-CSD transactions represented 98.42% (compared with 98.63% in 2020) of the total T2S settlement volume  while the daily average value of intra-CSD settlement represented 96.90% (97.26% in 2020) of the total T2S settlement value.Chart 19 Intra-CSD settlement in 2021 (percentages  daily averages) Source: T2S.Only a very small percentage is attributable to cross-CSD traffic. Chart 20 shows the share of cross-CSD transactions compared with total value and volume of all transactions settled  in terms of daily average volume and value  in 2021.Chart 20 Cross-CSD settlement in 2021 (percentages  daily averages) Source: T2S.In 2021 the daily average volume of cross-CSD settlement transactions represented 1.05% of the total T2S settlement volume (compared with 0.99% in 2020)  while the daily average value of cross-CSD settlement transactions represented 3.10% of the total T2S settlement value (2.74% in 2020).Considering that intra-CSD and cross-CSD transactions together accounted for 99.47% of the total volume and 100.00% of the total value  the share of external-CSD settlement was negligible in 2021.1.7 Interaction between T2S and connected RTGS systemsAt the start of each day liquidity is sent from the RTGS accounts in TARGET2 and Kronos2 (see Section 1.7.2) to the DCAs in T2S  while towards the end of RTS  at the latest  any remaining liquidity in DCAs is returned from T2S to the corresponding RTGS accounts. During the day  liquidity can be freely transferred from the RTGS systems to T2S and vice versa.1.7.1 Interaction between T2S and TARGET2Inbound liquidity transfers are transfers from the TARGET2 RTGS accounts to the T2S DCAs  while outbound liquidity transfers are transfers from the T2S DCAs to the TARGET2 RTGS accounts.Chart 21 shows the daily average volumes of liquidity transfers between TARGET2 RTGS accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021. The daily average volume of inbound liquidity transfers from TARGET2 was 614  while the daily average volume of outbound liquidity transfers to TARGET2 was 1 073.Chart 21 Volume of liquidity transfers between TARGET2 RTGS accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021 (number of transactions  daily averages) Source: T2S.Chart 22 shows the daily average value of liquidity transfers between TARGET2 RTGS accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021. The daily average value of inbound liquidity transfers from TARGET2 was €140.05 billion  while the daily average value of outbound liquidity transfers to TARGET2 was €145.18 billion. Any remaining balance on T2S DCAs stemming from the discrepancy between inbound and outbound liquidity transfers is automatically transferred back to TARGET2 as part of the RTS closure activities.Chart 22 Value of liquidity transfers between TARGET2 RTGS accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021 (EUR billions  daily averages) Source: T2S.1.7.2 Interaction between T2S and Kronos2Inbound liquidity transfers are transfers from the Kronos2 RTGS accounts to the T2S DCAs  while outbound liquidity transfers are transfers from the T2S DCAs to the Kronos2 RTGS accounts.[10]Chart 23 shows the daily average volumes of liquidity transfers between Kronos2 RTGS accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021. The daily average volume of inbound liquidity transfers from Kronos2 was 47 transfers  while the daily average volume of outbound liquidity transfers to Kronos2 was 156 transfers.Chart 23 Volume of liquidity transfers between Kronos2 accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021 (number of transactions  daily averages) Source: T2S.Chart 24 shows the daily average value of liquidity transfers between Kronos2 RTGS accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021. The daily average value of inbound liquidity transfers from Kronos2 was €2.77 billion (corresponding to DKK 21.31 billion)  while the daily average value of outbound liquidity transfers to Kronos2 was €2.87 billion (corresponding to DKK 22.08 billion). Any remaining balance on T2S DCAs stemming from the discrepancy between inbound and outbound liquidity transfers is automatically transferred back to Kronos2 as part of the RTS closure activities.Chart 24 Value of liquidity transfers between Kronos2 accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021 (EUR billions  daily averages) Source: T2S.2 T2S Service level and availability data2.1 Technical availabilityThe Eurosystem pays particular attention to the proper functioning and operation of the T2S platform. The availability of the services is measured continuously and objectively at pre-defined components of T2S  throughout each Settlement Day  excluding the Maintenance Window.The use of key performance indicators (KPIs) is one of the measures applied to demonstrate how effectively T2S is achieving its punctuality objectives. The punctuality of T2S is measured by calculating the real duration of the following three phases of the Business Day and comparing these against the expected target durations.Start of Day (SOD) – measures the elapsed time between the Start of Day phase (event BDCD) and the End of Start of Day (event ESOD)Night-Time Settlement including reporting (NTS + reporting) – measures the elapsed time between the start of the Night-Time Settlement (event C1P0) and the end of the NTS reporting (event ENTS)End of Day (EOD) – measures the elapsed time between the Start of the End of Day phase (event SEOD) and the End of Day Reports (event EEOR)Table 2 summarises the average duration on a monthly basis of the different phases in a business day in comparison with the respective target durations. The figures show that the platform operated within the target expectations.Table 2 Punctuality2.2 Incidents in T2SThe Eurosystem is dedicated to ensuring the smooth operation of the T2S system during normal operations and to steering activities aimed at restoring the proper functioning of the T2S Services by mitigating the effects of incidents.In 2021 the T2S platform experienced three major incidents  described as unplanned interruptions or reductions in the quality of an agreed service for which a Crisis Managers' conference call[11] was required. Each of the incidents was followed up with a detailed report  which serves as input for continuously improving the service and for increasing capabilities for preventing or mitigating them in the future. Paragraphs 1.2.1-1.2.3 provide more details about the three major incidents that occurred in 2021.In comparison  in 2020 the T2S platform experienced 21 major incidents.As illustrated in Chart 25  throughout the year 2021 the service level indicator  computed as the weighted average of the platform services  was below the committed KPI value of 99.7% on two occasions (June and November). Nonetheless  the overall results demonstrate a consistently high performance by the platform in the remaining months.Chart 25 T2S Service level indicator in 2021 Source: T2S.2.2.1 25 January incidentA major incident occurred in NTS on 25 January 2021  causing event C1S4 to be delayed.The root cause of the issue related to a change in one of the database tables and was an unexpected consequence of the deployment of a minor change effected on 16 January 2021.This change proved to be inefficient with higher volumes.An optimisation at database level allowed event C1S4 to run at its usual pace and it was finally completed at 01:28 CET.As a follow-up to the incident  an alert was put in place to identify the possible reoccurrence of the issue with the access path  thus shortening the reaction time.2.2.2 14 June incidentOn 14 June 2021  following the deployment of T2S Release 5.0  the EOD reporting phase did not complete in its usual time frame. Instead  events closed and the BD change took place at 22:50 CET. The start of NTS (event C1P0) was scheduled 75 minutes afterwards  at 00:05 CET. Both the SOD and the NTS phases ran smoothly. Similar delays were also experienced on 15 June  after which a rollback of two changes stemming from Release 5.0 enabled a return to close to expected event durations.2.2.3 22 November incidentOn 22 November 2021  following the deployment of T2S Release 5.2  T2S dealt with an incident that prevented the proper closure of the Weekly Maintenance Window at a planned time of 02:30 CET on Monday  affecting outbound A2A traffic.The incident was discovered by the operator through the technical monitoring tool at 05:10 CET. The operator was able to identify a missing job run that had caused the restart of the message brokers as the root cause. Once the jobs had been executed at around 07:45 CET  the outbound flow was resumed. In the meantime  a considerable queue of messages had accrued  which was fully processed by around 10:30 CET.The late appearance of the alarm was caused by a wrong setting in the technical monitoring tool  which was subsequently fine-tuned to react to the changed weekly maintenance schedule introduced in Release 6.0.3 T2S financial performance3.1 Cost recovery objectiveThe financial position of T2S is determined by cost and revenue trends. The platform operates on a full cost recovery basis  meaning that all costs incurred should be covered by the revenues generated. The T2S pricing structure is defined in Schedule 7 of the T2S Framework Agreement and is also available in the TARGET Services Pricing Guide. T2S cost recovery is driven by three factors:the transaction volumes that are settled in T2S; the fees that are charged to T2S actors for using its services; the pre-defined T2S cost recovery period.3.2 Financial performance of T2SThe overall financial position of T2S is detailed in the annual T2S financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with specific accounting policies established by the Market Infrastructure Board (MIB). In the interests of clarity  the financial information is presented in a similar manner to a profit and loss report (T2S operating statement) and a balance sheet report (T2S financial situation report).The T2S operating statement shows yearly accumulated revenues (collected on a monthly basis) and yearly operational costs (paid on a quarterly basis). The T2S financial situation report provides a snapshot of relevant items in the asset and liability accounts.For more information on the T2S financial position  see the latest T2S financial statement for 2020.[12]3.3 Analysis of revenues collected in 2021Chart 26 displays the relative split (in percentage terms) in T2S revenues between settlement services (SETT) and information services (INSV). The SETT revenue derives from the core settlement services that are available continuously during the night-time and real-time settlement periods  except for a short period during the maintenance window. Information services include services related to T2S information items  such as queries and reports. As part of this service  a CSD or an NCB may query any of its assigned accounts.As shown in the Chart 26 below  in 2021 approximately four-fifths (80.6%) of T2S revenues stemmed from settlement services  while approximately one-fifth (19.4%) of T2S revenues stemmed from information services. The settlement services portion of T2S revenues has been increasing over the years (with a concomitant reduction in the information services portion)  mainly owing to the gradual migration of some of the largest T2S markets in the platform’s first years of operation  and to the increase in T2S prices  which became effective in January 2019.Chart 26 Share of T2S revenue split between settlement and information services Source: T2S.Table 3 displays the share (in percentage terms) of T2S revenues split between settlement services (SETT) and information services (INSV) detailed per tariff item. In 2021 the tariff items that contributed the most to the settlement services portion of T2S revenues were DVP (51.9%) and FOP (9.8%)  while the tariff items that contributed the most to the information services portion of T2S revenues were charges related to Transmissions (10.1%) and Messages bundled into file (6.0%).Table 3 Share of T2S revenue split between settlement and information services tariff items4 T2S risk management and compliance4.1 Risk managementManaging operational and information security risk is a key element of the governance structure of T2S.The T2S governance is based on the ECB Guideline on T2S [13] which lays down the responsibilities of the Governing Council and of the MIB in relation to T2S  including their risk management-related responsibilities. Thus  the Governing Council decides on the general operational aspects of T2S  including the TARGET services risk management framework. The MIB’s responsibilities[14] include (in full respect of the mandates of the European System of Central Bank (ESCB) committees) the preparation of a T2S risk management framework for Governing Council approval  its implementation and maintenance.The T2S risk status and assessment  including risk analysis and mitigation measures (where relevant)  is shared on a regular basis with the CSDs and the NCBs via the relevant fora: the Operations Managers Group (OMG)  the Project Managers Group (PMG)  the CSD Steering Group (CSG)  the Securities Managers Group (SMG) and the Eurosystem Risk Management Forum (ERMF). As part of their own risk management activities  and complying with their own national regulatory requirements  CSDs and NCBs actively contribute to risk discussions by providing their views on existing risks and sharing information about any risks their participants and/or they themselves may pose to T2S.Following a recommendation from the TARGET2 overseer  a common TARGET Services Risks Management Framework was adopted in 2021 for all TARGET services. The framework is based on a three-line model:[15] the TARGET services first line manages risks on a day-to-day basis and is made up of operational experts and managers whose main role is to ensure the efficient and smooth operation of TARGET services  while the TARGET services second line hosts the risk management function  and is composed of operational risk managers and experts  that are independent from operations and have a direct reporting line to the Steering Level. Both manage TARGET services operational risks and report regularly to the MIB  for their area of competence. Lastly  the third line is represented by the Eurosystem Internal Auditors’ Committee (IAC).4.2 OversightThe Eurosystem conducts the oversight of T2S as laid down in the Eurosystem oversight policy framework. The ECB has primary oversight responsibility for T2S and leads and coordinates all oversight activities. The oversight of T2S is conducted against a subset of the Principles for financial market infrastructures (PFMIs) established by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) as considered relevant for T2S by the Eurosystem. The PFMIs are the international standards for FMIs  i.e. payment systems  CSDs  securities settlement systems  central counterparties and trade repositories. Although T2S does not fall within the definition of an FMI provided in the PFMI report  the Eurosystem decided to apply the PFMIs to T2S as these principles relate to functions performed by T2S  i.e. the settlement and recording of securities transactions.In the course of 2021  the operation function engaged in an active dialogue with the oversight function in order to follow up on outstanding oversight recommendations stemming from the various previous assessments. The oversight function acknowledged the progress made overall in 2021  as most of the actions planned for this year to address the oversight recommendations were completed (in particular those related to risk management  following the finalisation of the TARGET Services Risk Management Framework). The progress made in the implementation of the action plan to address the outstanding recommendations is constantly monitored by the ECB’s oversight function through regular exchanges between the two areas.In 2021 the operation function shared the information requested by the ECB’s oversight function to support the continuous conduct of the oversight assessments of operational incidents and changes to the system implemented with T2S Releases 5.0 in June 2021 and 5.2 in November 2021. Following the implementation of the T2S Penalty Mechanism with T2S Release 4.2 in November 2020  the operation function regularly informed the oversight function about the status of the dry run activities being conducted in the production environment before the entry into force of the settlement discipline regime in February 2022. Furthermore  the operation function provided the oversight function with aggregated settlement statistics and information on operational and financial performance  as well as on risk management  testing and migration activities  with a view to supporting the oversight function’s monitoring of T2S activities that are relevant from an oversight perspective. With regard to cyber resilience  in 2021 the oversight function progressed in the assessment of T2S against the Eurosystem cyber resilience oversight expectations (CROE)  and the operation function provided the necessary support to share the relevant documentation for the assessment and clarify specific aspects as required during regular exchanges. The oversight assessment report is scheduled to be finalised in March 2022 and the findings will then be shared with the operation function.4.3 External examinationT2S services are performed on a single technical platform integrated with central banks’ RTGS systems for all participating currencies. Under the T2S Framework Agreement  the Eurosystem and the CSDs have agreed that the performance of T2S services must be subject to technical and operational examinations performed by an external examiner. These examinations provide an independent  third-party assessment to all participating CSDs based on the established industry norm (ISAE 3402). The external examiner must be a reputable  internationally active accounting firm.The objective of these examinations is to provide the CSDs with reasonable assurance that (a) the organisation set up by the Eurosystem meets the obligations established in the Framework Agreement  and (b) the controls implemented by the Eurosystem are suitably designed  effective  and allow for efficient risk assessments to meet the security objectives.As required by its statute  the Eurosystem conducted a public tender in 2018 and appointed an external examiner for T2S. The third external examination of T2S services took place in 2021  which looked into T2S services in 2020. For the first time  the agreed additional checks for the control and management of cyber-related risks were included in the 2020 examination. Apart from some exceptions  the external examiner confirmed that the T2S controls examined were both suitably designed and implemented and had operated effectively throughout the examination period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. The findings and recommendations from the 2020 examination report will be addressed in a comprehensive action plan  together with the open actions from the 2019 action plan.The external examination for 2021 will be performed in 2022. These external examinations are a regular yearly exercise.4.4 Special reviewIn December 2020 the ECB appointed Deloitte GmbH to conduct an independent review of five major information technology-related incidents (not cyber incidents) which occurred in 2020  affecting payment transactions and securities processing of TARGET services. The review aimed to identify the root causes of the incidents  draw more general lessons and propose recommendations in the following six key areas: (i) change and release management  (ii) business continuity management  (iii) fail-over and recovery tests  (iv) communication protocols  (v) governance  and (vi) data centre and IT operations.On 28 July 2021 the ECB published Deloitte’s independent review. The report included a detailed description of the relevant incidents  the impact each had on TARGET services participants and the respective root causes. Deloitte also performed a thorough review of the procedures followed during the incidents  highlighting the weaknesses identified and issuing recommendations to address them.In its response  the Eurosystem accepted Deloitte’s general conclusions and recommendations  and committed to decisively address them.In the second half of 2021 the Eurosystem prepared an action plan to address the issues and recommendations raised by Deloitte in a timely manner. The action plan was further broadened to include recommendations issued by the Eurosystem oversight function and the Internal Audit Committee in relation to the TARGET services incidents that took place in 2020. In addition  for the recommendations on a specific TARGET service  the Eurosystem sought to design response actions that would apply holistically across the different TARGET services and the T2-T2S consolidated system due to go live in November 2022.Measures addressing several recommendations were agreed or implemented in 2021  while most of the remaining measures will be implemented in 2022. For some recommendations  market participants were also involved to ensure that their views were taken into account. For that purpose  dedicated sessions with the Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Payments (AMI-Pay)  the Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral (AMI-SeCo) and the T2S CSG were organised. These groups will also be regularly updated on the implementation of the action plan until completion.5 System evolution5.1 Regular software updatesT2S evolution reflects changes in business needs  regulatory factors and applicable market standards  along with some changes considered to aspects of system maintenance. The typical T2S annual release schedule includes one major release and one minor release  including change requests and production problems  as well as two production problem releases  which only include fixes for production problems.5.1.1 T2S releases in 2021 (R4.3  R5.0  R5.1 and R5.2)On 20 February 2021 T2S Release 4.3 was deployed to fix 12 known production problems.On 12 June 2021 the major T2S release  Release 5.0  went live with the implementation of 19 change requests (listed in Table 4 below)  four editorial change requests and 27 fixes for known production problems. These changes covered a wide range of functional areas  including enhancements to the penalty mechanism  the cash forecast  and the deployment of several change requests related to the T2-T2S consolidation project  including making the maintenance window optional on weekdays.A second release solely for production problems (Release 5.1) was deployed on 18 September 2021 to fix 16 production problems.The minor release  T2S Release 5.2  deployed on 20 November 2021  included 13 change requests (listed in Table 5 below)  one editorial change request and four fixes for production problems. The changes included enhancements to the T2S penalty mechanism (see Box 3) and to the T2S auto-collateralisation functionality  as well as additional tools for handling contingency situations.The numbers of change requests deployed and production problems resolved in 2021 are shown in Table 6.Table 4 T2S releases in 2021Table 5 Change requests implemented in T2S Release 5.0Table 6 Change requests implemented in T2S Release 5.25.1.2 Future system evolutionIn 2022 changes to T2S will be delivered in two releases – Release 6.0 in July 2022 and Release 6.2 in November 2022. The changes planned for July 2022 will include the introduction of the new interface ESMIG and other common components developed for the T2-T2S consolidation project (see Section 5.4)  as well as a new technology for the digital signature of manual actions in T2S (the non-repudiation of origin). In November 2022 the T2S release will coincide with the go-live of centralised liquidity management (CLM) and RTGS settlement services  and will also include enhancements to the management of reference data as well as changes in preparation of the future onboarding of end-investor markets on the platform.In addition to the major and minor releases in 2022  two releases solely for production problems will be deployed  on 18 February 2022 (release 5.3) and 17 September 2022 (Release 6.1) respectively.Although it is acknowledged that changes to the scope of the planned releases might be proposed in the future  the number of change requests planned for implementation in 2022 are shown in Table 7.Table 7 T2S releases in 2022* * Changes to the scope might be still possible.For further information  a full list of T2S change requests and the detailed contents of each release can be found on the ECB’s website:List of change requestsProject Managers Group – scope of T2S releasesBox 3CSDR and Penalty Mechanism In line with the CSD Regulation (CSDR)  settlement discipline regime  which intends to apply harmonised measures at the EU level to address settlement fails  the penalty mechanism was included in T2S. The T2S penalty mechanism offers the identification  calculation and reporting of cash penalties to T2S CSDs based on the analysis of failed transactions in T2S  as well as a set of operational tools deemed necessary in this context. The T2S Penalty Mechanism Dry Run  which took place between 13 September 2021 and 31 January 2022  was a core activity in the readiness preparation for the CSDR settlement discipline regime. It gave the T2S community the possibility to test the T2S Penalty Mechanism in production conditions and detected a number of issues that could be fixed ahead of the regulatory deadline for entry into force on 1 February 2022. Furthermore  the exercise was suspended between 30 November and 3 December in order to concentrate resources in finalising the work on already identified fixes (testing and deployment) to improve the overall performance and stability of the penalty mechanism process. The main issues detected were performance issues that had an impact on the duration of the respective events. Owing to minor changes and technical optimisations the overall performance was improved  and the process became more stable.5.2 Onboarding of new CSDsT2S has also been constantly evolving in terms of participants. The following CSDs are currently working towards joining the T2S platform.Euroclear Finland. The migration of Euroclear Finland to T2S is scheduled for 11 September 2023 as the migration planning was endorsed by the MIB in July 2021. As an end-investor market  Euroclear Finland is expected to bring more than 2 million securities accounts to T2S  a significant increase compared with today’s operations.The migration of Euroclear Finland to T2S is scheduled for 11 September 2023 as the migration planning was endorsed by the MIB in July 2021.

Euroclear Bank signed [16] the T2S Framework Agreement on 21 December 2021 and is set to join T2S governance in the first quarter of 2022. The migration will take place in stages to ensure a smooth transition that enables Euroclear Bank to start offering its clients settlement services in central bank money. The exact date of migration has yet to be officially announced by Euroclear Bank.Euroclear Bank signed the T2S Framework Agreement on 21 December 2021 and is set to join T2S governance in the first quarter of 2022.

The exact date of migration has yet to be officially announced by Euroclear Bank. Središnje klirinško depozitarno društvo (SKDD). Under Croatia’s national plan for the changeover from the Croatian kuna to the euro (planned for 1 January 2023)  the ECB team has been supporting Hrvatska narodna banka (the Croatian central bank) and SKDD with their preparations to join T2S. On 17 December 2021 SKDD delivered to the MIB its self-assessment for migrating to the T2S platform and the Eurosystem is expected to take a decision in the first half of 2022 and offer the T2S Framework Agreement to SKDD for signing.Under Croatia’s national plan for the changeover from the Croatian kuna to the euro (planned for 1 January 2023)  the ECB team has been supporting Hrvatska narodna banka (the Croatian central bank) and SKDD with their preparations to join T2S.

Bulgarian market. The ECB team has engaged in preliminary discussions with the private (Central Depository AD) and public (BNBGSSS) CSDs with regard to a possible T2S migration  in the context of Bulgaria potentially joining the euro in 2024. The self-assessment exercise and subsequent Eurosystem decision to offer the T2S Framework Agreement is expected to take place in 2022.5.3 Exit activities of current CSDsComplementary to the onboarding activities reported in the last chapter  in 2021 two CSDs initiated activities to exit from T2S.NCDCP. After NCDCP’s decision to stop operating as a CSD in December 2020 and submission of the termination notice to the ECB in June 2021  NCDPD successfully completed its exit activities on 12 November 2021.After NCDCP’s decision to stop operating as a CSD in December 2020 and submission of the termination notice to the ECB in June 2021  NCDPD successfully completed its exit activities on 12 November 2021. ID2S. Following the decision taken by the shareholders of ID2S on the 30 September 2021 to liquidate the company  ID2S requested the Eurosystem to initiate the exit process from T2S. In 2021 the process was initiated and the exit from the test environments was successfully conducted. The exit from the PROD environment is planned for February 2022.5.4 Consolidation of TARGET2 and T2SThe T2-T2S consolidation project will replace the current TARGET2 with a new RTGS system and apply a CLM tool across all TARGET services (T2  T2S  TIPS and ECMS).The functional specification phase of the project ended in 2020 following the publication of stable User Detailed Functional Specifications (UDFS) and User Handbooks (UHBs).In 2021 the focus was on the update of these user specifications and preparing them for testing by incorporating change requests approved after the publication of the UDFS and UHB books. UDFS v2.2 was published in April and the different books of UHB v2.0 were published between May and December 2021.The T2-T2S consolidation project has also published explainers and examples to help market participants better understand certain concepts by gathering information spread across different chapters or specifications books into single documents.The next versions of the user specifications are expected to be published throughout 2022 before the go-live.Migration  testing and readinessThe T2‑T2S consolidation project will go live in November 2022 following a “Big Bang” migration approach. This means that the current TARGET2 SSP will be discontinued at the time of the launch of the new T2 service. Transition in stages is not possible because the current SWIFT FIN Y-copy message flow used in TARGET2 cannot co-exist with the V-shape message flow that will be employed by the new T2 service. The V-shape set-up provides for network-agnostic connectivity and enhanced information security.Following the Eurosystem Acceptance Testing (EAT) conducted up until early 2021  for the rest of the year the focus was on user testing. Central Bank Testing started in June 2021 and User Testing (UT) began in December 2021.In 2022 testing will be stepped up and the migration process will be intensively practised in a set of go-live rehearsal tests  some of which will include the whole TARGET community. T2 participants will be invited to take part in dedicated testing campaigns  e.g. billing  ancillary system procedures. T2 participants will need to successfully perform the mandatory test cases in order to access the new platform.The Community Readiness Reporting process follows the Community Readiness Framework which is outlined in the Migration  Testing and Readiness Strategy document. The readiness of the community to migrate in November 2022 will continue to be assessed against these milestones throughout the year in quarterly cycles.Further details are available on the T2-T2S consolidation project page on the ECB’s website.5.5 Eurosystem Collateral Management SystemThe Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS) will be a single collateral management system used to manage eligible assets mobilised as collateral in Eurosystem monetary policy operations  replacing the current local collateral management systems.The ECMS will interact with the CLM module in T2 to ensure the settlement of payments stemming from monetary policy operations  corporate actions and fees  and to update the relevant credit line.In addition  the ECMS will interact with T2S for the settlement of securities and the management of the auto-collateralisation process. The resulting synergies are expected to benefit NCBs and all other ECMS players in their communities – counterparties  CSDs and tri-party agents (TPAs) – by contributing to the efficient exchange of securities  collateral and liquidity within the Eurosystem. It will be accessible via a single common interface across jurisdictions and facilitate the mobilisation of cross-border collateral.In 2021 the software development phase was concluded and EAT and preparations for UT started. Ensuring that ECMS stakeholders have the necessary documentation for their internal adaptations was a priority in 2021. The catalogue of ECMS messages and credit claim schemas have been published on the ECB website  as well as detailed information on the future interaction between counterparties and the ECMS (authentication of instructions  potential business configurations  the U2A and A2A roles that counterparties may hold  the business rules and status codes that will apply to them in the ECMS). Key information on readiness milestones was provided to external stakeholders  and work commenced on preparing the testing and migration activities. The series of workshops with CSDs and TPAs launched in 2020 was continued in 2021  to facilitate the understanding and effective preparation of these significant stakeholders for the upcoming changes that the ECMS will make to the way in which collateral is managed by the Eurosystem. The ECMS is scheduled to go live on 20 November 2023.Further details on the functions and features of the ECMS are available on the ECMS – professional use page on the ECB’s website.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.31,0.35,0.34,True,English,"['TARGET2-Securities Annual Report', 'Market Settlement Efficiency Workshop V', 'instant payment settlement service', 'monthly total T2S settlement volumes', 'real-time gross settlement system', 'new T2S statistical framework', 'fragmented securities settlement landscape', 'cross-border settlement procedures', 'different settlement practices', 'settlement discipline regime', 'central bank money', 'market infrastructure matters', 'commoditised securities settlement', 'total monthly traffic', 'central securities depositories', 'average monthly volumes', 'settlement efficiency Source', 'fourth full year', 'T2S settlement data', 'securities settlement platform', 'T2S adaptation plans', 'first migration wave', 'T2S migration period', 'Financial market infrastructures', 'late matching transactions', 'daily average value', 'daily average volume', 'TARGET2-Securities Annual Report', 'financial system', 'total value', 'single market', 'high volumes', 'migration waves', 'integrated platform', 'financial institutions', 'financial markets', 'securities transactions', 'T2S platform', 'functioning economy', 'The Eurosystem', 'monetary policy', 'single set', 'greater integration', 'Danish kroner', '11th edition', 'first edition', 'pivotal year', 'technical documentation', 'operational stability', 'main incidents', 'previous year', 'depth understanding', 'core content', 'three boxes', 'depth information', 'hold functionality', 'CSD Regulation', 'minor decrease', '257 operating days', '258 operating days', 'COVID-19) pandemic', 'T2S traffic', 'T2S.

(“ClearStream” or the ""Company"") (TSX: CSM) today announced its results for the three months ended March 31  2022. All amounts are in Canadian dollars and expressed in thousands of dollars unless otherwise noted.“EBITDAS” and “Adjusted EBITDAS” are not standard measures under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of these items and limitations of their use.“Activity levels in the first quarter were strong as revenues grew by 8% from the fourth quarter of 2021 and represented the highest level for quarterly revenue since the first quarter of 2020  which was largely unaffected by the pandemic. We are actively working with our customers and suppliers to manage both the inflationary and labour supply pressures in the current market ” said Barry Card  Interim Chief Executive Officer.“The pricing for commodities in the end markets we serve continues to be strong and is anticipated to remain that way throughout the year. This is providing our customers with the confidence to increase their spending on both maintenance and capital projects  as evidenced by the 17 turnaround projects that we have scheduled for the second quarter. We are proud to partner with our customers on these important projects to build and maintain the integrity of their production infrastructure ” added Mr. Card.HIGHLIGHTSRevenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $109.8 million  representing an increase of $27.6 million or 33.6% from Q1 2021.Gross profit for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $9.7 million  representing an increase of $1.7 million or 21.1% from Q1 2021.Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 8.9%  as compared to 9.8% in Q1 2021.Adjusted EBITDAS for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $3.0 million  representing an increase of $0.8 million or 34.9% from Q1 2021.Adjusted EBITDAS margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 2.7%  unchanged from Q1 2021.Selling  general and administrative expenses for three months ended March 31  2022 were $8.1 million  representing an increase of $2.1 million or 34.9% from Q1 2021. Consistent with the last three quarters in 2021  the increase is largely due to investments being made to support our enterprise systems and digital strategy to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness. As well our business has recovered and stabilized in 2022  therefore  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work in 2022.Liquidity remained strong with total cash and available credit facilities of $37.4 million at March 31  2022  as compared to $33.7 million at December 31  2021.New project awards and contract renewals were $96 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 and $36 million for the month of April 2022. Approximately 80% of that work is expected to be completed in 2022.Story continuesMaintenance and Construction ServicesRevenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $99.4 million  representing an increase of 34.3% or $25.4 million from Q1 2021 and $5.4 million or 5.7% from Q4 2021. The increase was due to our customers increasing their spending on both maintenance and capital projects. We expect activity levels to remain high in the second quarter with 17 turnaround projects scheduled. We continue to focus on consolidating various scopes of work with existing or new customers by bundling our services in order to enable more efficient execution and lower costs for our customers on each work site.Wear Technology Overlay ServicesRevenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $12.3 million  representing an increase of 43.0% or $3.7 million from Q1 2021 and 36.7% or $3.3 million from Q4 2021. Gross profit margin was lower as we completed more fabrication work  which has a lower margin than the specialty weld overlay products that we market under the brand name AssetArmor™. With the continued rise in global energy demand and commodity prices  we are seeing our customers in the oil sands operating at full production levels  which has started to increase the demand for our AssetArmor™ products.Environmental ServicesWe continue to grow our capabilities by adding staff within our professional services. During the first quarter  we completed a large decommissioning project. We are seeing our customers continue to allocate expenditures for the closure  reclamation and remediation of oil and gas wells  pipelines and facilities in Western Canada. We expect this trend to continue with our clients regardless of the expiry of the government funded programs at the end of 2022 given the increased focus on ESG (environmental  social and governance) matters.FIRST QUARTER 2022 FINANCIAL RESULTS($ millions  except per share amounts)Three months ended March 31  2022 2021 % Change Revenue Maintenance and Construction Services 99.4 74.0 34.3 % Wear Technology Overlay Services 12.3 8.6 44.1 % Total 109.8 82.2 33.6 % Gross Profit Maintenance and Construction Services 7.4 5.9 24.9 % Wear Technology Overlay Services 2.4 2.2 10.6 % Total 9.7 8.0 21.1 % Gross Profit Margin (% of revenue) Maintenance and Construction Services 7.4 % 8.0 % (0.6 )% Wear Technology Overlay Services 19.3 % 25.1 % (5.8 )% Total 8.9 % 9.8 % (0.9 )%Selling  general and administrative expenses 8.1 6.0 34.9 % % of revenue 7.3 % 7.3 % — % Adjusted EBITDAS * Maintenance and Construction Services 7.2 5.8 24.5 % Wear Technology Overlay Services 2.3 2.1 10.9 % Corporate (6.5 ) (5.7 ) (15.4 )% Total 3.0 2.2 34.9 % % of revenue 2.7 % 2.7 % — % Loss from continuing operations (7.8 ) (7.6 ) 2.8 % Net loss per share (dollars) from continuing operations (basic and diluted) (0.07 ) (0.07 ) — %* “Adjusted EBITDAS” is not a standard measure under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of this measure and limitations of its use.Revenue for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $109 848 compared to $82 204 for the three months ended March 31  2021  representing an increase of 33.6%. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong market momentum in the first quarter in 2022  with an increase in activity across all areas of the business.Gross profit for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $9 740 compared to $8 045 for the three months ended March 31  2021  representing an increase of 21.1%. Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 8.9% compared to 9.8% for the three months ended March 31  2021. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven by a few factors including a change in the mix of services and products provided with lower gross profit margins as well as inflationary pressures on labour  equipment and materials. The recovery of these increases in costs are being built into contracts collaboratively with our customers on a go forward basis.Selling  general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $8 052  in comparison to $5 969 for the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 34.9%. As a percentage of revenue  SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31  2022 were 7.3%  unchanged from the same period in 2021. The increase in SG&A expenses is largely due to the ongoing investments being made to support the Company's enterprise systems and digital strategy. These investments  which will extend throughout 2022  are expected to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness. In addition  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work anticipated in 2022.For the three months ended March 31  2022  Adjusted EBITDAS was $3 006 compared to $2 229 for the three months ended March 31  2021. As a percentage of revenue  Adjusted EBITDAS was 2.7% for the three months ended March 31  2022 unchanged from the same period in 2021.Income from government subsidies includes the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (""CERS"") received from the Government of Canada to assist with the payment of employee wages and rent as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CEWS and CERS programs ended in 2021. Therefore  the Company did not have any income from government subsidies during the three months ended March 31  2022  compared to$6 755 for the three months ended March 31  2021.Loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $7 783 compared to loss of $7 569 for the three months ended March 31  2021. The loss variance was driven by the reduction in government subsidies in 2022  an increase in SG&A expenses and an increase in restructuring expenses  partially offset by an increase in gross profit and the impairment of right-of-use assets recognized in 2021.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESClearStream has an asset-based lending facility (the “ABL Facility”) comprised of (i) a revolving credit facility providing for maximum borrowings up to $15.0 million (the “Revolving Facility”) and (ii) a term loan facility providing for maximum borrowings of up to $40.5 million (the “Term Loan Facility”).

ClearStream established a new $25 million asset-based revolving credit facility with a three-year term (the “New ABL Facility”) to replace the Revolving Facility.The New ABL Facility provides for maximum borrowings up to $25 million with a Canadian chartered bank. The amount available under the New ABL Facility will vary from time to time based on the borrowing base determined with reference to the accounts receivable and inventories of ClearStream. The obligations under the New ABL Facility are secured by  among other things  a first ranking lien on all of the existing and after acquired accounts receivable and inventories of the Company and the other guarantors  being certain of the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries. The maturity date of the New ABL Facility is April 14  2025. The interest rate on the New ABL Facility is prime plus 2.5%.The financial covenants applicable under the New ABL Facility are:The Company must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.00:1.00 for each twelve month period calculated and tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter; and The Company must not expend or become obligated for any capital expenditures in an aggregate amount exceeding $10 million during any fiscal year.As part of the Refinancing  the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility was extended from September 30  2022 to October 14  2025 and the interest rate was changed to a fixed rate of 8.0%.The Company anticipates that its liquidity (cash on hand and available credit facilities) and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short-term contractual obligations and maintain compliance with its financial covenants through March 31  2023.As at March 31  2022  issued and outstanding share capital included 110 001 239 common shares  127 732 Series 1 preferred shares  and 40 111 Series 2 preferred shares.The Series 1 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $127.732 million) are convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a price of $0.35/share and the Series 2 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $40.111 million) are convertible into common shares at a price of $0.10/share.The Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares have a 10% fixed cumulative preferential cash dividend payable when the Company has sufficient monies to be able to do so  including under the provisions of applicable law and contracts affecting the Company.

These factors should not be considered exhaustive. Risks and uncertainties about ClearStream’s business are more fully discussed in ClearStream’s disclosure materials  including its annual information form and management’s discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results  filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada and available at www.sedar.com. In formulating the forward-looking information  management has assumed that business and economic conditions affecting ClearStream will continue substantially in the ordinary course  including  without limitation  with respect to general levels of economic activity  regulations  taxes and interest rates. Although the forward-looking information is based on what management of ClearStream consider to be reasonable assumptions based on information currently available to it  there can be no assurance that actual events or results will be consistent with this forward-looking information  and management’s assumptions may prove to be incorrect.This forward-looking information is made as of the date of this press release  and ClearStream does not assume any obligation to update or revise it to reflect new events or circumstances except as required by law.

Forward-looking information is provided for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.Advisory regarding Non-Standard MeasuresThe terms ‘‘EBITDAS’’ and “Adjusted EBITDAS” (collectively  the ‘‘Non-standard measures’’) are financial measures used in this press release that are not standard measures under IFRS. ClearStream’s method of calculating the Non-Standard Measures may differ from the methods used by other issuers. Therefore  ClearStream’s Non-Standard Measures  as presented may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.EBITDAS refers to net earnings determined in accordance with IFRS  before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  income tax expense (recovery)  and other long-term incentive plan expenses. EBITDAS is used by management and the directors of ClearStream as well as many investors to determine the ability of an issuer to generate cash from operations. Management also uses EBITDAS to monitor the performance of ClearStream’s reportable segments and believes that in addition to net income or loss and cash provided by operating activities  EBITDAS is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures and income taxes. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31  2022.Adjusted EBITDAS refers to EBITDAS excluding impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring expense  gain (loss) on sale of property  plant and equipment  recovery of contingent consideration liability  one time incurred expenses  impairment of right-of-use assets  and government subsidies. ClearStream has used Adjusted EBITDAS as the basis for the analysis of its past operating financial performance. Adjusted EBITDAS is a measure that management believes (i) is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures  and income taxes  and (ii) facilitates the comparability of the results of historical periods and the analysis of its operating financial performance which may be useful to investors. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31  2022.Investors are cautioned that the Non-Standard Measures are not alternatives to measures under IFRS and should not  on their own  be construed as an indicator of performance or cash flows  a measure of liquidity or as a measure of actual return on the shares. These Non-Standard Measures should only be used with reference to ClearStream’s consolidated interim and annual financial statements available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on ClearStream’s website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca.",neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,mixed,0.43,0.3,0.27,True,English,"['First Quarter 2022 Financial Results', 'ClearStream', 'ClearStream Energy Services Inc.

We are actively working with our customers and suppliers to manage both the inflationary and labour supply pressures in the current market ” said Barry Card  Interim Chief Executive Officer. “The pricing for commodities in the end markets we serve continues to be strong and is anticipated to remain that way throughout the year. This is providing our customers with the confidence to increase their spending on both maintenance and capital projects  as evidenced by the 17 turnaround projects that we have scheduled for the second quarter. We are proud to partner with our customers on these important projects to build and maintain the integrity of their production infrastructure ” added Mr. Card.Advertisement 3 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet  but your article continues below.Article content HIGHLIGHTS Revenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $109.8 million  representing an increase of $27.6 million or 33.6% from Q1 2021.Gross profit for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $9.7 million  representing an increase of $1.7 million or 21.1% from Q1 2021.Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 8.9%  as compared to 9.8% in Q1 2021.Adjusted EBITDAS for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $3.0 million  representing an increase of $0.8 million or 34.9% from Q1 2021.Adjusted EBITDAS margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 2.7%  unchanged from Q1 2021.Selling  general and administrative expenses for three months ended March 31  2022 were $8.1 million  representing an increase of $2.1 million or 34.9% from Q1 2021. Consistent with the last three quarters in 2021  the increase is largely due to investments being made to support our enterprise systems and digital strategy to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness. As well our business has recovered and stabilized in 2022  therefore  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work in 2022.Liquidity remained strong with total cash and available credit facilities of $37.4 million at March 31  2022  as compared to $33.7 million at December 31  2021.New project awards and contract renewals were $96 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 and $36 million for the month of April 2022. Approximately 80% of that work is expected to be completed in 2022.Advertisement 4 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet  but your article continues below.Article content Maintenance and Construction Services Revenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $99.4 million  representing an increase of 34.3% or $25.4 million from Q1 2021 and $5.4 million or 5.7% from Q4 2021. The increase was due to our customers increasing their spending on both maintenance and capital projects. We expect activity levels to remain high in the second quarter with 17 turnaround projects scheduled. We continue to focus on consolidating various scopes of work with existing or new customers by bundling our services in order to enable more efficient execution and lower costs for our customers on each work site. Wear Technology Overlay Services Revenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $12.3 million  representing an increase of 43.0% or $3.7 million from Q1 2021 and 36.7% or $3.3 million from Q4 2021. Gross profit margin was lower as we completed more fabrication work  which has a lower margin than the specialty weld overlay products that we market under the brand name AssetArmor™. With the continued rise in global energy demand and commodity prices  we are seeing our customers in the oil sands operating at full production levels  which has started to increase the demand for our AssetArmor™ products.Advertisement 5 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet  but your article continues below.Article content Environmental Services We continue to grow our capabilities by adding staff within our professional services. During the first quarter  we completed a large decommissioning project. We are seeing our customers continue to allocate expenditures for the closure  reclamation and remediation of oil and gas wells  pipelines and facilities in Western Canada. We expect this trend to continue with our clients regardless of the expiry of the government funded programs at the end of 2022 given the increased focus on ESG (environmental  social and governance) matters.

A number of factors could cause actual events or results to differ materially from the events and results discussed in the forward-looking information including  but not limited to  the success of our response to the COVID-19 global pandemic  compliance with debt covenants  access to credit facilities and other sources of capital for working capital requirements and capital expenditure needs  availability of labour  dependence on key personnel  economic conditions  commodity prices  interest rates  regulatory change  weather and risks related to the integration of acquired businesses. These factors should not be considered exhaustive. Risks and uncertainties about ClearStream’s business are more fully discussed in ClearStream’s disclosure materials  including its annual information form and management’s discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results  filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada and available at www.sedar.com. In formulating the forward-looking information  management has assumed that business and economic conditions affecting ClearStream will continue substantially in the ordinary course  including  without limitation  with respect to general levels of economic activity  regulations  taxes and interest rates. Although the forward-looking information is based on what management of ClearStream consider to be reasonable assumptions based on information currently available to it  there can be no assurance that actual events or results will be consistent with this forward-looking information  and management’s assumptions may prove to be incorrect.Advertisement 18 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet  but your article continues below.Article content This forward-looking information is made as of the date of this press release  and ClearStream does not assume any obligation to update or revise it to reflect new events or circumstances except as required by law. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is provided for the purpose of providing information about management’s current expectations and plans relating to the future. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes. Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures The terms ‘‘EBITDAS’’ and “Adjusted EBITDAS” (collectively  the ‘‘Non-standard measures’’) are financial measures used in this press release that are not standard measures under IFRS. ClearStream’s method of calculating the Non-Standard Measures may differ from the methods used by other issuers. Therefore  ClearStream’s Non-Standard Measures  as presented may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.Advertisement 19 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet  but your article continues below.Article content EBITDAS refers to net earnings determined in accordance with IFRS  before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  income tax expense (recovery)  and other long-term incentive plan expenses. EBITDAS is used by management and the directors of ClearStream as well as many investors to determine the ability of an issuer to generate cash from operations. Management also uses EBITDAS to monitor the performance of ClearStream’s reportable segments and believes that in addition to net income or loss and cash provided by operating activities  EBITDAS is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures and income taxes. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDAS in its management’s discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31  2022.Advertisement 20 Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet  but your article continues below.Article content Adjusted EBITDAS refers to EBITDAS excluding impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring expense  gain (loss) on sale of property  plant and equipment  recovery of contingent consideration liability  one time incurred expenses  impairment of right-of-use assets  and government subsidies. ClearStream has used Adjusted EBITDAS as the basis for the analysis of its past operating financial performance. Adjusted EBITDAS is a measure that management believes (i) is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures  and income taxes  and (ii) facilitates the comparability of the results of historical periods and the analysis of its operating financial performance which may be useful to investors. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDAS in its management’s discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31  2022. Investors are cautioned that the Non-Standard Measures are not alternatives to measures under IFRS and should not  on their own  be construed as an indicator of performance or cash flows  a measure of liquidity or as a measure of actual return on the shares. These Non-Standard Measures should only be used with reference to ClearStream’s consolidated interim and annual financial statements available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on ClearStream’s website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca.Share this article in your social networkAdvertisement Story continues below This advertisement has not loaded yet  but your article continues below.Financial Post Top Stories Sign up to receive the daily top stories from the Financial Post  a division of Postmedia Network Inc.

This description supplements  and should be read together with  the description of the general terms and provisions of the junior subordinated notes set forth in the accompanying Prospectus under the caption “Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes.” The following description does not purport to be complete and is subject to  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  the description in the accompanying Prospectus and the Subordinated Note Indenture (as defined below).GeneralEach series of Junior Subordinated Notes is a series of debt securities under the Subordinated Note Indenture dated as of October 1  2015  as heretofore supplemented and amended and as further supplemented and amended from time to time (the “Subordinated Note Indenture”)  between the Company and Computershare Trust Company  N.A.  as successor trustee (the “Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee”). The Company may issue an unlimited amount of other securities under the Subordinated Note Indenture which are on parity with the Junior Subordinated Notes.The Junior Subordinated Notes are the Company’s unsecured and subordinated obligations and are subordinated to all of the Company’s “Senior Indebtedness” (as defined under “Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes—Subordination” in the accompanying Prospectus). Additional information about the Company’s current outstanding indebtedness and the relative priorities of the Company’s indebtedness is described below under “—Ranking; Subordination.”The Junior Subordinated Notes will be initially represented by one or more fully registered global securities (the “Global Securities”) deposited with the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee  as custodian for DTC  as depository  and registered in the name of DTC or DTC’s nominee. A beneficial interest in a Global Security will be shown on  and transfers or exchanges thereof will be effected only through  records maintained by DTC and its participants  as described below under “—Book-Entry Issuance—The Depository Trust Company.” The authorized denominations of the Junior Subordinated Notes will be $1 000 and any largerS-7amount that is an integral multiple of $1 000. Except in certain circumstances described below  the Junior Subordinated Notes that are issued as Global Securities will not be exchangeable for Junior Subordinated Notes in definitive certificated form.The Junior Subordinated Notes will not be subject to a sinking fund provision.The entire principal amount of the Series 2019A JSNs will mature and become due and payable  together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon  on August 1  2024. The entire principal amount of the Series 2019B JSNs will mature and become due and payable  together with any accrued and unpaid interest thereon  on August 1  2027. The Subordinated Note Indenture does not contain any financial covenants or restrict the Company from paying dividends  making investments  incurring indebtedness or repurchasing the Company’s securities. Except for the covenants described under “Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes—Consolidation  Merger and Sale” in the accompanying Prospectus  the Subordinated Note Indenture does not contain provisions that afford holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes protection in the event the Company is involved in a highly leveraged transaction or other similar transaction that may adversely affect such holders. The Subordinated Note Indenture does not limit the Company’s ability to issue or incur other debt or issue preferred stock.Each series of Junior Subordinated Notes is limited in an aggregate principal amount to $862 500 000.The Company will not pay any additional amounts to holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes in respect of any tax  assessment or governmental charge.Ranking; SubordinationThe Company’s obligations under the Junior Subordinated Notes are unsecured and rank junior in right of payment to all of the Company’s “Senior Indebtedness ” whether presently existing or from time to time hereafter incurred  created  assumed or existing  as defined under “Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes—Subordination” in the accompanying Prospectus. As of March 31  2022  the Senior Indebtedness of the Company  on an unconsolidated basis  aggregated approximately $8.8 billion .Since the Company is a holding company  its right and  hence  the right of its creditors (including holders of the Junior Subordinated Notes) to participate in any distribution of the assets of any subsidiary of the Company  whether upon liquidation  reorganization or otherwise  is structurally subordinated to claims of creditors and preferred stockholders of each subsidiary. As of March 31  2022  on a consolidated basis  the Company had approximately $52.2 billion of outstanding long-term debt (including securities due within one year)  of which approximately $35.4 billion was long-term debt (including securities due within one year) of the Company’s subsidiaries. In addition  as of March 31  2022  the Company had approximately $2.3 billion of short-term notes payable  $1.6 billion of which was short-term notes payable of the Company’s subsidiaries. In addition  as of March 31  2022  the Company’s subsidiaries had approximately $0.3 billion of preferred stock outstanding.There are no terms of the Junior Subordinated Notes that limit the Company’s ability to incur additional Senior Indebtedness or that limit its subsidiaries’ ability to incur additional debt or other liabilities or issue preferred and preference stock.InterestInterest on the Junior Subordinated Notes will be payable semi-annually in arrears on February 1 and August 1 (each  an “Interest Payment Date”). The first interest payment following this remarketing will be made on August 1  2022 and will include interest accrued (i) at an annual rate of 2.70% from  and including  May 1  2022 to  but excluding May   2022  the expected date of delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes  and (ii) (A) at an annual rate of % from  and including  May   2022 to  but excluding  August 1  2022  in the case of the Series 2019A JSNs  and (B) at an annual rate of % from  and including  May   2022 to  but excluding  August 1  2022  in the case of the Series 2019B JSNs. On and after May   2022  the Series 2019A JSNs will bear interest at % per year and the Series 2019B JSNs will bear interest at % per year.Subject to certain exceptions  the Subordinated Note Indenture provides for the payment of interest on an Interest Payment Date only to persons in whose names the Junior Subordinated Notes are registered at the close of business on the Record Date. The “Record Date” means the 15th day of the calendar month immediately preceding the calendar month in which the applicable Interest Payment Date falls (or  if such day is not a Business Day  the next preceding Business Day); provided that if any of the Junior Subordinated Notes are held by a securities depository in book-entry form  the Record Date for the Junior Subordinated Notes will be the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the applicable Interest Payment Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing  any interest payable at maturity will be paid to the person to whom principal is payable. Interest will be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months  and with respect to any period less than a full calendar month  on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed per 30-day month.S-8If any Interest Payment Date or the maturity date is not a Business Day  then the applicable payment will be made on the next succeeding day that is a Business Day and no interest will accrue or be paid in respect of such delay. A “Business Day” means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday or a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York  New York or Hartford  Connecticut are authorized or required by law or executive order to close or a day on which the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee’s corporate trust office is closed for business.RedemptionThe Junior Subordinated Notes may not be redeemed prior to maturity.Events of DefaultThe events of default and related provisions set forth under “Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes — Events of Default” in the accompanying Prospectus will apply to the Junior Subordinated Notes.Modification of IndentureIn addition to the purposes set forth under “Description of the Junior Subordinated Notes—Modification” in the accompanying Prospectus  the Company and the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee may from time to time  without the consent of any holders of Junior Subordinated Notes  amend and/or supplement the Subordinated Note Indenture for the following purposes:• following the Purchase Contract settlement date (August 1  2022)  to supplement any of the provisions of the Junior Subordinated Notes to such extent as shall be necessary to permit or facilitate the defeasance and discharge of the Junior Subordinated Notes pursuant to the Subordinated Note Indenture  provided that any such action will not adversely affect the interests of any holder of any Junior Subordinated Note in any material respect;• to set forth the terms of any series of Junior Subordinated Notes following a successful remarketing to incorporate the reset interest rate  incorporate semi-annual interest payment dates  to eliminate the optional redemption provision in the Series 2019B JSNs and to eliminate the interest deferral provisions in the Junior Subordinated Notes; and• to conform the terms of the Subordinated Note Indenture and the Junior Subordinated Notes to the descriptions thereof contained in the “Description of the Remarketable Junior Subordinated Notes ” “Description of the Equity Units ” “Description of the Purchase Contracts” and “Certain Provisions of the Purchase Contract and Pledge Agreement” sections in the preliminary prospectus supplement for the Equity Units  dated August 12  2019  as supplemented and/or amended by the related pricing term sheet.Agreement by Holders to Certain Tax TreatmentEach holder of the Junior Subordinated Notes will  by accepting the Junior Subordinated Notes or a beneficial interest therein  be deemed to have agreed that the holder will treat the Junior Subordinated Notes as indebtedness for United States federal  state and local tax purposes.Book-Entry Issuance—The Depository Trust CompanyEach series of Junior Subordinated Notes will be evidenced by one or more global notes registered in the name of DTC’s nominee  Cede & Co.  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. Such global notes will be deposited with the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee as custodian for DTC.DTC advises that it is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law  a “banking organization” within the meaning of the New York Banking Law  a member of the Federal Reserve System  a “clearing corporation” within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code and a “clearing agency” registered pursuant to the provisions of Section 17A of the 1934 Act. DTC holds securities that its participants (“Direct Participants”) deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the post-trade settlement among Direct Participants of sales and other securities transactions in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry transfers and pledges between participants’ accounts  thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct Participants include United States and Non-United States securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies  clearing corporations and certain other organizations. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation (“DTCC”). DTCC is the holding company for DTC  National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation  all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC isS-9owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to the DTC system is also available to others  including securities brokers and dealers  banks  trust companies and clearing corporations that clear transactions through or maintain a custodial relationship with a Direct Participant  either directly or indirectly (“Indirect Participants”). The rules applicable to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC.Purchases of the Junior Subordinated Notes under the DTC system must be made by or through Direct Participants  which will receive a credit for the Junior Subordinated Notes on DTC’s records. The ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each Junior Subordinated Note (“Beneficial Owner”) is in turn to be recorded on the Direct and Indirect Participants’ records. Beneficial Owners will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchases  but Beneficial Owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transactions  as well as periodic statements of their holdings  from the Direct or Indirect Participant through which they purchased the Junior Subordinated Notes. Transfers of ownership interests on the Junior Subordinated Notes are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of Direct and Indirect Participants acting on behalf of Beneficial Owners. Beneficial Owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in Junior Subordinated Notes  except in the event that use of the book-entry system for the Junior Subordinated Notes is discontinued. To facilitate subsequent transfers  all Junior Subordinated Notes deposited by Direct Participants with DTC are registered in the name of DTC’s nominee  Cede & Co.  or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of DTC. The deposit of the Junior Subordinated Notes with DTC and their registration in the name of Cede & Co. or such other nominee do not effect any change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual Beneficial Owners of the Junior Subordinated Notes; DTC’s records reflect only the identity of the Direct Participants to whose accounts the Junior Subordinated Notes are credited  which may or may not be the Beneficial Owners. The Direct and Indirect participants will remain responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers.Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to Direct Participants  by Direct Participants to Indirect Participants and by Direct Participants and Indirect Participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by arrangements among them  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Notices will be sent to DTC.Neither DTC nor Cede & Co. (nor such other DTC nominee) will consent or vote with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes unless authorized by a Direct Participant in accordance with DTC’s procedures. Under its usual procedures  DTC mails an omnibus proxy to the Company as soon as possible after the Record Date. The omnibus proxy assigns the voting or consenting rights of Cede & Co. to those Direct Participants to whose accounts the Junior Subordinated Notes are credited on the Record Date. The Company believes that these arrangements will enable the Beneficial Owners to exercise rights equivalent in substance to the rights that can be directly exercised by a registered holder of the Junior Subordinated Notes.Payments of principal and interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes will be made to Cede & Co. (or such other nominee of DTC). DTC’s practice is to credit Direct Participants’ accounts upon DTC’s receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from the Company or the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee on the payable date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on DTC’s records. Payments by participants to Beneficial Owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices and will be the responsibility of each participant and not of DTC  the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee or the Company  subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal and interest to Cede & Co. (or other such nominee of DTC) is the Company’s responsibility. Disbursement of such payments to Direct Participants will be the responsibility of DTC  and disbursement of such payments to the Beneficial Owners is the responsibility of Direct Participants and Indirect Participants.In a few special situations described below  a book-entry security representing the Company’s securities will terminate and interests in it will be exchanged for physical certificates representing the securities. After that exchange  the choice of whether to hold securities directly or in street name will be up to each Beneficial Owner. Each Beneficial Owner must consult its bank  broker or other financial institution to find out how to have its interests in the securities transferred to its name  so that it will be a direct holder.The special situations for termination of a Global Security representing the Junior Subordinated Notes are:• DTC notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as depository for that Global Security or DTC ceases to be a “clearing agency” registered under the 1934 Act and the Company is unable to find a qualified replacement for DTC within 90 days; or• any event of default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes has occurred and is continuing  or any other event has occurred and is continuing  which after notice or lapse of time  would become an event of default with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes  and any Beneficial Owner requests that its beneficial interest be exchanged for a physical certificate.S-10DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depository with respect to the Junior Subordinated Notes at any time by giving the Company or the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee reasonable notice. In the event no successor securities depository is obtained  certificates for the Junior Subordinated Notes will be printed and delivered.The information in this section concerning DTC’s book-entry system has been obtained from sources that the Company believes to be reliable  but neither the Company nor any remarketing agent takes any responsibility for the accuracy thereof.The Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor  determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under the Subordinated Note Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Junior Subordinated Note (including any transfers between or among Direct Participants of DTC or Beneficial Owners of interests in any Junior Subordinated Note) other than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by  and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of  the Subordinated Note Indenture  and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements hereof.Neither the Subordinated Note Indenture Trustee nor any agent shall have any responsibility or liability for any actions taken or not taken by DTC.Global Clearance and Settlement ProceduresSecondary market trading between Clearstream Banking  société anonyme   Luxembourg (“Clearstream”) participants and/or Euroclear system participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and the Euroclear system  as applicable. Cross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC  on the one hand  and directly or indirectly through Clearstream participants or Euroclear system participants  on the other  will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its United States depositary; however  such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will  if the transaction meets its settlement requirements  deliver instructions to its United States depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving securities in DTC  and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream participants and Euroclear system participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective United States depositaries. Because of time-zone differences  credits of Junior Subordinated Notes received in Clearstream or the Euroclear system as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the business day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or any transactions in such Junior Subordinated Notes settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Euroclear system participant or Clearstream participant on such business day. Cash received in Clearstream or the Euroclear system as a result of sales of the Junior Subordinated Notes by or through a Clearstream participant or a Euroclear system participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or the Euroclear system cash account only as of the business day following settlement in DTC.MATERIAL UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONSThe following is a general discussion of the material United States federal income tax considerations relevant to the acquisition  ownership and disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes  and insofar as it relates to matters of United States federal income tax law and regulations or legal conclusions with respect thereto  constitutes the opinion of the Company’s tax counsel  Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP. Except where noted  this discussion only applies to Junior Subordinated Notes that are held as capital assets by holders who purchase the Junior Subordinated Notes in the remarketing for cash at the offering price. This discussion does not describe all of the material tax considerations that may be relevant to holders in light of their particular circumstances or to holders subject to special rules  such as certain financial institutions  regulated investment companies  real estate investment trusts  banks  insurance companies  tax-exempt entities  certain former citizens or residents of the United States  dealers in securities  traders in securities that elect to use a mark-to-market method of accounting  partnerships and other pass-through entities (and persons holding the Junior Subordinated Notes through a partnership or other pass-through entity)  holders whose functional currency is not the United States dollar  passive foreign investment companies  controlled foreign corporations and corporations that accumulate earnings to avoid United States federal income tax or persons holding the Junior Subordinated Notes as part of a hedge  straddle or other integrated transaction. In addition  this discussion does not address the effect of any state  local  foreign or other tax laws or any United States federal estate  gift or alternative minimum tax considerations. This discussion is based upon the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the “Code”)  administrative pronouncements  judicial decisions and final  temporary and proposed Treasury regulations  all as in effect on the date hereof  and all of which are subject to change or differingS-11interpretations  possibly with retroactive effect  so as to result in United States federal income tax consequences different from those discussed below.As used in this Prospectus Supplement  the term “United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Junior Subordinated Note that is for United States federal income tax purposes:• an individual citizen or resident of the United States;• a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States  any state thereof or the District of Columbia;• an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; or• a trust (i) with respect to which a court within the United States is able to exercise primary supervision over its administration and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all of its substantial decisions or (ii) that was in existence on August 20  1996  and has a valid election in effect under applicable Treasury regulations to be treated as a domestic trust.The term “Non-United States Holder” means a beneficial owner of a Junior Subordinated Note that is neither a United States Holder nor a partnership (or other pass-through entity).If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership) holds Junior Subordinated Notes  the tax treatment of the partnership and its partners will generally depend on the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership and its partners. If a holder of Junior Subordinated Notes is a partnership or a partner in such a partnership  such holder should consult with its own tax advisors regarding the United States federal income tax considerations of the purchase  ownership and disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes.Persons considering purchasing the Junior Subordinated Notes should consult their own tax advisors regarding the United States federal income tax considerations relating to the purchase  ownership and disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes in light of their particular circumstances  as well as the effect of any state  local  foreign or other tax laws.The Company has treated and will continue to treat  and  by purchasing the Junior Subordinated Notes  each holder agrees to treat  the Junior Subordinated Notes as indebtedness for United States federal income tax purposes. The remainder of this discussion assumes that the Junior Subordinated Notes will be so treated.United States HoldersTreatment of the Junior Subordinated Notes and Interest ThereonFrom their issuance  the Company has treated the Junior Subordinated Notes as “variable rate debt instruments” that are subject to applicable United States Treasury regulations that apply to “reset bonds ” and stated interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes as taxable to a United States Holder as ordinary interest income at the time such interest is received or accrued  in accordance with such United States Holder’s regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.Upon the remarketing of the Junior Subordinated Notes  the Junior Subordinated Notes will no longer be linked to an agreement for the purchase of the Company’s common stock. Each of the remarketed Junior Subordinated Notes will bear interest at a fixed rate. The Series 2019A JSNs and the Series 2019B JSNs have fixed maturity dates of August 1  2024  and August 1  2027  respectively. There are no contingent interest payments or terms. Accordingly  the remarketed Junior Subordinated Notes will be treated as debt for United States federal income tax purposes and stated interest payments on the remarketed Junior Subordinated Notes generally will be taxable to a United States Holder as ordinary income at the time received or accrued  in accordance with the United States Holder’s regular method of accounting for United States federal income tax purposes.Pre-Acquisition Accrued InterestThe purchase price of the Junior Subordinated Notes sold in this remarketing will include an amount of interest attributable to interest accrued for the period prior to this remarketing. Under general United States federal income tax accounting principles  the portion of the first interest payment on the Junior Subordinated Notes equal to the amount of such pre-acquisition accrued interest should be treated as a return of such pre-acquisition accrued interest  rather than as an amount payable on the Junior SubordinatedS-12Notes. Accordingly  the portion of the first interest payment on the Junior Subordinated Notes equal to the pre-acquisition accrued interest should not be treated as taxable interest income and a holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Junior Subordinated Notes should be reduced by a corresponding amount. This discussion assumes that this treatment is correct  and references in this discussion to stated interest do not include such portion of the first interest payment equal to the pre-acquisition accrued interest. United States Holders are urged to consult with their own tax advisors concerning the particular tax treatment to them of any pre-acquisition accrued interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes.Bond PremiumIf the amount paid by a United States Holder for a Junior Subordinated Note pursuant to this offering (excluding any amount attributable to pre-acquisition accrued interest) is greater than its principal amount  such United States Holder will generally be considered to have purchased the Junior Subordinated Note with “bond premium” in the amount equal to such excess. A United States Holder generally may be able to elect to amortize this bond premium  using a constant-yield method  over the remaining term of the Junior Subordinated Note by offsetting the interest income on such Junior Subordinated Note allocable to an accrual period with the premium allocable to such accrual period. If a United States Holder makes such an election  such United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Junior Subordinated Note will be reduced by the amount of premium amortized. If a United States Holder does not elect to amortize the premium  the premium will decrease the gain or increase the loss such United States Holder would otherwise recognize on a disposition of such Junior Subordinated Note. An election to amortize bond premium applies to all taxable debt obligations owned or acquired by the United States Holder on or after the first day of the first taxable year for which the election is made and may be revoked only with the consent of the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”). United States Holders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the effect of an election to amortize bond premium on their particular circumstances.Sale  Exchange  Redemption or Other Taxable Disposition of the Junior Subordinated NotesA United States Holder generally will recognize gain or loss upon the sale  exchange  redemption or other taxable disposition of a Junior Subordinated Note equal to the difference  if any  between (a) the sum of the cash and the fair market value of any property received on such disposition (other than amounts properly attributable to accrued but unpaid interest  which amounts (excluding any amount attributable to pre-acquisition accrued interest) will be treated as interest income as described above under “—Treatment of the Junior Subordinated Notes and Interest Thereon”) and (b) such United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in the Junior Subordinated Note. A United States Holder’s adjusted tax basis in a Junior Subordinated Note generally will be equal to the amount that such United States Holder paid for the Junior Subordinated Note (excluding any amount attributable to pre-acquisition accrued interest)  reduced by the amount of any bond premium previously amortized by such United States Holder with respect to the Junior Subordinated Note and any payments on the Junior Subordinated Note other than payments of qualified stated interest. Any gain or loss recognized on a sale  exchange  redemption or other taxable disposition of a Junior Subordinated Note generally will be capital gain or loss  and will be long-term capital gain or loss  if  at the time of such disposition  the United States Holder will have held the Junior Subordinated Note for a period of more than one year. The deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations.Medicare TaxCertain United States Holders that are individuals  estates or trusts are subject to a 3.8% Medicare tax on all or a portion of their “net investment income ” which may include all or a portion of their interest income and net gains from the disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Each United States Holder that is an individual  estate or trust is urged to consult its tax advisors regarding the applicability of this Medicare tax to its income and gains in respect of its investment in the Junior Subordinated Notes.Backup Withholding and Information ReportingInformation reporting requirements generally apply in connection with payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes to  and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of the Junior Subordinated Notes by  non-corporate United States Holders. A United States Holder will be subject to backup withholding on these payments if the United States Holder fails to provide its taxpayer identification number to the paying agent and fails to comply with certain certification procedures or otherwise establish an exemption from backup withholding. Any backup withholding from a payment to a United States Holder will be allowed as a credit against such United States federal income tax liability  or may entitle such United States Holder to a refund  provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. United States Holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the application of backup withholding in their particular situation  the availability of an exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption  if available.S-13Non-United States HoldersPayments of InterestSubject to the discussions below under “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding” and “—Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act Withholding ” no withholding of United States federal income tax will apply to a payment of interest on a Junior Subordinated Note to a Non-United States Holder under the “Portfolio Interest Exemption ” provided that:• such payment is not effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder’s conduct of a trade or business within the United States;• the Non-United States Holder does not actually or constructively own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of the Company’s stock entitled to vote;• the Non-United States Holder is not a controlled foreign corporation that is related directly or constructively to the Company through stock ownership;• the Non-United States Holder is not a bank that acquired the Junior Subordinated Notes in consideration for an extension of credit made pursuant to a loan agreement entered into in the ordinary course of its trade or business; and• the Non-United States Holder provides the withholding agent  in accordance with specified procedures  with a statement to the effect that such holder is not a United States person (generally by providing a properly executed IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E).If a Non-United States Holder cannot satisfy the requirements of the “Portfolio Interest Exemption” described above  payments of interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes made to such Non-United States Holder will be subject to a 30% United States federal withholding tax  unless that holder provides the paying agent with a properly executed statement: (i) claiming an exemption from or reduction of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty (generally on IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E); or (ii) stating that the payment on the Junior Subordinated Notes is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected to that holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (generally on an IRS Form W-8ECI).If a Non-United States Holder is engaged in a trade or business in the United States (and  if an applicable United States income tax treaty applies  if the Non-United States Holder maintains a permanent establishment within the United States) and the interest on the Junior Subordinated Notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business (and  if an applicable United States income tax treaty applies  attributable to that permanent establishment)  that Non-United States Holder will be subject to United States federal income tax on the interest on a net income basis in the same manner as if that Non-United States Holder were a United States Holder. In addition  if such Non-United States Holder is a foreign corporation  it may also  under certain circumstances  be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a 30% rate or such lower rate as may be specified by an applicable income tax treaty.Sale  Exchange  Redemption or other Taxable Disposition of the Junior Subordinated NotesSubject to the discussions below under “—Information Reporting and Backup Withholding ” any gain realized by a Non-United States Holder on the sale  exchange  redemption or other taxable disposition of a Junior Subordinated Note generally will not be subject to United States federal income tax unless:• such gain is effectively connected with the Non-United States Holder’s conduct of a trade or business in the United States (and  if an applicable United States income tax treaty applies  is attributable to a permanent establishment maintained by the Non-United States Holder within the United States); or• the Non-United States Holder is an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more in the taxable year of the disposition and certain other conditions are met.Information Reporting And Backup WithholdingThe amount of interest paid on the Junior Subordinated Notes to Non-United States Holders generally must be reported annually to the IRS. These reporting requirements apply regardless of whether withholding was reduced or eliminated by any applicable income tax treaty. Copies of the information returns reflecting income in respect of the Junior Subordinated Notes mayS-14also be made available to the tax authorities in the country in which the Non-United States Holder is a resident under the provisions of an applicable income tax treaty or information sharing agreement.A Non-United States Holder will generally not be subject to additional information reporting or to backup withholding (currently at a 24% rate) with respect to payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes or to information reporting or backup withholding with respect to proceeds from the sale or other disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes to or through a United States office of any broker  as long as the Non-United States Holder:• has furnished to the payor or broker a valid IRS Form W-8BEN or W-8BEN-E certifying  under penalties of perjury  the Non-United States Holder’s status as a non-United States person;• has furnished to the payor or broker other documentation upon which it may rely to treat the payments as made to a non-United States person in accordance with applicable Treasury regulations; or• otherwise establishes an exemption.The payment of the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes to or through a foreign office of a broker will generally not be subject to information reporting or backup withholding. However  a sale or disposition of Junior Subordinated Notes will be subject to information reporting  but not backup withholding  if it is to or through a foreign office of a United States broker or a non-United States broker with certain enumerated connections with the United States unless the documentation requirements described above are met or the holder otherwise establishes an exemption.Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to a Non-United States Holder will be allowed as a credit against such holder’s United States federal income tax liability  if any  or will otherwise be refundable  provided that the requisite procedures are followed and the proper information is filed with the IRS on a timely basis. Non-United States Holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such exemption  if applicable.Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act WithholdingA withholding tax of 30% will apply to interest income paid on Junior Subordinated Notes held by a Non-United States Holder where the Non-United States Holder is (i) a foreign financial institution (as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary)  unless such institution enters into an agreement with the United States government to collect and provide to the United States tax authorities substantial information regarding United States account holders of such institution (which would include certain equity and debt holders of such institution  as well as certain account holders that are foreign entities with United States owners)  or (ii) a foreign entity that is not a financial institution (as a beneficial owner or as an intermediary)  unless such entity provides the withholding agent with a certification identifying the substantial United States owners of the entity  which generally includes any United States person who directly or indirectly owns more than 10% of the entity. An intergovernmental agreement between the United States and an applicable foreign country may modify these requirements. Under certain circumstances  a Non-United States Holder of Junior Subordinated Notes might be eligible for a refund or credit of such taxes  and a Non-United States Holder might be required to file a United States federal income tax return to claim such refund or credit. The Company will not pay any additional amounts to “gross up” payments to holders as a result of any withholding or deduction for such taxes. Non-United States Holders of Junior Subordinated Notes are encouraged to consult with their tax advisors regarding the possible implications of these withholding requirements on their investment in the Junior Subordinated Notes.THE UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME TAX DISCUSSION SET FORTH ABOVE IS INCLUDED FOR GENERAL INFORMATION ONLY AND MAY NOT BE APPLICABLE DEPENDING UPON A HOLDER’S PARTICULAR SITUATION. HOLDERS SHOULD CONSULT THEIR TAX ADVISORS REGARDING THE PARTICULAR TAX CONSEQUENCES TO THEM OF THE ACQUISITION  OWNERSHIP AND DISPOSITION OF THE JUNIOR SUBORDINATED NOTES  INCLUDING THE TAX CONSEQUENCES UNDER STATE  LOCAL  FOREIGN AND OTHER TAX LAWS.S-15REMARKETINGSubject to the terms and conditions of a remarketing agreement (the “Remarketing Agreement”) among the Company  Barclays Capital Inc.  Citigroup Global Markets Inc.  Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC  J.P. Morgan Securities LLC  Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC and Wells Fargo Securities  LLC  as the remarketing agents (the “Remarketing Agents”)  and U.S. Bank Trust Company  National Association  solely in its capacity as Purchase Contract Agent and as attorney-in-fact of the holders of Purchase Contracts  the Remarketing Agents have agreed to use their commercially reasonable efforts to remarket the Series 2019A RSNs and the Series 2019B RSNs at public offering prices that will result in aggregate proceeds sufficient to purchase the Treasury Portfolio  as required by the terms of the Corporate Units.The Remarketing Agents have no obligation to purchase any of the Junior Subordinated Notes. The Remarketing Agreement provides that the remarketing is subject to customary conditions precedent  including the delivery of legal opinions.The offering of the Junior Subordinated Notes by the Remarketing Agents is subject to the Remarketing Agents’ right to reject any order in whole or in part.In connection with the remarketing  the Remarketing Agents have reset the rate of interest payable on the Series 2019A JSNs to the reset rate of % per annum and have reset the rate of interest payable on the Series 2019B JSNs to the reset rate of % per annum  in each case  effective on and after May   2022  the expected delivery date for the Junior Subordinated Notes.The Junior Subordinated Notes will not be listed on any securities exchange or on any automated deal er quotation system.The Remarketing Agents may make a market in the Junior Subordinated Notes after completion of the offering  but will not be obligated to do so and may discontinue any market-making activities at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to the liquidity of the trading market for the Junior Subordinated Notes or that an active public market for the Junior Subordinated Notes will develop. If an active public trading market for the Junior Subordinated Notes does not develop  the market price and liquidity of the Junior Subordinated Notes may be adversely affected.The Company has agreed to indemnify the several Remarketing Agents against certain liabilities  including liabilities under the Securities Act of 1933  as amended.The Company will pay a remarketing fee equal to % of the principal amount of the Series 2019A JSNs and % of the principal amount of the Series 2019B JSNs. The Company’s expenses associated with the offer and sale of the Junior Subordinated Notes (not including the remarketing fee) are estimated to be $ .In order to facilitate the offering of the Junior Subordinated Notes  the Remarketing Agents may engage in transactions that stabilize  maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Specifically  the Remarketing Agents may over-allot in connection with this remarketing  creating short positions in the Junior Subordinated Notes for their own accounts. In addition  to cover over-allotments or to stabilize the price of the Junior Subordinated Notes  the Remarketing Agents may bid for  and purchase  Junior Subordinated Notes in the open market. Finally  the Remarketing Agents may reclaim selling concessions allowed to the Remarketing Agents or dealers for distributing Junior Subordinated Notes in this remarketing  if the Remarketing Agents repurchase previously distributed Junior Subordinated Notes in transactions to cover short positions  in stabilization transactions or otherwise. Any of these activities may stabilize or maintain the market price of the Junior Subordinated Notes above independent market levels. The Remarketing Agents are not required to engage in these activities and may end any of these activities at any time without notice.In general  purchases of a security for the purpose of stabilization or to reduce a short position could cause the price of the security to be higher than it might be in the absence of such purchases. The imposition of a penalty bid might also have an effect on the price of a security to the extent that it were to discourage resales of the security.Neither the Company nor any Remarketing Agent makes any representation or prediction as to the direction or magnitude of any effect that the transactions described above may have on the price of the Junior Subordinated Notes. In addition  neither the Company nor any Remarketing Agent makes any representation that the Remarketing Agents will engage in such transactions or that such transactions once commenced will not be discontinued without notice.It is expected that delivery of the Junior Subordinated Notes will be made  against payment for the Junior Subordinated Notes  on or about May   2022  which will be the business day following the pricing of the Junior Subordinated Notes. Under Rule 15c6-1 under the 1934 Act  purchases or sales of securities in the secondary market generally are required to settle within two business days (T+2)  unless the parties to any such transactions expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly  purchasers of the Junior Subordinated Notes who wish to trade the Junior Subordinated Notes on the date of this Prospectus Supplement or theS-16next succeeding business day(s) will be required  because the Junior Subordinated Notes will settle within business days (T+ )  to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed settlement. Purchasers of the Junior Subordinated Notes who wish to trade on the date of this Prospectus Supplement or the next succeeding business day(s) should consult their own legal advisors.In the ordinary course of business  the Remarketing Agents and their respective affiliates have from time to time performed and may in the future perform various financial advisory  commercial banking  investment banking  sales and trading  investment research  principal investment  hedging  market making  asset leasing treasury services and other financial and non-financial activities and services for the Company and its affiliates  for which they received  or will continue to receive  customary fees or compensation.In addition  in the ordinary course of their business activities  the Remarketing Agents and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity securities (or related derivative securities)  loans  commodities  currencies  credit default swaps and other financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own accounts and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities may involve securities and/or instruments of the Company or its affiliates. Certain of the Remarketing Agents or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with the Company routinely hedge  and certain other of the Remarketing Agents or their affiliates may hedge  their credit exposure to the Company consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically  such Remarketing Agents and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in the Company’s securities  including potentially the Junior Subordinated Notes. Any such credit default swaps or short positions could adversely affect future trading prices of the Junior Subordinated Notes. The Remarketing Agents and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or financial instruments and may hold  or recommend to clients that they acquire  long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments.Selling RestrictionsCanadaEach Remarketing Agent has represented and agreed that the Junior Subordinated Notes may be sold in Canada only to purchasers purchasing  or deemed to be purchasing  as principal that are accredited investors  as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario)  and are permitted clients  as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements  Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations.

The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser’s province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal advisor.Pursuant to section 3A.3 of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (“NI 33-105”)  the Remarketing Agents are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with this offering.European Economic AreaThe Junior Subordinated Notes are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the “EEA”).

Please see “Risk Factors” in the accompanying prospectus for a complete list of risk factors relating to the notes.Early Redemption RisksThe notes have early redemption risk . In addition to the optional make-whole redemption discussed above under “Fixed/Floating Rate Notes Due 2026—Other Provisions ” we have the option to redeem the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026  (i) in whole but not in part  on May   2025 or (ii) in whole at any time or in part from time to time  on or after April   2026  on at least 5 but not more than 30 days’ prior notice. In addition to the optional make-whole redemption discussed above under “Fixed/Floating Rate Notes Due 2032—Other Provisions ” we have the option to redeem the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032  (i) in whole but not in part  on May   2031 or (ii) in whole at any time or in part from time to time  on or after February   2032  on at least 5 but not more than 30 days’ prior notice. It is more likely that we will redeem the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 or the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 prior to the respective stated maturity date to the extent that the interest payable on such notes is greater than the interest that would be payable on other instruments of ours of a comparable maturity  of comparable terms and of a comparable credit rating trading in the market. If the notes are redeemed prior to the respective stated maturity date  you may have to re-invest the proceeds in a lower interest rate environment.Optional RedemptionIn addition to the optional make-whole redemption discussed above under “Fixed/Floating Rate Notes Due 2026—Other Provisions ” we may  at our option  redeem the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026  (i) in whole but not in part  on May   2025 or (ii) in whole at any time or in part from time to time  on or after April   2026  on at least 5 but not more than 30 days’ prior notice  at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest on the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 to but excluding the redemption date. If fewer than all of the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 are to be redeemed  the trustee will select  not more than 30 days prior to the redemption date  the particular fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 not previously called for redemption in accordance with its procedures at the time of selection; provided  that if the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 are represented by one or more global securities  beneficial interests in such fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 will be selected for redemption by the applicable depositary in accordance with its standard procedures therefor.In addition to the optional make-whole redemption discussed above under “Fixed/Floating Rate Notes Due 2032—Other Provisions ” we may  at our option  redeem the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032  (i) in whole but not in part  on May   2031 or (ii) in whole at any time or in part from time to time  on or after February   2032  on at least 5 but not more than 30 days’ prior notice  at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest on the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 to but excluding the redemption date. If fewer than all of the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 are to be redeemed  the trustee will select  not more than 30 days prior to the redemption date  the particular fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 or portions thereof for redemption from the outstanding fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 not previously called for redemption in accordance with its procedures at the time of selection; provided  that if the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 are represented by one or more global securities  beneficial interests in such fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 will be selected for redemption by the applicable depositary in accordance with its standard procedures therefor.On or before the respective redemption date  we will deposit with the trustee money sufficient to pay the redemption price of and accrued interest on the notes to be redeemed on that date. If such money is so deposited  on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on such notes (unless we default in the payment of the redemption price and accrued interest) and such notes will cease to be outstanding.For information regarding notices of redemption  see “Description of Debt Securities—Redemption and Repurchase of Debt Securities—Notice of Redemption” in the accompanying prospectus.The notes do not contain any provisions affording the holders the right to require us to purchase the notes after the occurrence of any change in control event affecting us.PS-7United States Federal TaxationTax Considerations for the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026In the opinion of our counsel  Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP  the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 should be treated as “variable rate debt instruments” denominated in a currency (the “denomination currency”) other than the U.S. dollar for U.S. federal tax purposes  and will therefore be subject to special rules under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended  and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. See the discussion in the section of the accompanying prospectus supplement called “United States Federal Taxation―Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders― Foreign Currency Notes” for further information about the treatment of the notes. The fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 should be treated as providing for a single fixed rate followed by a single qualified floating rate (“QFR”)  as described in the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement called “United States Federal Taxation―Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders― Floating Rate Notes―General” and “―Floating Rate Notes that Provide for Multiple Rates.” Under applicable Treasury Regulations  in order to determine the amount of qualified stated interest (“QSI”) and original issue discount (“OID”) in respect of the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026  an equivalent fixed rate debt instrument (denominated in euro) must be constructed for the entire term of the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026. The equivalent fixed rate debt instrument is constructed in the following manner: (i) first  the initial fixed rate is converted to a QFR that would preserve the fair market value of the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026  and (ii) second  each QFR (including the QFR determined under (i) above) is converted to a fixed rate substitute (which should generally be the value of that QFR as of the issue date of the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026). Under Treasury Regulations applicable to certain options arising under the terms of a debt instrument  in determining the amount of QSI and OID  we should be deemed to exercise our optional redemption right if doing so would reduce the yield on the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument. For the purpose of determining QSI and OID  the optional make-whole redemption should not be deemed to be exercised. However  if  as of the issue date  redeeming the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 on May   2025 would reduce the yield of the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument  the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 should be treated as fixed rate debt instruments maturing on May   2025 (the “instrument maturing May 2025”). Under those circumstances  if the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 are not actually redeemed by us on May   2025  solely for purposes of the OID rules  they should be deemed retired and reissued for their principal amount  and should thereafter be treated as floating rate debt instruments with a term of one year (the “1-year instrument”). The instrument maturing May 2025 would be treated as issued without OID  and all payments of interest thereon would be treated as QSI. Interest on the 1-year instrument should generally be taken into account when received or accrued  according to your method of tax accounting  but it is possible that the 1-year instrument could be subject to the rules described under “United States Federal Taxation―Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders―Short-Term Notes” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.If  as of the issue date  redeeming the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 on May   2025 would not reduce the yield on the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument  the rules under “United States Federal Taxation―Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders― Discount Notes―General” must be applied to the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument to determine the amounts of QSI and OID on the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026. Under those circumstances  the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 may be issued with OID.A U.S. holder is required to include any QSI in income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. holders will be required to include any OID in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues  in accordance with a constant yield method based on a compounding of interest. All amounts will be determined in the denomination currency and then translated into U.S. dollars according to the rules described in the section of the accompanying prospectus supplement called “United States Federal Taxation—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Foreign Currency Notes.” QSI allocable to an accrual period must be increased (or decreased) by the amount  if any  which the interest actually accrued or paid during an accrual period (including the fixed rate payments made during the initial period) exceeds (or is less than) the interest assumed to be accrued or paid during the accrual period under the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument.Tax Considerations for the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032In the opinion of our counsel  Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP  the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 should be treated as “variable rate debt instruments” denominated in a currency (the “denomination currency”) other than the U.S. dollar for U.S. federal tax purposes  and will therefore be subject to special rules under Section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended  and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. See the discussion in the section of the accompanying prospectus supplement called “United States Federal Taxation―Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders― Foreign Currency Notes” for further information about the treatment of the notes. The fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 should be treated as providing for a single fixed rate followed by a single qualified floating rate (“QFR”)  as described in the sections of the accompanying prospectus supplement called “United States Federal Taxation―Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders― Floating Rate Notes―General” and “―Floating Rate Notes that Provide for Multiple Rates.” Under applicable Treasury Regulations  in order to determine the amount of qualified stated interest (“QSI”) and original issue discount (“OID”) in respect of the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032  an equivalent fixed rate debt instrument (denominated in euro) must be constructed for the entire term of the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032. The equivalent fixed rate debt instrument is constructed in the following manner: (i) first  the initial fixed rate is converted to a QFRPS-8that would preserve the fair market value of the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032  and (ii) second  each QFR (including the QFR determined under (i) above) is converted to a fixed rate substitute (which should generally be the value of that QFR as of the issue date of the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032). Under Treasury Regulations applicable to certain options arising under the terms of a debt instrument  in determining the amount of QSI and OID  we should be deemed to exercise our optional redemption right if doing so would reduce the yield on the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument. For the purpose of determining QSI and OID  the optional make-whole redemption should not be deemed to be exercised. However  if  as of the issue date  redeeming the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 on May   2031 would reduce the yield of the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument  the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 should be treated as fixed rate debt instruments maturing on May   2031 (the “instrument maturing May 2031”). Under those circumstances  if the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 are not actually redeemed by us on May   2031  solely for purposes of the OID rules  they should be deemed retired and reissued for their principal amount  and should thereafter be treated as floating rate debt instruments with a term of one year (the “1-year instrument”). The instrument maturing May 2031 would be treated as issued without OID  and all payments of interest thereon would be treated as QSI. Interest on the 1-year instrument should generally be taken into account when received or accrued  according to your method of tax accounting  but it is possible that the 1-year instrument could be subject to the rules described under “United States Federal Taxation―Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders―Short-Term Notes” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.If  as of the issue date  redeeming the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 on May   2031 would not reduce the yield on the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument  the rules under “United States Federal Taxation―Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders― Discount Notes―General” must be applied to the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument to determine the amounts of QSI and OID on the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032. Under those circumstances  the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 may be issued with OID.A U.S. holder is required to include any QSI in income in accordance with the U.S. holder’s regular method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes. U.S. holders will be required to include any OID in income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues  in accordance with a constant yield method based on a compounding of interest. All amounts will be determined in the denomination currency and then translated into U.S. dollars according to the rules described in the section of the accompanying prospectus supplement called “United States Federal Taxation—Tax Consequences to U.S. Holders—Foreign Currency Notes.” QSI allocable to an accrual period must be increased (or decreased) by the amount  if any  which the interest actually accrued or paid during an accrual period (including the fixed rate payments made during the initial period) exceeds (or is less than) the interest assumed to be accrued or paid during the accrual period under the equivalent fixed rate debt instrument.Both U.S. and non-U.S. holders of the notes should read the section of the accompanying prospectus supplement entitled “United States Federal Taxation.”You should consult your tax adviser regarding all aspects of the U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the notes  as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state  local or non-U.S. taxing jurisdiction.The discussion in the preceding paragraphs under “United States Federal Taxation ” and the discussion contained in the section entitled “United States Federal Taxation” in the accompanying prospectus supplement  insofar as they purport to describe provisions of U.S. federal income tax laws or legal conclusions with respect thereto  constitute the full opinion of Davis Polk & Wardwell LLP regarding the material U.S. federal tax consequences of an investment in the notes.PS-9Supplemental Information Concerning Plan of Distribution; Conflicts of InterestOn May   2022  we agreed to sell to the managers listed in this pricing supplement  and they severally agreed to purchase  the principal amounts of notes set forth opposite their respective names below at a net price of %  plus accrued interest  if any  for the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 and at a net price of %  plus accrued interest  if any  for the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032  each of which we refer to as the “purchase price” for the respective notes. The purchase price for the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 equals the stated issue price of %  plus accrued interest  if any  less a combined management and underwriting commission of % of the principal amount of the fixed/floating rate notes due 2026 and the purchase price for the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032 equals the stated issue price of %  plus accrued interest  if any  less a combined management and underwriting commission of % of the principal amount of the fixed/floating rate notes due 2032.NamePrincipal Amount of Fixed/Floating Rate Notes Due 2026Principal Amount of Fixed/Floating Rate Notes Due 2032 Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc€€ Total€€Morgan Stanley & Co. International plc (“MSIP”) is our wholly-owned subsidiary.MSIP is not a U.S. registered broker-dealer and  therefore  to the extent that it intends to effect any sales of the notes in the United States  it will do so through Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“MS & Co.”). MS & Co. is our wholly-owned subsidiary. MS & Co. will conduct this offering in compliance with the requirements of Rule 5121 of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority  Inc.  which is commonly referred to as FINRA  regarding a FINRA member firm’s distribution of the securities of an affiliate and related conflicts of interest. MS & Co. or any of our other affiliates may not make sales in this offering to any discretionary account without the prior written approval of the customer .CanadaNotwithstanding the selling and other restrictions set forth in “Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)” in the accompanying prospectus supplement  the following applies with respect to securities offered or sold in Canada:With respect to sales of the notes in Canada  the notes may be sold only to purchasers that are: (i) not individuals; (ii) purchasing  or deemed to be purchasing  as principal; (iii) “accredited investors”  as defined in National Instrument 45-106 Prospectus Exemptions (“NI 45-106”) or subsection 73.3(1) of the Securities Act (Ontario)  as applicable; and (iv) “permitted clients”  as defined in National Instrument 31-103 Registration Requirements  Exemptions and Ongoing Registrant Obligations. The distribution of the notes in Canada is being made on a private placement basis only and is therefore exempt from the requirement that Morgan Stanley prepares and files a prospectus with the relevant Canadian regulatory authorities.Although Morgan Stanley is a “reporting issuer”  as such term is defined under applicable Canadian securities legislation  in the provinces of British Columbia  Alberta  Saskatchewan  Québec and Newfoundland and Labrador  the certificate(s)  if any  representing the notes will not carry the legend prescribed by Section 2.5(2) of National Instrument 45-102 Resale of Securities nor will a written notice containing such legend restriction notation be delivered to any purchaser. Accordingly  the notes will not be or become freely tradeable in Canada  and any resale of the notes must be made in accordance with an exemption from  or pursuant to a transaction not subject to  the prospectus requirements of applicable Canadian securities laws. Canadian purchasers are advised to seek legal advice prior to any resale of the notes.Prospective investors in Canada are advised that your name and other specified information  including the number of notes you have purchased  may be disclosed to Canadian securities regulatory authorities and may become available to the public in accordance with the requirements of applicable Canadian law. By purchasing any notes hereunder  you are deemed to have consented to the disclosure of that information.Securities legislation in certain provinces of Canada provides purchasers of securities with a remedy for damages or rescission  or both  in addition to any other rights they may have at law  where this pricing supplement  the accompanying prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus (collectively  the “offering memorandum”) or any amendment to it contains a “misrepresentation” within the meaning of Canadian securities legislation. These remedies  or notice with respect toPS-10these remedies  must be exercised or delivered  as the case may be  by the purchaser within the time limits prescribed by applicable securities legislation.OntarioSecurities legislation in Ontario provides an Ontario purchaser (other than (a) a “Canadian financial institution” or a “Schedule III bank” (each as defined in NI 45-106)  (b) the Business Development Bank of Canada or (c) a subsidiary of any person referred to in (a) or (b) above  if the person owns all the voting securities of the subsidiary  except the voting securities required by law to be owned by the directors of that subsidiary) with a statutory right of action for damages or rescission against an issuer and any selling security holder where the offering memorandum contains a misrepresentation without regard to whether the purchaser relied on the misrepresentation. The right of action for damages is exercisable not later than the earlier of 180 days from the date the purchaser first had knowledge of the facts giving rise to the cause of action and three years from the date of the transaction that gave rise to the cause of action. The right of action for rescission is exercisable not later than 180 days from the date of the transaction that gave rise to the cause of action. If a purchaser elects to exercise the right of action for rescission  the purchaser will have no right of action for damages against the issuer or any selling security holder. In no case will the amount recoverable in any action exceed the price at which the notes were offered to the purchaser and if the purchaser is shown to have purchased the notes with knowledge of the misrepresentation  the issuer and any selling security holder will have no liability. In the case of an action for damages  the issuer and any selling security holder will not be liable for all or any portion of the damages that are proven to not represent the depreciation in value of the notes as a result of the misrepresentation relied upon.SaskatchewanThe Securities Act  1988 (Saskatchewan) (the “Saskatchewan Act”) provides that where an offering memorandum  together with any amendment to the offering memorandum  sent or delivered to a purchaser contains a misrepresentation  a purchaser who purchases a security covered by the offering memorandum or an amendment to the offering memorandum is deemed to have relied on that misrepresentation  if it was a misrepresentation at the time of purchase  and has a right of action for damages against (a) the issuer or a selling security holder on whose behalf the distribution is made  (b) every promoter and director of the issuer or the selling security holder  as the case may be  at the time the offering memorandum or any amendment thereof was sent or delivered  (c) every person or company whose consent has been filed respecting the offering  but only with respect to reports  opinions or statements that have been made by them  (d) every person or company that  in addition to those mentioned in (a) to (c) above  signed the offering memorandum or the amendment thereof and (e) every person or company that sells notes on behalf of the issuer or selling security holder under the offering memorandum or amendment thereof. In addition  such a purchaser that purchases the security from the issuer or a selling securityholder may elect to exercise a right of rescission against such person where an offering memorandum contains a misrepresentation and  when the purchaser so elects  the purchaser shall have no right of action for damages against such person.The Saskatchewan Act provides further that (a) where an individual makes a verbal statement to a prospective purchaser that contains a misrepresentation relating to the security purchased and the verbal statement is made either before or contemporaneously with the purchase of the security  the purchaser is deemed to have relied on the misrepresentation  if it was a misrepresentation at the time of purchase  and has a right of action for damages against the individual who made the verbal statement  (b) a purchaser of a security from a vendor who is trading in Saskatchewan in contravention of the Saskatchewan Act  the regulations thereunder or a decision of the Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan  whether that vendor is trading on his own behalf or by another person or agent on his behalf  may elect to void the contract and  if the purchaser so elects  the purchaser is entitled to recover all money and other consideration paid by him to the vendor pursuant to the trade and (c) if the distribution of notes has not been completed and (i) there is a material change in the affairs of the issuer  (ii) it is proposed that the terms or conditions of the offering described in the offering memorandum be altered or (iii) notes are to be distributed in addition to the notes previously described in the offering memorandum  and an amendment to the offering memorandum is not sent or delivered in accordance with the Saskatchewan Act  the purchaser has a right of action for rescission or damages against the manager or offeror that failed to comply with the applicable requirement.Subject to the Saskatchewan Act  these statutory rights are exercisable  in the case of an action for rescission  180 days after the date of the transaction that gave rise to the cause of action or  in the case of any action  other than an action for rescission  the earlier of (a) one year after the plaintiff first had knowledge of the facts giving rise to the cause of action and (b) six years after the date of the transaction that gave rise to the cause of the action.New BrunswickNew Brunswick securities legislation provides investors who purchase notes offered for sale in reliance on the exemption in Section 2.3 of NI 45-106 with a statutory right of action for damages against the issuer  a selling security holder on whose behalf the distribution is made  every person who was a director of the issuer at the date of the offering memorandum and every personPS-11who signed the offering memorandum  or a right of action for rescission against the issuer and the selling security holder on whose behalf the distribution is made  in the event that any information relating to the offering provided to the purchaser contains a misrepresentation. Where an offering memorandum is delivered to a prospective purchaser of notes in connection with a trade made in reliance on the exemption in Section 2.3 of NI 45-106  and the document contains a misrepresentation  a purchaser who purchases the notes is deemed to have relied on the misrepresentation and has  subject to certain limitations and defences  the above-noted statutory rights of action. If the purchaser elects to exercise the right of rescission  the purchaser will have no right of action for damages. The right of action will be exercisable by the purchaser only if the purchaser gives notice to the defendant  in the case of any action for rescission  not more than 180 days after the date of the transaction that gave rise to the cause of action  that the purchaser is exercising this right and  in the case of any action for damages  before the earlier of (a) one year after the plaintiff first had knowledge of the facts giving rise to the cause of action and (b) six years after the date of the transaction that gave rise to the cause of action.The liability of all persons and companies referred to above is joint and several. A defendant is not liable for a misrepresentation if it proves that the purchaser purchased the notes with knowledge of the misrepresentation. In an action for damages  the defendant shall not be liable for all or any portion of the damages that the defendant proves do not represent the depreciation in value of the notes as a result of the misrepresentation relied upon. In no case shall the amount recoverable for the misrepresentation exceed the price at which the notes were offered.Nova ScotiaNova Scotia securities legislation provides that if an offering memorandum or any advertising or sales literature (as defined in the Securities Act (Nova Scotia)) contains a misrepresentation  a purchaser of notes is deemed to have relied upon such misrepresentation if it was a misrepresentation at the time of purchase and has  subject to certain limitations and defences  a statutory right of action for damages against the seller of such notes  the directors of the seller at the date of the offering memorandum and the persons who have signed the offering memorandum or  alternatively  while still the owner of the notes  may elect instead to exercise a statutory right of rescission against the seller  in which case the purchaser shall have no right of action for damages against the seller  the directors of the seller or the persons who have signed the offering memorandum. The rights described above are subject to certain limitations  including: (a) no action may be commenced to enforce the right of action for rescission or damages by a purchaser resident in Nova Scotia later than 120 days after the date payment was made for the notes (or after the date on which initial payment was made for the notes where payments subsequent to the initial payment are made pursuant to a contractual commitment assumed prior to  or concurrently with  the initial payment); (b) no person will be liable if it proves that the purchaser purchased the notes with knowledge of the misrepresentation; (c) in the case of an action for damages  no person will be liable for all or any portion of the damages that it proves do not represent the depreciation in value of the notes resulting from the misrepresentation; and (d) in no case will the amount recoverable in any action exceed the price at which the notes were offered to the purchaser.The liability of all persons or companies referred to above is joint and several with respect to the same cause of action.The foregoing summary is subject to the express provisions of the Securities Act (Ontario)  the Securities Act (New Brunswick)  the Saskatchewan Act and the Securities Act (Nova Scotia) and the rules and regulations thereunder and reference is made thereto for the complete text of such provisions.Newfoundland and LabradorPurchasers of notes resident in Newfoundland and Labrador will be entitled to a contractual right of action for damages or rescission against the issuer equivalent to the statutory rights provided to purchasers in Ontario.Notwithstanding the selling and other restrictions set forth in “Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)” in the accompanying prospectus supplement  the following applies with respect to securities offered or sold in the EEA:Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail InvestorsThe managers have represented and agreed  and each underwriter  dealer  other agent and remarketing firm participating in the distribution of the securities will be required to represent and agree  that it has not offered  sold or otherwise made available any notes to any retail investor in the EEA.

Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of these items and limitations of their use.“Activity levels in the first quarter were strong as revenues grew by 8% from the fourth quarter of 2021 and represented the highest level for quarterly revenue since the first quarter of 2020  which was largely unaffected by the pandemic. We are actively working with our customers and suppliers to manage both the inflationary and labour supply pressures in the current market ” said Barry Card  Interim Chief Executive Officer.“The pricing for commodities in the end markets we serve continues to be strong and is anticipated to remain that way throughout the year. This is providing our customers with the confidence to increase their spending on both maintenance and capital projects  as evidenced by the 17 turnaround projects that we have scheduled for the second quarter. We are proud to partner with our customers on these important projects to build and maintain the integrity of their production infrastructure ” added Mr. Card.HIGHLIGHTSRevenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $109.8 million  representing an increase of $27.6 million or 33.6% from Q1 2021.Gross profit for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $9.7 million  representing an increase of $1.7 million or 21.1% from Q1 2021.Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 8.9%  as compared to 9.8% in Q1 2021.Adjusted EBITDAS for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $3.0 million  representing an increase of $0.8 million or 34.9% from Q1 2021.Adjusted EBITDAS margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 2.7%  unchanged from Q1 2021.Selling  general and administrative expenses for three months ended March 31  2022 were $8.1 million  representing an increase of $2.1 million or 34.9% from Q1 2021. Consistent with the last three quarters in 2021  the increase is largely due to investments being made to support our enterprise systems and digital strategy to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness. As well our business has recovered and stabilized in 2022  therefore  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work in 2022.Liquidity remained strong with total cash and available credit facilities of $37.4 million at March 31  2022  as compared to $33.7 million at December 31  2021.New project awards and contract renewals were $96 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 and $36 million for the month of April 2022. Approximately 80% of that work is expected to be completed in 2022.Maintenance and Construction ServicesRevenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $99.4 million  representing an increase of 34.3% or $25.4 million from Q1 2021 and $5.4 million or 5.7% from Q4 2021. The increase was due to our customers increasing their spending on both maintenance and capital projects. We expect activity levels to remain high in the second quarter with 17 turnaround projects scheduled. We continue to focus on consolidating various scopes of work with existing or new customers by bundling our services in order to enable more efficient execution and lower costs for our customers on each work site.Wear Technology Overlay ServicesRevenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $12.3 million  representing an increase of 43.0% or $3.7 million from Q1 2021 and 36.7% or $3.3 million from Q4 2021. Gross profit margin was lower as we completed more fabrication work  which has a lower margin than the specialty weld overlay products that we market under the brand name AssetArmor™. With the continued rise in global energy demand and commodity prices  we are seeing our customers in the oil sands operating at full production levels  which has started to increase the demand for our AssetArmor™ products.Environmental ServicesWe continue to grow our capabilities by adding staff within our professional services. During the first quarter  we completed a large decommissioning project. We are seeing our customers continue to allocate expenditures for the closure  reclamation and remediation of oil and gas wells  pipelines and facilities in Western Canada. We expect this trend to continue with our clients regardless of the expiry of the government funded programs at the end of 2022 given the increased focus on ESG (environmental  social and governance) matters.FIRST QUARTER 2022 FINANCIAL RESULTS($ millions  except per share amounts)Three months ended March 31  2022 2021 % Change Revenue Maintenance and Construction Services 99.4 74.0 34.3 % Wear Technology Overlay Services 12.3 8.6 44.1 % Total 109.8 82.2 33.6 % Gross Profit Maintenance and Construction Services 7.4 5.9 24.9 % Wear Technology Overlay Services 2.4 2.2 10.6 % Total 9.7 8.0 21.1 % Gross Profit Margin (% of revenue) Maintenance and Construction Services 7.4 % 8.0 % (0.6 )% Wear Technology Overlay Services 19.3 % 25.1 % (5.8 )% Total 8.9 % 9.8 % (0.9 )%Selling  general and administrative expenses 8.1 6.0 34.9 % % of revenue 7.3 % 7.3 % — % Adjusted EBITDAS * Maintenance and Construction Services 7.2 5.8 24.5 % Wear Technology Overlay Services 2.3 2.1 10.9 % Corporate (6.5 ) (5.7 ) (15.4 )% Total 3.0 2.2 34.9 % % of revenue 2.7 % 2.7 % — % Loss from continuing operations (7.8 ) (7.6 ) 2.8 % Net loss per share (dollars) from continuing operations (basic and diluted) (0.07 ) (0.07 ) — %* “Adjusted EBITDAS” is not a standard measure under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of this measure and limitations of its use.Revenue for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $109 848 compared to $82 204 for the three months ended March 31  2021  representing an increase of 33.6%. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong market momentum in the first quarter in 2022  with an increase in activity across all areas of the business.Gross profit for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $9 740 compared to $8 045 for the three months ended March 31  2021  representing an increase of 21.1%. Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 8.9% compared to 9.8% for the three months ended March 31  2021. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven by a few factors including a change in the mix of services and products provided with lower gross profit margins as well as inflationary pressures on labour  equipment and materials. The recovery of these increases in costs are being built into contracts collaboratively with our customers on a go forward basis.Selling  general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $8 052  in comparison to $5 969 for the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 34.9%. As a percentage of revenue  SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31  2022 were 7.3%  unchanged from the same period in 2021. The increase in SG&A expenses is largely due to the ongoing investments being made to support the Company's enterprise systems and digital strategy. These investments  which will extend throughout 2022  are expected to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness. In addition  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work anticipated in 2022.For the three months ended March 31  2022  Adjusted EBITDAS was $3 006 compared to $2 229 for the three months ended March 31  2021. As a percentage of revenue  Adjusted EBITDAS was 2.7% for the three months ended March 31  2022 unchanged from the same period in 2021.Income from government subsidies includes the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (""CERS"") received from the Government of Canada to assist with the payment of employee wages and rent as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CEWS and CERS programs ended in 2021. Therefore  the Company did not have any income from government subsidies during the three months ended March 31  2022  compared to$6 755 for the three months ended March 31  2021.Loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $7 783 compared to loss of $7 569 for the three months ended March 31  2021. The loss variance was driven by the reduction in government subsidies in 2022  an increase in SG&A expenses and an increase in restructuring expenses  partially offset by an increase in gross profit and the impairment of right-of-use assets recognized in 2021.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESClearStream has an asset-based lending facility (the “ABL Facility”) comprised of (i) a revolving credit facility providing for maximum borrowings up to $15.0 million (the “Revolving Facility”) and (ii) a term loan facility providing for maximum borrowings of up to $40.5 million (the “Term Loan Facility”). As at March 31  2022  the Company had $12.0 million of available capacity under the Revolving Facility  $40.5 million drawn on the Term Loan Facility and $25.4 million of cash on hand.On March 30  2022  the Company amended its Revolving Facility  extending the maturity date of the facility to April 14  2022 from March 31  2022.On April 14  2022  ClearStream completed the refinancing of its ABL facility (the “Refinancing”). ClearStream established a new $25 million asset-based revolving credit facility with a three-year term (the “New ABL Facility”) to replace the Revolving Facility.The New ABL Facility provides for maximum borrowings up to $25 million with a Canadian chartered bank. The amount available under the New ABL Facility will vary from time to time based on the borrowing base determined with reference to the accounts receivable and inventories of ClearStream. The obligations under the New ABL Facility are secured by  among other things  a first ranking lien on all of the existing and after acquired accounts receivable and inventories of the Company and the other guarantors  being certain of the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries. The maturity date of the New ABL Facility is April 14  2025. The interest rate on the New ABL Facility is prime plus 2.5%.The financial covenants applicable under the New ABL Facility are:The Company must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.00:1.00 for each twelve month period calculated and tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter; and The Company must not expend or become obligated for any capital expenditures in an aggregate amount exceeding $10 million during any fiscal year.As part of the Refinancing  the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility was extended from September 30  2022 to October 14  2025 and the interest rate was changed to a fixed rate of 8.0%.The Company anticipates that its liquidity (cash on hand and available credit facilities) and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short-term contractual obligations and maintain compliance with its financial covenants through March 31  2023.As at March 31  2022  issued and outstanding share capital included 110 001 239 common shares  127 732 Series 1 preferred shares  and 40 111 Series 2 preferred shares.The Series 1 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $127.732 million) are convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a price of $0.35/share and the Series 2 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $40.111 million) are convertible into common shares at a price of $0.10/share.The Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares have a 10% fixed cumulative preferential cash dividend payable when the Company has sufficient monies to be able to do so  including under the provisions of applicable law and contracts affecting the Company. The board of directors of the Company does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends until such times as the Company's balance sheet and liquidity position supports the payment. As at March 31  2022  the accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series 1 and Series 2 shares totaled $64.0 million. Any accrued and unpaid dividends are convertible in certain circumstances at the option of the holder into additional Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares.OUTLOOKThe continued rise in energy demand and commodity prices continues to provide strong fundamentals for our customers in the energy industry. While these customers have been prioritizing debt repayment and returns to shareholders  they are starting to increase spending on both maintenance projects (to enhance operational reliability) and capital projects (to maintain/expand productive capacity). We expect activity levels to continue to recover throughout 2022.Due to the war in Ukraine and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic  growth in our served markets continues to drive some near-term challenges  including inflationary pressure on labour  equipment and materials as well as supply chain disruptions. We are working closely with our customers and suppliers to manage these challenges. We are also enhancing our programs to attract  retain and develop our number one resource  our employees.With energy transition and environmental considerations becoming increasingly important for all stakeholders in all industrial end markets  we expect that our customers will continue to focus on improving their operational processes for greater efficiencies and reliability  which aligns well with our service offerings.To better support our customers  ClearStream has continued to add new service offerings that encompass the full asset lifecycle and is now offering a suite of more than 40 services. Through the extensive regional coverage provided by our 19 operating facilities  we believe that ClearStream is well-positioned to further consolidate the services required at various operating sites while generating efficiencies and cost reductions for its customers.ClearStream's business model continues to prove its resilience as we are working closely with our customers everyday in helping them to effectively manage their operations.Additional InformationOur unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended March 31  2022 and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of the operating and financial results can be accessed on our website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca and will be available shortly through SEDAR at www.sedar.com.About ClearStream Energy Services Inc.With a legacy of excellence and experience stretching back more than 50 years  ClearStream provides solutions for the Energy and Industrial markets including: Oil & Gas  Petrochemical  Mining  Power  Agriculture  Forestry  Infrastructure and Water Treatment.

These factors should not be considered exhaustive.

In formulating the forward-looking information  management has assumed that business and economic conditions affecting ClearStream will continue substantially in the ordinary course  including  without limitation  with respect to general levels of economic activity  regulations  taxes and interest rates.

Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.Advisory regarding Non-Standard MeasuresThe terms ‘‘EBITDAS’’ and “Adjusted EBITDAS” (collectively  the ‘‘Non-standard measures’’) are financial measures used in this press release that are not standard measures under IFRS. ClearStream’s method of calculating the Non-Standard Measures may differ from the methods used by other issuers. Therefore  ClearStream’s Non-Standard Measures  as presented may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.EBITDAS refers to net earnings determined in accordance with IFRS  before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  income tax expense (recovery)  and other long-term incentive plan expenses. EBITDAS is used by management and the directors of ClearStream as well as many investors to determine the ability of an issuer to generate cash from operations. Management also uses EBITDAS to monitor the performance of ClearStream’s reportable segments and believes that in addition to net income or loss and cash provided by operating activities  EBITDAS is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures and income taxes. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31  2022.Adjusted EBITDAS refers to EBITDAS excluding impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring expense  gain (loss) on sale of property  plant and equipment  recovery of contingent consideration liability  one time incurred expenses  impairment of right-of-use assets  and government subsidies. ClearStream has used Adjusted EBITDAS as the basis for the analysis of its past operating financial performance. Adjusted EBITDAS is a measure that management believes (i) is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures  and income taxes  and (ii) facilitates the comparability of the results of historical periods and the analysis of its operating financial performance which may be useful to investors. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31  2022.Investors are cautioned that the Non-Standard Measures are not alternatives to measures under IFRS and should not  on their own  be construed as an indicator of performance or cash flows  a measure of liquidity or as a measure of actual return on the shares. These Non-Standard Measures should only be used with reference to ClearStream’s consolidated interim and annual financial statements available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on ClearStream’s website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca.",neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,mixed,0.38,0.28,0.34,True,English,"['First Quarter 2022 Financial Results', 'ClearStream', 'Interim Chief Executive Officer', 'specialty weld overlay products', 'Wear Technology Overlay Services', 'ClearStream Energy Services Inc.', 'FIRST QUARTER 2022 FINANCIAL RESULTS', 'labour supply pressures', 'large decommissioning project', 'New project awards', 'global energy demand', 'last three quarters', 'available credit facilities', 'full production levels', 'Gross profit margin', 'production infrastructure', 'Construction Services', 'lower margin', 'AssetArmor™ products', 'Environmental Services', 'professional services', 'Activity levels', 'fourth quarter', 'second quarter', 'three months', 'highest level', 'GLOBE NEWSWIRE', 'standard measures', 'press release', 'current market', 'Barry Card', 'capital projects', '17 turnaround projects', 'important projects', 'Mr. Card', 'EBITDAS margin', 'administrative expenses', 'enterprise systems', 'digital strategy', 'longer-term efficiencies', 'cost competitiveness', 'cost reductions', 'previous years', 'increased volume', 'total cash', 'contract renewals', 'various scopes', 'efficient execution', 'lower costs', 'brand name', 'continued rise', 'commodity prices', 'gas wells', 'Western Canada', 'environmental, social', 'Change Reven', 'quarterly revenue', 'new customers', 'Canadian dollars', 'oil sands', 'share amounts', 'work site', 'fabrication work', 'end markets', 'Adjusted EBITDAS', 'Records', 'Q1', 'CALGARY', 'Alberta', 'May', 'Company', 'TSX', 'CSM', 'thousands', 'IFRS', 'Advisory', 'description', 'items', 'limitations', 'use', 'revenues', 'pandemic', 'suppliers', 'inflationary', 'pricing', 'commodities', 'confidence', 'spending', 'maintenance', 'integrity', 'HIGHLIGHTS', 'March', 'Selling', 'general', 'investments', 'business', 'elements', 'order', 'Liquidity', 'December', 'April', 'Q4', 'existing', 'capabilities', 'staff', 'expenditures', 'closure', 'reclamation', 'remediation', 'pipelines', 'trend', 'clients', 'expiry', 'government', 'programs', 'focus', 'ESG', 'governance', 'matters', '9.']",2022-05-05,2022-05-06,stockhouse.com

In this unfavourable context  AKWEL limited its decline in activity to -4.4% on a like-for-like basis  which is comparable to the decline in global automotive production (-4.2%1).Products and Functions turnover was €239.1m  down -9.0%. The Cooling business (-4.0%) limited its decline  as did the Air business (-3.5%)  which gained market share  while the Pollution Control product line posted a sharper decline this quarter (-12.9%). Control revenue for its part continued to fall  to €4.0m  after unusual previous years.A still limited level of investments this quarter as well as a clear improvement of the working capital  with a return to normal of suppliers' debts and the continuation of the optimization of receivables  contributed to generating a significant quarterly free cash flow at €19.8m.Difficulties in the supply of raw materials and components will continue to weigh on the organisation and activity of manufacturers and equipment suppliers  exacerbated by international geopolitical tensions.

Sanofi has retained a roughly 30% stake.The company targets an API market valued at €72 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at an average rate of 6% to 7% per year until 2024  as well as an outsourcing category that has been forecast to grow at 7%-8% per year over the same period.It operates six European API production sites at Brindisi in Italy  Frankfurt in Germany  Haverhill in the UK)  St Aubin les Elbeuf and Vertolaye in France  and Újpest in Hungary  and employs around 3 350 workers.“We are fully confident in our ability to unlock further value for all our stakeholders ” said chief executive Karl Rotthier  as he rang the Euronext bell on what is his birthday.The company “looks forward to writing this new chapter alongside Sanofi  which will remain a long-term strategic partner  BPI France and L’Oréal  and to serve our clients in Europe and globally ” he added.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.32,0.21,0.47,True,English,"['Sanofi ingredients', 'market debut', 'EuroAPI', 'six European API production sites', 'St Aubin les Elbeuf', 'chief executive Karl Rotthier', 'small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients', 'European drug producers', 'pharma ingredients business', 'largest API producer', 'lower-margin ingredients business', 'single largest producer', '500 other pharma companies', 'long-term strategic partner', 'L’Oréal', 'new growth opportunities', 'API market', 'ingredient producers', 'new chapter', 'starting price', 'early trading', 'Euronext exchange', 'declining market', 'market valuation', 'manufacturing services', 'rare diseases', 'supply chains', 'third parties', 'average rate', 'outsourcing category', 'same period', 'Euronext bell', 'new company', 'contract development', 'BPI France', 'Sanofi', 'spin', 'EuroAPI', 'shares', 'separation', 'world', 'APIs', 'Israel', 'Teva', 'portfolio', 'resources', 'medicines', 'oncology', 'immunology', 'time', 'concerns', 'reliance', 'countries', 'India', 'China', 'COVID', 'Russia', 'attack', 'Ukraine', 'sales', 'partnerships', 'order', 'advantage', '30% stake', 'year', 'Brindisi', 'Italy', 'Frankfurt', 'Germany', 'Haverhill', 'Vertolaye', 'Újpest', 'Hungary', '3,350 workers', 'ability', 'value', 'stakeholders', 'birthday', 'clients']",2022-05-06,2022-05-06,pharmaphorum.com

The spinoff valued Euroapi at 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion).Sanofi had previously planned to list the business via an initial public offering  but decided to pursue a spinoff instead due to market turmoil since the start of the year. Europe’s IPO market has been shuttered for the past two months as the war in Ukraine and soaring inflation weigh on investor sentiment.“The most important element was that we get listed and that we become independent ” EuroAPI Chief Executive Officer Karl Rotthier said in an interview. “That was the reason why  when we saw the IPO window was closed  we straight away went for another instrument.”EuroAPI  which had 892.8 million euros in sales last year  helps secure manufacturing and distribution capacities for Europe at a time of increasing supply-chain snags and shortages of essential medicines. China and India are among the countries that are big producers of drug ingredients.Sanofi  which retains 30% of the unit’s share capital  declined as much as 3.8% on Friday. The French government took a 12% stake in EuroAPI via EPIC Bpifrance.Active pharmaceutical ingredients are chemical molecules and biological substances essential to any drug. EuroAPI has more than 500 customers  3 350 employees and six production sites in Europe  according to its website.Early on in the coronavirus pandemic  France suffered from shortages of face-masks and some essential medicines. The government’s stake in EuroAPI reflects President Emmanuel Macron’s plan to bolster national sovereignty in areas ranging from pharmaceuticals and energy to retailers and food makers.Geopolitical tensions have also driven home the importance of the supply chain in this very strategic industry segment  Rotthier said. “We can play a very important role in European sovereignty as a reliable supplier for the entire market.”Investors got one EuroAPI share for every 23 Sanofi shares held. L’Oreal SA  the French drugmaker’s top holder  has agreed not to sell any stock in the unit for one year.BNP Paribas SA is the listing agent  also advising alongside Bank of America Corp.

The observation period has been set at six months.The Paris Commercial Court has also granted the Company's request to examine a plan for the partial sale of the company under the specific terms of the ""prepack-cession""  after a favorable opinion from the Public Prosecutor's Office (“ministère public”).Consequently  the Company announces that the hearing to examine the offer or offers  as the case may be  is scheduled for Tuesday  June 14  2022 before the Paris Commercial Court.The Company will inform the market of the Court's decision.In view of the above  there are no plans at this stage to resume the listing of Recylex S.A. shares.**** See press release of April 15  2022***Disclaimer : This press release is a non-official translation into English of the press release of the same date issued in French language and is provided solely for the convenience of English-speaking users.
