4338,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/intro/publications/html/ecb.targetsecar202205.en.html,TARGET2-Securities Annual Report 2021,1 day ago,Financial market infrastructures (FMIs) are the backbone of the financial system. They provide the networks through which financial institutions and financial markets connect with each other and through which financial transactions are cleared and settled. Therefore  it is essential to ensure that market infrastructures are safe and efficient  and that they provide for a stable and well-functioning economy. The Eurosystem is closely involved in this work as the conduct of monetary policy depends on the availability of reliable and effective FMIs  such as TARGET2 (the real-time gross settlement system)  TARGET2-Securities (the securities settlement platform) and TIPS (the instant payment settlement service).TARGET2-Securities (T2S)  in particular  was conceived as an initiative to address the highly fragmented securities settlement landscape in Europe. It was launched in June 2015 as an integrated platform for processing securities transactions against central bank money. T2S revolutionised securities settlement in Europe by offering a solution to simplify cross-border settlement procedures and to the difficulties caused by different settlement practices among countries.T2S provides harmonised and commoditised securities settlement to central securities depositories (CSDs)  and applies a single set of rules  standards and tariffs to all participant CSDs. This allows the securities settlement platform to lay the foundations for a single market for securities settlement and  as a result  contributes to achieving greater integration of Europe’s financial market. Today  the T2S platform connects 20 CSDs and processes on average over 700 000 securities transactions per day against both euro and Danish kroner.The report and its structureThis is the 11th edition of the TARGET2-Securities Annual Report  which now covers the fourth full year after the end of the T2S migration period. The first edition was published in 2011  a pivotal year for the finalisation of the legal and technical documentation of T2S and for the CSDs to prepare their T2S adaptation plans.This year the report presents the evolution of T2S settlement data  while confirming the continuity of operational stability and efficiency. It describes the developments which took place in T2S in 2021 as well as some of the main incidents that had an impact on the platform throughout the previous year. The report is mainly addressed to decision-makers  practitioners  lawyers  and academics wishing to acquire an in-depth understanding of T2S and how it works. In addition  it will serve the public with an interest in market infrastructure matters and T2S in particular.In addition to the core content  three boxes are included in this year’s publication. They provide in-depth information on the Market Settlement Efficiency Workshop V  the survey on on-hold functionality and late matching transactions  and the CSD Regulation (CSDR) and the settlement discipline regime that entered into force on 1 February 2022.1 Evolution of T2S traffic in 2021Table 1 provides an overview of traffic developments in T2S in 2021 compared with 2020. In 2021 T2S settled 187 377 873 transactions  with a total value of €178.30 trillion. This corresponded to a daily average volume of 726 271 transactions  with a daily average value of €691.10 billion. Compared with the previous year  there was an increase of 3.16% in the value settled  and of 6.05% in the volume settled. Settlement efficiency in 2021 was 94.07% in terms of value and 94.34% in terms of volume. This represented a minor decrease of 0.30% in terms of value and 0.18% in terms of volume compared with 2020.Table 1 Evolution of T2S settlement data and settlement efficiency Source: T2S.Notes: There were 257 operating days in 2020 and 258 operating days in 2021. EoD: end of day.1.1 Volume of settlements in T2SChart 1 shows the evolution of the volumes settled in T2S and settlement efficiency at the end of the day since the first migration wave was completed in 2015. As a result of the migration waves  the monthly total T2S settlement volumes increased from 1 815 790 transactions in September 2015 to 11 804 649 transactions in October 2017. Between November 2018 and December 2019  total T2S settlement volumes averaged 12 819 952 transactions per month. In March 2020  following the outbreak of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic  total monthly traffic peaked at 20 232 528 transactions. In 2021 T2S settled on average 15 614 823 transactions per month. Compared with 2020  the average monthly volumes were 6.05% higher in 2021. Monthly volumes peaked at over 18 million transactions in March 2021  although this was lower than the peak in March 2020. As traffic in T2S stabilised in its first few years of operation  settlement efficiency in volume terms became less volatile and averaged 96.85% between November 2018 and December 2019. Following the introduction of the new T2S statistical framework [1] settlement efficiency in volume terms decreased to 94.81% in January 2020. The particularly high volumes settled in T2S in March 2020 affected settlement efficiency  which declined to 92.81%. Between that date and the end of 2021  settlement efficiency in volume terms averaged 94.50%.Chart 1 Evolution of volumes settled in T2S and settlement efficiency at end of day (left-hand scale: number of transactions  monthly totals; right-hand scale: settlement efficiency  percentages) Source: T2S.Notes: Migration wave 1 refers to 22 June‑31 August 2015; wave 2 refers to 29 March 2016; wave 3 refers to 12 September 2016; wave 4 refers to 6 February 2017; and final wave refers to 18 September 2017. NCDCP (Slovakian CSD) joined on 27 October 2017; settlement in Danish kroner (DKK) available  and ID2S (French CSD) joined on 29 October 2018.In 2021 T2S settled on average 726 271 transactions per day. Chart 2 shows the evolution of the daily average T2S traffic in volume terms. The daily average volume per month ranged from 639 876 (in August) to 798 571 (in February). The highest daily volume settled was on 30 November (1 061 928 transactions) and the lowest was on 28 December (245 181 transactions).The minimum occurred in a period of lower traffic owing to seasonality  with the closing of the German stock market on 24 December as a key driver for the volumes settled two business days later. The maximum was likely influenced by the market conditions at the time. Overall  the number of transactions settled in T2S on a daily average basis in 2021 was higher than in 2020 (687 476 transactions)  despite the market volatility caused by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020.Chart 2 Volumes of T2S transactions settled in 2021 (number of transactions (thousands)  daily averages) Source: T2S.1.1.1 Real-time settlement and night-time settlementIn T2S  the new business day starts at 18:45 CET with the preparation for night-time settlement (NTS). NTS processing starts at 20:00 CET and is completed before 22:00 CET. It consists of two cycles. The first cycle is subdivided into five sequences and the second cycle into four sequences. Within the different sequences  a pre-defined set of transaction or instruction types is settled. At the end of the second cycle T2S submits  for partial settlement  all eligible transactions for which settlement failed in an earlier attempt in the same evening.After the end of NTS there is a short preparation period for real-time settlement (RTS)  followed by the RTS process. RTS is concluded by the end of the RTS process at 18:00 CET  but may be interrupted by the maintenance window. T2S Release 5.0 in June 2021 made the daily maintenance window optional. Additionally  the time of the weekly maintenance window has changed from Saturday at 03:00 CET to Monday at 05:00 CET. Since June the mandatory weekly maintenance window has been activated every weekend from Saturday 02:30 CET on Saturday to 02:30 CET on Monday. During the week the maintenance window is activated on an optional basis. When activated  it starts at 03:00 CET and ends at 05:00 CET. During the maintenance window T2S is closed for all settlement activities.RTS includes five partial settlement windows  at 08:00 CET  10:00 CET  12:00 CET  14:00 CET and 15:45 CET. In each partial settlement window  T2S partially settles new settlement instructions arriving in T2S that are eligible for partial settlement  as well as previously unprocessed or partially processed settlement instructions eligible for partial settlement. The first and the last partial settlement windows have a duration of 30 minutes each  while the others each have a duration of 15 minutes. The real-time settlement closure period starts with the DVP cut-off  which is harmonised at 16:00 CET for all currencies.In 2021 15 614 823 transactions were settled on average each month  compared with 14 723 437 in 2020. Chart 3 shows the total monthly volumes of traffic  broken down by NTS and RTS. The total monthly traffic ranged between a low of 14 077 269 transactions in August and a high of 18 249 070 transactions in March. This is in line with 2020  as total monthly traffic reached its minimum (12 487 334 transactions) and maximum (20 232 528 transactions) levels in the same months.Chart 3 NTS and RTS volumes in 2021 (number of transactions (millions)  monthly totals) Source: T2S.As depicted in the chart  there is little variation in the share of the total volume settled in NTS and RTS each month in 2021. NTS accounted for 52.63% of the overall volume  while RTS accounted for 47.37%  which is in line with the 2020 statistics (52.98% and 47.02%  respectively). In absolute terms  the monthly volumes settled in NTS and RTS both peaked in March  at 9 543 443 and 8 705 627 transactions respectively. Conversely  in percentage terms  the peak volume settled in NTS was seen in February (53.32%)  while the peak volume settled in RTS was seen in December (48.70%). In volume terms  delivery versus payment (DVP) transactions  which account for the majority of the T2S traffic  were largely settled during the NTS cycles (62.44%).1.1.2 Settlement volume by transaction typeFive transaction categories make up T2S volumes: DVP  free-of-payment (FOP)  payment-free-of-delivery (PFOD)  settlement restrictions on securities (SRSE) and delivery-with-payment (DWP).[2] Chart 4 displays total T2S traffic broken down by transaction type.Chart 4 Settlement volume by transaction type in 2021 (percentages  yearly totals) Source: T2S.Note: The category “Other” includes PFOD  SRSE and DWP.In 2021 DVP and FOP transactions were the largest contributors to T2S traffic  together representing around 96.56% of the total settled volume  compared with 97.24% in 2020. DVP transactions accounted for most of the total T2S volumes  with 72.66% (corresponding to a daily average of 527 732 transactions). FOP transactions represented 23.90% of the total T2S volumes (corresponding to a daily average of 173 590 transactions). PFOD transactions  SRSE transactions and DWP transactions together accounted for 3.44% of the total volumes (corresponding to a daily average of 24 949 transactions). The percentage contribution of each transaction type relative to the overall volume is consistent with the pattern observed in previous years.1.1.3 Settlement volume by transaction categoriesThe three largest securities categories contributing to T2S traffic in terms of volume are equities  entitlements (rights) and debt instruments. Chart 5 shows the daily average volume settled for each of these three categories. In line with previous years  in 2021 equities represented the largest share of overall T2S traffic with a daily average volume of 382 204 transactions (52.63%)  followed by entitlements (rights) with 195 235 transactions (26.88%) and debt instruments with 64 432 transactions (8.87%). The remaining share (11.62%) is attributable to other types of security. In 2020 the weight of equities and debt instruments was higher (58.52% and 9.57%  respectively)  whereas the weight of entitlements (rights) was slightly lower (26.26%).Chart 5 Volume by securities category in 2021 (number of transactions  daily averages) Source: T2S.The daily average volume of equity transactions in 2021 ranged between a low of 335 271 (in August) and a high of 423 261 transactions (in February). The daily average volume of entitlements (rights) ranged between 161 328 transactions (in June) and 232 520 (in November). The daily average volume of debt instruments ranged between 53 547 transactions (in August) and 72 778 (in April). Throughout the year equities consistently accounted for by far the largest volume  followed by entitlements and then debt instruments.1.2 Value of settlements in T2SChart 6 shows the evolution of the value settled in T2S and of settlement efficiency at the end of the day since the first migration wave was completed in 2015. Following the migration waves  monthly total T2S settled values increased from €10.14 trillion in September 2015 to €19.14 trillion in October 2017. Between November 2018 and December 2019  total T2S settled values averaged €22.98 trillion per month. The introduction of the new T2S statistical framework considerably affected settled values  which dropped to €14.76 trillion in January 2020 (i.e. a decrease of 32.38% compared with December 2019). Similar to the trend in volumes  values also saw a notable increase in March 2020  reaching €16.74 trillion. Compared with 2020  average monthly volumes were 3.16% higher in 2021. Unlike volumes  in March 2021 values were higher than at the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic  standing at €17.06 trillion. Settlement efficiency in value terms averaged 97.52% between November 2018 and December 2019  largely in line with the average of 97.95% observed between September 2015 and October 2018. Following the methodological changes  the decrease in settlement efficiency between December 2019 and January 2020 was slightly larger in value terms than in volume terms (-2.33 percentage points compared with -1.73 percentage points). In line with volumes  settlement efficiency in value terms also dropped  falling to 88.95% in March 2020. From that date to the end of 2021  settlement efficiency in value terms averaged 94.40%.Chart 6 Evolution of value settled in T2S and settlement efficiency at end of day (left-hand scale: EUR billions  monthly totals; right-hand scale: settlement efficiency  percentages) Source: T2S.Notes: Migration wave 1: 22 June-31 August 2015; wave 2: 29 March 2016; wave 3: 12 September 2016; wave 4: 6 February 2017; final wave: 18 September 2017; NCDCP: 27 October 2017; DKK  ID2S: 29 October 2018.In 2021 T2S settled an average of €691.10 billion per day. Chart 7 shows the evolution of daily average T2S traffic in value terms.[3] The daily average value ranged from €620.04 billion (in August) to €741.88 billion (in March). The highest daily value was recorded on 10 March (€955.75 billion) and the lowest on 29 December (€438.34 billion). In line with volumes  the minimum was reached in a period of lower traffic owing to seasonality. Overall  the daily average value settled in T2S in 2021 was higher than in 2020 (€672.53 billion). The range of the daily average volume per month was narrower than in 2020  when it fluctuated between €567.31 billion in August and €931.42 billion in March.Chart 7 Values of settled T2S transactions in 2021 (EUR billions  daily averages) Source: T2S.Comparing Chart 7 with Chart 2  the highest daily traffic is seen in different months for volume (November) and value (March). This is not the case for the lowest daily traffic (which was recorded in December for both volume and value).1.2.1 Real-time settlement and night-time settlementIn 2021 T2S settled transactions with an average monthly value of €14.86 trillion  compared with €14.40 trillion in 2020. Chart 8 depicts total monthly traffic in terms of value  broken down by NTS and RTS. Total monthly traffic ranged from a low of €13.64 trillion in August and a high of €17.06 trillion in March. This is in line with 2020  when minimum (€11.91 trillion) and maximum (€16.78 trillion) levels were reached in the same months.Chart 8 NTS and RTS values in 2021 (EUR billions  monthly totals) Source: T2S.On average  RTS accounted for 65.09% of overall traffic in value terms in 2021 (61.67% in 2020)  compared with 34.91% settled in NTS (38.33% in 2020). As shown in Chart 4  settlement was more evenly balanced between RTS and NTS in volume terms (47.37% and 52.63% respectively). This indicates that the RTS phases were more value-intensive than volume-intensive and featured transactions with a higher average value than in the NTS cycles. In contrast  the NTS cycles were more volume-intensive than value-intensive.In absolute terms  the monthly values settled in both NTS and RTS in 2021 peaked in March  at €5 787.09 billion and €11 276.20 billion respectively. As a percentage of the total monthly value  the peak value settled in NTS was in February (37.52%)  while the peak value settled in RTS was in December (67.31%). 65.20% of the total value of DVP transactions  which represented the majority of overall T2S traffic  was settled in RTS.1.2.2 Settlement value by transaction typeThree transaction categories make up settlement values in T2S  namely DVP  DWP and PFOD  compared with five categories for volumes.[4] Chart 9 illustrates the total value settled in T2S by transaction type in 2021.Chart 9 Settlement value by transaction type in 2021 (percentages  yearly totals) Source: T2S.Note: The category “Other” includes PFOD and DWP.As for volumes (see Chart 5)  DVP represented the largest transaction type in value terms in 2021. DVP transactions were on average the largest contributor to T2S traffic  accounting for 95.52% (corresponding to a daily average of €660.15 billion)  compared with 96.38% in 2020. PFOD and DWP transactions together accounted for only 4.48% (corresponding to a daily average of €30.95 billion) of the total value settled  compared with 3.62% in 2020.1.2.3 Settlement value by transaction categoriesAs in the case of volumes  the three largest securities categories contributing to T2S traffic in terms of value are equities  entitlements (rights) and debt instruments. Chart 10 shows the daily average value settled for these three types of security in 2021. Debt instruments were by far the largest securities category in overall T2S traffic in value terms  with a daily average of €587.28 billion (84.98%)  followed by equities with €67.18 billion (9.72%) and entitlements (rights) with €1.14 billion (0.16%). The remaining share (5.14%) is attributable to other types of security. In 2020 the weight of debt instruments and equities was higher (85.55% and 10.02% respectively)  whereas the weight of entitlements (rights) was largely unchanged (0.15%).Chart 10 Value by securities category in 2021 (EUR billions  daily averages) Source: T2S.Note: Owing to the much lower values of entitlements (rights) settlements compared with the other two categories  the amounts are barely visible on the chart.Unlike in Chart 6  where equities are the largest securities category in volume terms  they are the second largest in value terms  whereas debt instruments are by far the largest category in value terms but are the third largest in volume terms. This suggests that equity transactions have a much lower average value than debt instrument transactions. Like equities  entitlements (rights) contribute far more to settlement volumes than to values.1.3 Settlement efficiencySettlement efficiency measures the efficiency of the settlement engine of the T2S platform. It compares the volume (or value) of transactions that are settled on a given day with the total volume (or value) of transactions eligible for settlement on that day.[5]Charts 11 and 12 show the evolution of settlement efficiency in T2S in 2021  at end of day (EOD) and after NTS respectively.Chart 11 Settlement efficiency at end of day in 2021 (percentages  at end of day) Source: T2S.In 2021 settlement efficiency at end of day reached on average 94.34% in volume terms and 94.07% in value terms. This is in line with the 2020 calculations  when settlement efficiency at end of day averaged 94.51% in volume terms and 94.35% in value terms. In 2021 settlement efficiency in volume terms ranged between 93.18% and 94.79%  as illustrated in Chart 11. In value terms  it displayed more volatility  ranging between 92.78% and 96.20%. The minimum level was reached in December and the maximum level was reached in August  in both volume and value terms. During the fourth quarter of 2021 T2S recorded a significant increase in both the volume and the value of on-hold transactions  mainly owing to external reasons  such as volatility on financial markets. This  combined with the lower traffic typically seen in the month of December  negatively affected settlement efficiency. In this period the average settlement efficiency at end of day stood at 93.83% in volume terms and 93.31% in value terms.In 2021 average settlement efficiency after NTS reached 67.89% in volume terms and 41.82% in value terms (see Chart 12). This compares with a level of 67.85% in volume terms and 46.75% in value terms in 2020. In line with the end of day  settlement efficiency after NTS displayed more volatility in value than in volume terms. The minimum level was reached in December in both volume and value terms (66.09% and 38.53% respectively)  whereas the maximum level was reached in February in volume terms (69.54%) and in January in value terms (46.51%).Chart 12 Settlement efficiency after NTS in 2021 (percentages  after NTS) Source: T2S.It is important to emphasize that the settlement efficiency is in line with market expectations and its evolution is discussed with the key stakeholders via dedicated Market Settlement Efficiency (MSE) workshops. See also Box 1.Box 1Settlement efficiency according to CSDR guidelines The analysis of settlement efficiency topics continued in 2021. A fifth dedicated Market Settlement Efficiency (MSE) workshop was organised in June. The main purpose was to improve on the calculation of the settlement efficiency indicator computed in accordance with the CSDR guidelines prepared for the fourth workshop  to support the CSDs in their preparation for the new regulatory framework. The enhancements encompassed aligning the treatment of partially settled transactions[6] with CSDR requirements and including late matching transactions (LMT)[7] in additional breakdowns compared with the fourth workshop. The indicators were provided at the global level  as well as by time of day  type of settlement instruction and type of asset. Moreover  a set of intraday settlement efficiency indicators was developed following contacts with the market. The CSRD settlement efficiency indicator (CSDR SEI) is based on the principle that transactions eligible for settlement that are not settled at end of day  irrespective of the reason  have to be considered as failures  thus having a negative impact on the settlement efficiency. In line with past results  the analysis showed that on-hold transactions were the main fail reason in volume terms in the reference month of February 2021  whereas in value terms lack of securities and on-hold transactions were the main fail reasons (see Table A). The asymmetric impact of the on-hold fail reason in the CSDR SEI for volume and value is mainly because the on-hold transactions are usually FOP transactions  which do not imply cash movements. Table A Main fail reasons in T2S Source: T2S.Notes: Calculations are for February 2021. Fail reasons are computed as a percentage of total failed transactions in value and volume terms. Particular attention has been paid to the intraday evolution of the CSDR settlement efficiency indicator  both in volume and value terms  with the aim of investigating liquidity usage and identifying settlement best practices to optimise settlement efficiency. The analysis looked at different points in time of the T2S business day  including the end of the two NTS cycles  the start of day-time at 07:00 CET  the end of all partial settlement windows (at 08:30 CET  10:15 CET  12:15 CET  14:15 CET and 16:00 CET) and the end of RTS at 18:00 CET. The intraday evolution of the CSDR settlement efficiency indicator in value terms showed two main increases throughout the business day: the first during the two cycles of the NTS phase and the second during the first partial settlement window scheduled for 08:00 CET. The CSDR SEI reached 33.97% in value terms at the end of NTS Cycle 1 and then jumped by 12.70 percentage points to 46.67% in a short time during NTS Cycle 2 (see Chart A). The increase was less pronounced afterwards (+3.90 percentage points to 50.57% in seven hours  from the end of NTS to 03:00 CET). The plateau observed between 03:00 CET and 05:00 CET was due to the maintenance window.[8] The CSDR SEI marked significant increases at each partial settlement window and reached 94.21% at the end of RTS  including the impact of LMTs. It is worth noting that the inclusion of LMTs has a negative effect on the CSDR SEI at the end of RTS  because it increases the number of transactions that are considered to be unsettled. Excluding the impact of LMTs  the CSDR SEI would increase to 94.78%. Chart A Evolution of the intraday settlement efficiency indicator in T2S in value terms (left-hand scale: settlement efficiency in percentages; right-hand scale: total value in EUR billions) Source: T2S.Note: Calculations relative to February 2021. The blue shaded area represents the NTS phase and the yellow shaded areas represent the partial settlement windows throughout the T2S business day. The intraday evolution of the CSDR settlement efficiency indicator in volume terms showed that the indicator reached 58.12% at the end of NTS Cycle 1 and grew by 3.04 percentage points to 61.16% during NTS Cycle 2 (see Chart B). The CSDR SEI showed a further slight increase of 6.72% in seven hours (to 67.88%) from the end of NTS to 03:00 CET. It then rose consistently throughout the day  mainly from 05:00 CET to 09:00 CET  when the settlement ratio increased by 14.03 percentage points  from 67.88% to 81.91%. The CSDR SEI reached 89.57% at end of RTS  including LMTs. Excluding the impact of LMTs  the CSDR SEI would increase to 91.25%. Chart B Evolution of the intraday settlement efficiency indicator in T2S in volume terms (left-hand scale: settlement efficiency in percentages; right-hand scale: number of transactions in thousands) Source: T2S.Note: Calculations relative to February 2021. The blue shaded area represents the NTS phase and the yellow shaded areas represent the partial settlement windows throughout the T2S business day. In conclusion  the analysis showed that the settlement efficiency indicator based on CSDR guidelines reached an average of 94.78% in value terms and 89.57% in volume terms  including the impact of LMT  at the end of the day  thus leaving room for further improvement. No critical points in time during the T2S operational day emerged  as the main causes of settlement fails are related to certain market-oriented practices  such as on-hold transactions [9] and to a lack of securities. In addition  the analysis confirmed that the possibility of using multiple partial settlement windows during the day helps to increase settlement efficiency in T2S.1.4 Unsettled transactionsNot all transactions submitted for processing in T2S are settled on the intended settlement day. This may be because the resources (cash and/or securities) needed for settlement are not available  one of the two instructions underlying the transaction is set to on-hold or the instruction is submitted late. Unsettled transactions negatively impact settlement efficiency (see Section 1.3).Chart 13 illustrates the daily average volume of unsettled transactions in T2S at the end of the day in 2021. The calculations comprise of DVP  DWP  PFOD  FOP and SRSE transactions.Chart 13 Volume of unsettled transactions in 2021 (number of transactions  daily averages) Source: T2S.In 2021 the daily average number of unsettled transactions was 14 170  which is slightly lower than the 14 418 transactions reported in 2020. This means that  on a daily average basis  of the total number of transactions processed by T2S  5.66% were unsettled at the end of the day. Unsettled transactions reached a high of 16 449 in November and a low of 11 486 in August  thus mirroring the volume trends illustrated in Chart 3. In line with the results observed for settled transactions  DVP and FOP represented around 98.64% of all unsettled transactions in volume terms.Chart 14 shows the daily average value of unsettled transactions in T2S in 2021. The transaction types contributing to the value are DVP  DWP and PFOD.Chart 14 Value of unsettled transactions in 2021 (EUR billions  daily averages) Source: T2S.The daily average value of unsettled transactions in T2S in 2021 ranged between €14.75 billion in August and €34.52 billion in November. These figures are significantly lower than in 2020  when they ranged between €22.49 billion in October and €63.92 billion in March. In 2021 DVP represented 99.36% of all unsettled transactions in value terms  followed by PFOD with 0.64%. Once again  these results reflect the composition of settled traffic in value terms.At the end of each day  the unsettled transactions are not deleted but automatically postponed by T2S (“recycled” in technical terms) to the following business day(s). T2S attempts to recycle them for a period of time referred to as the “recycling period” before they are automatically cancelled. In other words  the recycling period can be defined as the number of days during which a transaction remains unsettled. Chart 15 shows the share of unsettled transactions and the recycling days required before settling.Chart 15 Average unsettled transactions per number of recycling days in 2021 (percentages  number of recycling days) Source: T2S.Chart 15 shows that on average 24.93% of unsettled transactions sent for recycling were settled on the following business day in 2021 (first column) and less than half of those (11.50% in total) were pending for two days before settlement. Only 1.11% were pending for 16 days (last bar). In 2020 these averages were slightly higher at 26.28%  12.51% and 1.16%  respectively.Box 2Survey on on-hold and late matching transactions Following the fourth workshop on settlement efficiency topics held in October 2020  a survey was carried out among the CSDs in T2S to investigate the reasons behind on-hold and late matching transactions in their markets. A total of 17 responses  covering 19 markets  were received. The results were grouped by the size of the reporting CSD and presented at the fifth workshop held in June 2021 (see Box 1). This box provides some key takeaways. On-hold transactions The on-hold functionality is a risk management tool aimed at ensuring the availability of the necessary resources before settlement is attempted in T2S. It comprises four types: party-on-hold  CSD-on-hold  CSD-validation-on-hold and CoSD (conditional securities delivery)-on-hold. Most CSDs  irrespective of their size  indicated that “party-on-hold” is the most widely used functionality  followed by 40% or more that use CSD-on-hold (see Chart A). Conversely  a minority of CSDs indicated that they use the CSD-validation-on-hold option  and only less than half of the medium and large CSDs reported usage of CoSD-on-hold. These results are in line with expectations  as T2S actors can set out the first two types of on-hold functionality  while the last two are automatically set by T2S in line with specific rules and conditions drawn up by the CSDs. Chart A Usage of the on-hold functionality in T2S by type (percentages  share of respondents) Source: ECB calculations.Note: The size of the reporting CSD is determined by its volumes in T2S. The results showed that the on-hold functionality is used for several reasons. First  it provides support for managing and optimising the settlement of specific instruction types and client resources. For instance  it can help prevent settlement fails that are due to a lack of securities when segregated accounts are involved and it supports ownership and position checks in the case of omnibus accounts. Second  the functionality supports the timely matching of transactions and helps prevent the settlement of cancelled transactions that are still awaiting the counterparty’s cancellation. Third  it helps manage settlement involving communities or markets outside T2S  where the partial release implementation may not be completed. At the same time  the survey highlighted that inefficiencies in the usage of the on-hold functionality can arise owing to the lack of straight-through processing (STP) and the presence of interdependencies  also with markets outside T2S. These may cause the unavailability of resources by actors along the settlement chain. Moreover  it was noted that the system design means that transactions are not prioritised by their recycling period in T2S. Owing to regulatory requirements  T2S actors may thus set transactions with an intended settlement date (ISD) less than 4 days on-hold. Late matching transactions As discussed in Box 1  LMTs are matched either after their cut-off on the ISD has been reached or after their ISD  and thus count as unsettled at the end of the day. The survey results indicated different potential reasons for LMTs in T2S. First  the need for information from own clients or counterparties and the submission of incomplete  invalid or incorrect instructions on either side can cause the late submission of instructions to T2S. Second  transactions in T2S can be matched late because the client submits the instruction to the CSD late. Third  business process dependencies  such as internal dependencies before submission to T2S  linkages between transaction flows or long intermediary chains also play a role. Overall  the survey offered interesting insights into on-hold and LMTs from a market perspective. This can help the T2S operator better understand the way T2S actors make use of the available functionalities and consider implementing changes to address potential issues. It can also be considered a stock-taking exercise for the market  which may result in guiding and encouraging clients in the use of specific functionalities  promoting information sharing between counterparties or developing market practices.1.5 Use of auto-collateralisationAuto-collateralisation in T2S is an intraday credit operation granted by a central bank which is triggered when a T2S dedicated cash account (DCA) holder does not have enough funds to settle securities transactions. Its ultimate purpose is to improve the buyer’s cash position and secure the funds necessary to settle the transaction. Auto-collateralisation is an automatic process which is aimed at facilitating smooth real-time DVP settlement in central bank money.Two types of auto-collateralisation are available in T2S:auto-collateralisation on-flow refers to the use of the securities which are about to be purchased as collateral to secure the necessary credit to complete the transaction;auto-collateralisation on-stock is the use of other securities already held by the buyer as collateral to complete the transaction.In 2021 the overall use of auto-collateralisation reached a daily average value of €115.79 billion  compared with €103.45 billion in 2020. Chart 16 shows the daily average value of auto-collateralisation per month  broken down by type. The daily average use of auto-collateralisation ranged between €106.00 billion in June and €126.41 billion in March.Chart 16 Auto-collateralisation use by type in 2021 (left-hand scale: EUR billions  daily averages; right-hand scale: number of transactions  daily averages) Source: T2S.Note: The chart shows use of auto-collateralisation by national central banks.The use of auto-collateralisation largely follows a similar pattern to that observed for daily DVP transactions settled throughout the year.On average  83.15% of the total value of auto-collateralisation was represented by auto-collateralisation on-flow (corresponding to €96.27 billion) and 16.85% by auto-collateralisation on-stock (corresponding to €19.51 billion). As in 2020  the use of auto-collateralisation on-stock remained relatively stable in 2021. In contrast  the use of auto-collateralisation on-flow displayed a more volatile pattern reaching a peak of €103.89 billion in March. The total monthly number of auto-collateralisation transactions ranged between 193 565 (in April) and 265 977 (in March).In 2021 the overall use of auto-collateralisation on a monthly basis ranged between €2 310.47 billion in May and €2 907.20 billion in March. Chart 17 shows the monthly total value of auto-collateralisation  broken down by RTS and NTS  and the value of auto-collateralisation as a share of DVP transactions.Chart 17 Real-time and night-time use of auto-collateralisation in 2021 (left-hand scale: EUR billions; right-hand scale: percentages  monthly totals) Source: T2S.Note: The chart shows use of auto-collateralisation by national central banks.On average  83.08% of auto-collateralisation transactions took place during RTS (corresponding to €2 068.28 billion) and 16.92% took place during NTS (€421.10 billion) in 2021. This compares to 78.61% and 21.39% respectively in 2020. The use of auto-collateralisation in RTS and NTS follows a similar pattern to that of the daily average value of transactions settled in T2S (see Chart 8). Auto-collateralisation use during RTS peaked in March (at €2 452.80 billion)  while its use during NTS peaked in January (at €515.79 billion).In 2021 the use of auto-collateralisation represented on average 17.54% of the total monthly value of DVP transactions settled and remained broadly stable over the year. This represents an increase compared with 2020 when this figure was 15.96%. As the chart shows  auto-collateralisation use as a share of DVP transactions reached its highest point in December (18.44%).1.6 Other aspects related to settlement in T2S1.6.1 Internally and externally matched settlement instructionsIn order to settle a securities transaction  the delivering and receiving parties provide the necessary details in the form of settlement instructions. The two settlement instructions have to be compared to ensure that both parties agree on the terms of the transaction. If the comparison is successful  the two settlement instructions are matched  generating a new settlement transaction in T2S. This process can take place either inside T2S in the module performing the validation and matching of individual settlement instructions (life cycle management and matching – LCMM) or outside T2S. In the first case  the settlement instructions are defined as internally matched. In the second case  they are referred to as externally matched.In 2021 728 354 settlement instructions were matched daily in T2S on average  compared with an average of 805 148 daily settlement instructions that were matched outside T2S. This represents an increase of 5.25% and 3.89% respectively compared with 2020. Chart 18 compares the daily average number of instructions that were internally and externally matched each month.Chart 18 Internally and externally matched settlement instructions in 2021 (number of instructions  daily averages) Source: T2S.Overall  47.50% of settlement instructions were internally matched  suggesting that slightly more than half (52.50%) reached T2S as already matched.1.6.2 Intra-  cross- and external-CSD settlementInvestors can access different markets linked to T2S through multiple technical channels. Depending on the number of CSDs involved  it is possible to distinguish between intra-CSD  cross-CSD and external-CSD traffic.Intra-CSD traffic refers to securities transfers where the delivering and receiving parties belong to the same CSDCross-CSD traffic takes place when the delivering and receiving parties belong to different CSDsExternal-CSD traffic occurs when the delivering and receiving parties belong to different CSDs  one of which is not in T2SIn T2S  intra-CSD transactions represent the majority of all settled transactions in terms of both volume and value.As illustrated in Chart 19  in 2021 the daily average volume of intra-CSD transactions represented 98.42% (compared with 98.63% in 2020) of the total T2S settlement volume  while the daily average value of intra-CSD settlement represented 96.90% (97.26% in 2020) of the total T2S settlement value.Chart 19 Intra-CSD settlement in 2021 (percentages  daily averages) Source: T2S.Only a very small percentage is attributable to cross-CSD traffic. Chart 20 shows the share of cross-CSD transactions compared with total value and volume of all transactions settled  in terms of daily average volume and value  in 2021.Chart 20 Cross-CSD settlement in 2021 (percentages  daily averages) Source: T2S.In 2021 the daily average volume of cross-CSD settlement transactions represented 1.05% of the total T2S settlement volume (compared with 0.99% in 2020)  while the daily average value of cross-CSD settlement transactions represented 3.10% of the total T2S settlement value (2.74% in 2020).Considering that intra-CSD and cross-CSD transactions together accounted for 99.47% of the total volume and 100.00% of the total value  the share of external-CSD settlement was negligible in 2021.1.7 Interaction between T2S and connected RTGS systemsAt the start of each day liquidity is sent from the RTGS accounts in TARGET2 and Kronos2 (see Section 1.7.2) to the DCAs in T2S  while towards the end of RTS  at the latest  any remaining liquidity in DCAs is returned from T2S to the corresponding RTGS accounts. During the day  liquidity can be freely transferred from the RTGS systems to T2S and vice versa.1.7.1 Interaction between T2S and TARGET2Inbound liquidity transfers are transfers from the TARGET2 RTGS accounts to the T2S DCAs  while outbound liquidity transfers are transfers from the T2S DCAs to the TARGET2 RTGS accounts.Chart 21 shows the daily average volumes of liquidity transfers between TARGET2 RTGS accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021. The daily average volume of inbound liquidity transfers from TARGET2 was 614  while the daily average volume of outbound liquidity transfers to TARGET2 was 1 073.Chart 21 Volume of liquidity transfers between TARGET2 RTGS accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021 (number of transactions  daily averages) Source: T2S.Chart 22 shows the daily average value of liquidity transfers between TARGET2 RTGS accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021. The daily average value of inbound liquidity transfers from TARGET2 was €140.05 billion  while the daily average value of outbound liquidity transfers to TARGET2 was €145.18 billion. Any remaining balance on T2S DCAs stemming from the discrepancy between inbound and outbound liquidity transfers is automatically transferred back to TARGET2 as part of the RTS closure activities.Chart 22 Value of liquidity transfers between TARGET2 RTGS accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021 (EUR billions  daily averages) Source: T2S.1.7.2 Interaction between T2S and Kronos2Inbound liquidity transfers are transfers from the Kronos2 RTGS accounts to the T2S DCAs  while outbound liquidity transfers are transfers from the T2S DCAs to the Kronos2 RTGS accounts.[10]Chart 23 shows the daily average volumes of liquidity transfers between Kronos2 RTGS accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021. The daily average volume of inbound liquidity transfers from Kronos2 was 47 transfers  while the daily average volume of outbound liquidity transfers to Kronos2 was 156 transfers.Chart 23 Volume of liquidity transfers between Kronos2 accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021 (number of transactions  daily averages) Source: T2S.Chart 24 shows the daily average value of liquidity transfers between Kronos2 RTGS accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021. The daily average value of inbound liquidity transfers from Kronos2 was €2.77 billion (corresponding to DKK 21.31 billion)  while the daily average value of outbound liquidity transfers to Kronos2 was €2.87 billion (corresponding to DKK 22.08 billion). Any remaining balance on T2S DCAs stemming from the discrepancy between inbound and outbound liquidity transfers is automatically transferred back to Kronos2 as part of the RTS closure activities.Chart 24 Value of liquidity transfers between Kronos2 accounts and T2S DCAs in 2021 (EUR billions  daily averages) Source: T2S.2 T2S Service level and availability data2.1 Technical availabilityThe Eurosystem pays particular attention to the proper functioning and operation of the T2S platform. The availability of the services is measured continuously and objectively at pre-defined components of T2S  throughout each Settlement Day  excluding the Maintenance Window.The use of key performance indicators (KPIs) is one of the measures applied to demonstrate how effectively T2S is achieving its punctuality objectives. The punctuality of T2S is measured by calculating the real duration of the following three phases of the Business Day and comparing these against the expected target durations.Start of Day (SOD) – measures the elapsed time between the Start of Day phase (event BDCD) and the End of Start of Day (event ESOD)Night-Time Settlement including reporting (NTS + reporting) – measures the elapsed time between the start of the Night-Time Settlement (event C1P0) and the end of the NTS reporting (event ENTS)End of Day (EOD) – measures the elapsed time between the Start of the End of Day phase (event SEOD) and the End of Day Reports (event EEOR)Table 2 summarises the average duration on a monthly basis of the different phases in a business day in comparison with the respective target durations. The figures show that the platform operated within the target expectations.Table 2 Punctuality2.2 Incidents in T2SThe Eurosystem is dedicated to ensuring the smooth operation of the T2S system during normal operations and to steering activities aimed at restoring the proper functioning of the T2S Services by mitigating the effects of incidents.In 2021 the T2S platform experienced three major incidents  described as unplanned interruptions or reductions in the quality of an agreed service for which a Crisis Managers' conference call[11] was required. Each of the incidents was followed up with a detailed report  which serves as input for continuously improving the service and for increasing capabilities for preventing or mitigating them in the future. Paragraphs 1.2.1-1.2.3 provide more details about the three major incidents that occurred in 2021.In comparison  in 2020 the T2S platform experienced 21 major incidents.As illustrated in Chart 25  throughout the year 2021 the service level indicator  computed as the weighted average of the platform services  was below the committed KPI value of 99.7% on two occasions (June and November). Nonetheless  the overall results demonstrate a consistently high performance by the platform in the remaining months.Chart 25 T2S Service level indicator in 2021 Source: T2S.2.2.1 25 January incidentA major incident occurred in NTS on 25 January 2021  causing event C1S4 to be delayed.The root cause of the issue related to a change in one of the database tables and was an unexpected consequence of the deployment of a minor change effected on 16 January 2021.This change proved to be inefficient with higher volumes.An optimisation at database level allowed event C1S4 to run at its usual pace and it was finally completed at 01:28 CET.As a follow-up to the incident  an alert was put in place to identify the possible reoccurrence of the issue with the access path  thus shortening the reaction time.2.2.2 14 June incidentOn 14 June 2021  following the deployment of T2S Release 5.0  the EOD reporting phase did not complete in its usual time frame. Instead  events closed and the BD change took place at 22:50 CET. The start of NTS (event C1P0) was scheduled 75 minutes afterwards  at 00:05 CET. Both the SOD and the NTS phases ran smoothly. Similar delays were also experienced on 15 June  after which a rollback of two changes stemming from Release 5.0 enabled a return to close to expected event durations.2.2.3 22 November incidentOn 22 November 2021  following the deployment of T2S Release 5.2  T2S dealt with an incident that prevented the proper closure of the Weekly Maintenance Window at a planned time of 02:30 CET on Monday  affecting outbound A2A traffic.The incident was discovered by the operator through the technical monitoring tool at 05:10 CET. The operator was able to identify a missing job run that had caused the restart of the message brokers as the root cause. Once the jobs had been executed at around 07:45 CET  the outbound flow was resumed. In the meantime  a considerable queue of messages had accrued  which was fully processed by around 10:30 CET.The late appearance of the alarm was caused by a wrong setting in the technical monitoring tool  which was subsequently fine-tuned to react to the changed weekly maintenance schedule introduced in Release 6.0.3 T2S financial performance3.1 Cost recovery objectiveThe financial position of T2S is determined by cost and revenue trends. The platform operates on a full cost recovery basis  meaning that all costs incurred should be covered by the revenues generated. The T2S pricing structure is defined in Schedule 7 of the T2S Framework Agreement and is also available in the TARGET Services Pricing Guide. T2S cost recovery is driven by three factors:the transaction volumes that are settled in T2S; the fees that are charged to T2S actors for using its services; the pre-defined T2S cost recovery period.3.2 Financial performance of T2SThe overall financial position of T2S is detailed in the annual T2S financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with specific accounting policies established by the Market Infrastructure Board (MIB). In the interests of clarity  the financial information is presented in a similar manner to a profit and loss report (T2S operating statement) and a balance sheet report (T2S financial situation report).The T2S operating statement shows yearly accumulated revenues (collected on a monthly basis) and yearly operational costs (paid on a quarterly basis). The T2S financial situation report provides a snapshot of relevant items in the asset and liability accounts.For more information on the T2S financial position  see the latest T2S financial statement for 2020.[12]3.3 Analysis of revenues collected in 2021Chart 26 displays the relative split (in percentage terms) in T2S revenues between settlement services (SETT) and information services (INSV). The SETT revenue derives from the core settlement services that are available continuously during the night-time and real-time settlement periods  except for a short period during the maintenance window. Information services include services related to T2S information items  such as queries and reports. As part of this service  a CSD or an NCB may query any of its assigned accounts.As shown in the Chart 26 below  in 2021 approximately four-fifths (80.6%) of T2S revenues stemmed from settlement services  while approximately one-fifth (19.4%) of T2S revenues stemmed from information services. The settlement services portion of T2S revenues has been increasing over the years (with a concomitant reduction in the information services portion)  mainly owing to the gradual migration of some of the largest T2S markets in the platform’s first years of operation  and to the increase in T2S prices  which became effective in January 2019.Chart 26 Share of T2S revenue split between settlement and information services Source: T2S.Table 3 displays the share (in percentage terms) of T2S revenues split between settlement services (SETT) and information services (INSV) detailed per tariff item. In 2021 the tariff items that contributed the most to the settlement services portion of T2S revenues were DVP (51.9%) and FOP (9.8%)  while the tariff items that contributed the most to the information services portion of T2S revenues were charges related to Transmissions (10.1%) and Messages bundled into file (6.0%).Table 3 Share of T2S revenue split between settlement and information services tariff items4 T2S risk management and compliance4.1 Risk managementManaging operational and information security risk is a key element of the governance structure of T2S.The T2S governance is based on the ECB Guideline on T2S [13] which lays down the responsibilities of the Governing Council and of the MIB in relation to T2S  including their risk management-related responsibilities. Thus  the Governing Council decides on the general operational aspects of T2S  including the TARGET services risk management framework. The MIB’s responsibilities[14] include (in full respect of the mandates of the European System of Central Bank (ESCB) committees) the preparation of a T2S risk management framework for Governing Council approval  its implementation and maintenance.The T2S risk status and assessment  including risk analysis and mitigation measures (where relevant)  is shared on a regular basis with the CSDs and the NCBs via the relevant fora: the Operations Managers Group (OMG)  the Project Managers Group (PMG)  the CSD Steering Group (CSG)  the Securities Managers Group (SMG) and the Eurosystem Risk Management Forum (ERMF). As part of their own risk management activities  and complying with their own national regulatory requirements  CSDs and NCBs actively contribute to risk discussions by providing their views on existing risks and sharing information about any risks their participants and/or they themselves may pose to T2S.Following a recommendation from the TARGET2 overseer  a common TARGET Services Risks Management Framework was adopted in 2021 for all TARGET services. The framework is based on a three-line model:[15] the TARGET services first line manages risks on a day-to-day basis and is made up of operational experts and managers whose main role is to ensure the efficient and smooth operation of TARGET services  while the TARGET services second line hosts the risk management function  and is composed of operational risk managers and experts  that are independent from operations and have a direct reporting line to the Steering Level. Both manage TARGET services operational risks and report regularly to the MIB  for their area of competence. Lastly  the third line is represented by the Eurosystem Internal Auditors’ Committee (IAC).4.2 OversightThe Eurosystem conducts the oversight of T2S as laid down in the Eurosystem oversight policy framework. The ECB has primary oversight responsibility for T2S and leads and coordinates all oversight activities. The oversight of T2S is conducted against a subset of the Principles for financial market infrastructures (PFMIs) established by the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) and the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) as considered relevant for T2S by the Eurosystem. The PFMIs are the international standards for FMIs  i.e. payment systems  CSDs  securities settlement systems  central counterparties and trade repositories. Although T2S does not fall within the definition of an FMI provided in the PFMI report  the Eurosystem decided to apply the PFMIs to T2S as these principles relate to functions performed by T2S  i.e. the settlement and recording of securities transactions.In the course of 2021  the operation function engaged in an active dialogue with the oversight function in order to follow up on outstanding oversight recommendations stemming from the various previous assessments. The oversight function acknowledged the progress made overall in 2021  as most of the actions planned for this year to address the oversight recommendations were completed (in particular those related to risk management  following the finalisation of the TARGET Services Risk Management Framework). The progress made in the implementation of the action plan to address the outstanding recommendations is constantly monitored by the ECB’s oversight function through regular exchanges between the two areas.In 2021 the operation function shared the information requested by the ECB’s oversight function to support the continuous conduct of the oversight assessments of operational incidents and changes to the system implemented with T2S Releases 5.0 in June 2021 and 5.2 in November 2021. Following the implementation of the T2S Penalty Mechanism with T2S Release 4.2 in November 2020  the operation function regularly informed the oversight function about the status of the dry run activities being conducted in the production environment before the entry into force of the settlement discipline regime in February 2022. Furthermore  the operation function provided the oversight function with aggregated settlement statistics and information on operational and financial performance  as well as on risk management  testing and migration activities  with a view to supporting the oversight function’s monitoring of T2S activities that are relevant from an oversight perspective. With regard to cyber resilience  in 2021 the oversight function progressed in the assessment of T2S against the Eurosystem cyber resilience oversight expectations (CROE)  and the operation function provided the necessary support to share the relevant documentation for the assessment and clarify specific aspects as required during regular exchanges. The oversight assessment report is scheduled to be finalised in March 2022 and the findings will then be shared with the operation function.4.3 External examinationT2S services are performed on a single technical platform integrated with central banks’ RTGS systems for all participating currencies. Under the T2S Framework Agreement  the Eurosystem and the CSDs have agreed that the performance of T2S services must be subject to technical and operational examinations performed by an external examiner. These examinations provide an independent  third-party assessment to all participating CSDs based on the established industry norm (ISAE 3402). The external examiner must be a reputable  internationally active accounting firm.The objective of these examinations is to provide the CSDs with reasonable assurance that (a) the organisation set up by the Eurosystem meets the obligations established in the Framework Agreement  and (b) the controls implemented by the Eurosystem are suitably designed  effective  and allow for efficient risk assessments to meet the security objectives.As required by its statute  the Eurosystem conducted a public tender in 2018 and appointed an external examiner for T2S. The third external examination of T2S services took place in 2021  which looked into T2S services in 2020. For the first time  the agreed additional checks for the control and management of cyber-related risks were included in the 2020 examination. Apart from some exceptions  the external examiner confirmed that the T2S controls examined were both suitably designed and implemented and had operated effectively throughout the examination period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. The findings and recommendations from the 2020 examination report will be addressed in a comprehensive action plan  together with the open actions from the 2019 action plan.The external examination for 2021 will be performed in 2022. These external examinations are a regular yearly exercise.4.4 Special reviewIn December 2020 the ECB appointed Deloitte GmbH to conduct an independent review of five major information technology-related incidents (not cyber incidents) which occurred in 2020  affecting payment transactions and securities processing of TARGET services. The review aimed to identify the root causes of the incidents  draw more general lessons and propose recommendations in the following six key areas: (i) change and release management  (ii) business continuity management  (iii) fail-over and recovery tests  (iv) communication protocols  (v) governance  and (vi) data centre and IT operations.On 28 July 2021 the ECB published Deloitte’s independent review. The report included a detailed description of the relevant incidents  the impact each had on TARGET services participants and the respective root causes. Deloitte also performed a thorough review of the procedures followed during the incidents  highlighting the weaknesses identified and issuing recommendations to address them.In its response  the Eurosystem accepted Deloitte’s general conclusions and recommendations  and committed to decisively address them.In the second half of 2021 the Eurosystem prepared an action plan to address the issues and recommendations raised by Deloitte in a timely manner. The action plan was further broadened to include recommendations issued by the Eurosystem oversight function and the Internal Audit Committee in relation to the TARGET services incidents that took place in 2020. In addition  for the recommendations on a specific TARGET service  the Eurosystem sought to design response actions that would apply holistically across the different TARGET services and the T2-T2S consolidated system due to go live in November 2022.Measures addressing several recommendations were agreed or implemented in 2021  while most of the remaining measures will be implemented in 2022. For some recommendations  market participants were also involved to ensure that their views were taken into account. For that purpose  dedicated sessions with the Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Payments (AMI-Pay)  the Advisory Group on Market Infrastructures for Securities and Collateral (AMI-SeCo) and the T2S CSG were organised. These groups will also be regularly updated on the implementation of the action plan until completion.5 System evolution5.1 Regular software updatesT2S evolution reflects changes in business needs  regulatory factors and applicable market standards  along with some changes considered to aspects of system maintenance. The typical T2S annual release schedule includes one major release and one minor release  including change requests and production problems  as well as two production problem releases  which only include fixes for production problems.5.1.1 T2S releases in 2021 (R4.3  R5.0  R5.1 and R5.2)On 20 February 2021 T2S Release 4.3 was deployed to fix 12 known production problems.On 12 June 2021 the major T2S release  Release 5.0  went live with the implementation of 19 change requests (listed in Table 4 below)  four editorial change requests and 27 fixes for known production problems. These changes covered a wide range of functional areas  including enhancements to the penalty mechanism  the cash forecast  and the deployment of several change requests related to the T2-T2S consolidation project  including making the maintenance window optional on weekdays.A second release solely for production problems (Release 5.1) was deployed on 18 September 2021 to fix 16 production problems.The minor release  T2S Release 5.2  deployed on 20 November 2021  included 13 change requests (listed in Table 5 below)  one editorial change request and four fixes for production problems. The changes included enhancements to the T2S penalty mechanism (see Box 3) and to the T2S auto-collateralisation functionality  as well as additional tools for handling contingency situations.The numbers of change requests deployed and production problems resolved in 2021 are shown in Table 6.Table 4 T2S releases in 2021Table 5 Change requests implemented in T2S Release 5.0Table 6 Change requests implemented in T2S Release 5.25.1.2 Future system evolutionIn 2022 changes to T2S will be delivered in two releases – Release 6.0 in July 2022 and Release 6.2 in November 2022. The changes planned for July 2022 will include the introduction of the new interface ESMIG and other common components developed for the T2-T2S consolidation project (see Section 5.4)  as well as a new technology for the digital signature of manual actions in T2S (the non-repudiation of origin). In November 2022 the T2S release will coincide with the go-live of centralised liquidity management (CLM) and RTGS settlement services  and will also include enhancements to the management of reference data as well as changes in preparation of the future onboarding of end-investor markets on the platform.In addition to the major and minor releases in 2022  two releases solely for production problems will be deployed  on 18 February 2022 (release 5.3) and 17 September 2022 (Release 6.1) respectively.Although it is acknowledged that changes to the scope of the planned releases might be proposed in the future  the number of change requests planned for implementation in 2022 are shown in Table 7.Table 7 T2S releases in 2022* * Changes to the scope might be still possible.For further information  a full list of T2S change requests and the detailed contents of each release can be found on the ECB’s website:List of change requestsProject Managers Group – scope of T2S releasesBox 3CSDR and Penalty Mechanism In line with the CSD Regulation (CSDR)  settlement discipline regime  which intends to apply harmonised measures at the EU level to address settlement fails  the penalty mechanism was included in T2S. The T2S penalty mechanism offers the identification  calculation and reporting of cash penalties to T2S CSDs based on the analysis of failed transactions in T2S  as well as a set of operational tools deemed necessary in this context. The T2S Penalty Mechanism Dry Run  which took place between 13 September 2021 and 31 January 2022  was a core activity in the readiness preparation for the CSDR settlement discipline regime. It gave the T2S community the possibility to test the T2S Penalty Mechanism in production conditions and detected a number of issues that could be fixed ahead of the regulatory deadline for entry into force on 1 February 2022. Furthermore  the exercise was suspended between 30 November and 3 December in order to concentrate resources in finalising the work on already identified fixes (testing and deployment) to improve the overall performance and stability of the penalty mechanism process. The main issues detected were performance issues that had an impact on the duration of the respective events. Owing to minor changes and technical optimisations the overall performance was improved  and the process became more stable.5.2 Onboarding of new CSDsT2S has also been constantly evolving in terms of participants. The following CSDs are currently working towards joining the T2S platform.Euroclear Finland. The migration of Euroclear Finland to T2S is scheduled for 11 September 2023 as the migration planning was endorsed by the MIB in July 2021. As an end-investor market  Euroclear Finland is expected to bring more than 2 million securities accounts to T2S  a significant increase compared with today’s operations.The migration of Euroclear Finland to T2S is scheduled for 11 September 2023 as the migration planning was endorsed by the MIB in July 2021.

Euroclear Bank signed [16] the T2S Framework Agreement on 21 December 2021 and is set to join T2S governance in the first quarter of 2022. The migration will take place in stages to ensure a smooth transition that enables Euroclear Bank to start offering its clients settlement services in central bank money. The exact date of migration has yet to be officially announced by Euroclear Bank.Euroclear Bank signed the T2S Framework Agreement on 21 December 2021 and is set to join T2S governance in the first quarter of 2022.

Under Croatia’s national plan for the changeover from the Croatian kuna to the euro (planned for 1 January 2023)  the ECB team has been supporting Hrvatska narodna banka (the Croatian central bank) and SKDD with their preparations to join T2S. On 17 December 2021 SKDD delivered to the MIB its self-assessment for migrating to the T2S platform and the Eurosystem is expected to take a decision in the first half of 2022 and offer the T2S Framework Agreement to SKDD for signing.Under Croatia’s national plan for the changeover from the Croatian kuna to the euro (planned for 1 January 2023)  the ECB team has been supporting Hrvatska narodna banka (the Croatian central bank) and SKDD with their preparations to join T2S.

Bulgarian market. The ECB team has engaged in preliminary discussions with the private (Central Depository AD) and public (BNBGSSS) CSDs with regard to a possible T2S migration  in the context of Bulgaria potentially joining the euro in 2024. The self-assessment exercise and subsequent Eurosystem decision to offer the T2S Framework Agreement is expected to take place in 2022.5.3 Exit activities of current CSDsComplementary to the onboarding activities reported in the last chapter  in 2021 two CSDs initiated activities to exit from T2S.NCDCP. After NCDCP’s decision to stop operating as a CSD in December 2020 and submission of the termination notice to the ECB in June 2021  NCDPD successfully completed its exit activities on 12 November 2021.After NCDCP’s decision to stop operating as a CSD in December 2020 and submission of the termination notice to the ECB in June 2021  NCDPD successfully completed its exit activities on 12 November 2021. ID2S. Following the decision taken by the shareholders of ID2S on the 30 September 2021 to liquidate the company  ID2S requested the Eurosystem to initiate the exit process from T2S. In 2021 the process was initiated and the exit from the test environments was successfully conducted. The exit from the PROD environment is planned for February 2022.5.4 Consolidation of TARGET2 and T2SThe T2-T2S consolidation project will replace the current TARGET2 with a new RTGS system and apply a CLM tool across all TARGET services (T2  T2S  TIPS and ECMS).The functional specification phase of the project ended in 2020 following the publication of stable User Detailed Functional Specifications (UDFS) and User Handbooks (UHBs).In 2021 the focus was on the update of these user specifications and preparing them for testing by incorporating change requests approved after the publication of the UDFS and UHB books. UDFS v2.2 was published in April and the different books of UHB v2.0 were published between May and December 2021.The T2-T2S consolidation project has also published explainers and examples to help market participants better understand certain concepts by gathering information spread across different chapters or specifications books into single documents.The next versions of the user specifications are expected to be published throughout 2022 before the go-live.Migration  testing and readinessThe T2‑T2S consolidation project will go live in November 2022 following a “Big Bang” migration approach. This means that the current TARGET2 SSP will be discontinued at the time of the launch of the new T2 service. Transition in stages is not possible because the current SWIFT FIN Y-copy message flow used in TARGET2 cannot co-exist with the V-shape message flow that will be employed by the new T2 service. The V-shape set-up provides for network-agnostic connectivity and enhanced information security.Following the Eurosystem Acceptance Testing (EAT) conducted up until early 2021  for the rest of the year the focus was on user testing. Central Bank Testing started in June 2021 and User Testing (UT) began in December 2021.In 2022 testing will be stepped up and the migration process will be intensively practised in a set of go-live rehearsal tests  some of which will include the whole TARGET community. T2 participants will be invited to take part in dedicated testing campaigns  e.g. billing  ancillary system procedures. T2 participants will need to successfully perform the mandatory test cases in order to access the new platform.The Community Readiness Reporting process follows the Community Readiness Framework which is outlined in the Migration  Testing and Readiness Strategy document. The readiness of the community to migrate in November 2022 will continue to be assessed against these milestones throughout the year in quarterly cycles.Further details are available on the T2-T2S consolidation project page on the ECB’s website.5.5 Eurosystem Collateral Management SystemThe Eurosystem Collateral Management System (ECMS) will be a single collateral management system used to manage eligible assets mobilised as collateral in Eurosystem monetary policy operations  replacing the current local collateral management systems.The ECMS will interact with the CLM module in T2 to ensure the settlement of payments stemming from monetary policy operations  corporate actions and fees  and to update the relevant credit line.In addition  the ECMS will interact with T2S for the settlement of securities and the management of the auto-collateralisation process. The resulting synergies are expected to benefit NCBs and all other ECMS players in their communities – counterparties  CSDs and tri-party agents (TPAs) – by contributing to the efficient exchange of securities  collateral and liquidity within the Eurosystem. It will be accessible via a single common interface across jurisdictions and facilitate the mobilisation of cross-border collateral.In 2021 the software development phase was concluded and EAT and preparations for UT started. Ensuring that ECMS stakeholders have the necessary documentation for their internal adaptations was a priority in 2021. The catalogue of ECMS messages and credit claim schemas have been published on the ECB website  as well as detailed information on the future interaction between counterparties and the ECMS (authentication of instructions  potential business configurations  the U2A and A2A roles that counterparties may hold  the business rules and status codes that will apply to them in the ECMS). Key information on readiness milestones was provided to external stakeholders  and work commenced on preparing the testing and migration activities. The series of workshops with CSDs and TPAs launched in 2020 was continued in 2021  to facilitate the understanding and effective preparation of these significant stakeholders for the upcoming changes that the ECMS will make to the way in which collateral is managed by the Eurosystem. The ECMS is scheduled to go live on 20 November 2023.Further details on the functions and features of the ECMS are available on the ECMS – professional use page on the ECB’s website.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.31,0.35,0.34,True,English,"['TARGET2-Securities Annual Report', 'Market Settlement Efficiency Workshop V', 'instant payment settlement service', 'monthly total T2S settlement volumes', 'real-time gross settlement system', 'new T2S statistical framework', 'fragmented securities settlement landscape', 'cross-border settlement procedures', 'different settlement practices', 'settlement discipline regime', 'central bank money', 'market infrastructure matters', 'commoditised securities settlement', 'total monthly traffic', 'central securities depositories', 'average monthly volumes', 'settlement efficiency Source', 'fourth full year', 'T2S settlement data', 'securities settlement platform', 'T2S adaptation plans', 'first migration wave', 'T2S migration period', 'Financial market infrastructures', 'late matching transactions', 'daily average value', 'daily average volume', 'TARGET2-Securities Annual Report', 'financial system', 'total value', 'single market', 'high volumes', 'migration waves', 'integrated platform', 'financial institutions', 'financial markets', 'securities transactions', 'T2S platform', 'functioning economy', 'The Eurosystem', 'monetary policy', 'single set', 'greater integration', 'Danish kroner', '11th edition', 'first edition', 'pivotal year', 'technical documentation', 'operational stability', 'main incidents', 'previous year', 'depth understanding', 'core content', 'three boxes', 'depth information', 'hold functionality', 'CSD Regulation', 'minor decrease', '257 operating days', '258 operating days', 'COVID-19) pandemic', 'T2S traffic', 'T2S.

In this unfavourable context  AKWEL limited its decline in activity to -4.4% on a like-for-like basis  which is comparable to the decline in global automotive production (-4.2%1).Products and Functions turnover was €239.1m  down -9.0%. The Cooling business (-4.0%) limited its decline  as did the Air business (-3.5%)  which gained market share  while the Pollution Control product line posted a sharper decline this quarter (-12.9%). Control revenue for its part continued to fall  to €4.0m  after unusual previous years.A still limited level of investments this quarter as well as a clear improvement of the working capital  with a return to normal of suppliers' debts and the continuation of the optimization of receivables  contributed to generating a significant quarterly free cash flow at €19.8m.Difficulties in the supply of raw materials and components will continue to weigh on the organisation and activity of manufacturers and equipment suppliers  exacerbated by international geopolitical tensions.

Sanofi has retained a roughly 30% stake.The company targets an API market valued at €72 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at an average rate of 6% to 7% per year until 2024  as well as an outsourcing category that has been forecast to grow at 7%-8% per year over the same period.It operates six European API production sites at Brindisi in Italy  Frankfurt in Germany  Haverhill in the UK)  St Aubin les Elbeuf and Vertolaye in France  and Újpest in Hungary  and employs around 3 350 workers.“We are fully confident in our ability to unlock further value for all our stakeholders ” said chief executive Karl Rotthier  as he rang the Euronext bell on what is his birthday.The company “looks forward to writing this new chapter alongside Sanofi  which will remain a long-term strategic partner  BPI France and L’Oréal  and to serve our clients in Europe and globally ” he added.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.03,mixed,0.32,0.21,0.47,True,English,"['Sanofi ingredients', 'market debut', 'EuroAPI', 'six European API production sites', 'St Aubin les Elbeuf', 'chief executive Karl Rotthier', 'small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients', 'European drug producers', 'pharma ingredients business', 'largest API producer', 'lower-margin ingredients business', 'single largest producer', '500 other pharma companies', 'long-term strategic partner', 'L’Oréal', 'new growth opportunities', 'API market', 'ingredient producers', 'new chapter', 'starting price', 'early trading', 'Euronext exchange', 'declining market', 'market valuation', 'manufacturing services', 'rare diseases', 'supply chains', 'third parties', 'average rate', 'outsourcing category', 'same period', 'Euronext bell', 'new company', 'contract development', 'BPI France', 'Sanofi', 'spin', 'EuroAPI', 'shares', 'separation', 'world', 'APIs', 'Israel', 'Teva', 'portfolio', 'resources', 'medicines', 'oncology', 'immunology', 'time', 'concerns', 'reliance', 'countries', 'India', 'China', 'COVID', 'Russia', 'attack', 'Ukraine', 'sales', 'partnerships', 'order', 'advantage', '30% stake', 'year', 'Brindisi', 'Italy', 'Frankfurt', 'Germany', 'Haverhill', 'Vertolaye', 'Újpest', 'Hungary', '3,350 workers', 'ability', 'value', 'stakeholders', 'birthday', 'clients']",2022-05-06,2022-05-07,pharmaphorum.com

Total expense ratio: 0.39%.Cumulative return is the aggregate amount that an investment has gained or lost over time.General Market ReviewHeading into 2022  the macro backdrop for risk-assets was already facing challenges from the expected slowdown in global growth  due to the resurgence of the Omicron variant and persistent inflationary dynamics. Further headwinds arose in the first quarter  with the threat of tighter monetary policy and escalating geopolitical tensions. At the beginning of the year  the market expected the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) to hike interest rates three times in 2022.1 This was considered aggressive at the time  given that the Fed was still expanding its balance sheet and growth rates were declining. However  the policy path quickly evolved as fears of persistent inflation began rising. With full support from the Biden administration  the Fed became very hawkish and led the market to price in more than 10 interest rate hikes for 2022  implying multiple Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings with 50 basis point hikes.2 Consequently  U.S. 10-year Treasury rates rose more than 83 basis points to 2.33%.3In the first quarter of 2022  Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine put further pressure on risk assets as well as inflation dynamics. Even though Russia makes up only 2.5% of the global GDP  the outsized influence of Russia on key global commodity export markets  such as oil (11%)  gas (17%)  wheat (11%)  and nickel (7%)  created anxiety among market participants.4 Russian-related sanctions and self-imposed sanctions by business communities further disrupted the global supply chain. Consequently  global energy and agricultural prices rose sharply  further pressuring inflation expectations. However  Russia did not cut off its natural gas flows to European markets  a move markets initially feared would be part of Russia’s counter measures against the West’s severe sanctions. Nevertheless  geopolitical tensions centered around the Russia-Ukraine war increased pressure on the global growth trajectory  while elevating the inflation outlook for the rest of 2022. One interesting observation by global central banks  post Russia-Ukraine escalation  was that central banks appeared to prioritize policy focus around stemming inflation as opposed to boosting growth.A macro development that received less media attention was China’s major policy pivot in mid-March. Contributions to China’s deteriorating domestic growth momentum include (1) the regulatory crackdowns in Chinese technology sectors  (2) the liquidity crunch experienced by real estate property developers  and (3) the risk of large-scale lockdowns in major cities due to surging COVID-19 cases. These finally forced the Chinese government to announce a major policy pivot when China’s Financial Stability and Development Committee (FSDC) signaled State-Owned Enterprises  including major Chinese banks  to support growth initiatives. Consequently  Chinese financial asset markets and assets sensitive to China’s growth impulse rebounded as the risk of China’s hard landing declined.For EM investors  Q1 2022 was an even more challenging environment as they had to recognize the losses from exposures to Russia in their portfolios. The swift countermeasures by the West in the form of economic and financial sanctions  including the coordinated efforts to freeze the foreign reserves of Central Bank of Russia  risked forcing Russia to default on foreign debt obligations. Furthermore  index providers’ decision to exclude Russia from widely followed bond and equity indices forced passive investors to crystalize losses at inopportune market timing. That being said  EM investors quickly differentiated winners and losers from the geopolitical crisis as the cost of the war was going to be unevenly distributed between commodity exporters and commodity importers. The terms of trade shock effects from higher commodity prices will likely show up in EM countries’ trade and budget balances in the coming quarters.EM credit markets faced multiple headwinds coming from (1) the sell-off in U.S. Treasuries triggered by the tightening monetary policy and (2) the credit spread widening driven by a deteriorating outlook from a growth slowdown and losses from Russian assets. Interestingly  EM credit markets were much more resilient than anticipated at the onset of Russia’s invasion  as the EM credit sector  excluding Russian assets  performed similarly to Developed Market credit markets during the Period. One likely explanation of the EM resilience could be that the surging commodity prices were a net positive factor for the majority of EM issuers.Portfolio ReviewDuring the Period  the Fund outperformed the Index by 306 basis points. The Fund’s lower duration relative to the Index and country selections positively contributed to performance (+108 and +232 basis points  respectively). However  the Fund’s security selection was a detractor (-34 basis points).5Heading into the first quarter  we maintained our underweight duration exposure as we expected global bond yields to move higher in the first half of the year while credit spreads were expected to remain elevated. Thus  our decision to overweight high-yielding assets over the investment-grade sector  given that there were more spread buffers to absorb in high-yield sovereign bonds  positively impacted the Fund’s performance.The largest positive contribution derived from our underweights in Russia and Ukraine  which added to performance by 256 and 17 basis points  respectively.6 We maintained our underweight position in Russia as the credit spreads were not sufficiently attractive relative to the ongoing headline risks of the military build-up. As the war broke out  we maintained our underweight positions in Russia and sold our remaining Russian exposures when the Euroclear settlement firm unblocked the settlement process of Russian securities. As for our Ukraine exposure  we headed into Q1 2022 with market neutral exposure as Ukraine bonds sold off aggressively in Q4 2021 in line with other bonds that have high volatility. However  we reduced our Ukrainian exposure as headline risks related to Russia’s invasion increased.On the other hand  the Fund’s underweight in Turkey detracted from performance. Given that Turkey’s external positions were vulnerable to tightening U.S. monetary policy and to higher commodity prices as a major oil and agricultural goods importer  we maintained underweight positions in Turkey. Furthermore  our overweight positions in Colombia  Brazil  and Morocco were further detractors from performance. Colombia lagged as the market remained cautious of election risks. Our security selection detracted from performance due to the Fund’s exposure to a South African technology holding company  Nasper  which had investment exposure to China’s leading platform (Tencent). The regulatory crackdown on the Chinese technology sector elevated the perceived credit risks of the issuer.During the Period  we reduced our exposure to higher yielding African issuers  as we believed that the negative shock to EM risk appetite will make it difficult for these issuers to raise capital from the new issue market  which may raise refinancing risks.Outlook & StrategyKey investment themes heading into Q2 2022 are: (1) the market’s pricing of the Fed’s aggressive quantitative tightening (QT) path  (2) the repercussion of global commodity prices on the growth and inflation mix  (3) the risk of an elongated pandemic lockdown versus delivering on pro-growth commitment by the Chinese policymakers  and (4) geopolitical escalation.At the time of writing  the 10-year U.S. Treasury has continued to rise due to expectations of a more hawkish path for U.S. monetary policy. However  the recent sell-off in U.S. rates was not driven by the Fed’s policy rate path  which is already pricing in 250bp in 2022 and another 75bp in 2023  but by the market’s pricing of the Fed’s aggressive QT path. The Fed’s QT plan is more aggressive than many in the market had anticipated  not only in terms of the speed at which maximum cap should be reached  but also in terms of the size of the maximum cap with potential for Mortgage-Backed Securities sale. We expect the rise in rate volatility to dampen the general risk asset sentiments.Secondly  the longer the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues  the more likely global commodity prices may remain elevated  further deteriorating the growth-inflation mix. The market already shifted the expectation of global inflation fading from Q1 2022 to the latter half of the year. With global central banks already prioritizing inflation risks over growth slowdown risks in their policy focus  global growth momentum will likely deteriorate further in Q2 2022.Thirdly  the big uncertainty for global growth momentum is whether China will be able to quickly overcome the slowdown brought about by COVID-19 lockdown measures. We note that China’s credit impulse  namely the monthly change of flows in new credit  was trending higher prior to the lockdown measures. We believe this reflects how China’s government wanted to stimulate growth before the Communist Party National Congress gathers in the Fall to announce President Xi’s third term as party chief. Similar to what we have seen in Europe and in the United States  we expect China’s growth activity to quickly recover as the Omicron variant appears less concerning to authorities than prior variants. Furthermore  we expect authorities in China to provide more fiscal support to offset COVID-19 lockdown losses and to support EM asset risk appetite.Lastly  there remains a risk that the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical crisis could expand to a broader European event by inadvertently dragging one of the NATO members into the conflict. With all of the top-down macro risks mentioned above  we believe one positive catalyst for EM markets heading into Q2 2022 is that investors have likely incorporated these risks in their portfolios.Given that the risk-reward mix appears tilted more towards downside risks than upside potential  we plan to position the portfolio more defensively in terms of duration and credit risks relative to the Index. However  we plan to use the weaknesses in the credit markets triggered by the market’s overly aggressive assumptions of the Fed’s policy stance to add to duration risks. We feel that the sell-off in U.S. Treasury markets are excessive  given that the current level already reflects expectations for more than 10 interest rate hikes in 2022  in addition to the aggressive QT path.From a credit risk perspective  we plan to move up the credit quality spectrum by adding high-quality issuers while reducing lower quality and high-beta exposures. We find the investment grade corporate sector attractive from a risk-reward perspective as they may provide better protection from downside growth risks given that their credit fundamentals remain solid. Our regional allocation mix favors Latin America over Asia and the Middle East as higher commodity prices and hawkish regional EM central banks could potentially provide safeguards against tightening U.S. monetary policy. From a country allocation perspective  we believe credit differentiation driven by sovereigns with healthy external balance sheets will be the central theme for EM assets as the Fed withdraws liquidity support from the system.Credit Ratings noted are by Fitch  Moody’s  and Standard & Poor’s. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from Aaa (highest) to D (lowest). If more than one of these rating agencies rated the security  then an average of the ratings was taken to decide to security’s rating.Related ETFsEMBD: The Global X Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EM is an actively managed fund sub-advised by Mirae Asset Global Investments (USA) LLC that seeks a high level of total return  consisting of both income and capital appreciation  by investing in emerging market debt.

Duration is expressed in years.Investing involves risk  including the possible loss of principal. International investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values  from differences in generally accepted accounting principles  or from economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. High yield bonds involve greater risks of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment grade securities  due to the speculative nature of their investments. EMBD is actively managed  which could increase its transaction costs (thereby lowering its performance) and could increase the amount of taxes you owe by generating short-term gains  which may be taxed at a higher rate. EMBD is non-diversified.As an actively managed Fund  EMBD does not seek to replicate a specified index and is subject to increased credit and default risk  where there is an inability or unwillingness by the issuer of a fixed income security to meet its financial obligations  debt extension risk  where an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation later than expected  as well as interest rate/maturity risk  where the value of the Fund’s fixed income assets will decline because of rising interest rates.EMBD may invest in securities denominated in foreign currencies. Because the Fund’s NAV is determined in U.S. dollars  the EMBD’s NAV could decline if currencies of the underlying securities depreciate against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currencies. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably.Carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives  risks  and charges and expenses before investing.

(“ClearStream” or the ""Company"") (TSX: CSM) today announced its results for the three months ended March 31  2022. All amounts are in Canadian dollars and expressed in ...","ClearStream Energy Services Inc.Records $110 million in revenue  the highest level for quarterly revenue since Q1 2020CALGARY  Alberta  May 05  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ClearStream Energy Services Inc. (“ClearStream” or the ""Company"") (TSX: CSM) today announced its results for the three months ended March 31  2022. All amounts are in Canadian dollars and expressed in thousands of dollars unless otherwise noted.“EBITDAS” and “Adjusted EBITDAS” are not standard measures under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of these items and limitations of their use.“Activity levels in the first quarter were strong as revenues grew by 8% from the fourth quarter of 2021 and represented the highest level for quarterly revenue since the first quarter of 2020  which was largely unaffected by the pandemic. We are actively working with our customers and suppliers to manage both the inflationary and labour supply pressures in the current market ” said Barry Card  Interim Chief Executive Officer.“The pricing for commodities in the end markets we serve continues to be strong and is anticipated to remain that way throughout the year. This is providing our customers with the confidence to increase their spending on both maintenance and capital projects  as evidenced by the 17 turnaround projects that we have scheduled for the second quarter. We are proud to partner with our customers on these important projects to build and maintain the integrity of their production infrastructure ” added Mr. Card.HIGHLIGHTSRevenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $109.8 million  representing an increase of $27.6 million or 33.6% from Q1 2021.Gross profit for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $9.7 million  representing an increase of $1.7 million or 21.1% from Q1 2021.Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 8.9%  as compared to 9.8% in Q1 2021.Adjusted EBITDAS for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $3.0 million  representing an increase of $0.8 million or 34.9% from Q1 2021.Adjusted EBITDAS margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 2.7%  unchanged from Q1 2021.Selling  general and administrative expenses for three months ended March 31  2022 were $8.1 million  representing an increase of $2.1 million or 34.9% from Q1 2021. Consistent with the last three quarters in 2021  the increase is largely due to investments being made to support our enterprise systems and digital strategy to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness. As well our business has recovered and stabilized in 2022  therefore  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work in 2022.Liquidity remained strong with total cash and available credit facilities of $37.4 million at March 31  2022  as compared to $33.7 million at December 31  2021.New project awards and contract renewals were $96 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 and $36 million for the month of April 2022. Approximately 80% of that work is expected to be completed in 2022.Story continuesMaintenance and Construction ServicesRevenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $99.4 million  representing an increase of 34.3% or $25.4 million from Q1 2021 and $5.4 million or 5.7% from Q4 2021. The increase was due to our customers increasing their spending on both maintenance and capital projects. We expect activity levels to remain high in the second quarter with 17 turnaround projects scheduled. We continue to focus on consolidating various scopes of work with existing or new customers by bundling our services in order to enable more efficient execution and lower costs for our customers on each work site.Wear Technology Overlay ServicesRevenues for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $12.3 million  representing an increase of 43.0% or $3.7 million from Q1 2021 and 36.7% or $3.3 million from Q4 2021. Gross profit margin was lower as we completed more fabrication work  which has a lower margin than the specialty weld overlay products that we market under the brand name AssetArmor™. With the continued rise in global energy demand and commodity prices  we are seeing our customers in the oil sands operating at full production levels  which has started to increase the demand for our AssetArmor™ products.Environmental ServicesWe continue to grow our capabilities by adding staff within our professional services. During the first quarter  we completed a large decommissioning project. We are seeing our customers continue to allocate expenditures for the closure  reclamation and remediation of oil and gas wells  pipelines and facilities in Western Canada. We expect this trend to continue with our clients regardless of the expiry of the government funded programs at the end of 2022 given the increased focus on ESG (environmental  social and governance) matters.FIRST QUARTER 2022 FINANCIAL RESULTS($ millions  except per share amounts)Three months ended March 31  2022 2021 % Change Revenue Maintenance and Construction Services 99.4 74.0 34.3 % Wear Technology Overlay Services 12.3 8.6 44.1 % Total 109.8 82.2 33.6 % Gross Profit Maintenance and Construction Services 7.4 5.9 24.9 % Wear Technology Overlay Services 2.4 2.2 10.6 % Total 9.7 8.0 21.1 % Gross Profit Margin (% of revenue) Maintenance and Construction Services 7.4 % 8.0 % (0.6 )% Wear Technology Overlay Services 19.3 % 25.1 % (5.8 )% Total 8.9 % 9.8 % (0.9 )%Selling  general and administrative expenses 8.1 6.0 34.9 % % of revenue 7.3 % 7.3 % — % Adjusted EBITDAS * Maintenance and Construction Services 7.2 5.8 24.5 % Wear Technology Overlay Services 2.3 2.1 10.9 % Corporate (6.5 ) (5.7 ) (15.4 )% Total 3.0 2.2 34.9 % % of revenue 2.7 % 2.7 % — % Loss from continuing operations (7.8 ) (7.6 ) 2.8 % Net loss per share (dollars) from continuing operations (basic and diluted) (0.07 ) (0.07 ) — %* “Adjusted EBITDAS” is not a standard measure under IFRS. Please refer to the Advisory regarding Non-Standard Measures at the end of this press release for a description of this measure and limitations of its use.Revenue for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $109 848 compared to $82 204 for the three months ended March 31  2021  representing an increase of 33.6%. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong market momentum in the first quarter in 2022  with an increase in activity across all areas of the business.Gross profit for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $9 740 compared to $8 045 for the three months ended March 31  2021  representing an increase of 21.1%. Gross profit margin for the three months ended March 31  2022 was 8.9% compared to 9.8% for the three months ended March 31  2021. The decrease in gross profit margin was driven by a few factors including a change in the mix of services and products provided with lower gross profit margins as well as inflationary pressures on labour  equipment and materials. The recovery of these increases in costs are being built into contracts collaboratively with our customers on a go forward basis.Selling  general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for the three months ended March 31  2022 were $8 052  in comparison to $5 969 for the same period in 2021  representing an increase of 34.9%. As a percentage of revenue  SG&A expenses for the three months ended March 31  2022 were 7.3%  unchanged from the same period in 2021. The increase in SG&A expenses is largely due to the ongoing investments being made to support the Company's enterprise systems and digital strategy. These investments  which will extend throughout 2022  are expected to drive longer-term efficiencies and increase our cost competitiveness. In addition  certain elements of cost reductions in previous years have been reversed in order to support the increased volume of work anticipated in 2022.For the three months ended March 31  2022  Adjusted EBITDAS was $3 006 compared to $2 229 for the three months ended March 31  2021. As a percentage of revenue  Adjusted EBITDAS was 2.7% for the three months ended March 31  2022 unchanged from the same period in 2021.Income from government subsidies includes the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (""CEWS"") and the Canada Emergency Rent Subsidy (""CERS"") received from the Government of Canada to assist with the payment of employee wages and rent as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CEWS and CERS programs ended in 2021. Therefore  the Company did not have any income from government subsidies during the three months ended March 31  2022  compared to$6 755 for the three months ended March 31  2021.Loss from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31  2022 was $7 783 compared to loss of $7 569 for the three months ended March 31  2021. The loss variance was driven by the reduction in government subsidies in 2022  an increase in SG&A expenses and an increase in restructuring expenses  partially offset by an increase in gross profit and the impairment of right-of-use assets recognized in 2021.LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESClearStream has an asset-based lending facility (the “ABL Facility”) comprised of (i) a revolving credit facility providing for maximum borrowings up to $15.0 million (the “Revolving Facility”) and (ii) a term loan facility providing for maximum borrowings of up to $40.5 million (the “Term Loan Facility”). As at March 31  2022  the Company had $12.0 million of available capacity under the Revolving Facility  $40.5 million drawn on the Term Loan Facility and $25.4 million of cash on hand.On March 30  2022  the Company amended its Revolving Facility  extending the maturity date of the facility to April 14  2022 from March 31  2022.On April 14  2022  ClearStream completed the refinancing of its ABL facility (the “Refinancing”). ClearStream established a new $25 million asset-based revolving credit facility with a three-year term (the “New ABL Facility”) to replace the Revolving Facility.The New ABL Facility provides for maximum borrowings up to $25 million with a Canadian chartered bank. The amount available under the New ABL Facility will vary from time to time based on the borrowing base determined with reference to the accounts receivable and inventories of ClearStream. The obligations under the New ABL Facility are secured by  among other things  a first ranking lien on all of the existing and after acquired accounts receivable and inventories of the Company and the other guarantors  being certain of the Company's direct and indirect subsidiaries. The maturity date of the New ABL Facility is April 14  2025. The interest rate on the New ABL Facility is prime plus 2.5%.The financial covenants applicable under the New ABL Facility are:The Company must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio equal to or greater than 1.00:1.00 for each twelve month period calculated and tested as of the last day of each fiscal quarter; and The Company must not expend or become obligated for any capital expenditures in an aggregate amount exceeding $10 million during any fiscal year.As part of the Refinancing  the maturity date of the Term Loan Facility was extended from September 30  2022 to October 14  2025 and the interest rate was changed to a fixed rate of 8.0%.The Company anticipates that its liquidity (cash on hand and available credit facilities) and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet its short-term contractual obligations and maintain compliance with its financial covenants through March 31  2023.As at March 31  2022  issued and outstanding share capital included 110 001 239 common shares  127 732 Series 1 preferred shares  and 40 111 Series 2 preferred shares.The Series 1 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $127.732 million) are convertible at the option of the holder into common shares at a price of $0.35/share and the Series 2 preferred shares (having an aggregate value of $40.111 million) are convertible into common shares at a price of $0.10/share.The Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares have a 10% fixed cumulative preferential cash dividend payable when the Company has sufficient monies to be able to do so  including under the provisions of applicable law and contracts affecting the Company. The board of directors of the Company does not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends until such times as the Company's balance sheet and liquidity position supports the payment. As at March 31  2022  the accrued and unpaid dividends on the Series 1 and Series 2 shares totaled $64.0 million. Any accrued and unpaid dividends are convertible in certain circumstances at the option of the holder into additional Series 1 and Series 2 preferred shares.OUTLOOKThe continued rise in energy demand and commodity prices continues to provide strong fundamentals for our customers in the energy industry. While these customers have been prioritizing debt repayment and returns to shareholders  they are starting to increase spending on both maintenance projects (to enhance operational reliability) and capital projects (to maintain/expand productive capacity). We expect activity levels to continue to recover throughout 2022.Due to the war in Ukraine and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic  growth in our served markets continues to drive some near-term challenges  including inflationary pressure on labour  equipment and materials as well as supply chain disruptions. We are working closely with our customers and suppliers to manage these challenges. We are also enhancing our programs to attract  retain and develop our number one resource  our employees.With energy transition and environmental considerations becoming increasingly important for all stakeholders in all industrial end markets  we expect that our customers will continue to focus on improving their operational processes for greater efficiencies and reliability  which aligns well with our service offerings.To better support our customers  ClearStream has continued to add new service offerings that encompass the full asset lifecycle and is now offering a suite of more than 40 services. Through the extensive regional coverage provided by our 19 operating facilities  we believe that ClearStream is well-positioned to further consolidate the services required at various operating sites while generating efficiencies and cost reductions for its customers.ClearStream's business model continues to prove its resilience as we are working closely with our customers everyday in helping them to effectively manage their operations.Additional InformationOur unaudited condensed consolidated interim financial statements for the three months ended March 31  2022 and the related Management's Discussion and Analysis of the operating and financial results can be accessed on our website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca and will be available shortly through SEDAR at www.sedar.com.About ClearStream Energy Services Inc.With a legacy of excellence and experience stretching back more than 50 years  ClearStream provides solutions for the Energy and Industrial markets including: Oil & Gas  Petrochemical  Mining  Power  Agriculture  Forestry  Infrastructure and Water Treatment.

These factors should not be considered exhaustive. Risks and uncertainties about ClearStream’s business are more fully discussed in ClearStream’s disclosure materials  including its annual information form and management’s discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results  filed with the securities regulatory authorities in Canada and available at www.sedar.com. In formulating the forward-looking information  management has assumed that business and economic conditions affecting ClearStream will continue substantially in the ordinary course  including  without limitation  with respect to general levels of economic activity  regulations  taxes and interest rates. Although the forward-looking information is based on what management of ClearStream consider to be reasonable assumptions based on information currently available to it  there can be no assurance that actual events or results will be consistent with this forward-looking information  and management’s assumptions may prove to be incorrect.This forward-looking information is made as of the date of this press release  and ClearStream does not assume any obligation to update or revise it to reflect new events or circumstances except as required by law. Undue reliance should not be placed on forward-looking information. Forward-looking information is provided for the purpose of providing information about management's current expectations and plans relating to the future. Readers are cautioned that such information may not be appropriate for other purposes.Advisory regarding Non-Standard MeasuresThe terms ‘‘EBITDAS’’ and “Adjusted EBITDAS” (collectively  the ‘‘Non-standard measures’’) are financial measures used in this press release that are not standard measures under IFRS. ClearStream’s method of calculating the Non-Standard Measures may differ from the methods used by other issuers. Therefore  ClearStream’s Non-Standard Measures  as presented may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other issuers.EBITDAS refers to net earnings determined in accordance with IFRS  before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  income tax expense (recovery)  and other long-term incentive plan expenses. EBITDAS is used by management and the directors of ClearStream as well as many investors to determine the ability of an issuer to generate cash from operations. Management also uses EBITDAS to monitor the performance of ClearStream’s reportable segments and believes that in addition to net income or loss and cash provided by operating activities  EBITDAS is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures and income taxes. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31  2022.Adjusted EBITDAS refers to EBITDAS excluding impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring expense  gain (loss) on sale of property  plant and equipment  recovery of contingent consideration liability  one time incurred expenses  impairment of right-of-use assets  and government subsidies. ClearStream has used Adjusted EBITDAS as the basis for the analysis of its past operating financial performance. Adjusted EBITDAS is a measure that management believes (i) is a useful supplemental measure from which to determine ClearStream’s ability to generate cash available for debt service  working capital  capital expenditures  and income taxes  and (ii) facilitates the comparability of the results of historical periods and the analysis of its operating financial performance which may be useful to investors. ClearStream has provided a reconciliation of income (loss) from continuing operations to Adjusted EBITDAS in its management's discussion and analysis of the operating and financial results for the three months ended March 31  2022.Investors are cautioned that the Non-Standard Measures are not alternatives to measures under IFRS and should not  on their own  be construed as an indicator of performance or cash flows  a measure of liquidity or as a measure of actual return on the shares. These Non-Standard Measures should only be used with reference to ClearStream’s consolidated interim and annual financial statements available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com or on ClearStream’s website at www.clearstreamenergy.ca.",neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,mixed,0.43,0.3,0.27,True,English,"['First Quarter 2022 Financial Results', 'ClearStream', 'ClearStream Energy Services Inc.
