This performance compares to a loss of 9.93% for the Fund’s benchmark  the JP Morgan EMBI Global Core Index (the “Index”) during the same period.The Index tracks liquid  U.S.-dollar emerging market (EM) fixed and floating-rate debt instruments issued by sovereign and quasi-sovereign entities.The performance data quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results.

Total expense ratio: 0.39%.Cumulative return is the aggregate amount that an investment has gained or lost over time.General Market ReviewHeading into 2022  the macro backdrop for risk-assets was already facing challenges from the expected slowdown in global growth  due to the resurgence of the Omicron variant and persistent inflationary dynamics. Further headwinds arose in the first quarter  with the threat of tighter monetary policy and escalating geopolitical tensions. At the beginning of the year  the market expected the U.S. Federal Reserve (FED) to hike interest rates three times in 2022.1 This was considered aggressive at the time  given that the Fed was still expanding its balance sheet and growth rates were declining. However  the policy path quickly evolved as fears of persistent inflation began rising. With full support from the Biden administration  the Fed became very hawkish and led the market to price in more than 10 interest rate hikes for 2022  implying multiple Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings with 50 basis point hikes.2 Consequently  U.S. 10-year Treasury rates rose more than 83 basis points to 2.33%.3In the first quarter of 2022  Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine put further pressure on risk assets as well as inflation dynamics. Even though Russia makes up only 2.5% of the global GDP  the outsized influence of Russia on key global commodity export markets  such as oil (11%)  gas (17%)  wheat (11%)  and nickel (7%)  created anxiety among market participants.4 Russian-related sanctions and self-imposed sanctions by business communities further disrupted the global supply chain. Consequently  global energy and agricultural prices rose sharply  further pressuring inflation expectations. However  Russia did not cut off its natural gas flows to European markets  a move markets initially feared would be part of Russia’s counter measures against the West’s severe sanctions. Nevertheless  geopolitical tensions centered around the Russia-Ukraine war increased pressure on the global growth trajectory  while elevating the inflation outlook for the rest of 2022. One interesting observation by global central banks  post Russia-Ukraine escalation  was that central banks appeared to prioritize policy focus around stemming inflation as opposed to boosting growth.A macro development that received less media attention was China’s major policy pivot in mid-March. Contributions to China’s deteriorating domestic growth momentum include (1) the regulatory crackdowns in Chinese technology sectors  (2) the liquidity crunch experienced by real estate property developers  and (3) the risk of large-scale lockdowns in major cities due to surging COVID-19 cases. These finally forced the Chinese government to announce a major policy pivot when China’s Financial Stability and Development Committee (FSDC) signaled State-Owned Enterprises  including major Chinese banks  to support growth initiatives. Consequently  Chinese financial asset markets and assets sensitive to China’s growth impulse rebounded as the risk of China’s hard landing declined.For EM investors  Q1 2022 was an even more challenging environment as they had to recognize the losses from exposures to Russia in their portfolios. The swift countermeasures by the West in the form of economic and financial sanctions  including the coordinated efforts to freeze the foreign reserves of Central Bank of Russia  risked forcing Russia to default on foreign debt obligations. Furthermore  index providers’ decision to exclude Russia from widely followed bond and equity indices forced passive investors to crystalize losses at inopportune market timing. That being said  EM investors quickly differentiated winners and losers from the geopolitical crisis as the cost of the war was going to be unevenly distributed between commodity exporters and commodity importers. The terms of trade shock effects from higher commodity prices will likely show up in EM countries’ trade and budget balances in the coming quarters.EM credit markets faced multiple headwinds coming from (1) the sell-off in U.S. Treasuries triggered by the tightening monetary policy and (2) the credit spread widening driven by a deteriorating outlook from a growth slowdown and losses from Russian assets. Interestingly  EM credit markets were much more resilient than anticipated at the onset of Russia’s invasion  as the EM credit sector  excluding Russian assets  performed similarly to Developed Market credit markets during the Period. One likely explanation of the EM resilience could be that the surging commodity prices were a net positive factor for the majority of EM issuers.Portfolio ReviewDuring the Period  the Fund outperformed the Index by 306 basis points. The Fund’s lower duration relative to the Index and country selections positively contributed to performance (+108 and +232 basis points  respectively). However  the Fund’s security selection was a detractor (-34 basis points).5Heading into the first quarter  we maintained our underweight duration exposure as we expected global bond yields to move higher in the first half of the year while credit spreads were expected to remain elevated. Thus  our decision to overweight high-yielding assets over the investment-grade sector  given that there were more spread buffers to absorb in high-yield sovereign bonds  positively impacted the Fund’s performance.The largest positive contribution derived from our underweights in Russia and Ukraine  which added to performance by 256 and 17 basis points  respectively.6 We maintained our underweight position in Russia as the credit spreads were not sufficiently attractive relative to the ongoing headline risks of the military build-up. As the war broke out  we maintained our underweight positions in Russia and sold our remaining Russian exposures when the Euroclear settlement firm unblocked the settlement process of Russian securities. As for our Ukraine exposure  we headed into Q1 2022 with market neutral exposure as Ukraine bonds sold off aggressively in Q4 2021 in line with other bonds that have high volatility. However  we reduced our Ukrainian exposure as headline risks related to Russia’s invasion increased.On the other hand  the Fund’s underweight in Turkey detracted from performance. Given that Turkey’s external positions were vulnerable to tightening U.S. monetary policy and to higher commodity prices as a major oil and agricultural goods importer  we maintained underweight positions in Turkey. Furthermore  our overweight positions in Colombia  Brazil  and Morocco were further detractors from performance. Colombia lagged as the market remained cautious of election risks. Our security selection detracted from performance due to the Fund’s exposure to a South African technology holding company  Nasper  which had investment exposure to China’s leading platform (Tencent). The regulatory crackdown on the Chinese technology sector elevated the perceived credit risks of the issuer.During the Period  we reduced our exposure to higher yielding African issuers  as we believed that the negative shock to EM risk appetite will make it difficult for these issuers to raise capital from the new issue market  which may raise refinancing risks.Outlook & StrategyKey investment themes heading into Q2 2022 are: (1) the market’s pricing of the Fed’s aggressive quantitative tightening (QT) path  (2) the repercussion of global commodity prices on the growth and inflation mix  (3) the risk of an elongated pandemic lockdown versus delivering on pro-growth commitment by the Chinese policymakers  and (4) geopolitical escalation.At the time of writing  the 10-year U.S. Treasury has continued to rise due to expectations of a more hawkish path for U.S. monetary policy. However  the recent sell-off in U.S. rates was not driven by the Fed’s policy rate path  which is already pricing in 250bp in 2022 and another 75bp in 2023  but by the market’s pricing of the Fed’s aggressive QT path. The Fed’s QT plan is more aggressive than many in the market had anticipated  not only in terms of the speed at which maximum cap should be reached  but also in terms of the size of the maximum cap with potential for Mortgage-Backed Securities sale. We expect the rise in rate volatility to dampen the general risk asset sentiments.Secondly  the longer the Russia-Ukraine conflict continues  the more likely global commodity prices may remain elevated  further deteriorating the growth-inflation mix. The market already shifted the expectation of global inflation fading from Q1 2022 to the latter half of the year. With global central banks already prioritizing inflation risks over growth slowdown risks in their policy focus  global growth momentum will likely deteriorate further in Q2 2022.Thirdly  the big uncertainty for global growth momentum is whether China will be able to quickly overcome the slowdown brought about by COVID-19 lockdown measures. We note that China’s credit impulse  namely the monthly change of flows in new credit  was trending higher prior to the lockdown measures. We believe this reflects how China’s government wanted to stimulate growth before the Communist Party National Congress gathers in the Fall to announce President Xi’s third term as party chief. Similar to what we have seen in Europe and in the United States  we expect China’s growth activity to quickly recover as the Omicron variant appears less concerning to authorities than prior variants. Furthermore  we expect authorities in China to provide more fiscal support to offset COVID-19 lockdown losses and to support EM asset risk appetite.Lastly  there remains a risk that the Russia-Ukraine geopolitical crisis could expand to a broader European event by inadvertently dragging one of the NATO members into the conflict. With all of the top-down macro risks mentioned above  we believe one positive catalyst for EM markets heading into Q2 2022 is that investors have likely incorporated these risks in their portfolios.Given that the risk-reward mix appears tilted more towards downside risks than upside potential  we plan to position the portfolio more defensively in terms of duration and credit risks relative to the Index. However  we plan to use the weaknesses in the credit markets triggered by the market’s overly aggressive assumptions of the Fed’s policy stance to add to duration risks. We feel that the sell-off in U.S. Treasury markets are excessive  given that the current level already reflects expectations for more than 10 interest rate hikes in 2022  in addition to the aggressive QT path.From a credit risk perspective  we plan to move up the credit quality spectrum by adding high-quality issuers while reducing lower quality and high-beta exposures. We find the investment grade corporate sector attractive from a risk-reward perspective as they may provide better protection from downside growth risks given that their credit fundamentals remain solid. Our regional allocation mix favors Latin America over Asia and the Middle East as higher commodity prices and hawkish regional EM central banks could potentially provide safeguards against tightening U.S. monetary policy. From a country allocation perspective  we believe credit differentiation driven by sovereigns with healthy external balance sheets will be the central theme for EM assets as the Fed withdraws liquidity support from the system.Credit Ratings noted are by Fitch  Moody’s  and Standard & Poor’s. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from Aaa (highest) to D (lowest). If more than one of these rating agencies rated the security  then an average of the ratings was taken to decide to security’s rating.Related ETFsEMBD: The Global X Emerging Markets Bond ETF (EM is an actively managed fund sub-advised by Mirae Asset Global Investments (USA) LLC that seeks a high level of total return  consisting of both income and capital appreciation  by investing in emerging market debt.

Duration is expressed in years.Investing involves risk  including the possible loss of principal. International investments may involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable fluctuation in currency values  from differences in generally accepted accounting principles  or from economic or political instability in other nations. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. High yield bonds involve greater risks of default or downgrade and are more volatile than investment grade securities  due to the speculative nature of their investments. EMBD is actively managed  which could increase its transaction costs (thereby lowering its performance) and could increase the amount of taxes you owe by generating short-term gains  which may be taxed at a higher rate. EMBD is non-diversified.As an actively managed Fund  EMBD does not seek to replicate a specified index and is subject to increased credit and default risk  where there is an inability or unwillingness by the issuer of a fixed income security to meet its financial obligations  debt extension risk  where an issuer may exercise its right to pay principal on an obligation later than expected  as well as interest rate/maturity risk  where the value of the Fund’s fixed income assets will decline because of rising interest rates.EMBD may invest in securities denominated in foreign currencies. Because the Fund’s NAV is determined in U.S. dollars  the EMBD’s NAV could decline if currencies of the underlying securities depreciate against the U.S. dollar or if there are delays or limits on repatriation of such currencies. Currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably.Carefully consider the Fund’s investment objectives  risks  and charges and expenses before investing.

May 05  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) — Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ: ZLAB; HKEX: 9688) today announced that the company’s partner argenx (Euronext & Nasdaq: ARGX) reported positive data from the Phase 3 ADVANCE trial of VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab).In adults with primary ITP  ADVANCE met its primary endpoint demonstrating that a higher proportion of chronic ITP patients receiving VYVGART achieved a sustained platelet count response compared to placebo. ADVANCE is the first Phase 3 clinical trial of a neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in ITP.The ADVANCE trial enrolled 131 adult patients with chronic and persistent ITP. Patients were heavily pretreated and 67% of patients had received three or more prior ITP therapies  including 59% who had prior thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RAs) experience  34% with prior rituximab experience and 37% with a history of splenectomy. Patients were insufficiently controlled at baseline with mean platelet counts of 17×109/L across all patients. Of patients who completed the full ADVANCE study  94% (63/67) of VYVGART-treated patients and 97% (38/39) of placebo patients continued to the ADVANCE+ open-label extension study.Highlights of Phase 3 ADVANCE DataPrimary endpoint metADVANCE met its primary endpoint demonstrating a significantly higher proportion of patients with chronic ITP receiving VYVGART (17/78; 21.8%) compared to placebo (2/40; 5%) achieved a sustained platelet response (p=0.0316)  defined as having platelet counts greater than or equal to 50×109/L on at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24 of treatment.Primary endpoint responders were observed across patient types regardless of age  disease severity  time since diagnosis  prior ITP treatment or background medication.Key platelet-derived secondary endpoints demonstrated statistical significanceKey platelet-derived secondary endpoints showed VYVGART-treated patients had a statistically significant benefit compared to placebo on (1) cumulative number of weeks where platelet counts were at least 50×109/L in the chronic ITP population (p=0.0009) and (2) sustained platelet response in the overall population  including both chronic and persistent ITP patients (p=0.0108). Numerically fewer WHO-classified bleeding events occurred in treated patients throughout the trial but the difference from placebo was not statistically significant. A higher proportion of treated patients in the overall population achieved a durable  sustained platelet response compared to placebo  defined as a sustained platelet response on at least six of the last eight scheduled visits between weeks 17 and 24 of treatment (p=0.0265)  but was not considered statistically significant based on hierarchical testing.Additional secondary endpoints provided clinically meaningful data on platelet count responses throughout 24-week trialAdditional secondary endpoint data from the ADVANCE trial are consistent with primary and secondary platelet-derived endpoints and provide additional context on metrics that often drive treatment decisions.International Working Group (IWG) responder status : 51.2% of VYVGART-treated patients were classified as IWG responders and 27.9% as complete responders compared to 20% of placebo patients as IWG responders and 4.4% as complete responders. IWG responders are defined as having a platelet count of at least 30×109/L  a two-fold increase in platelet count from baseline  and the absence of bleeding for two separate  consecutive weekly visits. Complete responders are patients with platelet counts of 100×109/L and the absence of bleeding for two separate  consecutive weekly visits.: 51.2% of VYVGART-treated patients were classified as IWG responders and 27.9% as complete responders compared to 20% of placebo patients as IWG responders and 4.4% as complete responders. IWG responders are defined as having a platelet count of at least 30×109/L  a two-fold increase in platelet count from baseline  and the absence of bleeding for two separate  consecutive weekly visits. Complete responders are patients with platelet counts of 100×109/L and the absence of bleeding for two separate  consecutive weekly visits. Mean platelet count change from baseline : VYVGART-treated patients demonstrated a rapid onset of platelet count improvement with statistically significant separation from placebo observed at week one and maintained through 20 out of 24 weeks of the trial.: VYVGART-treated patients demonstrated a rapid onset of platelet count improvement with statistically significant separation from placebo observed at week one and maintained through 20 out of 24 weeks of the trial. Switch to biweekly dosing: Ten VYVGART-treated patients switched to a biweekly (every two weeks) dosing schedule after achieving platelet counts of 100×109/L for three out of four consecutive visits  compared to one placebo patient. Nine of the ten treated patients achieved a sustained platelet response.Consistent safety and tolerability profileADVANCE is the second registrational trial of VYVGART and the first to evaluate chronic weekly dosing. VYVGART was well-tolerated in this 24-week study and the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous clinical trials.The Phase 3 ADVANCE trial is the first of two registrational trials being conducted as part of the ongoing ITP development program. ADVANCE-SC is evaluating subcutaneous efgartigimod for the treatment of primary ITP.In November 2021  Zai Lab announced that the first patient with primary ITP was treated with efgartigimod in Greater China (mainland China  Hong Kong  Macau  and Taiwan) as part of the global registrational ADVANCE-SC Phase 3 study.Topline data from the ADVANCE-SC study are expected in the first quarter of 2023.Phase 3 ADVANCE Trial DesignThe Phase 3 ADVANCE trial was a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  multicenter  global trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of VYVGART in adult patients with chronic or persistent primary ITP. ​A total of 131 adult patients with primary ITP in North America  Europe and Japan enrolled in the trial and received VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Enrolled patients had a confirmed ITP diagnosis and a mean entry platelet count of less than 30×109/L. Patients were on a stable dose of at least one ITP treatment prior to randomization and had received at least one prior therapy. Concomitant medications permitted included corticosteroids  nonsteroidal immunosuppressive drugs  fostamatinib or TPO-RAs. If patients were on ‘watch and wait’ at baseline  they had to have received at least 2 prior treatments for ITP. ​Patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive VYVGART or placebo for a total of 24 weeks as part of the primary trial. Randomized patients received weekly infusions from weeks 1-4 and were eligible to adjust frequency to bi-weekly depending on platelet count. Administration frequency was fixed from study visits 16-24. ​The primary endpoint was measured by the proportion of patients with chronic ITP with a sustained platelet count response defined as achieving platelet counts of greater than or equal to 50×109/L for at least four of the last six scheduled visits between weeks 19 and 24. Patients who received rescue therapy at week 12 or later  or for whom dose and/or frequency of concurrent ITP therapies increased at week 12 or later  were considered non-responders. ​Key secondary endpoints included extent of disease control over 24-week treatment period  proportion of overall population with sustained platelet count response  incidence and severity of WHO-classified bleeding events and an extended primary endpoint analysis between weeks 17 and 24.About Immune Thrombocytopenia (ITP)Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder where immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies destroy platelets and reduce platelet production  which can lead to an increased risk of excessive bleeding and bruising. In severe cases  frequent bleeding events can cause anemia or even brain hemorrhage in rare cases. ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health  including anxiety  fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so there remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options.About ITP in ChinaThe prevalence of ITP in Greater China is estimated at 120 000 patients. Current first-line treatments are corticosteroids and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). However  there are concerns about side effects of corticosteroids  and there is limited access to IVIg therapy. Second-line treatment options are primarily thrombopoietic agents  rituximab  and splenectomy. Despite availability of these treatments with differing mechanisms of action  many patients develop resistance to treatment and are prone to relapse. There remains a significant need for new treatment options.About VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating immunoglobulin G (IgG) autoantibodies. It is the first and only approved FcRn blocker. VYVGART is approved in the United States for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is being studied in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and other IgG autoantibody-mediated diseases.Zai Lab has an exclusive license agreement with argenx to develop and commercialize efgartigimod in Greater China.About Zai LabZai Lab (NASDAQ: ZLAB; HKEX: 9688) is a patient-focused  innovative  commercial-stage  global biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing therapies that address medical conditions with unmet needs in oncology  autoimmune disorders  infectious diseases  and neuroscience.

The publication “A Randomized  Controlled Comparison of NCX 470 (0.021%  0.042% and 0.065%) and Latanoprost 0.005% in Patients with Open-Angle Glaucoma or Ocular Hypertension: The Dolomites Study”» is available by clicking here. NCX 470 is currently in two Phase 3 clinical trials.Dolomites was a dose-response Phase 2 clinical trial comparing three concentrations of NCX 470 ophthalmic solution (0.021%  0.042%  and 0.065%) to latanoprost ophthalmic solution  0.005% in 433 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Aligned with previously reported topline results on Dolomites  NCX 470 0.065% achieved statistical superiority compared to latanoprost 0.005% at all time-matched points measured on day 28  with a peak improvement in intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering of 1.4 mmHg greater than latanoprost. All tested concentrations of NCX 470 were statistically non-inferior to latanoprost and the dose response of NCX 470 showed improved IOP lowering with each incremental concentration. NCX 470 was safe and well-tolerated with no drug-related serious adverse events and no evidence of treatment-related systemic side effects.“As presented at the American Glaucoma Society in February 2020 by Dr David Wirta  the Dolomites Phase 2 data demonstrate that NCX 470  a monotherapy with a dual mechanism of action  has the potential to be a new standard of care for reducing intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.” said Doug Hubatsch  Chief Scientific Officer of Nicox. “We are pleased to be able to share the results of this Phase 2 trial in a peer-reviewed publication with the international glaucoma community. We are looking forward to the results of the subsequent Phase 3 trials of NCX 470 – Mont Blanc and Denali – which use a higher dose of NCX 470  based on the results of an initial adaptive design dose-ranging phase of the Mont Blanc trial.”NCX 470 is currently enrolling patients in two multi-regional Phase 3 glaucoma clinical trials  Mont Blanc and Denali.
