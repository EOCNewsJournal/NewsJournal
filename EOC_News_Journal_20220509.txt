At least that's what the very p…,"According to thierry Ehrmann  CEO and Founder of Artprice and the Artmarket.com group  ""All the conditions are in place for a new landmark. Last year  a Picasso painting sold for $103 million  but the record that really impressed was the $69 million for a work by Beeple. The market took real risks  which it had not done since the Salvator Mundi in 2017  the only result to ever cross the $200 million threshold"". Caution and reason do not always prevail when it comes to bidding on a truly iconic work. But Artprice has nevertheless identified five reasons justifying an estimate of $200 million: the exceptional characteristics of the work and the perfect timing of the sale could indeed galvanize the bidding.1. Andy Warhol's market at an apexComing out of the health crisis  Andy Warhol's prices are as buoyant as ever. In 2021  his auction turnover reached $348 million  exceeding the $300 million threshold for the first time in six years thanks to some 1 600 works sold worldwide. In terms of annual turnover  Andy Warhol was once again the third most successful artist in the world  behind Pablo Picasso and his friend Jean-Michel Basquiat.https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-art-market-in-2021/top-500-artists-by-auction-turnoverOn 15 November 2021  his painting Nine Marilyn (1962) was one of the centerpieces of Sotheby's Macklowe Collection sale  the most valuable collection ever sold at auction. Estimated between $40 and $60 million  the canvas was finally acquired for $47.4 million. A relatively modest result  it nevertheless marked the relaunch of the ultra high-end Warhol market and reassured sellers.2. The best period of creationWhile Warhol works circulate abundantly in auction rooms  his masterpieces remain relatively rare  in particular the most famous series  including Campbell Soup  Mao  Jackie Kennedy  etc. Among these paintings  the color pieces are now almost all in major museums. Of Andy Warhol's five best auction results  four have been works in black and white and the fifth  a work in black and green. None of them sport truly Pop colors.Top 5 Andy Warhol auction results1. Silver Car Crash (1963) – $105.4 million - 13/11/2013 – Sotheby's NY2. Triple Elvis (1963) – $81.9 million - 12/11 /2014 – Christie's NY3. Green Car Crash (1963) – $71.7 million - 05/16/2007 – Christie's NY4. Four Marlons (1966) – $69.6 million - 11/12/2014 – Christie's NY5. Men in her life (1962) – $63.4 million - 08/11/2010 – Phillips de Pury NYThese five works were all created in the 1960s  Andy Warhol's most creative decade. He also created the Shot Marilyn series in the 60s  including the piece that Christie's will be offering on Monday 9 May. Until now  only one painting from this series has been auctioned: Shot Red Marilyn (1964)  which successively sold for $4 million in 1989  then $3.6 million in 1994 at Christie's in New York.3. A work with a colorful historyShot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) is from a series of five portraits of America's most fetichized actress in the 1950s  a series that the performance artist Dorothy Podber apparently tried to shoot. The story goes that Andy Warhol naively accepted her request to ""shoot"" the works  thinking of course that the young woman wanted to photograph them. The error was quickly identified before any damage could be done  but the commercial genius of the American artist turned the incident to his advantage. By adding one more story to the myth of Marilyn  of the Factory  of Pop Art and of 'appropriation'  Warhol succeeded in making the five canvases even more exceptional.As Christie's points out  it is not just one of Warhol's most beautiful pieces still in circulation  it may also come from one of the most legendary collections there is  that of the illustrious art dealer and friend of the artist  Thomas Ammann. Like Leo Castelli  Ammann helped to make Warhol's work famous  exhibiting it alongside works by Francis Bacon  Jasper Johns  Mark Rothko  Cy Twombly and Jean-Michel Basquiat.4. Icon of Post-War Art and NFTsFor fifteen years  Andy Warhol has been the most successful Post-War artist on the art market. His success is based on an oeuvre that is distinctly recognizable in all the different radically innovative artistic techniques with which he experimented  techniques that in many respects opened numerous paths for Contemporary Art. By questioning the reproducibility of works as well as the tendentious relationship between art and money  his work challenged many of the assumptions of the Post-War art market.Similar questions are being posed today by NFTs  a phenomenon whose success is intimately based on the rise of crypto-currencies and which plays with ""variations on a theme"" to the point of creating 10 000 versions in PFP (picture for proof) collections.In May 2021  Christie's offered five digital works by Andy Warhol (found on a floppy disk) in the form of NFTs.5. An extremely favorable economic situationIn 2021  sales of NFTs contributed to the recovery of the global art market. This new category of work accounted for only 1.4% of global art auction turnover (with $232 million)  but the results for works by Beeple  Pak and Larva Labs awakened collectors to the possibilities of a less predictable and less well-oiled art market.https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-art-market-in-2021/key-results-in-2021Compared to last year  2022 appears to have started rather cautiously  although London hammered several excellent results  including a superb new record for René Magritte at almost $80 million  and a work by Chardin exceeded $26 million in Paris. But sales have not yet really started in New York. The month of May will therefore mark the real start to the year  with New York's prestigious spring sessions.It is in this context that the sale of Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) will take place  with all proceeds going to charity.Image: https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/05/Andy-WARHOL-Marilyn-Monroe-FS-II-29-1629243005.jpgCopyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

4462,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.ft.com/content/99fd2a19-5e2f-460d-9fdc-1980eebf8b02,Ukraine war cuts foreign investors off from their Russian assets,16 hours ago,Western sanctions on Russia were designed to isolate the country from the international financial system but the economic offensive has also left international traders who hold shares in Russian companies cut off from their assets.As Russian forces pushed into Ukraine  the US and the EU unleashed waves of measures against companies and individuals they alleged had close ties to Vladimir Putin’s regime.Among the first moves were measures to stop Russian companies from raising money on overseas markets  like London or New York.These prompted an equally forceful response from Putin: capital controls that banned Russia-based institutions from transferring foreign currency abroad. This  in effect  froze their assets inside Russia.With the opposing nations at what amounts to economic war  foreign investors with investments in Russia seem “caught between the proverbial rock and a hard place”  says Steven Hill  a partner at law firm K&L Gates.At the end of 2021  foreign investors held Russian equities worth $86bn  according to data from the Moscow Exchange. But the introduction of sanctions left them with an uneasy choice: divest from the Russian market  as some of the measures required; or — where permitted — hold on to their assets but face uncertainty over whether they could take control of them again.Investors are already counting the cost to their portfolios. Russia’s biggest corporate names  such as Gazprom  VTB  and TCS Group  have been left holding assets worth a fraction of what they were in early February.A Gazprom facility in Russia. The energy company’s shares were suspended from the LSE in March © Andrey Rudakov/BloombergMoreover  the war in Ukraine is a huge blow to the integration in recent years of Russian companies with western stock exchanges — mostly the London Stock Exchange  but also the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.Shares in the companies are often traded on overseas markets as depositary receipts  a type of bank certificate that securitises the ownership of shares.During the past two decades  London has been the predominant market for Russian companies to raise money outside Moscow. Thirty-nine Russian companies have listed in London and raised $44bn since 2005  according to financial data researcher FactSet.This trend slowed in 2014  after the peak of the commodities boom and the imposition of initial sanctions against Russia in response to its annexation of Crimea that year. Now  though  the war in Ukraine has dealt an all but terminal blow to the relationship.When Ukraine was invaded. shares in Russian companies became immediately toxic and western sanctions give international shareholders little time to divest. Meanwhile  banks were not only wary of breaking sanctions  but also worried that counterparts would not be able to settle their deals  or would be badly hit by volatile foreign exchange rates.Faced with uncertainty and regulatory requirements to maintain an orderly market  many exchanges suspended the shares of Russian-incorporated companies.London  home to the biggest cluster of Russian companies  suspended 28 companies. Index compilers like FTSE Russell  S&P Dow Jones  and MSCI  whose benchmarks are widely followed by fund managers  removed affected stocks from their indices at a price of zero.At the same time  the Moscow Exchange shut for nearly a month when the war began.When it reopened  investors found a very different market. Foreign investors’ access was restricted. Activity had greatly declined  making it harder to sell large blocks of shares. On the day the exchange restarted operations  private investors accounted for nearly 60 per cent of the total volume of trades  according to an exchange statement reported by Russian news agency Interfax.The Moscow Exchange  which closed for nearly a month after the Ukraine war began © Andrey Rudakov/BloombergThe few other windows open to western investors have continued to close.For example  depositary receipts had been able to represent shares listed in Russia as their receipt issuers held the underlying shares in the local market. As banks worked through the implications of the sanctions  some  including BNY Mellon  then allowed holders of Russian receipts to convert them into local shares in nearly 20 Russian firms. That would at least allow fund managers to hold the shares locally  even if they were difficult to trade.However  Russia moved swiftly to clamp down on the practice  passing laws to formally delist and terminate most overseas depositary receipts. To prevent a rush  the central bank of Russia then limited the number of shares that depositary banks could convert  defending its move as in the interests of financial stability.Or as the central bank put it: “Such practice may result in a disproportionate increase in the supply of local stocks in the market  which may have a significant impact on price and provoke a drop in stock prices.”Russian companies could apply to the central bank for permission to keep their depositary receipt programmes but only a few have been successful. Gazprom  once among the most actively traded shares on the LSE  is terminating its London and Singapore receipts in May after its application was rejected.The restrictions may not be permanent. At the end of April  Russia’s deputy central bank governor  Alexey Zabotkin  indicated in a news conference that Russia will slowly ease capital controls when the market stabilises.And the shares  and the associated cash  have not disappeared.Euroclear  the Belgium-based central securities depository  has said its balance sheet increased by 80 per cent in the first quarter  year-on-year  to nearly €23bn. This  it says  is because it has been accumulating coupons  dividends and redemptions from Russian companies but has been unable to pass them on to sanctioned parties.Even so  few are taking many chances with what’s left.K&L Gates  for example  advises clients to take urgent steps to preserve information about their investments  in case sanctions result in a devalued  or even lost investment — and the matter goes to arbitration.“Protecting foreign investment in Russia is likely to be a challenging exercise for the foreseeable future ” it warns.,negative,0.03,0.26,0.71,negative,0.01,0.14,0.84,True,English,"['Ukraine war', 'foreign investors', 'Russian assets', 'S&P Dow Jones', 'volatile foreign exchange rates', 'most overseas depositary receipts', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'K&L Gates', 'past two decades', 'biggest corporate names', 'Russian news agency', 'depositary receipt programmes', 'international financial system', 'western stock exchanges', 'A Gazprom facility', 'financial data researcher', 'The Moscow Exchange', 'Foreign investors’ access', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Thirty-nine Russian companies', 'stock prices', 'overseas markets', 'financial stability', 'Russian receipts', 'exchange statement', 'foreign currency', 'many exchanges', 'biggest cluster', 'receipt issuers', 'international traders', 'international shareholders', 'Russian forces', 'Russian equities', '20 Russian firms', 'western investors', 'economic offensive', 'close ties', 'first moves', 'capital controls', 'Russia-based institutions', 'opposing nations', 'proverbial rock', 'hard place', 'Steven Hill', 'law firm', 'uneasy choice', 'TCS Group', 'early February', 'energy company', 'Andrey Rudakov', 'huge blow', 'recent years', 'bank certificate', 'commodities boom', 'terminal blow', 'little time', 'regulatory requirements', 'Index compilers', 'FTSE Russell', 'fund managers', 'same time', 'large blocks', '60 per cent', 'total volume', 'other windows', 'BNY Mellon', 'central bank', 'disproportionate increase', 'significant impact', 'Russian market', 'depositary banks', 'private investors', 'predominant market', 'orderly market', 'Russian-incorporated companies', 'different market', 'local market', 'Western sanctions', 'Vladimir Putin', 'forceful response', 'initial sanctions', 'local stocks', 'economic war', 'underlying shares', 'local shares', 'Ukraine war', '28 companies', 'country', 'assets', 'EU', 'waves', 'measures', 'individuals', 'regime', 'money', 'effect', 'investments', 'partner', 'end', 'introduction', 'uncertainty', 'cost', 'portfolios', 'VTB', 'fraction', 'LSE', 'March', 'Bloomberg', 'integration', 'Nasdaq', 'type', 'ownership', 'FactSet', 'peak', 'imposition', 'annexation', 'Crimea', 'relationship', 'counterparts', 'deals', 'MSCI', 'benchmarks', 'indices', 'month', 'Activity', 'day', 'operations', 'trades', 'Interfax', 'example', 'implications', 'practice', 'laws', 'rush', 'number', 'interests', 'supply', 'drop', 'permission', '2021', '©']",2022-05-09,2022-05-09,ft.com

The Board of Directors proposes the following guidelines for the determination of salaries and other compensation to senior management. For the purpose of ensuring that the Company is able to recruit and retain qualified senior executives  the fundamental principle is that the senior executives must be offered employment terms and compensation on market terms. Salaries and other benefits: Compensation to the senior executives shall be comprised of a fixed salary and pension. The fixed salaries are normally reviewed on a calendar year basis. In addition to fixed salary  a variable salary may be implemented under the pre-requisite that the variable part never exceeds 25 percent of the yearly salary. In addition  senior management shall be entitled to customary non-monetary benefits such as  company cars and occupational healthcare. Other benefits may also be offered on an individual basis. Pension: Senior executives shall be offered pension terms that include a defined plan for provisions with premiums based on the entire basic salary. The pension provisions are individual and shall be in relation to the basic salary. Notice of termination period and severance pay: The notice period shall be a maximum of six months  if the Company gives the notice and a maximum of six months if the notice is given on the initiative of the senior executive. In the event of termination by the Company  severance pay may  in addition be paid in an amount corresponding to a maximum of six monthly salaries. Incentive program: Resolution regarding share and share price-related incentive programs directed to senior executives shall be made by the Annual General Meeting. Remuneration Committee: The remuneration committee  i.e. the board excluding the CEO  shall prepare issues regarding compensation principles  compensation and other terms of employment for senior executives. The more detailed principles for salary setting  pensions and other benefits shall be found in the salary policy established by the Remuneration Committee regarding senior executives. Deviations in individual cases: The Board of Directors shall be entitled to deviate from these guidelines where there is special cause for such an individual case. Compensation to Board of Directors Compensation to the Board of Directors is determined by the Annual General Meeting based on proposals from the nomination committee. However  the Board of Directors is entitled  in specific cases  to commission an individual director to perform consultancy services on behalf of the Company within their respective areas of competence. Directors elected by the Annual General Meeting shall  in these specific cases  be eligible to receive fees for services  which do not constitute board work. With respect to the services  a fee on market terms will be payable  which must be approved by the Board of Directors. This shall also be applicable if the work is carried out through a company wholly or partially owned by a board member. These guidelines correspond to the guidelines approved by the Annual General Meeting 2021. 15. Resolution regarding authorization of the Board of Directors to issue shares and/or warrants and/or convertibles The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board of Directors to resolve  on one or several occasions  on issue of shares and/or warrants and/or convertibles during the time until the next Annual General Meeting for payment in cash and/or with terms regarding set-off or issue in kind or otherwise with terms and thereby deviate from the preferential right of the shareholders. The issues shall be done to a marketable issue price determined by the Board of Directors in consultation with the company's financial advisers  taking into consideration any marketable issue-discount. The number of shares that could be issued  or the number of shares that could be subscribed for through warrants  or the number of shares that convertibles could be converted into shall amount to a total maximum of 15 295 000 new shares representing a dilution amounting to approximately ten per cent. The purpose of the authorization and the reason to deviate from the preferential right of the shareholders is that issues shall be possible for financing the company's business  commercialisation and development of the company's products and markets and/or acquisition of businesses  companies or parts of companies and/or enable a broadening of the owner base of the Company. The approval by the Annual General Meeting of this proposal in accordance with the above is valid only if supported by shareholders representing at least 2/3 of both the votes cast and the votes represented at the meeting. 16. Resolution regarding adjustment authorization The Board of Directors  the CEO or the person appointed by the Board of Directors shall be authorized to make such minor amendments and clarifications of the resolution by the Annual General Meeting that may prove necessary in connection with registration of the resolutions.

The ETFs aim to provide investors an opportunity to be more precise with their exposure.“For example  if they wish to focus on companies driven by domestic consumption  they are more likely to find them in the mid-cap space  whereas larger companies tend to have more international exposure.”It is the latest launch by the US giant offering exposure to China after it unveiled the Invesco China All Shares Stock Connect UCITS ETF (MCHN) and the Invesco China Technology All Shares Stock Connect UCITS ETF (MCHT) last year.Related articles,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.03,0.18,0.79,True,English,"['mid-cap China ETFs', 'synthetic large', 'Invesco', 'The Invesco S&P 500 China A 300 Swap UCITS ETF', 'Invesco China All Shares Stock Connect UCITS ETF', 'Foreign Assets Control Sanctions list', 'MidCap 500 Swap UCITS ETF', 'commodity ETF product management', 'Invesco S&P China', 'S&P index', 'two synthetic China ETFs', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Shenzhen stock exchanges', 'Invesco China Technology', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'total exchange ratio', 'mid-cap China ETFs', 'onshore equity market', 'second-largest equity market', 'mid-cap A-Shares companies', 'The ETFs', 'swap contracts', 'swap markets', 'mainland China', 'A-Shares market', 'Synthetic ETFs', 'EMEA equity', 'mid-cap space', 'market risk', 'synthetic replication', 'EMEA ETFs', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Borsa Italiana', 'largest stocks', 'minus fees', 'consistent” tracking', 'Christopher Mellor', 'structural advantage', 'Quant desks', 'hedge funds', 'market-neutral strategies', 'traditional methods', 'favourable conditions', 'potential outperformance', 'Gary Buxton', 'domestic consumption', 'latest launch', 'US giant', 'Related articles', 'synthetic large', 'index derivatives', 'index strategies', 'larger companies', 'investment banks', 'index return', 'international exposure', 'C500', 'C300', 'Renminbi', 'Shanghai', 'Office', 'counterparties', 'advantages', 'head', 'dynamic', 'access', 'world', 'investors', 'opportunity', 'example', 'MCHN', 'MCHT', '0.']",2022-09-05,2022-05-09,etfstream.com

4474,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.etftrends.com/dividend-channel/dividend-growth-is-strong-despite-rising-rates-and-inflation/,Dividend Growth is Strong Despite Rising Rates and Inflation,2 hours ago,Dividend ETFs are highly attractive in the current environment  offering investors generous yields and resiliency amid inflation and periods of rising rates.To combat decades-high inflation  the Federal Reserve last week ordered the largest interest hike in more than two decades  when the central bank raised its benchmark rate by a half-a-percentage point  following a quarter-point increase in March.Looking at the nine-year record for all global equity income and global large-cap core ETFs and open-end funds  sorted by the nine-year Sharpe ratio  the SmartETFs Dividend Builder ETF (DIVS)  managed by Guinness Atkinson Asset Management  sits at the top of the pack.DIVS invests globally in high-quality dividend growers with a long history of persistently high returns on capital. Looking under the hood of DIVS can unveil a lot about the quality of the fund’s holdings and its ability to stand up to rising interest rates.So far  in 2022  DIVs has had dividend updates from 17 of its 35 holdings  and despite the challenging current economic climate  zero companies have announced dividend cuts or cancellations  according to SmartETFs.15 companies have announced increases for their 2022 dividend from 2021 and two companies have announced a flat dividend compared to 2021  according to SmartETFs. This dividend growth elaborates on past momentum  having seen zero cancellations in 2021 and 2020.So far  in the fund  the average dividend growth announced for 2022 stands at 7.9%  according to SmartETFs.The financial holdings in DIVS have declared the largest year-on-year dividend increases. Aflac is to grow its dividend by 21.2% for 2022  following the 17.9% growth in 2021. Blackrock is to grow its dividend by 18.2% for 2022  following the 13.8% growth in 2021. CME Group is to grow its dividend by 11.1% for 2022  following the 5.9% growth in 2021. Deutsche Boerse is to grow its dividend by 6.7% for 2022  following the 3.4% growth in 2021. Arthur Gallagher is to grow its dividend by 6.3% for 2022  following the 6.7% growth in 2021  according to SmartETFs.The two companies included in DIVS that announced a flat dividend for 2022 — Henkel and Danone — cited cautiousness as reasons for capital preservation amid both their respective restructuring efforts to achieve higher growth. Both companies continue to have strong balance sheets and low leverage  and the management team behind DIVS believes they can continue growing their dividend in the future.For more news  information  and strategy  visit the Dividend Channel.,neutral,0.35,0.53,0.13,mixed,0.2,0.34,0.46,True,English,"['Dividend Growth', 'Rising Rates', 'Inflation', 'Guinness Atkinson Asset Management', 'challenging current economic climate', 'global large-cap core ETFs', 'SmartETFs Dividend Builder ETF', 'global equity income', 'largest interest hike', 'respective restructuring efforts', 'strong balance sheets', 'nine-year Sharpe ratio', 'rising interest rates', 'high-quality dividend growers', 'average dividend growth', 'current environment', 'rising rates', 'management team', 'Dividend ETFs', 'nine-year record', 'generous yields', 'Federal Reserve', 'two decades', 'central bank', 'benchmark rate', 'half-a-percentage point', 'quarter-point increase', 'open-end funds', 'long history', 'high returns', 'past momentum', 'CME Group', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Arthur Gallagher', 'low leverage', 'dividend updates', 'dividend cuts', 'flat dividend', 'Dividend Channel', 'zero companies', 'two companies', 'decades-high inflation', 'zero cancellations', 'capital preservation', 'higher growth', 'financial holdings', 'dividend increases', '2022 dividend', '15 companies', '17.9% growth', '13.8% growth', '5.9% growth', '3.4% growth', '6.7% growth', '35 holdings', 'investors', 'resiliency', 'periods', 'March', 'DIVS', 'top', 'pack', 'hood', 'lot', 'ability', 'Aflac', 'Blackrock', 'Henkel', 'Danone', 'cautiousness', 'reasons', 'future', 'news', 'information', 'strategy', '21.']",2022-05-09,2022-05-09,etftrends.com

More than half of the 121 companies polled by the American Chamber of Commerce in China have either reduced or delayed investment in the country  while nearly 60 percent of them lowered their income forecasts for this year following the latest virus outbreaks  a chamber statement said. More than 15 percent of the US companies with operations in Shanghai — which has been placed under lockdown for more than a month — reported their business there remains fully shut  the survey  conducted from April 29 to Thursday  showed. Nearly 60 percent of the respondents  who have operations throughout the country  said that production capabilities were slowed or reduced due to a lack of employees  difficulty in obtaining supplies or government-ordered lockdowns.AIRLINESQantas expands points salesQantas Airways Ltd is making every seat on more than 1 700 flights purchasable with air miles  allowing customers to burn through a mountain of loyalty points built up during the COVID-19 pandemic. Passengers are to be able to use points on all flights in August on more than 30 routes in Australia  Qantas said yesterday. The almost 130 000 seats would be available on mostly regional routes from cities including Melbourne and Sydney. Airlines normally set aside only a certain number of seats for points redemptions  and offering every seat on so many flights is unusual. So-called points planes have emerged since COVID-19 as a way to tap pent-up travel demand among frequent flyers who accumulated air miles while stuck on the ground.CARBON TRADINGFirm to trade offsetsA Singapore carbon exchange is teaming up with Germany’s main bourse to launch futures trading for carbon offsets as early as this year to meet the growing demand from companies to hedge their risks from greenhouse gas emissions. The futures contracts would be created by Deutsche Boerse AG using carbon credits sourced by Singapore-based AirCarbon Pte. The plan would be to trade the contracts on the European Energy Exchange  AirCarbon cofounder and chief executive officer Thomas McMahon said. BloombergNEF  a clean energy research group  estimates that the market for offsets could either skyrocket past US$100 billion or crumble if there are little improvements in quality.MALAYSIAIPO stream to stay strongThe pipeline for initial public offerings (IPOs) is likely to remain robust for the rest of the year  as excess cash buoys demand  the chief of the stock exchange operator said yesterday. “Our lead stream is strong  we have pent-up availability  the market support for IPOs this year has been very good ” Bursa Malaysia Bhd chief executive officer Muhamad Umar Swift said in a Bloomberg TV interview. “There is still a lot of liquidity in the Malaysian market chasing new offerings.” Malaysia topped its Southeast Asian peers in IPO proceeds raised in the first three months of this year  with five firms netting US$362 million through first-time share shares  Ernst & Young LLP said.

EVs will soon be a fixture of everyday life and creating the facilities to help accelerate adoption and implementation all around the world will be crucial when it comes to addressing concerns around long-term carbon emissions.”To deliver the project successfully  Arcadis has factored critical sensitivities such as humidity control and dust mitigation into the factory’s design. The team has also identified plans for installing future solar panels and for sourcing recyclable furniture  to reduce the plant’s overall carbon footprint.Story continuesPablo Moleira  project manager for Wallbox  said: “Arcadis has worked alongside our team from the earliest stages of this project  and together we have been able to bring this project to life on an accelerated schedule for maximum impact. North America needs electric vehicle chargers  and we are thrilled to be able to help accelerate the transition by making EV charging easier and more accessible.”- End-FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:ARCADIS CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONSKerri MooreE-mail : kerri.moore@arcadis.comARCADIS INVESTOR RELATIONSChristine DischMobile: +31 6 15376020E-mail: christine.disch@arcadis.comABOUT ARCADISArcadis is the leading global design & consultancy organization for natural and built assets.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  toda…,EINDHOVEN  the Netherlands & LAUSANNE  Switzerland--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announces the first patient enrollment in the HemON Study and first-in-human use of the Company’s ARCIM implantable pulse generator (IPG)  designed to stimulate the spinal cord to restore movement and autonomic function for people with spinal cord injury and other conditions that affect mobility.“ONWARD’s ARCIM IPG offers surgeons precision and flexibility never before available in an implantable neurostimulator ” said Dr. Jocelyne Bloch  Chief of Functional Neurosurgery at Switzerland’s Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). “Clinicians will be able to leverage these advanced capabilities to refine and deliver epidural stimulation therapies for people with spinal cord injury.”The ONWARD ARCIM IPG was purpose-designed to deliver targeted electrical stimulation to the spinal cord in the precise areas responsible for triggering or controlling movement and autonomic functions that may be affected by a spinal cord injury or neurodegenerative disorder. The IPG is designed to operate in closed-loop  incorporating data from sensors or other devices that may be deployed inside or outside the body. It is also designed to deliver therapy through an associated ARCIM lead with precision and flexibility  allowing clinicians to apply biomimetic stimulation that can closely replicate normal spinal cord activity patterns during mobility or autonomic function.The HemON Study (NCT05111093) aims to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of ARCIM Therapy to improve blood pressure management and trunk control in people with spinal cord injury who suffer from orthostatic hypotension  which is characterized by debilitatingly low blood pressure that may occur when people sit upright  stand  or change body position. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed in approximately 75% of people with spinal cord injury. HemON will enroll up to 16 participants at CHUV in Lausanne  Switzerland.“The first implant of our ARCIM IPG is a huge milestone for ONWARD and the SCI community ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. “This important achievement validates our vision for a future in which clinicians will no longer need to struggle with modified pain stimulators to explore new treatments and instead will be able to use devices and therapies designed specifically to treat people with spinal cord injury and their unique needs.”To learn more about ONWARD’s ARC Therapy and the company’s vision to restore movement  independence and health in people with spinal cord injury  please visit ONWD.com.THIS PRESS RELEASE CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 7(1) OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET ABUSE REGULATION (596/2014).About ONWARDONWARD is a medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury.

The Part A data showed THR-687 to be safe and well tolerated with no serious adverse events and none of the patients required rescue medication through Month 3  however  there was insufficient evidence of efficacy on the key endpoints (Best-Corrected Visual Acuity and Central Subfield Thickness). As a result  Oxurion has decided not to advance THR-687 to Part B of the INTEGRAL trial. The company is therefore fully focused on THR-149 which recently demonstrated a compelling safety and efficacy profile in patients with DME in the first part of the two-part Phase 2 KALAHARI trial. Part B of that trial is currently enrolling patients in the US and Europe.The INTEGRAL trial is a two-part  randomized  prospective  multicenter trial assessing multiple injections of THR-687 in treatment naïve DME patients. The Part A endpoints were safety (n = 16) and efficacy (n = 14)  with two dose levels of THR-687 (1.2mg and 2.0mg) each administered in three monthly IVT injections. Patients are being followed-up until month six of Part A of the trial  and we look forward to presenting the full data set at an upcoming medical conference.Arshad M. Khanani  M.D.  M.A.  Director of Clinical Research at Sierra Eye Associates  Reno  Nevada  US  comments: ""We are disappointed that the top-line results in the dose selection phase of the INTEGRAL trial did not meet the key efficacy endpoints  despite promising data in the Phase 1 trial. Novel mechanisms  like THR-687 and THR-149  remain an important opportunity to address the significant unmet medical needs for our patients with DME. Following the impressive data presented at Angiogenesis this year from the Phase 2 Part A KALAHARI trial for THR-149 in DME  I am looking forward to seeing the Part B data expected next year.""Story continuesTom Graney  CFA  Chief Executive Officer of Oxurion  comments: “While we had hoped for a better outcome for the patients in the INTEGRAL trial  we remain committed to developing new treatments to address the substantial unmet needs that remain in retinal diseases. We are excited about the potential of THR-149  a potent plasma kallikrein inhibitor  to provide a novel  first-in-class therapeutic for the up to 50% of DME patients who suboptimally respond to the current standard of care and have limited treatment options. We look forward to sharing the topline results of Part B of the Phase 2 trial in mid-2023.” He added  “As we discontinue our development of THR-687  we will explore potential partnership opportunities for the asset. Additionally  we are undertaking a thorough review of our capital and resource allocation plans to ensure that they are aligned with our objective of maximizing value creation for all stakeholders.”About OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is a biopharmaceutical company developing next generation standard of care ophthalmic therapies  which are designed to improve and better preserve vision in patients with retinal disorders including diabetic macular edema (DME)  the leading cause of vision loss in working-age people  as well as other conditions. Oxurion intends to play an important role in the treatment of retinal disorders  including the successful development of THR-149  its novel therapeutic for the treatment of DME. THR-149 is a potent plasma kallikrein inhibitor being developed as a potential new standard of care for the up to 50% of DME patients showing suboptimal response to anti-VEGF therapy.

Interim results from 39 patients with a median follow up of 6 months show an ORR of 21%—including two patients who achieved a complete response and six who achieved a partial response—and a very high disease control rate of 64%. The trial enrolled a heavily pre-treated patient population with more than two thirds of the patients having received at least two previous systemic lines of treatment.Interestingly  anti-tumor activity was observed in both PD-L1 positive (ORR of 27% and DCR of 77%) and PD-L1 negative patients (ORR of 17% and DCR of 58%) indicating a potential clinical benefit also in the PD-L1 negative population. In addition  a DCR of 71% was observed in patients with non-inflamed tumors  including both immune desert and T cell excluded tumors. Together these findings suggest a differentiated anti-tumor response pattern of the combination treatment compared to checkpoint inhibitor monotherapy.“We are thrilled to report these positive interim safety and efficacy results from our Phase 2 trial with VB10.16  which showed evidence of durable anti-tumor activity in a heavily pre-treated population of patients with late-stage cervical cancer ” said Michael Engsig  Chief Executive Officer of Nykode Therapeutics. “These interim results support Nykode’s unique approach of targeting Antigen-Presenting Cells (APCs)  designed to produce a robust and long-lasting CD8 killer T cell response against cancer cells. We look forward to reporting updated efficacy data readouts from the Phase 2 trial during the first half of 2023 as we continue to advance our cervical cancer program.”Story continuesImmunological analyses of the peripheral T cell responses demonstrated an increased HPV16-specific IFNγ T cell immune response post-vaccination in the majority of subjects and were associated with clinical efficacy indicating the induction of clinically relevant T cell responses. Clearance of circulating HPV16 DNA was significantly correlated with clinical response and progression free survival suggesting ctDNA may be an early marker of response to treatment in cervical cancer. VB10.16 is potentially a first-in-class therapeutic vaccine against HPV16 positive cervical cancer.""The patients who were treated with VB10.16 in combination with atezolizumab in the C-02 trial were heavily pre-treated and are prone to progress quickly ” said Professor Peter Hillemanns  Director of the Departments of Gynecology  Obstetrics and Breast Cancer at Hannover University Hospital  Germany and principal investigator of the C-02 trial. “It is very encouraging to see that a majority of patients experienced a clinical benefit and that many patients had durable responses. The combination of VB10.16 and atezolizumab was also well tolerated by patients.”“Treatment advances within the area of advanced cervical cancer have been limited though checkpoint inhibitors have demonstrated clinical efficacy in some patients. The unmet need is still high  and we are very pleased to see a high disease control rate and durable responses in these heavily pre-treated HPV16+ cervical cancer patients. The anti-tumor activity seen in both non-inflamed and PD-L1 negative populations may potentially open up a new subset of patients for treatment. These findings indicate that VB10.16 may give a meaningful added clinical benefit compared to the existing standard of care treatment in this setting. We would like to thank all the investigators  patients and their relatives for participating in this trial. Without all of you the advances of VB10.16 would not have been possible ” added Siri Torhaug  Chief Medical Officer of Nykode Therapeutics.VB10.16 was generally safe and well tolerated  with 10% of patients experiencing Grade 3 or more treatment-related adverse events  indicating no increased toxicity compared with atezolizumab monotherapy and a favorable safety profile that is consistent with previously published data for the Nykode DNA vaccine technology platform.Nykode expects to report updated efficacy data read-outs from VB C-02 during the first half of 2023.WebcastInvestors and analysts are invited to join a webcast presentation of the interim results conducted by CEO Michael Engsig and other members of the management team today  May 9  2022 at 2 p.m. CET / 8 a.m. ET. The slide presentation will be available in the Investors section of the Company’s website at https://nykode.com/investors following the event. The live and archived webcast of the presentation can be accessed in the Investors section of the Company’s website at https://nykode.com/investors/financial-reports-and-presentations.About the VB C-02 trialVB C-02 is a multi-center  single arm  open-label Phase 2 trial of patients with advanced or recurrent  non-resectable HPV16-positive cervical cancer. Patients received treatment with VB10.16 in combination with the PD-L1 inhibitor atezolizumab for up to one year. The main aim of the trial was to assess the efficacy  immunogenicity and safety of VB10.16 when given in combination with atezolizumab. The trial is now fully enrolled with 52 patients enrolled at sites in Europe  and the pre-planned second interim analysis was performed at the cut-off date of 14 February 2022. Nykode has previously reported positive interim safety data from the trial.Additional information about the VB C-02 trial is available at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04405349).About VB10.16VB10.16 is a potentially first-in-class off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccine candidate in development for the treatment of human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16)-positive cancers. The cancer vaccine is designed based on Nykode’s Vaccibody™ technology platform of targeting antigens to antigen presenting cells. The candidate has demonstrated favorable clinical data in a Phase I/IIa study in pre-cancerous HPV16-induced high grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL; CIN 2/3) demonstrating a statistically significant correlation of immune responses and clinical responses. VB10.16 is currently being investigated in the VB C-02 trial in patients with advanced or recurrent  non-resectable HPV16-positive cervical cancer.About cervical cancerCervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide and is most frequently diagnosed between the ages of 35 and 44. Each year around 600 000 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer worldwide. Almost all cases are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and HPV16 accounts for more than half of all cervical cancer cases. Approximately 80% of patients with cervical cancer have squamous cell carcinoma (arising from cells lining the bottom of the cervix) and most other patients have adenocarcinomas (arising from glandular cells in the upper cervix). Cervical cancer is often curable when detected early and effectively managed  but treatment options are more limited in advanced disease stages or when the cancer has spread.About Nykode TherapeuticsNykode Therapeutics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery and development of vaccines and novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer and infectious diseases. Nykode’s modular vaccine technology specifically targets antigens to Antigen Presenting Cells  which are essential for inducing rapid  strong and long-lasting antigen specific immune responses and eliciting efficacious clinical responses.Nykode’s lead product candidates are VB10.16  a therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of human papilloma virus 16 induced malignancies which is in Phase 2 for the treatment of cervical cancer; and VB10.NEO  a cancer neoantigen vaccine  which is exclusively out licensed to Genentech and is in Phase 1b for the treatment of locally advanced and metastatic tumors and Phase 1/2a for the treatment of melanoma  lung-  head and neck  renal-  and bladder cancer.

She joined from Shell  where she spent nearly 18 years  most recently as director of IR.Louzada brings to Azerion the experience of helping Shell transform its IR approach over recent years – changes demanded by intense investor scrutiny on the energy sector. She also has plenty of experience in tech  having previously founded two start-ups.Marcela Louzada  AzerionShe will now use that experience to build out the IR function at Azerion  which only went public in February this year  listing via a merger with a special purpose acquisition company on Euronext Amsterdam.Below  Louzada talks to IR Magazine about what attracted her to the new role  her approach to engagement as in-person meetings return  and managing negative sentiment toward the tech sector.What attracted you to the role?I was attracted by the opportunity to really make an impact and build on the initial investor engagement work done as part of the listing to develop our equity story  the relationship with the market  sell-side coverage  relationships with investors and how to communicate the message.Azerion has been growing massively in the last few years and has great potential. It operates in a market that is under consolidation and Azerion is ready to fight as one of the key players in that consolidation – and that’s just the place you want to be.I think Azerion will benefit from my experience of working at Shell and all the transformation that has taken place in the energy sector over the last couple of years. There was a huge change in the way Shell communicated with the market.It will be great for Azerion to have those practices. They will help the company transition from private to public  while keeping its entrepreneurial culture  which is important to its DNA. With investors  you don’t have many shots  so it’s good to get it right up-front.What experience from previous roles do you think will be useful?I always say I have been flirting with tech for a while because  besides my job in investor relations for Shell  I also founded a number of tech start-ups. Doing that gave me experience not only of starting a business  but also of fund-raising for a company that is not well known where you need to pitch its story.At Shell  we transformed the disclosures and the market communications over the last couple of years. Two years ago  we would have quarterly calls with the market  just an audio webcast  and the CEO going through a lot of slides.Today  Shell publishes a 10-minute video  first thing in the morning  so investors can get the message from management early in the day. And then later in the day  you have Q&A with management. By that time  all the noise and clarifications are out of the way  which has massively improved the quality of the Q&A. And that is just one example of all the modernization.Shell gives me experience on the public company  equity market side  and I also have that experience with start-ups and tech. Azerion is a chance to mix both.How are you approaching investor engagement as we go back to in-person meetings after the pandemic?The way I approach it is I always put investors at the center and use the communication channels that best address the demand. I would say at the moment it is a hybrid approach. I get some engagements that are virtual  others that are in person. Some investors even want to come to the office to meet management.In the case of Azerion  as it is a newly listed company  many investors are just getting to know us. If you are meeting for the first time  I think in-person engagements are important.We are getting ready for roadshows and conferences in June  along with more in-person meetings. Saying that  we are also doing virtual engagement so we have some virtual conferences we attend. I think the next few months will be more in person than virtual  but we will adapt to whatever works for the investor.What questions are you expecting from investors and analysts over the next 12 months?I think there are two areas. The first is more at the company level. Azerion is recently listed  so there is a lot of attention on the company’s financial performance  and how this compares with previous years.Then at the sector level  I expect a lot of attention. Of course  sentiment toward tech has been somewhat mixed recently  given the big players are publishing worsening results in some KPIs. Other topics that are hot in tech right now are the metaverse and non-fungible tokens. And Azerion has actually been one of the pioneers in that space with our virtual environments.Does the negative sentiment around tech affect your approach?I think it’s always important to monitor the sentiment and understand the main drivers behind investor concerns. Is it a macro question – are they just staying away from tech? Or are they asking: how sustainable is tech post-pandemic? That is a pretty fundamental point to address.I always say you should stay tuned  and look at the concerns behind that behavior and that sentiment  and then work with management to understand what your position is and how to address those concerns. Even if investors aren’t asking about it  we know certain questions are bugging them so I always like to stay ahead of it.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.62,0.16,0.23,True,English,"['new vice president', 'large-cap energy', 'emerging tech', 'Q&A', 'Marcela Louzada', 'IR Magazine', 'Azerion', 'special purpose acquisition company', 'initial investor engagement work', 'intense investor scrutiny', 'equity market side', 'side coverage', 'investor relations', 'investor concerns', 'virtual engagement', 'digital entertainment', 'vice president', 'energy sector', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'equity story', 'great potential', 'key players', 'huge change', 'entrepreneurial culture', 'many shots', 'previous roles', 'quarterly calls', 'audio webcast', '10-minute video', 'first thing', 'Q&A', 'one example', 'communication channels', 'two areas', 'financial performance', 'sector level', 'big players', 'worsening results', 'Other topics', 'non-fungible tokens', 'virtual environments', 'main drivers', 'macro question', 'fundamental point', 'media company', 'company level', 'two start-ups', 'person meetings', 'last couple', 'IR function', 'IR Magazine', 'Marcela Louzada', 'negative sentiment', 'market communications', 'hybrid approach', 'first time', 'virtual conferences', 'recent years', 'new role', 'previous years', 'public company', 'tech sector', 'person engagements', 'many investors', 'IR approach', 'next 12 months', 'tech start-ups', '18 years', 'Azerion', 'Shell', 'director', 'experience', 'changes', 'plenty', 'February', 'merger', 'opportunity', 'impact', 'part', 'listing', 'relationship', 'message', 'consolidation', 'place', 'transformation', 'way', 'practices', 'private', 'DNA', 'job', 'number', 'Doing', 'business', 'fund-raising', 'disclosures', 'CEO', 'lot', 'slides', 'morning', 'management', 'day', 'noise', 'clarifications', 'quality', 'modernization', 'chance', 'pandemic', 'center', 'demand', 'moment', 'others', 'office', 'case', 'roadshows', 'June', 'questions', 'analysts', 'attention', 'KPIs', 'metaverse', 'pioneers', 'space']",2022-05-09,2022-05-09,irmagazine.com

The rest is shared by more than a thousand companies  according to eureKING.EureKING CEO Michael Kloss  former head of Bayer’s diabetes business  said the company planned to swallow about three CDMOs that each make about 50 million euros in annual revenue in Europe over the next few years.The assumption  depending on the size of the targets  is to create a group that will reach an enterprise level of about a billion euros  he said.Eventually  the company hopes to build a one-stop boutique manufacturing network for European biotechs that don’t need large batches of product and aren’t necessarily prioritised by the big CDMOs.There are is a global need to scale up manufacturing to meet the burgeoning demand for advanced therapeutics  said Claire Skentelbery  director general of the European biotech industry group EuropaBio.Europe is not in the game on its own — the United States  India and now China have strong  growing manufacturing bases  she said. “In Europe  we need to make sure that we are shoulder to shoulder with the other major regions.”(Reporting by Natalie Grover.

Europe's market leader in the aparthotel sector continues to collaborate with other companies and is constantly on the lookout for new innovations. Adagio currently comprises of three brands  with 122 aparthotels and almost 14 000 apartments in 13 different countries.The company plans to double its portfolio with over 220 aparthotels worldwide by 2025. A very ambitious goal  although Adagio has already demonstrated its ability to do so: in 2021  the brand broke all records with the opening of ten new locations across five countries. Adagio continues its success with the recent announcement of its official partnership with its four-star aparthotel Adagio London Stratford and the famous London Stadium. Adagio's latest significant openings include Qatar and Malta  two countries where the brand has not previously been represented.In 2023  the focus will remain on international expansion with properties planned in Abidjan  Antwerp  London and Bucharest. Nonetheless  France  the group's home market will also move into focus with new openings anticipated in Rouen and Boulogne-Billancourt  allowing Adagio to maintain its marketleader position.Franchise on the riseAs an experienced operator of aparthotels  Adagio offers several development routes to implement its expansion strategy and achieve its goal: lease  management or franchise. As a result  the group's expertise in the medium- to long-stay segment is now available to franchise partners as this operating mode becomes a key development focus for Adagio in France and worldwide. In 2018  there were five franchised Adagios in the portfolio. In 2022  just four years later  there are now 18. There are also 15 more new openings with franchise partners planned over the next three years.Innovative concepts adapted to new needsAdagio's strong development is as a result of the introduction of a number of innovative concepts that meet the new expectations of travellers. In 2021 alone  the group launched the new apartment concepts ""Adagio access Living Hub"" and ""Adagio Smart House"". In 2022  Adagio launched its ""Coliving Concept“ with the first Coliving Apartment having opened in Paris in February. These innovations are in addition to the launch of ""The Circle""  Adagio’s public area concept. All new concepts can be seen at Adagio Paris Bercy Village  the group's innovation lab.Flexible with buildings - strong CSR commitmentAdagio is a very agile brand and can adapt to any building project be it the takeover of existing aparthotels  conversions (offices  residential buildings  retail  hotels  etc.) or new developments  taking into account the reversibility of infrastructures. This flexibility is always aligned with Adagio's strong CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) commitment  where the implementation of specific technical and operational measures ensure an improvement in the impact on the environment.Xavier Desaulles  CEO Adagio  says about the IHIF (International Hotel Investment Forum): “Our presence at IHIF in Berlin in early May  a major hotel investment forum in Europe  is a unique opportunity for ADAGIO to share with future partners the specificity of the aparthotel model and its extraordinary potential. As the European leader  it is also and above all an opportunity to communicate our know-how and our desire for innovation in this fast-growing market segment!""About AccorAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of more than 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

The 21 pods in this additional order will support all these new capabilities.PARIS  France  06 May 2022 -/African Media Agency(AMA)/- The French defence procurement agency (DGA) has placed a firm order with Thales for 21 additional TALIOS pods. The new target designation pods will equip Rafale aircraft currently in service with the French Air and Space Force and the French Navy.As theatres of operations become more complex  maintaining an accurate picture of the tactical situation is becoming increasingly crucial to the ability of pilots and commanders to make timely decisions and achieve a strategic advantage. Shortening the time it takes between gathering intelligence and defeating targets of interest is a key objective for armed forces all over the world.In an increasingly connected operational environment  the TALIOS1 pod will enable Rafale F4 standard aircraft to perform both air reconnaissance and ground/surface attack missions. The pod provides a wide-area search and target identification capability and can then switch instantly into target acquisition and tracking mode. Its high-resolution sensors provide a colour picture of the tactical situation to simplify the tasks of Rafale pilots. Thales has also developed a new Vision Permanent mode  which superimposes real-time video on a 3D map of the operational environment  enabling air crews to observe and understand the tactical situation in a significantly shorter time.TALIOS will ultimately incorporate artificial intelligence algorithms to provide an unprecedented level of assistance in target detection and recognition and further accelerate the decision-making process  particularly in high-intensity engagements.This order for 21 additional pods underscores the continuing confidence of the French forces  which have deployed TALIOS multiple times on expeditionary missions since the first pods were delivered in 2019. The new pods will be delivered between 2024 and 2025  straight after fulfilment of the initial order for 46 TALIOS systems.Close Sign up for free AllAfrica Newsletters Get the latest in African news delivered straight to your inbox Top Headlines Liberia Arms and Armies By submitting above  you agree to our privacy policy.

May 9  2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Kinco  the glove manufacturing company  has selected Centric Software®'s Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solution. Centric Software provides the mos…,"Based in Portland  Oregon and founded in 1975  Kinco is a second-generation family-owned company that produces premium gloves designed for everything from gardening  to snowmobiling  to thermal work gloves. They provide high quality and innovation at a fair price.We went with Centric  because of its stability  its size  but also the really  really organized approach to onboarding.Nicholas Pai is in Purchasing and Sourcing at Kinco. He describes the business for those not directly in it. ""Making gloves is surprisingly technical. Shoes have a standard size measurement for the interior of the shoe. Pants have standardized sizing. Gloves can be trickier because each piece has to be hand sewn  which a lot of people don't know."" He continues to explain that there are also challenges in the materials used to make gloves. ""There are simple cotton string knit gloves  nitrile and latex dipped gloves  leather gloves  and synthetic leather gloves. Finding consistency in sizing across the entire line is a challenge.""The company has 30 – 40 vendors. They make about 180 styles of gloves and have at least two suppliers for each style of glove in different countries to be prepared for disruptions. Pai says  ""We source from six different countries. We have to have shipment timings  production output timings  different Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) codes for different materials  and glove types. It can get overwhelming. For example  the US decides to do a 25% tariff on China. Okay  how do we quickly find pricing alternatives with our other factories that could make these gloves? We need to answer these questions to be quicker  more agile  and also have a place where all of our material information lives.""Pai felt that getting a PLM solution was inevitable. ""I think that every company in our size range trying to grow kind of hits a point where you just have to use a PLM."" Kinco searched for providers and in the process  interviewed and did demos with six suppliers. ""We've gone through enough experiences with software companies to realize that service to get you to where you need to be to run  is even more important than the software itself  sometimes."" He continues  ""In the end we went with Centric  because of its stability  its size  but also the really  really organized approach to onboarding. Currently  everybody in sourcing feels like they're drowning  especially with the troubles that we're having this year with things out of our control. We really needed to have a partnership with a company where they shouldered some of the onboarding work to keep us on track  which is really important.""Kinco expects numerous benefits from Centric PLM  like having all material and product information in one digital hub  but there were features that were non-negotiable. Says Pai  ""We decided on three main necessities that we had to have: a costing tool  a tech pack tool  and a vendor scoring system. Centric had them and we said well  that price is worth these three things that it can do."" He maintains  ""When companies are onboarding PLM  I would tend to believe they usually do it when they should have done it a year or two ago  and they're at a place where they're feeling overwhelmed. The Centric product is a great product  but I think the support Centric brings is better than every other company that I interviewed. And that was the selling feature for us specifically.""Chris Groves  President and CEO of Centric Software says  ""I am delighted that Kinco has chosen Centric. We are humbled by the kind words about our company that Nicholas Pai has expressed; we pride ourselves on providing the highest level of service. We work closely with each of our customers—due to input from partners like Kinco  all our version updates are market-driven and based on real-world situations.""Learn more about Centric PLMRequest a DemoKinco (www.kinco.com)Kinco has been making quality work  safety  garden  & thermal gloves since 1975.

At least that's what the very p…,"According to thierry Ehrmann  CEO and Founder of Artprice and the Artmarket.com group  ""All the conditions are in place for a new landmark. Last year  a Picasso painting sold for $103 million  but the record that really impressed was the $69 million for a work by Beeple. The market took real risks  which it had not done since the Salvator Mundi in 2017  the only result to ever cross the $200 million threshold"". Caution and reason do not always prevail when it comes to bidding on a truly iconic work. But Artprice has nevertheless identified five reasons justifying an estimate of $200 million: the exceptional characteristics of the work and the perfect timing of the sale could indeed galvanize the bidding.1. Andy Warhol's market at an apexComing out of the health crisis  Andy Warhol's prices are as buoyant as ever. In 2021  his auction turnover reached $348 million  exceeding the $300 million threshold for the first time in six years thanks to some 1 600 works sold worldwide. In terms of annual turnover  Andy Warhol was once again the third most successful artist in the world  behind Pablo Picasso and his friend Jean-Michel Basquiat.https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-art-market-in-2021/top-500-artists-by-auction-turnoverOn 15 November 2021  his painting Nine Marilyn (1962) was one of the centerpieces of Sotheby's Macklowe Collection sale  the most valuable collection ever sold at auction. Estimated between $40 and $60 million  the canvas was finally acquired for $47.4 million. A relatively modest result  it nevertheless marked the relaunch of the ultra high-end Warhol market and reassured sellers.2. The best period of creationWhile Warhol works circulate abundantly in auction rooms  his masterpieces remain relatively rare  in particular the most famous series  including Campbell Soup  Mao  Jackie Kennedy  etc. Among these paintings  the color pieces are now almost all in major museums. Of Andy Warhol's five best auction results  four have been works in black and white and the fifth  a work in black and green. None of them sport truly Pop colors.Top 5 Andy Warhol auction results1. Silver Car Crash (1963) – $105.4 million - 13/11/2013 – Sotheby's NY2. Triple Elvis (1963) – $81.9 million - 12/11 /2014 – Christie's NY3. Green Car Crash (1963) – $71.7 million - 05/16/2007 – Christie's NY4. Four Marlons (1966) – $69.6 million - 11/12/2014 – Christie's NY5. Men in her life (1962) – $63.4 million - 08/11/2010 – Phillips de Pury NYThese five works were all created in the 1960s  Andy Warhol's most creative decade. He also created the Shot Marilyn series in the 60s  including the piece that Christie's will be offering on Monday 9 May. Until now  only one painting from this series has been auctioned: Shot Red Marilyn (1964)  which successively sold for $4 million in 1989  then $3.6 million in 1994 at Christie's in New York.3. A work with a colorful historyShot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) is from a series of five portraits of America's most fetichized actress in the 1950s  a series that the performance artist Dorothy Podber apparently tried to shoot. The story goes that Andy Warhol naively accepted her request to ""shoot"" the works  thinking of course that the young woman wanted to photograph them. The error was quickly identified before any damage could be done  but the commercial genius of the American artist turned the incident to his advantage. By adding one more story to the myth of Marilyn  of the Factory  of Pop Art and of 'appropriation'  Warhol succeeded in making the five canvases even more exceptional.As Christie's points out  it is not just one of Warhol's most beautiful pieces still in circulation  it may also come from one of the most legendary collections there is  that of the illustrious art dealer and friend of the artist  Thomas Ammann. Like Leo Castelli  Ammann helped to make Warhol's work famous  exhibiting it alongside works by Francis Bacon  Jasper Johns  Mark Rothko  Cy Twombly and Jean-Michel Basquiat.4. Icon of Post-War Art and NFTsFor fifteen years  Andy Warhol has been the most successful Post-War artist on the art market. His success is based on an oeuvre that is distinctly recognizable in all the different radically innovative artistic techniques with which he experimented  techniques that in many respects opened numerous paths for Contemporary Art. By questioning the reproducibility of works as well as the tendentious relationship between art and money  his work challenged many of the assumptions of the Post-War art market.Similar questions are being posed today by NFTs  a phenomenon whose success is intimately based on the rise of crypto-currencies and which plays with ""variations on a theme"" to the point of creating 10 000 versions in PFP (picture for proof) collections.In May 2021  Christie's offered five digital works by Andy Warhol (found on a floppy disk) in the form of NFTs.5. An extremely favorable economic situationIn 2021  sales of NFTs contributed to the recovery of the global art market. This new category of work accounted for only 1.4% of global art auction turnover (with $232 million)  but the results for works by Beeple  Pak and Larva Labs awakened collectors to the possibilities of a less predictable and less well-oiled art market.https://www.artprice.com/artprice-reports/the-art-market-in-2021/key-results-in-2021Compared to last year  2022 appears to have started rather cautiously  although London hammered several excellent results  including a superb new record for René Magritte at almost $80 million  and a work by Chardin exceeded $26 million in Paris. But sales have not yet really started in New York. The month of May will therefore mark the real start to the year  with New York's prestigious spring sessions.It is in this context that the sale of Shot Sage Blue Marilyn (1964) will take place  with all proceeds going to charity.Image: https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2022/05/Andy-WARHOL-Marilyn-Monroe-FS-II-29-1629243005.jpgCopyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to c ontact our E conometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

By 2025  the facility is expected to produce over 500 000 units annually. Wallbox’s chargers are compatible with all electric vehicles  making the new facility conducive to EV growth in the U.S. In addition to manufacturing  the site will also feature offices  labs  evaluation areas and a warehouse  and is expected to create 250 high-paying green jobs in the region.Ketan Maroo  vice president of industrial infrastructure at Arcadis  said: “Charging infrastructure and manufacturing are critical to supporting EV adoption. EV adoption is essential in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and mitigating the effects of climate change. Our team is proud to play a part in driving sustainable mobility forward.”Mark Cowlard  Global President of Places at Arcadis  added  “Although EV technology is relatively new  at Arcadis we have decades of experience in delivering large-scale manufacturing facilities  particularly for the automotive industry  and understanding the procedural and physical requirements of working with clients in this space give us a solid foundation of knowledge on which to build. EVs will soon be a fixture of everyday life and creating the facilities to help accelerate adoption and implementation all around the world will be crucial when it comes to addressing concerns around long-term carbon emissions.”To deliver the project successfully  Arcadis has factored critical sensitivities such as humidity control and dust mitigation into the factory’s design. The team has also identified plans for installing future solar panels and for sourcing recyclable furniture  to reduce the plant’s overall carbon footprint.Pablo Moleira  project manager for Wallbox  said: “Arcadis has worked alongside our team from the earliest stages of this project  and together we have been able to bring this project to life on an accelerated schedule for maximum impact. North America needs electric vehicle chargers  and we are thrilled to be able to help accelerate the transition by making EV charging easier and more accessible.”- End-FOR FURTHER INFORMATION PLEASE CONTACT:ARCADIS CORPORATE COMMUNICATIONSKerri MooreE-mail : kerri.moore@arcadis.comARCADIS INVESTOR RELATIONSChristine DischMobile: +31 6 15376020E-mail: christine.disch@arcadis.comABOUT ARCADISArcadis is the leading global design & consultancy organization for natural and built assets.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announces the first patient enrollment in the HemON Study and first-in-human use of the Company’s ARCIM implantable pulse generator (IPG)  designed to stimulate the spinal cord to restore movement and autonomic function for people with spinal cord injury and other conditions that affect mobility.“ONWARD’s ARCIM IPG offers surgeons precision and flexibility never before available in an implantable neurostimulator ” said Dr. Jocelyne Bloch  Chief of Functional Neurosurgery at Switzerland’s Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). “Clinicians will be able to leverage these advanced capabilities to refine and deliver epidural stimulation therapies for people with spinal cord injury.”The ONWARD ARCIM IPG was purpose-designed to deliver targeted electrical stimulation to the spinal cord in the precise areas responsible for triggering or controlling movement and autonomic functions that may be affected by a spinal cord injury or neurodegenerative disorder. The IPG is designed to operate in closed-loop  incorporating data from sensors or other devices that may be deployed inside or outside the body. It is also designed to deliver therapy through an associated ARCIM lead with precision and flexibility  allowing clinicians to apply biomimetic stimulation that can closely replicate normal spinal cord activity patterns during mobility or autonomic function.The HemON Study (NCT05111093) aims to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of ARCIM Therapy to improve blood pressure management and trunk control in people with spinal cord injury who suffer from orthostatic hypotension  which is characterized by debilitatingly low blood pressure that may occur when people sit upright  stand  or change body position. Orthostatic hypotension has been observed in approximately 75% of people with spinal cord injury. HemON will enroll up to 16 participants at CHUV in Lausanne  Switzerland.“The first implant of our ARCIM IPG is a huge milestone for ONWARD and the SCI community ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD. “This important achievement validates our vision for a future in which clinicians will no longer need to struggle with modified pain stimulators to explore new treatments and instead will be able to use devices and therapies designed specifically to treat people with spinal cord injury and their unique needs.”To learn more about ONWARD’s ARC Therapy and the company’s vision to restore movement  independence and health in people with spinal cord injury  please visit ONWD.com.THIS PRESS RELEASE CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 7(1) OF THE EUROPEAN MARKET ABUSE REGULATION (596/2014).About ONWARDONWARD is a medical technology company creating innovative therapies to restore movement  independence  and health in people with spinal cord injury.

The study's primary endpoint is the reduction in AOBP[4] measurements after three months of treatment compared to baseline values at randomization. Its secondary endpoints include ambulatory blood pressure measurements  the percentage of patients at target blood pressure and blood concentrations of several biomarkers.No treatment-related serious adverse event has yet been reported. The prevalence of allergic skin reactions is consistent with that observed in the NEW-HOPE study. The trial has been overseen by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) that has consistently recommended continuing it with the protocol unchanged at every evaluation.With the last visit of the last included patient coming after three months of treatment and a month of post-treatment follow-up  the initial results of the phase III pivotal study FRESH are expected in late October 2022 for presentation at the American Heart Association (AHA) congress in Chicago from November 5 to 7  2022.REFRESH  the second phase III long-term efficacy and safety pivotal study with the once-a-day formulation of firibastat and necessary for registering the product  is continuing normally  providing confirmation that the marketing authorization application will be submitted in the third quarter of 2023.About Quantum GenomicsQuantum Genomics is a biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of a new class of cardiovascular drugs  based on the Brain Aminopeptidase A Inhibition (BAPAI) mechanism.

We now have 15 active implant sites in Germany  and we will continue to add 10 more sites by the end of the third quarter. This growth validates our patient-centric  ‘Going Deep’ strategy of developing Centers of Excellence as we increase therapy penetration at each of these sites. We were also thrilled to implant our first commercial CCC patients in Germany  and we expect continued acceleration in CCC implants following the positive response to our BETTER SLEEP data presentation at the World Sleep Congress in Rome  where we hosted 55 key opinion leaders during the pre-Congress symposium.”Mr. Taelman continued  “We are also happy with the acceleration in the pace of implants in our DREAM U.S. pivotal study  given recent weekly implant rates  which have increased meaningfully over the last month. We believe we have enough patients enrolled to complete the study by the end of the second quarter of 2022  particularly in light of the FDA’s approval to reduce the sample size to 115 patients. We also continue our dialogue with FDA regarding our IDE submission for our ACCCESS trial for CCC patients in the U.S.  and we expect to implant our first patient before the end of this year.”“Finally  I am thrilled to announce the nominations of Ray Cohen and Ginny Kirby for appointment to the Board of Directors. They will bring a wealth of knowledge that will benefit Nyxoah as we complete DREAM  prepare for our U.S. launch  and advance our pipeline. I look forward to working closely with both of them ” concluded Mr. Taelman.First Quarter 2022 ResultsUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS AT AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31  2022 – INTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF LOSS AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS(unaudited) (in thousands)For the three months ended March 31 Notes 2022 2021 Revenue € 660 € 185 Cost of goods sold ( 289) ( 52) Gross profit € 371 € 133 Research and Development Expense (3 595) (3 094) Selling  General and Administrative Expense (4 193) (2 366) Other income/(expense) 136 4 Operating loss for the period € (7 281) € (5 323) Financial income 1 576 4 Financial expense ( 788) ( 325) Loss for the period before taxes € (6 493) € (5 644) Income taxes ( 208) ( 25) Loss for the period € (6 701) € (5 669) Loss attributable to equity holders € (6 701) € (5 669) Other comprehensive loss Items that may be subsequently reclassified to profit or loss (net of tax) Currency translation differences ( 102) ( 70) Total comprehensive loss for the year  net of tax € (6 803) € (5 739) Loss attributable to equity holders € (6 803) € (5 739) Basic Loss Per Share (in EUR) € (0.260) € (0.256) Diluted Loss Per Share (in EUR) € (0.260) € (0.256)The accompanying notes are an integral part of these condensed consolidated interim financial statementsUNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS AT AND FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31  2022 – INTERIM CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS(unaudited) (in thousands)For the three months ended March 31 2022 2021 CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES Loss before tax for the year € (6 493) € (5 644) Adjustments for Finance income (1 576) ( 4) Finance expenses 788 325 Depreciation and impairment of property  plant and equipment and right-of-use assets 255 164 Amortization of intangible assets 208 211 Share-based payment transaction expense 665 − Increase/(decrease) in provisions 10 − Other non-cash items 180 3 Cash generated before changes in working capital € (5 963) € (4 945) Changes in working capital Decrease/(Increase) in inventory 45 ( 51) (Increase)/decrease in trade and other receivables 884 (1 195) Increase/(Decrease) in trade and other payables ( 392) 2 170 Cash generated from changes in operations € (5 426) € (4 021) Interests received − 1 Income tax paid (65) (34) Net cash used in operating activities € (5 491) € (4 054) CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES Purchases of property  plant and equipment ( 128) ( 169) Capitalization of intangible assets (3 412) (1 606) (Increase)/decrease in financial assets - current (44 032) − Net cash used in investing activities € (47 572) € (1 775) CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES Payment of principal portion of lease liabilities ( 146) ( 135) Repayment of other loan ( 21) ( 21) Interests paid ( 109) ( 105) Proceeds from issuance of shares  net of transaction costs 130 52 Other financial costs (2) − Net cash generated from financing activities € ( 148) € ( 209) Movement in cash and cash equivalents € (53 211) € (6 038) Effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents 489 ( 55) Cash and cash equivalents at January 1 € 135 509 € 92 300 Cash and cash equivalents at March 31 € 82 787 € 86 207RevenueRevenue was €660 000 for the first quarter ending March 31  2022  compared to €185 000 for the first quarter ending March 31  2021. The increase in revenue was attributable to the Company’s commercialization of the Genio® system  primarily in Germany.Cost of Goods SoldCost of goods sold was €289 000 for the three months ending March 31  2022  representing a gross profit of €371 000  or gross margin of 56.2%.Research and Development ExpensesResearch and Development expenses were €3.6 million for the three months ending March 31  2022  versus €3.1 million for the prior year period  reflecting the Company’s investments in the development of next generation versions of the Genio® system as well as ongoing clinical studies  most notably DREAM in the U.S.Selling  General and Administrative ExpensesGeneral and administrative expenses rose to €4.2 million for the first quarter of 2022  up from €2.4 million in the first quarter of 2021. This was due primarily to increased commercial efforts in Germany and other European markets  as well as investments in Nyxoah’s corporate infrastructure. The Company expects to continue adding headcount across the organization ahead of U.S. commercial launch.Operating LossTotal operating loss for the first quarter of 2022 was €7.3 million versus €5.3 million in the first quarter of 2021  driven by the acceleration in our R&D spending  as well as ongoing commercial and clinical activities. Nyxoah realized a net loss of €6.7 million for the quarter ended March 31  2022  compared to a net loss of €5.7 million for the quarter ended March 31  2021.Cash PositionAs of March 31  2022  cash and financial assets totaled €127.8 million on March 31  2022  compared to €135.5 million on December 31  2021. Total cash burn was approximately €2.6 million per month during the first quarter of 2022. Nyxoah expects monthly cash burn to increase slightly as the year progresses to account for the commencement of the ACCCESS IDE trial in the U.S.  and current cash position provides ample liquidity to get to U.S. commercialization in 2024.First Quarter 2022 ReportNyxoah’s financial report for the first quarter of 2022  including details of the consolidated results  are available on the investor page of Nyxoah’s website (https://investors.nyxoah.com/financials).Conference call and webcast presentationNyxoah will conduct a conference call open to the public tomorrow  May 10  2022  at 2:00 p.m. CET / 8:00 a.m. ET  which will also be webcasted.

It was carried out exclusively through the transfer of existing shares.During the presentation of the results of this plan  Sopra Steria Chairman Pierre Pasquier welcomed employee commitment to the company’s business strategy: ""By making We Share a success  our employees have shown their commitment to being part of an independent Group  combining our entrepreneurial culture with our collective force.""Upon completion of this plan  holdings managed on behalf of employees represented around 7% of the share capital and 8% of voting rights  bolstering Sopra Steria’s position as one of the leading listed French companies when it comes to employee share ownership. After adding the shares held directly in registered form by current and former Group employees  these proportions amount to nearly 10% of the share capital and 13% of voting rights  thereby making employees the Group’s second-largest shareholder.Shares subscribed under the We Share 2022 plan were delivered on 5 May 2022.The features of this plan were detailed in a press release dated 24 February 2022.About Sopra SteriaSopra Steria  a European Tech leader recognised for its consulting  digital services and software development  helps its clients drive their digital transformation to obtain tangible and sustainable benefits.
