This marketing was done through the distributor BLYYD  which starts to deploy in 2022 deliveries in Germany  England and soon in Spain and Benelux.In less than 5 years  the ATM FULL ELEC fleet has proven itself in France. Thanks to this success  this zero emission vehicle is starting to be exported in Europe and in the United States with the leader of e-commerce and transport for which volumes of thousands of vehicles are being negotiated.The brands that already use GAUSSIN's ATM in their activities are the following :AgedissAmazon FranceAuchanBarillaBert and YouBHT (Allemagne)*BILS DerooBLYYD SpareBoulangerBUTCarrefourCdiscountCMR / Kuhne & NagelCMR LocationCompact (Royaume-Uni)*ConforamaDecathlonDSM NutritionFandi EmballagesFernride (DE)GeodisGERFLORGrimonprezGXOHeppnerID LogisiticsJacques MartinKuhne & NagelLa Poste / ColissimoLeclercLeclerc SocaraLeroy MerlinLOMAKMichelinMondial RelayNormandie ManutentionPlug Power (US)Relais VertRoyal CaninSAFRANStefUPS (US)XPOYves Rocher* Distributor officially installed. In 2022  new distributors are planned for Spain and Benelux.GAUSSIN plans to deliver 61 ATMs on order in 2022:- 34 ATM via BLYYD for the European market - 2 to Nexport for the launch in Australia - 20 to Plug Power and 5 to Robotic Research for their customers in the US market.One million kilometers driven with a new vehicle that makes the difference with its unique performance and the equivalent of 3 000 tonnes of CO2 emissionsToday  the fleet of ATMs operating on logistics sites that are increasingly eco-responsible has passed the one million kilometer mark. This symbolic threshold represents more than 20 times around the Earth.The carbon footprint of this zero-emission fleet is also very interesting with the elimination of more than 3000 tonnes of CO2 emissions.An ATM has a 24-hour autonomy thanks to the ""battery swapping"" option  an invention patented by GAUSSIN that allows to swap batteries on an ATM in only 3 minutes. This means that the vehicle is not immobilized while the battery is being charged  resulting in a 99.5% availability rate.The birth of an electric and hydrogen range for transport and logistics with the ATM 38 tonnes  for port container terminals with the APM 75 tonnes  and for airports with the ART 80 tonnesSince the 1st ATM  a complete range of products has been created with different derivatives for other international markets :The ASBM 75 tonnes  capable of moving road semi-trailers but also swap bodiesThe APM 75 tonnes  a version used for container terminal operationsThe ART 80 tonnes  a GSE (Ground Support Equipment) tanker used on airport tarmacs.All these vehicles are available with 100% electric or hydrogen engines  with the possibility of having a driver on board or being 100% autonomous.A new production site in France  immediately available with a capacity of 2 400 vehicles per yearGAUSSIN recently announced (see press release of April 7  2022) the increase of its production capacities with the installation of a new 28 000 square-meter site in Saint Vallier  in the Saône-et-Loire region. GAUSSIN was already present in this region  where the Group has created two assembly lines for ATM® and APM® vehicles via its subsidiary METALLIANCE (see press release of June 24  2021)  partly located in 8 000 square meters of industrial premises currently being renovated by the Creusot Montceau Urban Community.This new site will notably be dedicated to the production of ATM® logistics vehicles in order to meet the increasing demand on the European and American markets. Immediately available  and previously in the hands of the American handling group TEREX  then of the Scandinavian group KONECRANES which closed it in March 2021  this new site does not require a building permit and already has the necessary infrastructure. The SEMCIB (Société D'économie Mixte Pour La Coopération Industrielle En Bourgogne) is the owner-lessor.The site will be able to accommodate 8 production lines capable of manufacturing 200 vehicles each  i.e.  a capacity of 1 600 vehicles per year. It will bring the total capacity to 2 400 vehicles per year. In the immediate future  it will allow the production of 400 additional vehicles per year and will make it possible to meet the contracts signed with the world leaders in e-commerce  transport and logistics.Next stepsHyVolution in Paris: May 11 to 12Advanced Clean Transportation (ACT) Expo in Los Angeles: May 9 to 12H2 Racing Truck World TourAbout GAUSSINGAUSSIN is an engineering company that designs  assembles and sells innovative products and services in the transport and logistics field.

Scheduled to open in the summer of 2022  CBI's metaverse aims to offer richer and more diverse experiences than traditional video games.A true exchange and sharing platform  AlphaVerse is designed around a central ""Hub""  that connects many different universes in the gaming and entertainment universes. Some universes are developed by CBI directly  while others are developed by CBI with partners  and others are developed by third parties to be linked to AlphaVerse through the Hub. Today  CBI has focused its content on video games  entertainment  and in particular music and digital arts  interests that bring together large communities. It has also developed an original model for funding charitable initiatives. Within this framework  CBI has partnered with and launched the development of various universes and associated NFTs  including MetaCoaster  United at Home  Chi Modu  Horyou and Artech.The universes offer gaming and interaction experiences  content sharing and creation  and exchanges. Visitors and players will be able to create  offer  and trade content within the game through NFTs and cryptocurrencies  as well as outside it  on various blockchain platforms.In addition to the metaverse  CBI’s projects include developing and marketing non-fungible tokens (""NFTs"") and cryptocurrencies  and specifically Crystal  Alphaverse's cryptocurrency  of which 600 million units have been created on the blockchain with the first private sales already completed  and more generally  the investment in blockchain technology related projects.Main achievements in FY 2021-2022FY 2021-22 enabled the company to establish the foundations for its development and starting up its activity. The last few months were marked by the following transactions:September 2021: Finalization of the contribution in kind of assets to the Company (see below)September 2021: Creation of the Crystal (CRYS) token  the cryptocurrency to be used in AlphaVerse - 600 million units created on the Binance Smart ChainOctober 2021: Listing of CBI shares on Euronext GrowthNovember 2021: First sales of CRYS and NFTJanuary 2022: 10-for-1 stock split in January 2022February 2022: Allocation of free shares  based on one free share for every four shares heldMarch 2022: Buyback and cancellation of the warrant that allowed Atari to acquire 5% of CBI's share capital at a price of €0.1 per share  in exchange for the termination of the Atari license  payment of USD $100 000  €12 000 and transfer of 3 500 000 Atari shares held by CBI to Atari.Objectives for FY 2022-23For FY 2022-23  the goal is to continue to develop AlphaVerse to become one of the main players in the metaverse worldwide.CBI is targeting significant revenue growth  driven by the launch of AlphaVerse and the first associated universes  including MetaCoaster (theme park game)  Chi Modu (hip-hop artist photographer)  Horyou (environmental protection foundation)  Art Tech (digital art)  Rave Age (electronic music) and Xave (music  currently being acquired).The level of profitability in 2022-23 will depend on the composition of revenues and is therefore difficult to predict at this stage.Preliminary consolidated financial statements for FY 2021-22The preliminary consolidated financial statements at March 31  2022 have been prepared in accordance with IFRS accounting principles and standards.They include the activities of the operating companies Crypto Blockchain Industries  SA  OP Productions  LLC and Free Reign East  LLC from April 1  2021 to March 31  2022 as well as the contribution in kind of cash  Atari shares  Atari tokens and the investment in National Carrier Exchange  LLC (contribution made on September 24  2021) and lastly CBI’s buyback  on March 29  2022  of the warrant that allowed the Atari Group to acquire 5% of CBI’s share capital for a price per share equal to the par value  i.e. €0.1 per share.PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTIFRS  in € ’000 and in % of revenues March 31  2022 March 31  2021 Change Revenues 4 280.7 100.0% 0 0 100.0% n/s n/s Cost of goods solds (487.1) -11.4% - 0.0% n/s n/s Gross margin 3 793.6 88.6% 0 0 100.0% n/s n/s R&D expenses (538.5) -12.6% (0 0) 0.0% n/s n/s Sales & marketing expenses (562.5) -13.1% (0 0) 0.0% n/s n/s G&A expenses (749.6) -17.5% (5.0) 0.0% n/s n/s Other operating income (expenses) - - - 0.0% n/s n/s Current operating income 1 943.0 45.4% (5 0) n/s n/s n/s Other income (expenses) - - - 0.0% n/s n/s Operating income 1 943.0 45.4% (5 0) n/s n/s n/s Cost of debt (62 2) -1 4% - 0.0% n/s n/s Other financial income (expenses) 2 044 7 47 7% - 0.0% n/s n/s Income taxes - - - 0.0% n/s n/s Net profit (loss) 3 925.5 91.7% (5 0) n/s n/s n/s Minority interests (118.5) -2.8% - 0.0% n/s n/s Net profit Group share 3 807.0 88.9% (5 0) n/s n/s n/sThe CBI Group had no activity in FY 2020-21  as the Company was formed in January 2021.Preliminary consolidated revenuesThe first sales of licenses and NFTs started at the end of November 2021  and the results at March 31  2022 therefore represent four months of activity.At March 31  2022  CBI is reporting preliminary consolidated revenues of €4 280.7K  mainly from the first sales of NFTs and tokens related to the development of the universes and AlphaVerse  and to a lesser extent  the licenses and online games of the subsidiaries OP Productions and Free Reign East. NCX is not consolidated.Over the four months of commercial activities  the proceeds from sales of NFTs and tokens are mainly derived from the sales or pre-sales recorded for AlphaVerse  including United at Home (Beat AlphaVerse)  among others.Preliminary consolidated income from operationsThe pro forma gross margin came to 88.6% of revenues for the period.Preliminary consolidated research and development expenses include the development and operation of video games. Their change depends on the level of new features developed. Classic video games are fully amortized  and there is no additional depreciation. With respect to the metaverse  the value of the intellectual property rights is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and has not been amortized at March 31  2022  as this amortization starts from the opening of the metaverse.Preliminary consolidated sales and marketing expenses include advertising of the games through the launch of online campaigns. The expenses for the period related to OP Productions' game with new features  which resulted in additional marketing expenses to acquire additional players  and to marketing operations on the metaverse.Preliminary consolidated general and administrative expenses for the period mainly reflect management expenses  as well as general expenses related to the listing of the company's shares on Euronext Growth market.Preliminary consolidated operating income for the period came to €1 943.0k  compared to €(5.0)k for the same period last year.The preliminary consolidated financial expenses reflects the interest paid at the legal rate on the Ker Ventures loan and the IFRS 16 restatements  while consolidated financial income mainly reflects the capital gains recorded by the investment services provider TSAF under the liquidity contract for CBI shares.Preliminary consolidated minority interests represent the amount attributable to the 23% owners of OP Productions  LLC and Free Reign East  LLC and totaled €118.5K for the period.There is no corporate income tax payable for the period.The preliminary consolidated net profit (Group share) for the period came to €3 807.0 K  compared with a €(5.0) K loss for the same period last year.PRELIMINARY CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETASSETS (in €’000) March 31  2022 March 31  2021 Intangible assets 6 912.9 - Tangible assets 11.8 - IFRS 16 restatement (leases) 2 236.2 - Financial assets 12 246.6 - LONG-TERM ASSETS 21 407.5 - Inventory of cryptocurrencies and NFTs 2 828.5 - Accounts receivable 440.4 Cash and liquidity 2 647.2 37.0 SHORT-TERM ASSETS 5 916.1 37.0 TOTAL ASSETS 27 323.6 37.0SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES (in €’000) March 31  2022 March 31  2021 Share capital 24 258.8 37.0 Premium and consolidated reserves (10 446.8) - Net Income  Group share 3 807.0 (5.0) CONSOLIDATED EQUITY  GROUPE SHARE 17 619.0 32.0 Minority interests 206.6 - TOTAL CONSOLIDATED EQUITY 17 825.6 32.0 Shareholders’ loan 4 573.4 - Restatement IFRS 16 (leases) 2 015.6 - LONG-TERM LIABILITIES 6 589.0 - Accounts payable 2 559.2 5.0 Other liabilities 349.8 - SHORT-TERM LIABILITIES 2 909.0 - SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 27 323.6 37.0Preliminary consolidated intangible assetsAmounts invested in the development of the games and the metaverse are capitalized and amortized from the date they are put into service. For the metaverse  the value of the intellectual property rights is recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and has not been amortized at March 31  2022. This amortization will begin when the metaverse opens  scheduled for the end of the first half FY 2022-23.Preliminary consolidated financial assetsWhen listed  the portfolio of shares and financial instruments is valued based on a volume-weighted average price calculated over six months (V-WAP). This method was also used for the contribution in kind made in September 2021. Atari shares were used during the year to buy back the warrant issued to the Atari Group.Preliminary consolidated token and NFT inventoryThe inventory of tokens is recorded at cost  based on the purchase price. Each cryptocurrency is valued based on different volume-weighted average prices to reflect the value of each cryptocurrency and the overall portfolio. If the cost price of a cryptocurrency is less than its market value  no unearned revenue is recognized. If the cost price of a cryptocurrency is greater than its market value  an impairment loss is recognized in profit and loss. At March 31  2022 the inventory was valued at €2 828.5K.Preliminary Consolidated Shareholders’ Equity / Redemption of the WarrantPreliminary consolidated shareholders’ equity  Group share  totaled €17 619.0 K at March 31  2022.The increase is due to the profit for the year  the contribution of assets by Ker Ventures  EURL during the period  the private placement of shares in October 2021  all reduced by the repurchase price of the warrant issued to the Atari Group and cancelled as part of the agreement signed between CBI and Atari on March 29  2022.The change in preliminary consolidated shareholders’ equity can be broken down as follows:Equity as at March 31  2021 (000’s of euros) 32.0 Net income for the year 3 807.0 Contribution in kind 23 000.0 Rights issue / Private round and others 2 740.0 Expenses (809.8) Restatement IFRS 16 (435.3) Repurchase of Atari Warrant (10 716.9) Currency translation adjustments / Others 2 0 Equity as at March 31  2022 (000’s of euros) 17 619.0The March 29  2022 agreement was set up to unwind the capitalistic relationship between the two companies and to terminate the license agreement granted by Atari to CBI. Under the terms of this agreement  it is notably agreed as follows:Atari transfers back to CBI the warrant allowing Atari to acquire 5% of CBI’s share capital at par value (€0.1 per share)  which is then cancelled;CBI pays USD $100K to Atari and will transfer to Atari the 3.5 million Atari shares in its possession;CBI will not participate in Atari's pending capital increase;Atari and CBI have mutually agreed not to acquire any securities issued by the other entity for a period of five years;The license granted by Atari to CBI to operate certain Atari assets in the metaverse is terminated with immediate effect; the Atari NFTs sold by CBI will remain outstanding.The agreement was effective immediately and includes reciprocal concessions and non-interference clauses. The agreement covers each company  CBI and Atari  their subsidiaries  as well as their respective principal shareholders who are signatories to this agreement in their personal capacity (namely Frédéric Chesnais for CBI and Wade Rosen for Atari).The Warrant issued to Atari was an equity instrument  as it allowed Atari to acquire 5% of the share capital of CBI  a company whose shares are listed on Euronext Growth  for a price per CBI share equal to its par value. This Warrant was repurchased by CBI prior to its expiration date  in a transaction with a third party  and cancelled. The redemption price was charged to CBI's consolidated shareholders' equity at March 31  2022.The repurchase price includes the value of the Atari shares delivered as payment  cash on hand of USD$100 000 and other expense reimbursements. This price also includes  as a matter of prudence  given the commitments made over five years and the non-interference clauses referred to in the transaction protocol  the immediate loss of value of the ATRI token (€8 661.7K) insofar as its usefulness to the CBI Group over the next five years is fundamentally impacted by this transaction protocol.Preliminary consolidated net cash / financial liabilitiesAt March 31  2022  the Group had cash and cash equivalents of €2 647.2K. The application of IFRS 16 (Restatement of Leases) results in the recognition of a of €2 252.1 K accounting liability (of which €2 015.6K being classified as long- term liability  the balance being classified as short-term liability).Ker Ventures has contributed assets to the Company  in return for the issue of new shares and a deferred payment recorded as a shareholder loan for an amount of €4 450.2 K. This loan accrues interest at the legal rate and is classified as a long-term liability.The contribution of assets  completed on September 24  2021  was as follows:Description (€ ‘000) Cash 549.1 Atari Shares 1 953.0 Crypto-currencies 9 338.6 Investments in companies 15 609.6 Total Contribution 27 450.2 Shares 18 000.0 Premium 5 000.0 Shareholders' Loan 4 450.2 Total compensation 27 450.2Financial calendar:• June 30  2022: Release of the final FY 2021-2022 corporate and consolidated financial statements• September 19  2022 (5pm CET): General shareholders meetingDisclaimer:The realisation of projects  as well as their operational budget and financing plan  remain fundamentally subject to uncertainties  and the non-realisation of the underlying assumptions may have a significant impact on the value of assets and liabilities.About CBICRYPTO BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRIES (“CBI”) is a French company that develops  operates and invests in video games  business applications and selected projects relating to the blockchain  non-fungible tokens (“NFTs”) and cryptocurrencies.

We also saw a $50 million milestone from AstraZeneca triggered due to the first patient dosed in April in the Phase 3 lung cancer trial. This means our cash position is considerably strengthened to fund our pipeline ambitions into 2024 ” said Mondher Mahjoubi  Chief Executive Officer of Innate Pharma. “We look forward to additional clinical milestones this year from our broad antibody pipeline  specifically readouts for lacutamab in the second half and further progress on ANKETTM  as we leverage scientific expertise and strong partnerships to deliver innovative treatments for people with cancer.”Webcast and conference call will be held today at 2:00pm CEST (8:00am EDT)The live webcast will be available at the following link:https://event.on24.com/wcc/r/3759098/7B02319F4F19D3C195707D21AF02B664Participants may also join via telephone using the dial-in details below:France: 0805 620 704United States: 1 844 200 6205 / 1 646 904 5544United Kingdom: 44 208 0682 558All other locations: +1 929 526 1599Access code: 051477This information can also be found on the Investors section of the Innate Pharma website  www.innate-pharma.com.A replay of the webcast will be available on the Company website for 90 days following the event.Pipeline highlights:Lacutamab (IPH4102  anti-KIR3DL2 antibody):The Phase 2 TELLOMAK study in Sézary syndrome and mycosis fungoides (MF) continues to progress and the Company expects to report preliminary data from both cohorts in the second half of 2022. In March 2022  Innate announced the opening of a new MF all-comers cohort in the TELLOMAK study. The all-comers cohort will be recruiting both KIR3DL2 expressors and non-expressors to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment outcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay as a potential companion diagnostic.Two clinical trials are underway evaluating lacutamab in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing  relapsed/refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL):Phase 1b trial: a Company-sponsored Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate lacutamab as a monotherapy in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed PTCL.Phase 2 KILT (anti-KIR in T Cell Lymphoma) trial: The Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) investigator-sponsored  randomized trial to evaluate lacutamab in combination with chemotherapy GEMOX (gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin) versus GEMOX alone in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed/refractory PTCL.ANKETTM (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):Recruitment continues in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi evaluating IPH6101/SAR443579  the first NKp46/CD16-based NK cell engager  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high risk- myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS).IPH64  the second ANKETTM drug candidate of the research collaboration with Sanofi  is progressing and the Company looks forward to updates on this asset.Innate will provide updates on IPH65  the tetra-specific ANKETTM  throughout the year as progress is made toward an IND-enabling study in 2023.Monalizumab (anti-NKG2A antibody)  partnered with AstraZeneca:On April 29  2022  Innate announced a $50 million milestone payment from AstraZeneca was triggered for dosing the first patient in the Phase 3 clinical trial  PACIFIC-9  evaluating durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab or AstraZeneca’s oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable  Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT). This is a post-period event.Detailed results from the randomized AstraZeneca-sponsored Phase 2 COAST clinical trial  including monalizumab data in combination with durvalumab  were published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology on April 22  2022. The results were initially presented during the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress 2021. The results of the interim analysis showed monalizumab in combination with durvalumab improved progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) compared to durvalumab alone in patients with unresectable  Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had not progressed after concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT). The Journal of Clinical Oncology publication now includes exploratory subgroup analysis.An oral presentation on April 11  2022 at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting from the AstraZeneca-sponsored Phase 2 NeoCOAST randomized trial in resectable  early-stage NSCLC highlighted improved disease responses with durvalumab in combination withmonalizumab  oleclumab or danvatirsen  when compared to durvalumab alone. The follow-up randomized clinical trial  NeoCOAST-2  is enrolling patients with resectable  stage IIA-IIIA NSCLC to receive neoadjuvant durvalumab combined with chemotherapy and either oleclumab or monalizumab  followed by surgery and adjuvant durvalumab plus oleclumab or monalizumab.The AstraZeneca-sponsored Phase 3 INTERLINK-1 trial of monalizumab plus cetuximab in immuno-oncology-pretreated head and neck cancer is ongoing with final data expected in 2024.IPH5201 (anti-CD39)  partnered with AstraZeneca:Data for the Phase 1 trial in solid tumors with IPH5201 alone or in combination with durvalumab (PD-L1) are expected to be presented in 2023.IPH5301 (anti-CD73):In March 2022  The Institut Paoli-Calmettes announced that the first patient had been dosed in the investigator-sponsored Phase 1 trial of IPH5301 (CHANCES). The trial will be conducted in two parts  Part 1  the dose escalation  followed by a Part 2 safety expansion study cohort. Part 2 will evaluate IPH5301 in combination with chemotherapy and trastuzumab in HER2+ cancer patients.ATM program:On May 05  2022  Innate announced the commencement of an At-The-Market (ATM) program  pursuant to which it may  from time to time  offer and sell to eligible investors a total gross amount of up to $75 million American Depositary Shares (“ADS”).

In addition to this unprecedented success  this performance once again demonstrates the technological edge of our Order-to-Cash solution  our real commercial delivery capacity and the strength of our SaaS model. The return of inflation and the multiple hikes in interest rates will only increase appetite among businesses for solutions that secure and accelerate cash flow generation.“This market performance will be further strengthened by the recognition of Sidetrade as a Leader in the first Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Integrated Invoice-to-Cash Applications. This provides tremendous potential for growth in our business in the United States and in our enterprise accounts in Europe. We are now  more than ever  in the best possible position to consolidate our initial success in the United States  accelerate our growth in all regions and take Sidetrade to the next level.”Sidetrade hits quarterly new bookings record  with a surge of +132% in Q1 2022In Q1 2022  Sidetrade set a new record for Order-to-Cash SaaS bookings  which will generate an additional €2.17 million in annual recurring revenue (""ARR"")  compared with €0.94 million in Q1 2021; a 132% increase. The former record for bookings (ARR of €1.67 million) had been set in the previous quarter (Q4 2021). The total value of these new subscription contracts over their initial contract periods (excluding renewals) represents €6.91 million of total contract value (""TCV"").Story continuesTo these SaaS bookings should be added €1.09 million of services on an annual basis (implementation  configuration  training  recurring services  etc.)  compared with €0.81 million in Q1 2021. As a result  the annual contract value (ACV) of these orders in Q1 2022 was €3.27 million  compared with €1.75 million in Q1 2021  an 87% increase.The initial contract period for new customers (excluding renewals) rose to 40.8 months  compared with 36.2 months in the same quarter of the previous fiscal year.81% of bookings were international  with 62% from the United StatesIn Q1 2022  international orders represented more than 81% of all bookings  driven by unprecedented momentum in sales with world-leading organizations. As a result of inflation and recruitment difficulties  businesses have been driven to invest in Order-to-Cash solutions to accelerate their cash flow generation in an environment of rising interest rates  thereby increasing their productivity.Less than a year after operations were officially launched in North America  Sidetrade signed the largest contract in its history with a major Information Technology consultancy firm (see the press release issued on February 21  2022). This contract  awarded to Sidetrade in preference over its three direct US competitors  provides it with an additional ARR of €1.36 million in this region  i.e.  62% of all bookings in Q1 2022.As a reminder  Sidetrade had set itself the goal of achieving more than one-third of its bookings in the United States by the second half of 2022. Buoyed by this initial success and its recognition as a Leader in the first Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Integrated Invoice-to-Cash Applications  Sidetrade intends to ramp up its presence in North America by doubling its sales force in 2022.In this quarter  New Business includes the record-breaking contract signed in the United States  representing 69% of total bookings. Cross-selling represents 15% of total new bookings  with the remaining 16% of bookings accounting for Upselling of additional modules to existing customers.Growth in Order-to-Cash SaaS revenue  up +21%Sidetrade(€m) 2022 Q1 2021 Q1 Change ‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities 8.1 6.8 +19% of which SaaS Subscriptions 6.7 5.5 +21% ‘Sales & Marketing’ Activities 0.3 0.7 -57% Revenue 8.4 7.5 +12%2022 Q1 accounts have been audited and will be certified after the finalization of procedures required for the annual financial report.‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities grew very sharply to 19% in Q1 2022  driven by 21% growth in SaaS subscriptions. The growth in this recurring revenue is the result of record bookings in the 2021 fiscal year  which will continue to impact revenue growth throughout the 2022 fiscal year.‘Order-to-Cash’ Activities  a core business within the Company’s strategy since 2019  now represent 96% of total revenue.In addition  ‘Sales & Marketing’ Activities  which were launched in 2017 and were mainly focused on the French SME market  have become secondary to Sidetrade’s activities and have not been technologically integrated into the Order-to-Cash platform. They now account for only 4% of total revenue and will continue to play a less prominent role commercially  with estimated revenue of €0.9 million at end 2022.Total revenue grew by 12% in Q1 2022  to €8.4 million. In addition to this performance  international revenue continued to grow substantially  reaching 49% of revenue for the very first time  with the United States representing 19% of the total.A resilient economic model against inflationary pressuresVisibility of recurring revenue from subscriptions in a period of economic uncertaintySidetrade’s economic model provides its business with significant resilience  as 90% of its revenue is recurring  representing a significant advantage in the current environment. The robustness of its model is based on signing contracts that span multiple years. These comprise an average initial commitment period of 36.25 months (increasing to 40.8 months for new customers acquired in Q1 2022)  followed by successive periods of the same length. With a controlled churn of between 5% and 6% on average for Order-to-Cash solutions  the average time a customer remains with Sidetrade is close to 20 years.Resilience of the economic model in a period of high inflationDue to the length of its subscription periods  Sidetrade systematically reindexes all its contracts to changes in consumer price indices (the Syntec for Southern Europe  the UK CPI for Northern Europe  and the US CPI for the United States)  and alters the total price of subscriptions each year by reference to changes in these price indices. In addition to the fact that the rising cost of cash and salaries has made Order-to-Cash solutions more attractive to financial departments  the construction of Sidetrade’s economic model demonstrates robust pricing power that protects the Company’s future revenue against inflationary pressures.Sidetrade recognized as a Leader in the first Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Integrated Invoice-to-Cash Applications  and unveils a global map of B2B payment trendsOn April 11  2022  Sidetrade was recognized as one of three Leaders in the Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Invoice-to-Cash applications.Following this recognition  for the first time ever  Sidetrade made the move to reveal global B2B payment trends in an industry-first predictive payment intelligence map. This is extracted from its Data Lake   comprising of 593 million payment experiences  worth a total value of more than $4.6 trillion processed over the last three years from 20.7 million B2B buyers worldwide. This map offers users (businesses  governments  and analysts) unprecedented information on how buyers pay their suppliers  an invaluable resource in a climate of global uncertainty and inflationary pressures.Next financial announcementsAnnual Shareholder general meeting: June 16  2022 (11:00 am CEST  virtual)2022 First Half Year Revenue: July 19  2022  after the stock market closesInvestor relationsChristelle Dhrif +33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia relationsRebecca Parlby +44 7824 505 584 bparlby@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

Significant improvement in the MG-ADL was observed from Week 1.All key secondary endpoints were also met  including statistically significant improvements in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score  Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15-Item revised (MG-QoL15r)  again with significant improvement observed from Week 1. The proportion of patients on zilucoplan who responded to treatment by at least a 3-point reduction on MG-ADL and at least a 5-point reduction in QMG were also significantly higher than placebo.A favorable safety profile and good tolerability was observed  consistent with prior data  showing a similar rate of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) between zilucoplan (76.7%) and placebo (70.5%). The most common TEAEs were injection site bruising  headache  diarrhea  and MG worsening.In the RAISE study  174 patients were randomised to placebo (N=88) and zilucoplan 0.3 mg/kg (N=86). Patient demographics and baseline disease characteristics were generally balanced between treatment arms.""The results from the RAISE study are an exciting development in the gMG treatment paradigm and reinforce the critical role that complement inhibition could play for physicians treating patients with this debilitating illness. By targeting the underlying mechanisms of gMG at the neuromuscular junction  complement inhibitors like zilucoplan have the potential to provide rapid  consistent disease control earlier in the disease course. These findings are an encouraging sign that we may be able to meet patients' needs effectively  with treatments that are minimally invasive and well tolerated "" said James F. Howard  MD  Distinguished Professor of Neuromuscular Disease  Professor of Neurology  Medicine and Allied Health  The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine and lead investigator in the RAISE trial.Phase 3 MycarinG resultsResults from the Phase 3 MycarinG study (NCT03971422) (poster 25)2 demonstrated that rozanolixizumab significantly reduced MG-ADL from baseline to Day 43 at ~7 mg/kg and ~10 mg/kg doses compared with placebo in patients with AChR or muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) autoantibody positive gMG. Rozanolixizumab demonstrated a placebo-corrected mean improvement of 2.586 points at the ~7 mg/kg dose and 2.619 points in the MG-ADL at the ~10 mg/kg dose compared with placebo (both doses at p<0.001).Rozanolixizumab treatment reduced mean maximum total IgG levels by more than 70% (71 % for 7 mg/kg and 78% for 10 mg/kg) and anti-AChR autoantibody levels decreased over the treatment period in line with the total IgG reduction. Rozanolixizumab was generally well tolerated  with the majority of TEAEs being mild to moderate in intensity. A higher proportion of TEAEs occurred in the active treatment arms versus placebo (81.3% for ~7 mg/kg  82.6% for ~10 mg/kg and 67.2% for placebo). The most frequently reported TEAE was headache  most of which were mild to moderate  with severe headaches managed with over-the-counter analgesic medications. The other most common TEAEs were diarrhea  pyrexia and nausea.Due to the fluctuating and unpredictable nature of gMG and the subjectivity of symptoms  patient reported outcomes (PROs) help provide greater insight into disease impact and more granular detail on the effect of treatments than traditional endpoints. Within the MycarinG study  the MG Symptoms PRO measure  which was developed by UCB with patients  was used to assess a series of quality-of-life measures  including muscle weakness fatigability  physical fatigue and bulbar muscle weakness  throughout the treatment and observation periods (poster 64)3. All three MG Symptoms PRO scales or subdomains showed significant improvement from baseline with rozanolixizumab ~7 mg/kg and ~10 mg/kg doses compared with placebo at Day 43  indicating treatment with rozanolixizumab improves patients' symptoms and their ability to undertake daily activities. Further evaluation of the MG Symptoms PRO measure is ongoing.In the MycarinG study  a total of 66 patients were randomized to rozanolixizumab 7 mg/kg  67 to rozanolixizumab 10 mg/kg and 67 to placebo. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between treatment groups.""The one constant in gMG is unpredictability. People living with this disease experience symptoms that are nebulous  fluctuating  and which vary from one day to the next. For this reason  there is an urgent need for more effective  targeted  and convenient treatments that reduce the burden of disease on patients' daily lives. The results from the MycarinG study are extremely encouraging  and demonstrate the potential of rozanolixizumab as a new  effective and flexible treatment option to help ease the day-to-day burden of this challenging disease and improve treatment outcomes for patients "" said Professor Vera Bril  Professor of Medicine (Neurology)  University of Toronto  Director of the Neuromuscular Section  Division of Neurology  University of Toronto and University Health Network  Toronto  and lead investigator of the MycarinG study.""Every person living with gMG is unique  so a one-size-fits-all treatment approach will never be appropriate. This is why at UCB we are investigating two medicines with different MOAs. This unique approach means we may be able to offer physicians and patients a range of treatment options to meet the individual needs of many different patients  and therefore leave no one behind in our ambition to improve outcomes in gMG "" said Iris Loew-Friedrich  Executive Vice-President and Chief Medical Officer at UCB.UCB anticipates filing regulatory submissions for both zilucoplan and rozanolixizumab later this year.Digital innovation for patients living with myasthenia gravisFindings from a three-month observational study carried out by UCB in collaboration with digital health company Sharecare  to collect real-world data from gMG patients using smartphones  were also presented at the conference (poster 84)4. Beyond demonstrating that decentralized  smartphone-based methods to collect real-world data from gMG patients are feasible and may provide enhanced visibility into the burden of the disease  the study also identified unique clusters of exacerbation subtypes with specific symptom representation. This requires further validation but suggests that digital phenotyping holds promise for furthering understanding of exacerbations. This analysis forms part of UCB's holistic approach to delivering differentiated patient experiences  combining patient insights  pioneering research and artificial intelligence to deliver tailored support for individuals living with gMG.""Our gMG pipeline is supported by a holistic and integrated platform of support services and digital innovation that aims to deliver broad access to seamless and flexible services across the gMG care continuum "" continued Charl van Zyl  Executive Vice President Neurology & Head of Europe/International Markets at UCB. ""Our ultimate goal is to transform the lives of people living with this challenging disease by putting patients at the center of our world and advancing scientific solutions that meet their complex and varying needs.""For further information  contact UCB:Brand Communications  Rare DiseasesJim BaxterT+32.2.473.78.85.01[email protected]Media Relations  U.S. Rare DiseasesNatalie Jones LaceyT+ 404.229.3737[email protected]Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14[email protected]About Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)Myasthenia gravis is a rare disease impacting almost 200 000 patients in the U.S.  EU and Japan.5 6 People living with gMG can experience a variety of symptoms  including drooping eyelids  double vision and difficulty swallowing  chewing and talking  as well as severe muscular weakness that can result in life threatening weakness of the muscles of respiration.7gMG is a chronic and unpredictable auto-immune disease in which pathogenic autoantibodies can inhibit synaptic transmission at the neuro-muscular junction by targeting specific proteins on the post-synaptic membrane. This disrupts the ability of the nerves to stimulate the muscle and results in a weaker contraction8. gMG can occur at any age and in any race  although previous studies have shown that women are more often impacted than men.8 Most patients with gMG have pathogenic IgG antibodies that disrupt the transmission of nerve impulses to muscles in the NMJ and some activate the complement cascade. Complement-mediated destruction via MAC formation is a key mechanism causing damage at the NMJ and is the key driver of disease in AChR Ab+ gMG.About the zilucoplan RAISE study9The RAISE study (NCT04115293) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study to confirm the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with gMG. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily subcutaneous (SC) doses of zilucoplan or placebo for 12 weeks.The primary endpoint for RAISE study is change from baseline to Week 12 in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living (MG-ADL) score. Secondary endpoints include change in the Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score  the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) and the Myasthenia Gravis Quality of Life 15 revised (MG-QoL15r) from baseline to Week 12  the proportion requiring rescue therapy  the proportion with minimum symptom expression (MSE) (defined as MG-ADL of 0 or 1)  the proportion with a ≥3-point reduction in MG-ADL and the proportion with a ≥5-point reduction in QMG  all measured at Week 12. The majority of patients taking part in the RAISE trial opted to enroll in any future extensions to this clinical trial. As a result  UCB is exploring the potential for further extension studies into this treatment.For more information about the trial visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT04115293.About the rozanolixizumab MycarinG study10The MycarinG study (NCT03971422) is a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rozanolixizumab in adult patients with gMG  with an open-label extension.The primary endpoint for the MycarinG study is change in the Myasthenia Gravis-Activities of Daily Living Profile (MG-ADL) score  an eight-item patient-reported scale developed to assess MG symptoms and their effects on daily activities. Additional endpoints include response rates  changes in the Myasthenia Gravis composite (MGC) score  the Quantitative MG (QMG) score  patient-reported outcomes and adverse events (AEs). The majority of patients taking part in the MycarinG study opted to enroll in any future extensions to this clinical trial. As a result  UCB is exploring the potential for further extension studies into this treatment.For more information about the trial  visit https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT03971422.About ZilucoplanZilucoplan is a once-daily self-administered SC peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5 inhibitor) under clinical development by UCB in gMG. Results from the RAISE study  a multi-center  Phase 3  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled study demonstrate the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of zilucoplan in patients with gMG  and regulatory submissions are planned in 2022.The safety and efficacy of zilucoplan have not been established and it is not currently approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About RozanolixizumabRozanolixizumab is a SC administered  humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds  with high affinity  to human neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). It has been designed to block the interaction of FcRn and Immunoglobulin G (IgG)  accelerating the catabolism of antibodies and reducing the concentration of pathogenic IgG autoantibodies.11 12Rozanolixizumab is under clinical development with the aim of improving the lives of people with pathogenic IgG-autoantibody-driven autoimmune diseases.The safety and efficacy of rozanolixizumab have not been established and it is not approved for use in any indication by any regulatory authority worldwide.About UCB in Rare DiseasesAt UCB  we don't just see patients or population sizes  we see people in need.

Similarly  all the major museums and art galleries are creating and offering their own NFTs.The digital art created in the 1980s is finally coming of age with over a billion art-NFT enthusiasts actively pursuing creations in this medium at prices that are now very accessible.Artprice has already identified over 54 000 artists who are directly producing NFTs for their buying public  and this is only the very start of a major paradigm shift.According to sociologists  art historians and analysts  we are in the midst of major evolution that will definitively modify the structure of the art market as it has developed since the 1950s. This change is clearly confirmed by Artprice's art market analysts  particularly its econometricians.In its various reports on the Art Market  Artmarket.com has always indicated that it is impossible to understand the exponential growth of the NFT market without understanding the technological background to their existence. This 'history' includes Blockchain  cryptocurrencies and their cultural origin in the Cypherpunk community (period of data encryption – type PGP – at the beginning of 1990s).However  all players in the art-NFT market – OpenSea  Rarible  LooksRare  Nifty Gateway  Superare etc. – agree that the NFT revolution will ultimately take place in the Metaverse. In other words  it is illusory to envisage growth and a sustainable future for NFTs without the development of the Metaverse.The Metaverse is a set of virtual worlds. The term is regularly used to describe the future version of the Internet where virtual  durable and shared spaces are accessible via 3D interaction.Similarly  the Metaverse can be conceived as a set of virtual worlds connected to the Internet  which are perceived in augmented reality.Experts from the financial  economic  scientific and academic spheres are unanimous in considering the Metaverse as the natural extension of the Internet (Web 3.0).Ninety-five percent of the multinationals in Fortune's Global 500 ranking have Metaverse projects under development.These Metaverse projects now represent an economic and scientific equation that will either raise their business turnovers in a spectacular manner  or become a financial abyss  depending on the R&D choices they make.While Meta (Facebook) and Microsoft have retained colossal budgets for writing and coding virtual worlds  certain groups  and in particular Artmarket.com  are taking a different route which should make it possible to radically reduce the development costs of their Metaverses and become operational relatively quickly.Artprice by Artmarket.com's principal and founding shareholder is Server Group  an Internet pioneer since 1987  but also one of the pioneers of CGI hardware and software as of 1985.Server Group has owned a multitude of subsidiaries over the past 35 years and has acquired deep knowledge in the field of immersive video games and cinematic and televisual post-production. Appearing in the mid-1980s  the technologies in these areas are considered by the scientific community as the very first Metaverses.Artmarket.com's Metaverse project is built in its world-famous headquarters located in the heart of the Organe Contemporary Art Museum which manages La Demeure du Chaos  or the ""Abode of Chaos"" (as baptised by the New York Times).This Metaverse is revolutionary because it minimizes production costs and times and is based on the knowledge acquired by the Server Group from video game multinationals and film and network producers over the past 35 years (Studio Lumiere999® Paris/NY).For the record  the Abode of Chaos was created in 1999 (more than 23 years ago) by thierry Ehrmann  an artist/sculptor since 1980 (certified biography Who's Who In France in 2022).An open-air Museum of Contemporary Art occupying nearly 9 000 square meters  the Abode of Chaos is a unique museum circuit designed from its origin as a large-scale 'escape game' with elements of augmented reality.Among the nearly 6 300 distinct artworks there are 4 500 sculptures in raw steel – some weighing several hundred tons – as well as paintings  street art  engravings  installations  digital artworks and land artworks. The museum is equipped with a very powerful electronic network (optical fiber over 9000 m2  wifi 802.11ax  idO connected works of art  etc.).The Abode of Chaos and the Contemporary Art Museum that hosts it receives 180 000 visitors a year  of whom 25% come from outside France.Over the past 23 years the Abode of Chaos has been the subject of nearly 3 600 written and audiovisual press reports in 72 countries. It has also been exquisitely reflected in a major tome  Opus IX  a 504-page bilingual reference work that can be consulted free of charge online in PDF format as well as on the Issuu website  where it has been downloaded 37 million times (figure officially confirmed by a French Huissier SCP Mamet-Pons).In the international press  the Abode of Chaos has been described as an ensemble of distinct Œuvres and as an unavoidable and unique ""Factory"" with a place in Art History as one of the most significant artistic projects of the early 21st century.The Server Group and the Organe Museum have invested several million euros in this successful project  financed exclusively from equity capital after a solid IPO project (see Artmarket.com's universal registration document filed with the AMF  chapter 3.2.23).thierry Ehrmann – CEO and Founder of Server Group and Artprice by Artmarket.com – followed the example of major video game creators and film directors/producers to build the group's Metaverse based on 25 years of world famous physical creations.For the construction of its Metaverse  over the past three years Server Group has formed a number of alliances  notably with one of the main European spatial geometry groups  creating a European dream-team for 3D Design  Engineering  3D Lab and Scanner Surveys.Whereas Meta (formerly Facebook) is starting to build its Metaverse from scratch  Artmarket and Server Group is starting from the fundamental reality of 6 300 original art creations in reference to the contemporary art world - on a 9 000 m² site.This history has given us a substantial head start  saving both time and money  because the approach is completely different when you have undeniable global recognition for nearly 25 years.The technical specifications included the use/production of Faro Lidar 3D Scanner  Navis VLX  drones  Polygonal Ground Photogrammetry in a single reference and development system  and Augmented Intelligence processing to reveal the singular characteristics of the works and their architectural 'formativity'.Specialized spatial data engineers and surveyors scanned and digitized the 9000 m² of the Organe Contemporary Art Museum  including its multiple basements and elevations  and all of the 6 300 artworks. The result weighed 45 To and including the 27 years of post-production and digital production conducted by Server Group and its subsidiaries.The Group's Metaverse was therefore generated from a vast physical medium of which it is the both author and owner. This represents a huge asset in terms of intellectual property. Similarly  the explosion of avatars and the proliferation of virtual multitudes® are part of a narrative already written and scripted by thierry Ehrmann  and known throughout the world.While this ultra high-tech industrial process involving geometricians and spatial data experts required three years of field work (taking advantage of the COVID period)  this approach is very different from the interminable challenges facing Meta (Facebook) of building its Metaverse from lines of code.To understand the route taken by Server Group and Artprice by Artmarket.com  an analogy can be made with a well-known video game publisher whose Metaverse – based in medieval times – was constructed via an extremely detailed 3D scanning of several existing medieval European cities.The results of this work were excellent: with radically reduced production costs  top ranking in box office all over the world - its video game version substantially dwarfed its competitors positioned in the highly-prized 'medieval' segment.It is essential to specify that Artprice by Artmarket.com's Metaverse  whose head office is located in the heart of the Organe Contemporary Art Museum (which manages the Abode of Chaos) is practically complete. This work has required very substantial investments which have been entirely borne by Server Group and its subsidiaries and which have had no impact on Artmarket.com's balance sheets.Artprice by Artmarket.com's founding shareholder is Server Group  which is still by far the largest shareholder with 30.16% of the capital and 45.78% of the voting rights (Ehrmann family not included). Server Group took the industrial risk of investing in its Metaverse based on its confidence in Artmarket.com after 25 years as World Leader in Art Market Information.Under the regime of regulated agreements covered by Server Group at Artmarket.com  whose Metaverse project's profitability will be assured by low user costs because the costs associated with its R&D  and production are infinitely lower than those facing the multinationals who have started coding their Metaverses from scratch. Moreover  their projects are still to be concluded.Artmarket.com's upcoming NFT Marketplace will have an undeniable competitive advantage because the principal existing NFT platforms are facing time constraints  financial constraints  but also copyright constraints. As a result they do not really have successful Metaverses and may well be tempted to join Artmarket.com's metaverse. Artmarket.com which will aim to integrate them into its NFT Marketplace by providing them with its precious imprimatur.Indeed  OpenSea  the world's leading NFT platform  has itself declared that 80% of the primary issues of art NFTs are likely to affect the intellectual property rights of third parties. Faced with this observation  Opensea has announced it is considering solutions to counter this scourge and protect sellers and buyers. We firmly believe that the logical solution to this problem is the certification of the primary market by Artprice through its blockchain and its smart contracts.It is precisely in the primary issue of art NFTs that Artprice by Artmarket.com can achieve an extremely substantial turnover and profit.We are proud to say that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the only company in the global art market that can veritably ensure the certification of primary NFT drops  bearing in mind all the underlying parameters and associated data.The ability to certify primary issues of art NFTs is based on Artmarket.com's position as the global leader in art market information and as the owner and creator of databases containing a quarter of a century of art market data. This databank commands global respect and authority and is backed up by the world's largest collection of notes  manuscripts and sales catalogs (going back to 1700) which guarantee the authenticity and historical credibility of its databases.Lastly  the study report from Dynata  the world's largest data platform for insights  activation and measurement  surveyed more than 62 million panelists and 4 billion insights (reactions from a consumer in the form of data) in 11 countries (United States  Canada  United Kingdom  France  Spain  Germany  Netherlands  Italy  China  Japan and Australia) and published its ""New Experience Economy"" report.The report highlights a very favorable conclusion for Artmarket.com and for its Metaverse  and for its shareholders: 51% of respondents indicated that their favorite virtual (i.e. online) destination is a visit to a museum  an art gallery or an art exhibition.With its Metaverse  which is the ultimate and unavoidable consequence of the NFT revolution  Artprice by Artmarket.com aims to be the most successful and highly competitive art NFT platform. Its Metaverse represents the assurance of an exponential and continuous growth of the art-NFT market. It will be accompanied by Artprice by Artmarket's Blockchain and its smart contracts  thereby allowing a fair remuneration for artists in tendum with copyright societies such as ADAGP to which Artprice has long been one of the main contributors.In addition  the long-standing registration of the artpricecoin.com DNS (.net .org...) and its trademarks demonstrates Artmarket.com's overall strategy  which naturally includes the creation of a specific cryptocurrency after regulatory approvals.The Artprice by Artmarket.com blockchain will mainly use Ethereum for its smart contracts but will remain open to payment in Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies.Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The recommendation is supported by a fairness opinion provided by SEB Corporate Finance  Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) ("" SEB Corporate Finance "").""). An offer document regarding the Offer is expected to be made public on or around June 22  2022. The acceptance period in the Offer is expected to commence on or around June 23  2022 and expire on or around September 30  2022.The Offer is conditional upon the Offer being accepted to such extent that PMHH becomes the owner of shares representing more than 90 percent of the total number of outstanding shares in Swedish Match (on a fully diluted basis). Further  the Offer will be made on the terms and subject to the conditions 2 – 7 set out below in this announcement.Jacek Olczak  Chief Executive Officer of PMI  comments:""We are pleased to announce this exciting next step in Philip Morris International's and Swedish Match's trajectory toward a smoke-free future. Underpinned by compelling strategic and financial rationale  this combination would create a global smoke-free champion—strengthened by complementary geographic footprints  commercial capabilities and product portfolios—and open up significant platforms for growth in the U.S. and internationally. Swedish Match's dedicated employees and management have steadfastly pursued the company's vision of a world without cigarettes  while delivering very strong results. We look forward to building upon this success and joining forces to accelerate our shared smoke-free mission.""Background and reasons for the OfferIn 2016  PMI announced its new mission to replace cigarettes with science-based  less harmful alternatives as soon as possible—to the benefit of people who smoke  public health  PMI  and society. The proof of PMI's commitment to this mission and strong progress to date is undeniable: In 2015  essentially all of PMI's net revenues came from cigarettes. In 2021  nearly 30 percent came from smoke-free products. By 2025  PMI aims to be a predominantly smoke-free company  with more than half of its net revenues coming from such products.While cigarettes represent PMI's past and are part of its present  they do not represent its future. Since 2008  PMI has invested more than USD 9 billion in researching  developing  and commercializing its smoke-free products. PMI has built world-class scientific assessment capabilities  notably in the areas of preclinical systems toxicology  clinical and behavioral research  as well as post-market studies. And it has met the strictest regulatory requirements for its sector  including in the U.S.  where the Food and Drug Administration has authorized versions of PMI's leading heated tobacco product  IQOS  as “modified risk tobacco products” (MRTPs)  finding that exposure modification orders for these products are appropriate to promote the public health.PMI and Swedish Match share a mutual vision of a world without cigarettes and a strong commitment to developing  scientifically substantiating  and responsibly commercializing smoke-free products that are less harmful than cigarettes. PMI values how Swedish Match has relentlessly pursued tobacco harm reduction through its range of smoke-free products; received authorizations for its products via strict regulatory pathways in the U.S.; and reshaped the public health environment in countries such as Sweden and Norway.As PMI continues to evolve its business for the long term  it believes that the two companies would be a perfect pairing of strategic vision  culture  and enterprise. Together  the companies would be able to create a global  science-led smoke-free champion  combining expertise in heated tobacco and oral nicotine—including multiple MRTP authorizations—as well as PMI's emerging presence in e-vapor products  to switch more adult smokers to better alternatives than the two could achieve as separate companies. Swedish Match would lead the combined company’s oral nicotine business.The combination with Swedish Match would position PMI to:create a comprehensive smoke-free product portfolio globally  underpinned by a leading R&D engine for science  innovation  and growth through the companies' complementary capabilities;directly enter and compete in the large  attractive and growing U.S. smoke-free market by: (i) further supporting and developing Swedish Match's oral nicotine portfolio in the U.S. and (ii) leveraging Swedish Match's substantial operational platform in the U.S. to unlock commercial opportunities across other smoke-free categories in the coming years; anddrive accelerated global expansion opportunities for Swedish Match's oral nicotine products through PMI's international commercial infrastructure and financial resources.Therefore  the combination would immediately enhance PMI's already strong growth profile and support additional opportunities in the U.S. and internationally over time. It is also expected to be accretive to adjusted diluted EPS before any synergies  and excluding transaction-related costs as well as the amortization of acquired intangibles. Importantly  Swedish Match's operating cash flow comprises meaningful U.S. dollar net income  thereby improving PMI's currency profile.The transaction would result in a combined company with a strong balance sheet and leverage of approximately 3x net debt to adjusted EBITDA at closing  with deleveraging anticipated over the next few years. PMI would continue to target strong investment grade credit ratings over time  as a growing and highly cash-generative business. To support deleveraging  PMI has suspended its current three-year share repurchase program  which began in July 2021. PMI remains committed to its progressive dividend policy  while gradually reducing its adjusted diluted EPS payout ratio to around 75% over time.PMI recognizes that the employees and management team of Swedish Match have built a highly successful business with an excellent track record  and PMI has the utmost respect for them. PMI's current plans for the future business and general strategy  as described above  do not include any material changes with regard to Swedish Match's operational sites  or its management and employees  including their terms of employment. Swedish Match has a complementary organization with a talented  dedicated workforce  excellent culture and a strong base of skills in Sweden  the U.S. and across the world. PMI would intend to nurture this talent and provide additional opportunities as the companies grow together. Importantly  PMI intends to provide compensation and benefits consistent with Swedish Match's current programs  including the Profit Sharing Foundation in Sweden. In addition  PMI intends to preserve and develop Swedish Match's operational presence in Sweden  where much of the Company’s skills base is located  as well as in Richmond  Virginia  the site of the head office for Swedish Match's U.S. Division. PMI has no plans to divest the Lights business.The OfferConsiderationThe shareholders of Swedish Match are offered SEK 106 in cash per share in Swedish Match.5American Depositary Shares representing the right to receive shares in Swedish Match in connection with unsponsored American Depositary Receipt programs are not included in the Offer.If  prior to settlement of the Offer  Swedish Match (i) distributes dividends6 or (ii) in any other way distributes or transfers value to its shareholders  the consideration in the Offer will be reduced accordingly (the “Price Adjustment”).

Blockchain  or distributed l…,"LONDON : Blockchain needs its own music industry 'MP3' moment as fragmented regulation and technology hamper the development of a digital securities industry that could help realise its full potential  industry officials said.Blockchain  or distributed ledger technology (DLT)  underpins cryptoassets like bitcoin and allows many parties to access a single version of data at the same time.But extending its application to issuing  trading and settling securities like stocks and bonds requires a common digital format for the securities themselves  said Gerd Hartung  head of new digital markets at Deutsche Boerse.""The real topic is how do we get to the MP3 digital format you see in the music industry. The next level we are getting to is digitisation of the financial instrument itself "" he said.The digital MP3 file format  with its inferior audio quality  did not look like a disruptive technology until the arrival of MP3 players and streaming systems dramatically altered the music industry  removing a slew of middle men and almost all the barriers to entry faced by an artist.A similar pivot in financial markets would allow an instrument to be issued in hours rather than days or weeks  better targeting specific markets and taking advantage of windows of calm to reach more investors faster and free of data errors  industry officials say.But it would also challenge banks' dominant position in the revenue chain for issuing and trading securities.A further step from pilot project to live markets came this week with the launch of LedgerEdge  described as the first regulated  DLT-based corporate bond platform.""Everyone is looking for greater clarity on the regulatory definition of digital assets "" said David Nicol  chief executive and co-founder of LedgerEdge.But with many elements yet to fall into place  Arjun Jayaram  founder and chief executive of blockchain company Baton Systems  warned there was unlikely to be a ""big bang"" moment.Banks still use ""very old"" technology  making it harder to interface with DLT platforms  he said  while Javier Hernani  head of securities services at SIX which runs the Zurich and Madrid stock exchanges  said hooking up to blockchain was a cost that needed to be phased in.Hernani also pointed to the need for digital versions of currencies such as the dollar  euro or sterling to speed up payment and achieve the full benefits of DLT  something the relevant central banks have yet to decide on  let alone launch.Instead a ""bridge"" would be needed to allow digitised assets to be traded  but paid for in fiat currencies  he suggested.Regulators also need time to get to grips with the new technology  with the European Union and Britain preparing to test DLT in market infrastructure.""We intend to have this up and running next year  and if it teaches us that we need to update the relevant legislation  then we will do that too "" Britain's financial services minister John Glen said in a speech last month.The EU said its pilot regime would allow policymakers to identify obstacles in regulation.PARALLEL SYSTEMSHSBC and Wells Fargo are already using blockchain from Baton Systems to settle bilateral foreign currency trades  and in July Deutsche Boerse will use its digital central register to offer same day-issuance and paperless processing for digitised certificates and warrants in its Clearstream settlement arm.""We have done the proof of concepts in the past  but now it's really about bringing the real  fully-fledged financial  digital market infrastructure in place  and that needs to be productive and scalable "" Hartung said.Rival Euroclear has joined blockchain consortium Fnality - backed by banks including Santander  Barclays  Credit Suisse  MUFG and UBS - which is aiming to open a payments account for tokenised assets at the Bank of England in October.Meanwhile  the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corp's platform that leverages DLT is moving to a development phase for same-day settlement of securities trades  compared with two days at present.Consultants estimate potential savings of 50 per cent from using blockchain in areas like settlement  mainly through cutting time-consuming 'reconciliation' or the fixing of mismatches in transaction data.Faster completion of trades also means less risk and therefore less capital tied up in backing transactions.Looking at the derivatives market  Deloitte estimates a ""single shared version of trade data"" could reduce costs by one-third.Combining DLT with a machine-readable blueprint for how derivatives are managed and traded could cut the cost base for derivatives dealers by $3.2 billion  it says.SIX  which launched a digital bond in November  senses progress this year.""We are going from proof of concept to the real world  slowly "" the company's Hernani said.""We will continue to see some real business  but still in the small numbers. I think there will be parallel systems for a while.""",neutral,0.1,0.82,0.08,negative,0.01,0.1,0.89,True,English,"['MP3 music moment', 'Analysis', 'Blockchain', 'markets', 'first regulated, DLT-based corporate bond platform', 'real, fully-fledged financial, digital market infrastructure', 'financial services minister John Glen', 'U.S. Depository Trust', 'bilateral foreign currency trades', 'digital MP3 file format', 'common digital format', 'MP3 digital format', 'digital central register', 'inferior audio quality', 'Madrid stock exchanges', 'big bang"" moment', 'distributed ledger technology', ""banks' dominant position"", 'Clearstream settlement arm', 'single shared version', 'new digital markets', 'relevant central banks', 'blockchain consortium Fnality', 'digital securities industry', 'digital bond', 'financial markets', 'securities services', ""MP3' moment"", 'financial instrument', 'digital versions', 'single version', 'real topic', 'derivatives market', 'real world', 'real business', 'digital assets', 'MP3 players', 'new technology', 'relevant legislation', 'securities trades', 'music industry', 'industry officials', 'full potential', 'many parties', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'next level', 'disruptive technology', 'streaming systems', 'middle men', 'similar pivot', 'specific markets', 'revenue chain', 'pilot project', 'greater clarity', 'regulatory definition', 'David Nicol', 'chief executive', 'many elements', 'Arjun Jayaram', 'Baton Systems', 'old"" technology', 'full benefits', 'European Union', 'pilot regime', 'PARALLEL SYSTEMS', 'Wells Fargo', 'same day-issuance', 'paperless processing', 'Rival Euroclear', 'Credit Suisse', 'payments account', 'Clearing Corp', 'same-day settlement', 'potential savings', '50 per cent', ""time-consuming 'reconciliation"", 'Faster completion', 'less risk', 'less capital', 'machine-readable blueprint', 'small numbers', 'data errors', 'transaction data', 'trade data', 'tokenised assets', 'derivatives dealers', 'fragmented regulation', 'same time', 'Gerd Hartung', 'fiat currencies', 'development phase', 'two days', 'cost base', 'trading securities', 'Javier Hernani', 'DLT platforms', 'blockchain company', 'LONDON', 'cryptoassets', 'bitcoin', 'application', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'head', 'digitisation', 'arrival', 'slew', 'barriers', 'entry', 'artist', 'hours', 'weeks', 'advantage', 'windows', 'calm', 'investors', 'issuing', 'step', 'launch', 'LedgerEdge', 'Everyone', 'founder', 'place', 'SIX', 'Zurich', 'need', 'dollar', 'sterling', 'something', 'bridge', 'digitised', 'Regulators', 'grips', 'Britain', 'speech', 'policymakers', 'obstacles', 'HSBC', 'July', 'certificates', 'warrants', 'proof', 'concepts', 'past', 'Santander', 'Barclays', 'MUFG', 'UBS', 'England', 'October', 'present', 'Consultants', 'areas', 'fixing', 'mismatches', 'backing', 'transactions', 'Deloitte', 'costs', 'one-third', 'November']",2022-05-11,2022-05-11,channelnewsasia.com

Similarly  all the major museums and art galleries are creating and offering their own NFTs.The digital art created in the 1980s is finally coming of age with over a billion art-NFT enthusiasts actively pursuing creations in this medium at prices that are now very accessible.Artprice has already identified over 54 000 artists who are directly producing NFTs for their buying public  and this is only the very start of a major paradigm shift.According to sociologists  art historians and analysts  we are in the midst of major evolution that will definitively modify the structure of the art market as it has developed since the 1950s. This change is clearly confirmed by Artprice's art market analysts  particularly its econometricians.In its various reports on the Art Market  Artmarket.com has always indicated that it is impossible to understand the exponential growth of the NFT market without understanding the technological background to their existence. This 'history' includes Blockchain  cryptocurrencies and their cultural origin in the Cypherpunk community (period of data encryption – type PGP – at the beginning of 1990s).However  all players in the art-NFT market – OpenSea  Rarible  LooksRare  Nifty Gateway  Superare etc. – agree that the NFT revolution will ultimately take place in the Metaverse. In other words  it is illusory to envisage growth and a sustainable future for NFTs without the development of the Metaverse.The Metaverse is a set of virtual worlds. The term is regularly used to describe the future version of the Internet where virtual  durable and shared spaces are accessible via 3D interaction.Similarly  the Metaverse can be conceived as a set of virtual worlds connected to the Internet  which are perceived in augmented reality.Experts from the financial  economic  scientific and academic spheres are unanimous in considering the Metaverse as the natural extension of the Internet (Web 3.0).Ninety-five percent of the multinationals in Fortune's Global 500 ranking have Metaverse projects under development.These Metaverse projects now represent an economic and scientific equation that will either raise their business turnovers in a spectacular manner  or become a financial abyss  depending on the R&D choices they make.While Meta (Facebook) and Microsoft have retained colossal budgets for writing and coding virtual worlds  certain groups  and in particular Artmarket.com  are taking a different route which should make it possible to radically reduce the development costs of their Metaverses and become operational relatively quickly.Artprice by Artmarket.com's principal and founding shareholder is Server Group  an Internet pioneer since 1987  but also one of the pioneers of CGI hardware and software as of 1985.Server Group has owned a multitude of subsidiaries over the past 35 years and has acquired deep knowledge in the field of immersive video games and cinematic and televisual post-production. Appearing in the mid-1980s  the technologies in these areas are considered by the scientific community as the very first Metaverses.Artmarket.com's Metaverse project is built in its world-famous headquarters located in the heart of the Organe Contemporary Art Museum which manages La Demeure du Chaos  or the ""Abode of Chaos"" (as baptised by the New York Times).This Metaverse is revolutionary because it minimizes production costs and times and is based on the knowledge acquired by the Server Group from video game multinationals and film and network producers over the past 35 years (Studio Lumiere999® Paris/NY).For the record  the Abode of Chaos was created in 1999 (more than 23 years ago) by thierry Ehrmann  an artist/sculptor since 1980 (certified biography Who's Who In France in 2022).An open-air Museum of Contemporary Art occupying nearly 9 000 square meters  the Abode of Chaos is a unique museum circuit designed from its origin as a large-scale 'escape game' with elements of augmented reality.Among the nearly 6 300 distinct artworks there are 4 500 sculptures in raw steel – some weighing several hundred tons – as well as paintings  street art  engravings  installations  digital artworks and land artworks. The museum is equipped with a very powerful electronic network (optical fiber over 9000 m2  wifi 802.11ax  idO connected works of art  etc.).The Abode of Chaos and the Contemporary Art Museum that hosts it receives 180 000 visitors a year  of whom 25% come from outside France.Over the past 23 years the Abode of Chaos has been the subject of nearly 3 600 written and audiovisual press reports in 72 countries. It has also been exquisitely reflected in a major tome  Opus IX  a 504-page bilingual reference work that can be consulted free of charge online in PDF format as well as on the Issuu website  where it has been downloaded 37 million times (figure officially confirmed by a French Huissier SCP Mamet-Pons).In the international press  the Abode of Chaos has been described as an ensemble of distinct Œuvres and as an unavoidable and unique ""Factory"" with a place in Art History as one of the most significant artistic projects of the early 21st century.The Server Group and the Organe Museum have invested several million euros in this successful project  financed exclusively from equity capital after a solid IPO project (see Artmarket.com's universal registration document filed with the AMF  chapter 3.2.23).thierry Ehrmann – CEO and Founder of Server Group and Artprice by Artmarket.com – followed the example of major video game creators and film directors/producers to build the group's Metaverse based on 25 years of world famous physical creations.For the construction of its Metaverse  over the past three years Server Group has formed a number of alliances  notably with one of the main European spatial geometry groups  creating a European dream-team for 3D Design  Engineering  3D Lab and Scanner Surveys.Whereas Meta (formerly Facebook) is starting to build its Metaverse from scratch  Artmarket and Server Group is starting from the fundamental reality of 6 300 original art creations in reference to the contemporary art world - on a 9 000 m² site.This history has given us a substantial head start  saving both time and money  because the approach is completely different when you have undeniable global recognition for nearly 25 years.The technical specifications included the use/production of Faro Lidar 3D Scanner  Navis VLX  drones  Polygonal Ground Photogrammetry in a single reference and development system  and Augmented Intelligence processing to reveal the singular characteristics of the works and their architectural 'formativity'.Specialized spatial data engineers and surveyors scanned and digitized the 9000 m² of the Organe Contemporary Art Museum  including its multiple basements and elevations  and all of the 6 300 artworks. The result weighed 45 To and including the 27 years of post-production and digital production conducted by Server Group and its subsidiaries.The Group's Metaverse was therefore generated from a vast physical medium of which it is the both author and owner. This represents a huge asset in terms of intellectual property. Similarly  the explosion of avatars and the proliferation of virtual multitudes® are part of a narrative already written and scripted by thierry Ehrmann  and known throughout the world.While this ultra high-tech industrial process involving geometricians and spatial data experts required three years of field work (taking advantage of the COVID period)  this approach is very different from the interminable challenges facing Meta (Facebook) of building its Metaverse from lines of code.To understand the route taken by Server Group and Artprice by Artmarket.com  an analogy can be made with a well-known video game publisher whose Metaverse – based in medieval times – was constructed via an extremely detailed 3D scanning of several existing medieval European cities.The results of this work were excellent: with radically reduced production costs  top ranking in box office all over the world - its video game version substantially dwarfed its competitors positioned in the highly-prized 'medieval' segment.It is essential to specify that Artprice by Artmarket.com's Metaverse  whose head office is located in the heart of the Organe Contemporary Art Museum (which manages the Abode of Chaos) is practically complete. This work has required very substantial investments which have been entirely borne by Server Group and its subsidiaries and which have had no impact on Artmarket.com's balance sheets.Artprice by Artmarket.com's founding shareholder is Server Group  which is still by far the largest shareholder with 30.16% of the capital and 45.78% of the voting rights (Ehrmann family not included). Server Group took the industrial risk of investing in its Metaverse based on its confidence in Artmarket.com after 25 years as World Leader in Art Market Information.Under the regime of regulated agreements covered by Server Group at Artmarket.com  whose Metaverse project's profitability will be assured by low user costs because the costs associated with its R&D  and production are infinitely lower than those facing the multinationals who have started coding their Metaverses from scratch. Moreover  their projects are still to be concluded.Artmarket.com's upcoming NFT Marketplace will have an undeniable competitive advantage because the principal existing NFT platforms are facing time constraints  financial constraints  but also copyright constraints. As a result they do not really have successful Metaverses and may well be tempted to join Artmarket.com's metaverse. Artmarket.com which will aim to integrate them into its NFT Marketplace by providing them with its precious imprimatur.Indeed  OpenSea  the world's leading NFT platform  has itself declared that 80% of the primary issues of art NFTs are likely to affect the intellectual property rights of third parties. Faced with this observation  Opensea has announced it is considering solutions to counter this scourge and protect sellers and buyers. We firmly believe that the logical solution to this problem is the certification of the primary market by Artprice through its blockchain and its smart contracts.It is precisely in the primary issue of art NFTs that Artprice by Artmarket.com can achieve an extremely substantial turnover and profit.We are proud to say that Artprice by Artmarket.com is the only company in the global art market that can veritably ensure the certification of primary NFT drops  bearing in mind all the underlying parameters and associated data.The ability to certify primary issues of art NFTs is based on Artmarket.com's position as the global leader in art market information and as the owner and creator of databases containing a quarter of a century of art market data. This databank commands global respect and authority and is backed up by the world's largest collection of notes  manuscripts and sales catalogs (going back to 1700) which guarantee the authenticity and historical credibility of its databases.Lastly  the study report from Dynata  the world's largest data platform for insights  activation and measurement  surveyed more than 62 million panelists and 4 billion insights (reactions from a consumer in the form of data) in 11 countries (United States  Canada  United Kingdom  France  Spain  Germany  Netherlands  Italy  China  Japan and Australia) and published its ""New Experience Economy"" report.The report highlights a very favorable conclusion for Artmarket.com and for its Metaverse  and for its shareholders: 51% of respondents indicated that their favorite virtual (i.e. online) destination is a visit to a museum  an art gallery or an art exhibition.With its Metaverse  which is the ultimate and unavoidable consequence of the NFT revolution  Artprice by Artmarket.com aims to be the most successful and highly competitive art NFT platform. Its Metaverse represents the assurance of an exponential and continuous growth of the art-NFT market. It will be accompanied by Artprice by Artmarket's Blockchain and its smart contracts  thereby allowing a fair remuneration for artists in tendum with copyright societies such as ADAGP to which Artprice has long been one of the main contributors.In addition  the long-standing registration of the artpricecoin.com DNS (.net .org...) and its trademarks demonstrates Artmarket.com's overall strategy  which naturally includes the creation of a specific cryptocurrency after regulatory approvals.The Artprice by Artmarket.com blockchain will mainly use Ethereum for its smart contracts but will remain open to payment in Bitcoin and other major cryptocurrencies.Copyright 1987-2022 thierry Ehrmann www.artprice.com - www.artmarket.comDon't hesitate to contact our Econometrics Department for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: [email protected]for your requirements regarding statistics and personalized studies: Try our services (free demo): https://www.artprice.com/demoSubscribe to our services: https://www.artprice.com/subscriptionAbout Artmarket:Artmarket.com is listed on Eurolist by Euronext Paris  SRD long only and Euroclear: 7478 - Bloomberg: PRC - Reuters: ARTF.Discover Artmarket and its Artprice department on video: www.artprice.com/videoArtmarket and its Artprice department was founded in 1997 by its CEO  thierry Ehrmann.

The total cost for the subsidy  based on the above preliminary value of the warrants  is estimated at SEK 1 740 551 for the entire term of the warrant programme of three years  including any social security contributions.In order to be eligible for the subsidy  the participant must  at the time of the payment of the bonus  not have been dismissed (Sw. avskedad )  terminated his/her employment or given notice of employment termination  remain employed in the company for three years  or the subsidy will  with certain exceptions  be prorated  and must not have transferred his/her warrants.Further information on the warrant programDilutionUpon full exercise of all warrants  850 000 new shares can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.5 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the company  however  subject to any potential adjustment which may occur under the terms and conditions for the warrants. Accordingly  the program offers the employees the possibility to increase their shareholding in the company to the corresponding figure.Impact of financial ratio and costs for the company etc.The company's earnings per share are not affected by the issue of the warrants as the present value of the warrants' strike price exceeds the current market value of the share at the date of issue. Since the warrants are transferred to the participants at market value it is not expected that the company will incur any personnel costs. The warrant program will incur costs in relation to the subsidy that the participants are entitled to. Such costs amount to a maximum of SEK 1 740 551 for the entire term of the warrant program of three years. The warrant program may also incur certain limited costs in terms of external consulting fees and costs relating to the administration of the warrant program.Preparation of the matterThe principles of the warrant program have been prepared by the board of the company and are based on the warrant programs adopted by the annual general meetings 2020 and 2021. The board has thereafter decided to submit this proposal to the annual general meeting. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Other share related incentive programs etc.Except from the current proposal to issue warrants and the warrant programs resolved upon at the annual general meetings 2020 and 2021  the company has no outstanding share related incentive programs. It is the board's intention that the program shall recur annually  albeit in varying sizes.Authorization for the board of directorsThe board proposes that the meeting authorizes the board to execute the resolution in accordance with the above and to ensure that the Subsidiary's board of directors carries out the transfer of the warrants in accordance with the above.Majority requirementsA decision according to the proposal pursuant to item 18 above is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the annual general meeting. A decision according to the proposal pursuant to item 19 above is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the annual general meeting.DocumentationThe annual report  the remuneration report and other supporting documentation for resolutions will be available at the company's offices  Medivir AB  Lunastigen 5  SE-141 22 Huddinge  Sweden no later than three weeks prior to the meeting.

These upticks spread across the services provider’s global securities financing (GSF)  international central securities ...,Clearstream  a post-trade services provider owned by the Deutsche Börse Group  saw small increases in its business lines in April.These upticks spread across the services provider’s global securities financing (GSF)  international central securities depository (ICSD)  domestic CSD  and investment funds services (IFS).The updates are contained in the provider’s monthly figures for April 2022 released on Wednesday.Segmental BreakdownGSF  Clearstream’s collateral management  securities lending and borrowing services  saw its volume outstanding rise by 8% month-on-month (MoM) from €546 billion to €591.5 billion.On a year-to-date (YTD) basis  the provider’s GSF service jumped 10% from €525.9 billion to €577.1 billion.On the depository side  securities deposits in Clearstream’s ICSD increased by 7% MoM  rising from €7 234 billion to €7 749 billion.However  the total number of securities deposit transactions during this period at the ICSD dropped -6% to 5.7 million from 6.1 million.On a YTD basis  while the uptick in total securities deposits is a 5% increase  the fall in the total number of transactions stands at -15%.At the domestic level  Clearstream’s securities deposits rose by 2% from €5 551 billion in April 2021 to €5 653 in April 2022.ADVERTISEMENTHowever  unlike the ICSD  this rise in domestic securities deposits stems from a 4% change MoM in the total number of transactions which shot up from 13 million to 13.5 million.In fact  on a YTD basis  the uptick in the domestic CDS translates to a 7% upturn in securities deposits and a 10% rise in the total number of transactions.Clearstream’s Investment Funds Services is not left out. The services provider’s IFS recorded a 6% top up in securities deposits which rose MoM from €3 137 to €3 329.The total number of transactions in this regard increased by 4%  rising from 3.5 million to 3.6 million MoM.As a result of these  Clearstream’s IFS’ assets under custody (AUC) also jumped 5% MoM and 7% YTD  rising from €15 921 billion to €16 731 billion  and from €15 652 billion to €16 704 billion  respectively.Clearstream’s Recent MovesLast month  Clearstream sold its 50% stake in REGIS-TR  an European trade repository it co-founded in 2010  to Iberclear  a sub-subsidiary of the Swiss Infrastructure and Exchange Group (SIX).With the acquisition  SIX  a Swiss stock exchange and the parent company of the Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME)  became 100% owner of the repository.Clearstream last month also entered into a partnership with FNZ  a leading international wealth management platform  to enhance transparency across the UK and the European asset management industry.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,neutral,0.03,0.87,0.1,True,English,"['Global Securities Financing', 'CSD Services', 'Clearstream', 'Upticks', 'April', 'leading international wealth management platform', 'European asset management industry', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'international central securities depository', 'Mercados Españoles', 'global securities financing', 'investment funds services', 'European trade repository', 'Swiss stock exchange', 'post-trade services provider', 'domestic securities deposits', 'total securities deposits', 'securities deposit transactions', 'collateral management', 'Exchange Group', 'depository side', 'securities lending', 'borrowing services', 'Swiss Infrastructure', 'domestic CSD', 'domestic level', 'domestic CDS', 'total number', 'small increases', 'business lines', 'monthly figures', 'Segmental Breakdown', 'Recent Moves', 'parent company', 'YTD) basis', 'YTD basis', 'outstanding rise', 'GSF service', 'IFS’ assets', '3.6 million MoM.', '7% YTD', '3.5 million', '10% rise', '7% MoM', 'Clearstream', 'April', 'upticks', 'ICSD', 'updates', 'Wednesday', 'volume', 'period', '5% increase', 'fall', 'ADVERTISEMENT', '4% change', 'fact', '7% upturn', '6% top', 'regard', 'result', 'custody', 'AUC', '50% stake', 'REGIS-TR', 'Iberclear', 'sub-subsidiary', 'SIX', 'acquisition', 'Bolsas', 'BME', 'owner', 'partnership', 'FNZ', 'transparency', 'UK']",2022-05-11,2022-05-11,financemagnates.com

These upticks spread across the services provider’s global securities financing (GSF)  international central securities ...,Clearstream  a post-trade services provider owned by the Deutsche Börse Group  saw small increases in its business lines in April.These upticks spread across the services provider’s global securities financing (GSF)  international central securities depository (ICSD)  domestic CSD  and investment funds services (IFS).The updates are contained in the provider’s monthly figures for April 2022 released on Wednesday.Segmental BreakdownGSF  Clearstream’s collateral management  securities lending and borrowing services  saw its volume outstanding rise by 8% month-on-month (MoM) from €546 billion to €591.5 billion.On a year-to-date (YTD) basis  the provider’s GSF service jumped 10% from €525.9 billion to €577.1 billion.On the depository side  securities deposits in Clearstream’s ICSD increased by 7% MoM  rising from €7 234 billion to €7 749 billion.However  the total number of securities deposit transactions during this period at the ICSD dropped -6% to 5.7 million from 6.1 million.On a YTD basis  while the uptick in total securities deposits is a 5% increase  the fall in the total number of transactions stands at -15%.At the domestic level  Clearstream’s securities deposits rose by 2% from €5 551 billion in April 2021 to €5 653 in April 2022.ADVERTISEMENTHowever  unlike the ICSD  this rise in domestic securities deposits stems from a 4% change MoM in the total number of transactions which shot up from 13 million to 13.5 million.In fact  on a YTD basis  the uptick in the domestic CDS translates to a 7% upturn in securities deposits and a 10% rise in the total number of transactions.Clearstream’s Investment Funds Services is not left out. The services provider’s IFS recorded a 6% top up in securities deposits which rose MoM from €3 137 to €3 329.The total number of transactions in this regard increased by 4%  rising from 3.5 million to 3.6 million MoM.As a result of these  Clearstream’s IFS’ assets under custody (AUC) also jumped 5% MoM and 7% YTD  rising from €15 921 billion to €16 731 billion  and from €15 652 billion to €16 704 billion  respectively.Clearstream’s Recent MovesLast month  Clearstream sold its 50% stake in REGIS-TR  an European trade repository it co-founded in 2010  to Iberclear  a sub-subsidiary of the Swiss Infrastructure and Exchange Group (SIX).With the acquisition  SIX  a Swiss stock exchange and the parent company of the Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME)  became 100% owner of the repository.Clearstream last month also entered into a partnership with FNZ  a leading international wealth management platform  to enhance transparency across the UK and the European asset management industry.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,neutral,0.03,0.87,0.1,True,English,"['Global Securities Financing', 'CSD Services', 'Clearstream', 'Upticks', 'April', 'leading international wealth management platform', 'European asset management industry', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'international central securities depository', 'Mercados Españoles', 'global securities financing', 'investment funds services', 'European trade repository', 'Swiss stock exchange', 'post-trade services provider', 'domestic securities deposits', 'total securities deposits', 'securities deposit transactions', 'collateral management', 'Exchange Group', 'depository side', 'securities lending', 'borrowing services', 'Swiss Infrastructure', 'domestic CSD', 'domestic level', 'domestic CDS', 'total number', 'small increases', 'business lines', 'monthly figures', 'Segmental Breakdown', 'Recent Moves', 'parent company', 'YTD) basis', 'YTD basis', 'outstanding rise', 'GSF service', 'IFS’ assets', '3.6 million MoM.', '7% YTD', '3.5 million', '10% rise', '7% MoM', 'Clearstream', 'April', 'upticks', 'ICSD', 'updates', 'Wednesday', 'volume', 'period', '5% increase', 'fall', 'ADVERTISEMENT', '4% change', 'fact', '7% upturn', '6% top', 'regard', 'result', 'custody', 'AUC', '50% stake', 'REGIS-TR', 'Iberclear', 'sub-subsidiary', 'SIX', 'acquisition', 'Bolsas', 'BME', 'owner', 'partnership', 'FNZ', 'transparency', 'UK']",2022-05-11,2022-05-11,financemagnates.com

This is the fourth edition of our ESG report after the inaugural report...,FLEX LNGMay 11  2022Hamilton  BermudaFlex LNG Ltd. today release its 2021 Annual ESG Report. This is the fourth edition of our ESG report after the inaugural report in 2018 and contains key information about our commitment to the Environment  Social development  and Governance issues.The report presents our material environmental  social  and governance (ESG) performance  along with how we manage material sustainability topics  for the financial year ended December 31  2021.The ESG report is prepared in accordance with requirements of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (SASB) Marine Transportation Standard (2018) and has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (2021). It is based on the NASDAQ ESG Reporting Guide 2.0 and Euronext Guidelines to issuers for ESG reporting. The report is also prepared in line with the disclosure requirements of the UN Global Compact.The ESG report attached is also available on the company’s website www.flexlng.com. An index of disclosures responding to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI  core option) is also available on our website.Øystein M. Kalleklev  Chief Executive Officer of Flex LNG Management AS  commented:“We are pleased to publish the fourth edition of our annual ESG report. ESG is an integral part of our business strategy and we will continue to broaden the scope of our initiatives and our ESG reporting. Our business strategy is to transport LNG which is primarily utilized to replace coal and to some extent diesel in power generation. Replacing coal with natural gas cuts CO2 emissions by about half  but also cleans up the local environment due to the clean burning properties of natural gas. Furthermore  we transport the LNG on the most fuel-efficient ships in the industry  reducing the fuel consumption per transported unit close to 60% compared to the steam generation. 2021 was a challenging year operating ships when it comes to crew rotations due to Covid-19 restrictions. We have put top priority on carrying out these crew rotations despite the obstacles as the welfare of our crew is part of our social responsibility. We would therefore like to extend our gratitude to crew and onshore personnel for their diligent work and great results in this matter.”Story continuesFor further queries  please contact:Mr Knut Traaholt  Chief Financial Officer of Flex LNG Management ASTelephone: +47 23 11 40 00Email: IR@flexlng.comThis information is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 the Norwegian Securities Trading ActAttachment,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.56,0.23,0.21,True,English,"['2021 Annual ESG Report', 'Flex LNG', 'Norwegian Securities Trading Act Attachment', 'SASB) Marine Transportation Standard', 'Sustainability Accounting Standards Board', 'challenging year operating ships', 'Flex LNG Management AS', 'NASDAQ ESG Reporting Guide', 'material sustainability topics', 'UN Global Compact', 'Øystein M.

He was awarded an honorary degree during the afternoon bachelor’s ceremony on Saturday  May 7.“I’m a little bit speechless about this ” Bergmark said. His remarks focused on how generosity can improve the lives of others  and encouraged graduates to thank those whose generosity helped them get to their graduation day. “Many of us probably wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the generosity of other people. Share this moment of achievement with your supporters.”While working in London  he was fortunate to be involved in a management-led buyout of a small  unprofitable division of a Fortune 100 technology conglomerate. In his role as the chief financial officer of this geological research laboratory  he led the company’s IPO on NASDAQ  then later moved the listing to the New York Stock Exchange followed by a dual listing on the Amsterdam Euronext Stock Exchange.

He stays engaged with Georgia Tech as an emeritus trustee of the Georgia Tech Foundation  chair of the Scheller College of Business advisory board  and member of the Alexander-Tharpe board of directors.During his time in London he met Toni  his wife of more than 28 years.

He was a professor for more than 15 years  and talked about why Commencement was always his favorite day on campus. “It’s the one day and the only day of the year  when everyone – students  parents  professors  instructors – is happy. Thank you for letting me share this time with you.Bostic took office June 5  2017  as the 15th president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.

Drawing upon Barco’s long legacy in LED  TruePix is designed completely from the ground up to create a purpose-built video wall for a variety of enterprise applications. It perfects all aspects of the LED experience starting from installation  throughout its long lifetime  to after sales support and maintenance. TruePix ensures a truly seamless experience bringing content to life as intended in control rooms  television studios  lobbies  boardrooms  auditoriums  and other corporate applications.Key product highlights:Truly seamless displaySmart engineering for an easy  perfectly aligned installationUnmatched viewing experience thanks to the next gen Infinipix ® processor® Purpose-built robustness and ergonomics for 24/7 smooth and efficient operationsSuperb color accuracy  under all lighting conditionsReduced ecological footprint10 years of dedicated service and supportWith the ongoing cost erosion  LED technology is now within the reach of most companies  for a variety of applications. With TruePix  Barco combines the latest technological evolutions  a vast amount of expertise  and innovative  smart engineering. The result is a unique mounting technology  impressive image quality and ensuing longevity. These high-resolution 16:9 tiles are available in multiple options  with pixel pitches ranging from 0.9 to 1.9 mm.Speaking on the announcement  Gan Ta Loong  Managing Director  Barco SEA and Vice President Immersive and Large Videowall Experience APAC  said  “Barco has always believed in bringing technological marvels to industry and in our endeavor to continue we are proud to present TruePix  video walls offering seamless viewing experience combining innovative technology. TruePix encapsulates Barco’s 25 years of experience in LED technology  guaranteeing bespoke visuals & perfect sync of the content providing solutions to discerning needs of customers in key markets.”Reliably perfect qualityThe first product to incorporate Barco’s superior Infinipix Gen2 image processing system  TruePix ensures an unmatched viewing experience for all types of content. No visual distortions  low latency  perfect sync  and no tearing are the hallmarks of this system. Infinipix Gen2 also guarantees dimming without any loss in color accuracy  which drastically expands the effectiveness of the installation. What’s more  Barco’s proprietary smart calibration method for wide color gamut support and full color balancing control  will create rich and true-to-life images. TruePix also shows that visual excellence does not equal high energy consumption. Its EcoPower mode ensures reduced energy consumption  helping to limit the ecological footprint.SteadyView  a unique Barco feature  improves viewing ergonomics and reduces eye fatigue. This is especially important in control room environments  where the staff intensely use the wall for multiple hours on end. This makes TruePix one of the very first purpose-built LED walls for critical and high-intensity applications like control rooms and command centers.Smart engineering for predictable  truly seamless outcomesThe impressive image quality of an LED video wall can only come to its full right if the display is installed impeccably. However  there are always imperfections in the flatness of the walls and level of the floors  which very often cause mechanical stress in the frames of the tiles. This can lead to seams  damage  or difficulties during maintenance. TruePix’ innovative auto-balancing system counters these imperfections and makes sure the LED wall is 100% level and frictionless. Furthermore  the installation time is also cut because the tiles all slide perfectly into place without the need for manual adjustments. The guided module insertion ensures a fully contactless and risk-free installation  with no risk of tile damage.Full service support for 10 yearsFor Barco  ensuring longevity  reliability and perfect display uniformity is of major importance. With its uncompromising service  Barco takes every measure to deliver the promised experiences to its customers. Availability of batch compatible modules throughout the life of the wall is therefore a key part of Barco’s service offerings. If a module needs to be replaced  Barco guarantees that batch-compatible spare tiles (along with full service support) are available for up to 10 years. This brings complete peace of mind and a reduced cost of ownership over the full lifetime of the product.The Video wall Management Suite  Barco’s cloud-based platform for advanced video wall management  allows you to monitor  diagnose and/or control the TruePix installation remotely. This maximizes uptime and reduces the need and length of service interventions. TruePix is also the first LED product on the market to leverage 5Gb bandwidth. This makes the system up to 5 times more efficient with fewer cable runs and points of failure – as more LED modules can be connected in a single link. To further guarantee an uninterrupted data flow  4-way inter-tile communication and signal loop redundancy are embedded  making TruePix the most reliable LED solution in the market.About BarcoBarco is a global technology leader that develops networked visualization solutions for the entertainment  enterprise  and healthcare markets.

4670,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4110433.html,Victorian hotel performance road to recovery; Accor calls for investment in events to fast-track tourism revival,Accor  the largest hotel operator in Australia  has recorded growth in occupancy across its network of 66 hotels (10 200 rooms) in Victoria  but its city and suburban properties are still being impacted by delayed recovery in business and meetings travel.,"Accor  the largest hotel operator in Australia  has recorded growth in occupancy across its network of 66 hotels (10 200 rooms) in Victoria  but its city and suburban properties are still being impacted by delayed recovery in business and meetings travel.The Group’s Victorian hotels recorded an average occupancy of 60% from January to the end of April 2022  with Victorian regional areas  such as Geelong and Daylesford  enjoying strong support from holiday travellers  with properties such as Novotel Geelong performing ahead of pre-pandemic levels.In contrast  the slow return of workers to the Melbourne CBD has constrained occupancies in most city hotels  with the exception of the recent Grand Prix weekend  which saw most Accor hotels operating at 89% occupancy.Recent analysis from the Property Council of Australia revealed that while Melbourne CBD office occupancy had doubled in the March quarter  it was still only tracking at 32% capacity  compared to Sydney's 41%  Brisbane’s 48%  and Adelaide’s 61%.With interstate and international borders now open  Accor is anticipating a solid performance for the five new additions it added to its Victorian network in 2021: Mantra Traralgon  Mercure Melbourne Doncaster  Peppers Marysville  The Sebel Melbourne Ringwood and Mövenpick Hotel Melbourne Spencer Street  the first Mövenpick branded property in Victoria.Accor will add the 275-room Mercure Melbourne South Bank to its collection in the second half of 2022  a result of the recent agreement with Salter Brothers for Accor to manage 10 properties currently branded as Travelodge hotels.In the pipeline  Accor also has plans to add new-build hotels in Richmond  Hawthorn  Malvern and Latrobe  along with Novotel and ibis Styles hotels at Melbourne Airport  25hours Melbourne and SO/ Melbourne.Accor Pacific Chief Executive Officer  Sarah Derry  said  “Between 2021 and 2025  we are opening fourteen hotels in Victoria  which is an investment of over $700 million by a variety of owners. This will create around 600 jobs  whilst boosting the appeal of the city and the quality of accommodation available.”Ms Derry  said that CBD hotel performances during events such as the Formula 1 racing and Melbourne Comedy Festival had been encouraging.“When cities host major events such as the Grand Prix  we experience a significant surge in bookings. The Grand Prix is one of the world’s premier sports entertainment events  presenting Melbourne  Australia  and the Pacific in general  as highly inspiring and desirable destinations to the rest of the world ” said Ms Derry.“The return of full crowds at AFL has also been encouraging  and festivals and events are attracting leisure travellers to city hotels. The Victorian Government deserves congratulations for signing the Commonwealth Games in 2026  and the 114th International Rotary Convention next year is expected to attract over 20 000 visitors.""“The Victorian State Government stimulus packages such as the Victorian voucher travel scheme have been successful at driving demand  and we believe the travel scheme made a material positive impact over the Easter period. Another successful measure is the Midweek Melbourne Money initiative that supports bars and restaurants. More than 300 000 claims have been made since the program began on 7 March 2022. This helps to build a vibrancy in the city that attracts hotel guests.""“Corporate and business meetings are slowly resuming  but there is a long way to go.""“It is critical that investment in sports  arts and cultural events continues  as it creates jobs and supports local businesses.""“Most city hospitality and tourism operators are still suffering from the impact of Covid on business operations. The pandemic has created a number of issues for the industry  none more so than the ability to attract people who want to make a career in hospitality.""“We employ over 2 100 workers in Victoria  but we are still trying to recruit for 160 positions that remain vacant.""“From an immediate point of view  we need a return of skilled and unskilled workers  along with a rapid boost in international students. The tourism and hospitality industry is a dynamic and rewarding industry  and to attract talent back we need people to be confident that it is a sustainable career path  which provides the opportunity for incredible career development which opens doors all over the world.""“It isn’t emphasised enough  but tourism is one of Australia’s largest drivers of economic growth  with domestic and international tourism spend totalling $122 billion in the financial year before Covid. In that same year  Australia generated $60.8 billion in direct tourism gross domestic product.""“The investment of local and international businesses into upgrading existing and building new hotels has been unprecedented over the past five years. Melbourne now has international quality hotels in both the city centre and  increasingly  in major suburban are regional areas  which have been vital for the sustainability of local communities.""“These investments require active and positive government support at all levels  our industry continues to face major challenges and is a long way from returning to pre-Covid levels.”About AccorAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of more than 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.
