The recommendation is supported by a fairness opinion provided by SEB Corporate Finance  Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) ("" SEB Corporate Finance "").""). An offer document regarding the Offer is expected to be made public on or around June 22  2022. The acceptance period in the Offer is expected to commence on or around June 23  2022 and expire on or around September 30  2022.The Offer is conditional upon the Offer being accepted to such extent that PMHH becomes the owner of shares representing more than 90 percent of the total number of outstanding shares in Swedish Match (on a fully diluted basis). Further  the Offer will be made on the terms and subject to the conditions 2 – 7 set out below in this announcement.Jacek Olczak  Chief Executive Officer of PMI  comments:""We are pleased to announce this exciting next step in Philip Morris International's and Swedish Match's trajectory toward a smoke-free future. Underpinned by compelling strategic and financial rationale  this combination would create a global smoke-free champion—strengthened by complementary geographic footprints  commercial capabilities and product portfolios—and open up significant platforms for growth in the U.S. and internationally. Swedish Match's dedicated employees and management have steadfastly pursued the company's vision of a world without cigarettes  while delivering very strong results. We look forward to building upon this success and joining forces to accelerate our shared smoke-free mission.""Background and reasons for the OfferIn 2016  PMI announced its new mission to replace cigarettes with science-based  less harmful alternatives as soon as possible—to the benefit of people who smoke  public health  PMI  and society. The proof of PMI's commitment to this mission and strong progress to date is undeniable: In 2015  essentially all of PMI's net revenues came from cigarettes. In 2021  nearly 30 percent came from smoke-free products. By 2025  PMI aims to be a predominantly smoke-free company  with more than half of its net revenues coming from such products.While cigarettes represent PMI's past and are part of its present  they do not represent its future. Since 2008  PMI has invested more than USD 9 billion in researching  developing  and commercializing its smoke-free products. PMI has built world-class scientific assessment capabilities  notably in the areas of preclinical systems toxicology  clinical and behavioral research  as well as post-market studies. And it has met the strictest regulatory requirements for its sector  including in the U.S.  where the Food and Drug Administration has authorized versions of PMI's leading heated tobacco product  IQOS  as “modified risk tobacco products” (MRTPs)  finding that exposure modification orders for these products are appropriate to promote the public health.PMI and Swedish Match share a mutual vision of a world without cigarettes and a strong commitment to developing  scientifically substantiating  and responsibly commercializing smoke-free products that are less harmful than cigarettes. PMI values how Swedish Match has relentlessly pursued tobacco harm reduction through its range of smoke-free products; received authorizations for its products via strict regulatory pathways in the U.S.; and reshaped the public health environment in countries such as Sweden and Norway.As PMI continues to evolve its business for the long term  it believes that the two companies would be a perfect pairing of strategic vision  culture  and enterprise. Together  the companies would be able to create a global  science-led smoke-free champion  combining expertise in heated tobacco and oral nicotine—including multiple MRTP authorizations—as well as PMI's emerging presence in e-vapor products  to switch more adult smokers to better alternatives than the two could achieve as separate companies. Swedish Match would lead the combined company’s oral nicotine business.The combination with Swedish Match would position PMI to:create a comprehensive smoke-free product portfolio globally  underpinned by a leading R&D engine for science  innovation  and growth through the companies' complementary capabilities;directly enter and compete in the large  attractive and growing U.S. smoke-free market by: (i) further supporting and developing Swedish Match's oral nicotine portfolio in the U.S. and (ii) leveraging Swedish Match's substantial operational platform in the U.S. to unlock commercial opportunities across other smoke-free categories in the coming years; anddrive accelerated global expansion opportunities for Swedish Match's oral nicotine products through PMI's international commercial infrastructure and financial resources.Therefore  the combination would immediately enhance PMI's already strong growth profile and support additional opportunities in the U.S. and internationally over time. It is also expected to be accretive to adjusted diluted EPS before any synergies  and excluding transaction-related costs as well as the amortization of acquired intangibles. Importantly  Swedish Match's operating cash flow comprises meaningful U.S. dollar net income  thereby improving PMI's currency profile.The transaction would result in a combined company with a strong balance sheet and leverage of approximately 3x net debt to adjusted EBITDA at closing  with deleveraging anticipated over the next few years. PMI would continue to target strong investment grade credit ratings over time  as a growing and highly cash-generative business. To support deleveraging  PMI has suspended its current three-year share repurchase program  which began in July 2021. PMI remains committed to its progressive dividend policy  while gradually reducing its adjusted diluted EPS payout ratio to around 75% over time.PMI recognizes that the employees and management team of Swedish Match have built a highly successful business with an excellent track record  and PMI has the utmost respect for them. PMI's current plans for the future business and general strategy  as described above  do not include any material changes with regard to Swedish Match's operational sites  or its management and employees  including their terms of employment. Swedish Match has a complementary organization with a talented  dedicated workforce  excellent culture and a strong base of skills in Sweden  the U.S. and across the world. PMI would intend to nurture this talent and provide additional opportunities as the companies grow together. Importantly  PMI intends to provide compensation and benefits consistent with Swedish Match's current programs  including the Profit Sharing Foundation in Sweden. In addition  PMI intends to preserve and develop Swedish Match's operational presence in Sweden  where much of the Company’s skills base is located  as well as in Richmond  Virginia  the site of the head office for Swedish Match's U.S. Division. PMI has no plans to divest the Lights business.The OfferConsiderationThe shareholders of Swedish Match are offered SEK 106 in cash per share in Swedish Match.5American Depositary Shares representing the right to receive shares in Swedish Match in connection with unsponsored American Depositary Receipt programs are not included in the Offer.If  prior to settlement of the Offer  Swedish Match (i) distributes dividends6 or (ii) in any other way distributes or transfers value to its shareholders  the consideration in the Offer will be reduced accordingly (the “Price Adjustment”).

Blockchain  or distributed l…,"LONDON : Blockchain needs its own music industry 'MP3' moment as fragmented regulation and technology hamper the development of a digital securities industry that could help realise its full potential  industry officials said.Blockchain  or distributed ledger technology (DLT)  underpins cryptoassets like bitcoin and allows many parties to access a single version of data at the same time.But extending its application to issuing  trading and settling securities like stocks and bonds requires a common digital format for the securities themselves  said Gerd Hartung  head of new digital markets at Deutsche Boerse.""The real topic is how do we get to the MP3 digital format you see in the music industry. The next level we are getting to is digitisation of the financial instrument itself "" he said.The digital MP3 file format  with its inferior audio quality  did not look like a disruptive technology until the arrival of MP3 players and streaming systems dramatically altered the music industry  removing a slew of middle men and almost all the barriers to entry faced by an artist.A similar pivot in financial markets would allow an instrument to be issued in hours rather than days or weeks  better targeting specific markets and taking advantage of windows of calm to reach more investors faster and free of data errors  industry officials say.But it would also challenge banks' dominant position in the revenue chain for issuing and trading securities.A further step from pilot project to live markets came this week with the launch of LedgerEdge  described as the first regulated  DLT-based corporate bond platform.""Everyone is looking for greater clarity on the regulatory definition of digital assets "" said David Nicol  chief executive and co-founder of LedgerEdge.But with many elements yet to fall into place  Arjun Jayaram  founder and chief executive of blockchain company Baton Systems  warned there was unlikely to be a ""big bang"" moment.Banks still use ""very old"" technology  making it harder to interface with DLT platforms  he said  while Javier Hernani  head of securities services at SIX which runs the Zurich and Madrid stock exchanges  said hooking up to blockchain was a cost that needed to be phased in.Hernani also pointed to the need for digital versions of currencies such as the dollar  euro or sterling to speed up payment and achieve the full benefits of DLT  something the relevant central banks have yet to decide on  let alone launch.Instead a ""bridge"" would be needed to allow digitised assets to be traded  but paid for in fiat currencies  he suggested.Regulators also need time to get to grips with the new technology  with the European Union and Britain preparing to test DLT in market infrastructure.""We intend to have this up and running next year  and if it teaches us that we need to update the relevant legislation  then we will do that too "" Britain's financial services minister John Glen said in a speech last month.The EU said its pilot regime would allow policymakers to identify obstacles in regulation.PARALLEL SYSTEMSHSBC and Wells Fargo are already using blockchain from Baton Systems to settle bilateral foreign currency trades  and in July Deutsche Boerse will use its digital central register to offer same day-issuance and paperless processing for digitised certificates and warrants in its Clearstream settlement arm.""We have done the proof of concepts in the past  but now it's really about bringing the real  fully-fledged financial  digital market infrastructure in place  and that needs to be productive and scalable "" Hartung said.Rival Euroclear has joined blockchain consortium Fnality - backed by banks including Santander  Barclays  Credit Suisse  MUFG and UBS - which is aiming to open a payments account for tokenised assets at the Bank of England in October.Meanwhile  the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corp's platform that leverages DLT is moving to a development phase for same-day settlement of securities trades  compared with two days at present.Consultants estimate potential savings of 50 per cent from using blockchain in areas like settlement  mainly through cutting time-consuming 'reconciliation' or the fixing of mismatches in transaction data.Faster completion of trades also means less risk and therefore less capital tied up in backing transactions.Looking at the derivatives market  Deloitte estimates a ""single shared version of trade data"" could reduce costs by one-third.Combining DLT with a machine-readable blueprint for how derivatives are managed and traded could cut the cost base for derivatives dealers by $3.2 billion  it says.SIX  which launched a digital bond in November  senses progress this year.""We are going from proof of concept to the real world  slowly "" the company's Hernani said.""We will continue to see some real business  but still in the small numbers. I think there will be parallel systems for a while.""",neutral,0.1,0.82,0.08,negative,0.01,0.1,0.89,True,English,"['MP3 music moment', 'Analysis', 'Blockchain', 'markets', 'first regulated, DLT-based corporate bond platform', 'real, fully-fledged financial, digital market infrastructure', 'financial services minister John Glen', 'U.S. Depository Trust', 'bilateral foreign currency trades', 'digital MP3 file format', 'common digital format', 'MP3 digital format', 'digital central register', 'inferior audio quality', 'Madrid stock exchanges', 'big bang"" moment', 'distributed ledger technology', ""banks' dominant position"", 'Clearstream settlement arm', 'single shared version', 'new digital markets', 'relevant central banks', 'blockchain consortium Fnality', 'digital securities industry', 'digital bond', 'financial markets', 'securities services', ""MP3' moment"", 'financial instrument', 'digital versions', 'single version', 'real topic', 'derivatives market', 'real world', 'real business', 'digital assets', 'MP3 players', 'new technology', 'relevant legislation', 'securities trades', 'music industry', 'industry officials', 'full potential', 'many parties', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'next level', 'disruptive technology', 'streaming systems', 'middle men', 'similar pivot', 'specific markets', 'revenue chain', 'pilot project', 'greater clarity', 'regulatory definition', 'David Nicol', 'chief executive', 'many elements', 'Arjun Jayaram', 'Baton Systems', 'old"" technology', 'full benefits', 'European Union', 'pilot regime', 'PARALLEL SYSTEMS', 'Wells Fargo', 'same day-issuance', 'paperless processing', 'Rival Euroclear', 'Credit Suisse', 'payments account', 'Clearing Corp', 'same-day settlement', 'potential savings', '50 per cent', ""time-consuming 'reconciliation"", 'Faster completion', 'less risk', 'less capital', 'machine-readable blueprint', 'small numbers', 'data errors', 'transaction data', 'trade data', 'tokenised assets', 'derivatives dealers', 'fragmented regulation', 'same time', 'Gerd Hartung', 'fiat currencies', 'development phase', 'two days', 'cost base', 'trading securities', 'Javier Hernani', 'DLT platforms', 'blockchain company', 'LONDON', 'cryptoassets', 'bitcoin', 'application', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'head', 'digitisation', 'arrival', 'slew', 'barriers', 'entry', 'artist', 'hours', 'weeks', 'advantage', 'windows', 'calm', 'investors', 'issuing', 'step', 'launch', 'LedgerEdge', 'Everyone', 'founder', 'place', 'SIX', 'Zurich', 'need', 'dollar', 'sterling', 'something', 'bridge', 'digitised', 'Regulators', 'grips', 'Britain', 'speech', 'policymakers', 'obstacles', 'HSBC', 'July', 'certificates', 'warrants', 'proof', 'concepts', 'past', 'Santander', 'Barclays', 'MUFG', 'UBS', 'England', 'October', 'present', 'Consultants', 'areas', 'fixing', 'mismatches', 'backing', 'transactions', 'Deloitte', 'costs', 'one-third', 'November']",2022-05-11,2022-05-12,channelnewsasia.com

The next level we are getting to is digitisation of the financial instrument itself ” he said.The digital MP3 file format  with its inferior audio quality  did not look like a disruptive technology until the arrival of MP3 players and streaming systems dramatically altered the music industry  removing a slew of middle men and almost all the barriers to entry faced by an artist.A similar pivot in financial markets would allow an instrument to be issued in hours rather than days or weeks  better targeting specific markets and taking advantage of windows of calm to reach more investors faster and free of data errors  industry officials say.But it would also challenge banks’ dominant position in the revenue chain for issuing and trading securities.A further step from pilot project to live markets came this week with the launch of LedgerEdge  described as the first regulated  DLT-based corporate bond platform.“Everyone is looking for greater clarity on the regulatory definition of digital assets ” said David Nicol  chief executive and co-founder of LedgerEdge.But with many elements yet to fall into place  Arjun Jayaram  founder and chief executive of blockchain company Baton Systems  warned there was unlikely to be a “big bang” moment.Banks still use “very old” technology  making it harder to interface with DLT platforms  he said  while Javier Hernani  head of securities services at SIX which runs the Zurich and Madrid stock exchanges  said hooking up to blockchain was a cost that needed to be phased in.Hernani also pointed to the need for digital versions of currencies such as the dollar  euro or sterling to speed up payment and achieve the full benefits of DLT  something the relevant central banks have yet to decide on  let alone launch.Instead a “bridge” would be needed to allow digitised assets to be traded  but paid for in fiat currencies  he suggested.Regulators also need time to get to grips with the new technology  with the European Union and Britain preparing to test DLT in market infrastructure.“We intend to have this up and running next year  and if it teaches us that we need to update the relevant legislation  then we will do that too ” Britain’s financial services minister John Glen said in a speech last month.The EU said its pilot regime would allow policymakers to identify obstacles in regulation.PARALLEL SYSTEMSHSBC and Wells Fargo are already using blockchain from Baton Systems to settle bilateral foreign currency trades  and in July Deutsche Boerse will use its digital central register to offer same day-issuance and paperless processing for digitised certificates and warrants in its Clearstream settlement arm.“We have done the proof of concepts in the past  but now it’s really about bringing the real  fully-fledged financial  digital market infrastructure in place  and that needs to be productive and scalable ” Hartung said.Rival Euroclear has joined blockchain consortium Fnality – backed by banks including Santander  Barclays  Credit Suisse  MUFG and UBS – which is aiming to open a payments account for tokenised assets at the Bank of England in October.Meanwhile  the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corp’s platform that leverages DLT is moving to a development phase for same-day settlement of securities trades  compared with two days at present.Consultants estimate potential savings of 50% from using blockchain in areas like settlement  mainly through cutting time-consuming ‘reconciliation’ or the fixing of mismatches in transaction data.Faster completion of trades also means less risk and therefore less capital tied up in backing transactions.Looking at the derivatives market  Deloitte estimates a “single shared version of trade data” could reduce costs by one-third.Combining DLT with a machine-readable blueprint for how derivatives are managed and traded could cut the cost base for derivatives dealers by $3.2 billion  it says.SIX  which launched a digital bond in November  senses progress this year.“We are going from proof of concept to the real world  slowly ” the company’s Hernani said.“We will continue to see some real business  but still in the small numbers.

This is the fourth edition of our ESG report after the inaugural report in 2018 and contains key information about our commitment to the Environment  Social development  and Governance issues.The report presents our material environmental  social  and governance (ESG) performance  along with how we manage material sustainability topics  for the financial year ended December 31  2021.The ESG report is prepared in accordance with requirements of the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s (SASB) Marine Transportation Standard (2018) and has been prepared in accordance with the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards (2021). It is based on the NASDAQ ESG Reporting Guide 2.0 and Euronext Guidelines to issuers for ESG reporting.

An index of disclosures responding to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI  core option) is also available on our website.Øystein M. Kalleklev  Chief Executive Officer of Flex LNG Management AS  commented:“We are pleased to publish the fourth edition of our annual ESG report. ESG is an integral part of our business strategy and we will continue to broaden the scope of our initiatives and our ESG reporting. Our business strategy is to transport LNG which is primarily utilized to replace coal and to some extent diesel in power generation. Replacing coal with natural gas cuts CO2 emissions by about half  but also cleans up the local environment due to the clean burning properties of natural gas. Furthermore  we transport the LNG on the most fuel-efficient ships in the industry  reducing the fuel consumption per transported unit close to 60% compared to the steam generation. 2021 was a challenging year operating ships when it comes to crew rotations due to Covid-19 restrictions. We have put top priority on carrying out these crew rotations despite the obstacles as the welfare of our crew is part of our social responsibility. We would therefore like to extend our gratitude to crew and onshore personnel for their diligent work and great results in this matter.”Story continuesFor further queries  please contact:Mr Knut Traaholt  Chief Financial Officer of Flex LNG Management ASTelephone: +47 23 11 40 00Email: IR@flexlng.comThis information is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 the Norwegian Securities Trading ActAttachment,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.56,0.23,0.21,True,English,"['2021 Annual ESG Report', 'Flex LNG', 'Norwegian Securities Trading Act Attachment', 'SASB) Marine Transportation Standard', 'Sustainability Accounting Standards Board', 'challenging year operating ships', 'Flex LNG Management AS', 'NASDAQ ESG Reporting Guide', 'material sustainability topics', 'UN Global Compact', 'Øystein M.

An honorary doctorate is the most significant honor a university can bestow on an individual.Richard “Dick” Bergmark is a 1975 industrial management graduate who has demonstrated a deep commitment to Georgia Tech. He was awarded an honorary degree during the afternoon bachelor’s ceremony on Saturday  May 7.“I’m a little bit speechless about this ” Bergmark said. His remarks focused on how generosity can improve the lives of others  and encouraged graduates to thank those whose generosity helped them get to their graduation day. “Many of us probably wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for the generosity of other people. Share this moment of achievement with your supporters.”While working in London  he was fortunate to be involved in a management-led buyout of a small  unprofitable division of a Fortune 100 technology conglomerate. In his role as the chief financial officer of this geological research laboratory  he led the company’s IPO on NASDAQ  then later moved the listing to the New York Stock Exchange followed by a dual listing on the Amsterdam Euronext Stock Exchange. Under his leadership  the company grew substantially  with laboratories and operations in more than 50 countries and over 5 000 employees. He also holds an MBA from the University of Oklahoma and was a certified public accountant in Texas.Today  Bergmark enjoys mentoring students on career development decisions as well as serving as an advisor to a STEM-related educational foundation. He stays engaged with Georgia Tech as an emeritus trustee of the Georgia Tech Foundation  chair of the Scheller College of Business advisory board  and member of the Alexander-Tharpe board of directors.During his time in London he met Toni  his wife of more than 28 years. They reside in Houston  Texas.Watch Dick Bergmark’s remarks at Spring 2022 Commencement.Raphael Bostic  president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta  was awarded an honorary degree during the master’s ceremony on Friday  May 6  in recognition of his role as a valued friend of Georgia Tech.Bostic has engaged students  faculty  and staff at Georgia Tech through ongoing partnerships and research conversations related to economic policy  city design  economic mobility  and sustainable futures for Atlanta  Georgia  and beyond.“You don’t get these every day  and it’s really a day of pride for me ” Bostic said. He was a professor for more than 15 years  and talked about why Commencement was always his favorite day on campus. “It’s the one day and the only day of the year  when everyone – students  parents  professors  instructors – is happy. Thank you for letting me share this time with you.Bostic took office June 5  2017  as the 15th president and chief executive officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. He is responsible for all the bank's activities  including monetary policy  bank supervision and regulation  and payment services.

Drawing upon Barco’s long legacy in LED  TruePix is designed completely from the ground up to create a purpose-built video wall for a variety of enterprise applications. It perfects all aspects of the LED experience starting from installation  throughout its long lifetime  to after sales support and maintenance. TruePix ensures a truly seamless experience bringing content to life as intended in control rooms  television studios  lobbies  boardrooms  auditoriums  and other corporate applications.Key product highlights:Truly seamless displaySmart engineering for an easy  perfectly aligned installationUnmatched viewing experience thanks to the next gen Infinipix ® processor® Purpose-built robustness and ergonomics for 24/7 smooth and efficient operationsSuperb color accuracy  under all lighting conditionsReduced ecological footprint10 years of dedicated service and supportWith the ongoing cost erosion  LED technology is now within the reach of most companies  for a variety of applications. With TruePix  Barco combines the latest technological evolutions  a vast amount of expertise  and innovative  smart engineering. The result is a unique mounting technology  impressive image quality and ensuing longevity. These high-resolution 16:9 tiles are available in multiple options  with pixel pitches ranging from 0.9 to 1.9 mm.Speaking on the announcement  Gan Ta Loong  Managing Director  Barco SEA and Vice President Immersive and Large Videowall Experience APAC  said  “Barco has always believed in bringing technological marvels to industry and in our endeavor to continue we are proud to present TruePix  video walls offering seamless viewing experience combining innovative technology. TruePix encapsulates Barco’s 25 years of experience in LED technology  guaranteeing bespoke visuals & perfect sync of the content providing solutions to discerning needs of customers in key markets.”Reliably perfect qualityThe first product to incorporate Barco’s superior Infinipix Gen2 image processing system  TruePix ensures an unmatched viewing experience for all types of content. No visual distortions  low latency  perfect sync  and no tearing are the hallmarks of this system. Infinipix Gen2 also guarantees dimming without any loss in color accuracy  which drastically expands the effectiveness of the installation. What’s more  Barco’s proprietary smart calibration method for wide color gamut support and full color balancing control  will create rich and true-to-life images. TruePix also shows that visual excellence does not equal high energy consumption. Its EcoPower mode ensures reduced energy consumption  helping to limit the ecological footprint.SteadyView  a unique Barco feature  improves viewing ergonomics and reduces eye fatigue. This is especially important in control room environments  where the staff intensely use the wall for multiple hours on end. This makes TruePix one of the very first purpose-built LED walls for critical and high-intensity applications like control rooms and command centers.Smart engineering for predictable  truly seamless outcomesThe impressive image quality of an LED video wall can only come to its full right if the display is installed impeccably. However  there are always imperfections in the flatness of the walls and level of the floors  which very often cause mechanical stress in the frames of the tiles. This can lead to seams  damage  or difficulties during maintenance. TruePix’ innovative auto-balancing system counters these imperfections and makes sure the LED wall is 100% level and frictionless. Furthermore  the installation time is also cut because the tiles all slide perfectly into place without the need for manual adjustments. The guided module insertion ensures a fully contactless and risk-free installation  with no risk of tile damage.Full service support for 10 yearsFor Barco  ensuring longevity  reliability and perfect display uniformity is of major importance. With its uncompromising service  Barco takes every measure to deliver the promised experiences to its customers. Availability of batch compatible modules throughout the life of the wall is therefore a key part of Barco’s service offerings. If a module needs to be replaced  Barco guarantees that batch-compatible spare tiles (along with full service support) are available for up to 10 years. This brings complete peace of mind and a reduced cost of ownership over the full lifetime of the product.The Video wall Management Suite  Barco’s cloud-based platform for advanced video wall management  allows you to monitor  diagnose and/or control the TruePix installation remotely. This maximizes uptime and reduces the need and length of service interventions. TruePix is also the first LED product on the market to leverage 5Gb bandwidth. This makes the system up to 5 times more efficient with fewer cable runs and points of failure – as more LED modules can be connected in a single link. To further guarantee an uninterrupted data flow  4-way inter-tile communication and signal loop redundancy are embedded  making TruePix the most reliable LED solution in the market.About BarcoBarco is a global technology leader that develops networked visualization solutions for the entertainment  enterprise  and healthcare markets.

4670,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4110433.html,Victorian hotel performance road to recovery; Accor calls for investment in events to fast-track tourism revival,Accor  the largest hotel operator in Australia  has recorded growth in occupancy across its network of 66 hotels (10 200 rooms) in Victoria  but its city and suburban properties are still being impacted by delayed recovery in business and meetings travel.,"Accor  the largest hotel operator in Australia  has recorded growth in occupancy across its network of 66 hotels (10 200 rooms) in Victoria  but its city and suburban properties are still being impacted by delayed recovery in business and meetings travel.The Group’s Victorian hotels recorded an average occupancy of 60% from January to the end of April 2022  with Victorian regional areas  such as Geelong and Daylesford  enjoying strong support from holiday travellers  with properties such as Novotel Geelong performing ahead of pre-pandemic levels.In contrast  the slow return of workers to the Melbourne CBD has constrained occupancies in most city hotels  with the exception of the recent Grand Prix weekend  which saw most Accor hotels operating at 89% occupancy.Recent analysis from the Property Council of Australia revealed that while Melbourne CBD office occupancy had doubled in the March quarter  it was still only tracking at 32% capacity  compared to Sydney's 41%  Brisbane’s 48%  and Adelaide’s 61%.With interstate and international borders now open  Accor is anticipating a solid performance for the five new additions it added to its Victorian network in 2021: Mantra Traralgon  Mercure Melbourne Doncaster  Peppers Marysville  The Sebel Melbourne Ringwood and Mövenpick Hotel Melbourne Spencer Street  the first Mövenpick branded property in Victoria.Accor will add the 275-room Mercure Melbourne South Bank to its collection in the second half of 2022  a result of the recent agreement with Salter Brothers for Accor to manage 10 properties currently branded as Travelodge hotels.In the pipeline  Accor also has plans to add new-build hotels in Richmond  Hawthorn  Malvern and Latrobe  along with Novotel and ibis Styles hotels at Melbourne Airport  25hours Melbourne and SO/ Melbourne.Accor Pacific Chief Executive Officer  Sarah Derry  said  “Between 2021 and 2025  we are opening fourteen hotels in Victoria  which is an investment of over $700 million by a variety of owners. This will create around 600 jobs  whilst boosting the appeal of the city and the quality of accommodation available.”Ms Derry  said that CBD hotel performances during events such as the Formula 1 racing and Melbourne Comedy Festival had been encouraging.“When cities host major events such as the Grand Prix  we experience a significant surge in bookings. The Grand Prix is one of the world’s premier sports entertainment events  presenting Melbourne  Australia  and the Pacific in general  as highly inspiring and desirable destinations to the rest of the world ” said Ms Derry.“The return of full crowds at AFL has also been encouraging  and festivals and events are attracting leisure travellers to city hotels. The Victorian Government deserves congratulations for signing the Commonwealth Games in 2026  and the 114th International Rotary Convention next year is expected to attract over 20 000 visitors.""“The Victorian State Government stimulus packages such as the Victorian voucher travel scheme have been successful at driving demand  and we believe the travel scheme made a material positive impact over the Easter period. Another successful measure is the Midweek Melbourne Money initiative that supports bars and restaurants. More than 300 000 claims have been made since the program began on 7 March 2022. This helps to build a vibrancy in the city that attracts hotel guests.""“Corporate and business meetings are slowly resuming  but there is a long way to go.""“It is critical that investment in sports  arts and cultural events continues  as it creates jobs and supports local businesses.""“Most city hospitality and tourism operators are still suffering from the impact of Covid on business operations. The pandemic has created a number of issues for the industry  none more so than the ability to attract people who want to make a career in hospitality.""“We employ over 2 100 workers in Victoria  but we are still trying to recruit for 160 positions that remain vacant.""“From an immediate point of view  we need a return of skilled and unskilled workers  along with a rapid boost in international students. The tourism and hospitality industry is a dynamic and rewarding industry  and to attract talent back we need people to be confident that it is a sustainable career path  which provides the opportunity for incredible career development which opens doors all over the world.""“It isn’t emphasised enough  but tourism is one of Australia’s largest drivers of economic growth  with domestic and international tourism spend totalling $122 billion in the financial year before Covid. In that same year  Australia generated $60.8 billion in direct tourism gross domestic product.""“The investment of local and international businesses into upgrading existing and building new hotels has been unprecedented over the past five years. Melbourne now has international quality hotels in both the city centre and  increasingly  in major suburban are regional areas  which have been vital for the sustainability of local communities.""“These investments require active and positive government support at all levels  our industry continues to face major challenges and is a long way from returning to pre-Covid levels.”About AccorAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of more than 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

For shareholders who hold Shares directly or indirectly through the Swedish central securities depository system maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB (Euroclear)  the Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m. (Central European Time) on June 20  2022  unless the Offer is varied or withdrawn.The Offer by IPC is being made by way of ""modified Dutch Auction""  which will allow shareholders who choose to participate in the Offer to select a price of not more than CDN$14.00 (equivalent to approximately SEK 108.2) per Share and not less than CDN$12.00 (equivalent to approximately SEK 92.7) per Share (in increments of CDN$0.20 (equivalent to approximately SEK 1.55)) at which they are willing to tender all or part of their Shares to the Offer. Upon expiry of the Offer  IPC will determine the lowest purchase price per Share that will enable it to purchase the maximum number of Shares tendered to the Offer  having an aggregate purchase price not exceeding CDN$128 million. The purchase price under the Offer will be denominated in Canadian dollars and IPC's obligation to make payment of amounts owing to a depositing shareholder whose Shares are taken up will be made in Canadian dollars.Shareholders who wish to participate in the Offer will be able to do so through: (i) auction tenders  in which they specify the number of Shares being tendered at a specific price per Share; or (ii) purchase price tenders  in which they agree to have a specified number of Shares purchased at the purchase price to be determined pursuant to the Offer. Shareholders who validly deposit Shares without specifying the method in which they are tendering their Shares will be deemed to have made a purchase price tender.If Shares with an aggregate purchase price of more than CDN$128 million are tendered  IPC will purchase the Shares on a pro rata basis. All Shares tendered at or below the finally determined purchase price will be purchased  subject to proration  at the same purchase price determined pursuant to the terms of the Offer. All deposited Shares not purchased  including all Shares deposited pursuant to auction tenders at prices in excess of the purchase price  will be returned to shareholders.The Offer is not conditional upon any minimum number of Shares being tendered. The Corporation expects to fund any purchases of Shares pursuant to the Offer  including related fees and expenses  using the Corporation's available cash on hand.At the minimum and maximum of the pricing range of CDN$12.00 to CDN$14.00  the Offer will be for up to between 10.7 million Shares (approximately 7.1% of Shares currently outstanding) and 9.1 million Shares (approximately 6.1% of Shares currently outstanding)  respectively.

The corresponding amount in Swedish Krona for the purchase price will be determined at a date promptly following completion of the Offer  as determined by Pareto Securities AB (the Swedish Manager) based on the available market rate on the date the purchase price is converted from Canadian dollars to Swedish Krona. The risk of any fluctuations in such foreign exchange rate  including risks relating to the particular date and time at which funds are converted  will be borne solely by the tendering shareholders who hold Shares directly or indirectly through Euroclear.All shareholders who sell Shares under the Offer are generally expected to realize deemed dividends for purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada).

The amount of any such deemed dividend received by a shareholder who is a non-resident of Canada and who does not hold Shares directly or indirectly through Euroclear will be subject to Canadian withholding tax at a rate of 25% or such lower rate as may be substantiated under the terms of an applicable income tax treaty or convention. Shareholders are urged to evaluate carefully all information in the Offer Documents (as defined below) and consult their own financial  legal  investment  tax and other professional advisors in respect of the Offer.The Offer allows the Corporation an opportunity to return up to CDN$128 million of capital to shareholders who elect to tender  while at the same time increasing the proportionate Share ownership of shareholders who elect not to tender to the Offer. The Offer is not expected to restrict the Corporation from pursuing further business and strategic opportunities.The closing price of the Shares on May 2  2022 (the last full trading day before IPC announced its intention to make the Offer) on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and Nasdaq Stockholm in Sweden (Nasdaq Stockholm) was CDN$12.28 and SEK 92.65  respectively.

4697,Euroclear,Google API,https://www.zawya.com/en/opinion/markets-insights/blockchain-needs-mp3-music-moment-to-win-over-markets-m8wo8dsp,Blockchain needs MP3 music moment to win over markets,1 day ago,"LONDON - Blockchain needs its own music industry 'MP3' moment as fragmented regulation and technology hamper the development of a digital securities industry that could help realise its full potential  industry officials said.Blockchain  or distributed ledger technology (DLT)  underpins cryptoassets like bitcoin and allows many parties to access a single version of data at the same time.But extending its application to issuing  trading and settling securities like stocks and bonds requires a common digital format for the securities themselves  said Gerd Hartung  head of new digital markets at Deutsche Boerse.""The real topic is how do we get to the MP3 digital format you see in the music industry. The next level we are getting to is digitisation of the financial instrument itself "" he said.The digital MP3 file format  with its inferior audio quality  did not look like a disruptive technology until the arrival of MP3 players and streaming systems dramatically altered the music industry  removing a slew of middle men and almost all the barriers to entry faced by an artist.A similar pivot in financial markets would allow an instrument to be issued in hours rather than days or weeks  better targeting specific markets and taking advantage of windows of calm to reach more investors faster and free of data errors  industry officials say.But it would also challenge banks' dominant position in the revenue chain for issuing and trading securities.A further step from pilot project to live markets came this week with the launch of LedgerEdge  described as the first regulated  DLT-based corporate bond platform.""Everyone is looking for greater clarity on the regulatory definition of digital assets "" said David Nicol  chief executive and co-founder of LedgerEdge.But with many elements yet to fall into place  Arjun Jayaram  founder and chief executive of blockchain company Baton Systems  warned there was unlikely to be a ""big bang"" moment.Banks still use ""very old"" technology  making it harder to interface with DLT platforms  he said  while Javier Hernani  head of securities services at SIX which runs the Zurich and Madrid stock exchanges  said hooking up to blockchain was a cost that needed to be phased in.Hernani also pointed to the need for digital versions of currencies such as the dollar  euro or sterling to speed up payment and achieve the full benefits of DLT  something the relevant central banks have yet to decide on  let alone launch.Instead a ""bridge"" would be needed to allow digitised assets to be traded  but paid for in fiat currencies  he suggested.Regulators also need time to get to grips with the new technology  with the European Union and Britain preparing to test DLT in market infrastructure.""We intend to have this up and running next year  and if it teaches us that we need to update the relevant legislation  then we will do that too "" Britain's financial services minister John Glen said in a speech last month.The EU said its pilot regime would allow policymakers to identify obstacles in regulation.PARALLEL SYSTEMSHSBC and Wells Fargo are already using blockchain from Baton Systems to settle bilateral foreign currency trades  and in July Deutsche Boerse will use its digital central register to offer same day-issuance and paperless processing for digitised certificates and warrants in its Clearstream settlement arm.""We have done the proof of concepts in the past  but now it's really about bringing the real  fully-fledged financial  digital market infrastructure in place  and that needs to be productive and scalable "" Hartung said.Rival Euroclear has joined blockchain consortium Fnality - backed by banks including Santander  Barclays  Credit Suisse  MUFG and UBS - which is aiming to open a payments account for tokenised assets at the Bank of England in October.Meanwhile  the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corp's platform that leverages DLT is moving to a development phase for same-day settlement of securities trades  compared with two days at present.Consultants estimate potential savings of 50% from using blockchain in areas like settlement  mainly through cutting time-consuming 'reconciliation' or the fixing of mismatches in transaction data.Faster completion of trades also means less risk and therefore less capital tied up in backing transactions.Looking at the derivatives market  Deloitte estimates a ""single shared version of trade data"" could reduce costs by one-third.Combining DLT with a machine-readable blueprint for how derivatives are managed and traded could cut the cost base for derivatives dealers by $3.2 billion  it says.SIX  which launched a digital bond in November  senses progress this year.""We are going from proof of concept to the real world  slowly "" the company's Hernani said.""We will continue to see some real business  but still in the small numbers. I think there will be parallel systems for a while.""(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)",neutral,0.1,0.83,0.06,negative,0.03,0.15,0.82,True,English,"['MP3 music moment', 'Blockchain', 'markets', 'first regulated, DLT-based corporate bond platform', 'real, fully-fledged financial, digital market infrastructure', 'financial services minister John Glen', 'U.S. Depository Trust', 'bilateral foreign currency trades', 'digital MP3 file format', 'common digital format', 'MP3 digital format', 'digital central register', 'inferior audio quality', 'Madrid stock exchanges', 'big bang"" moment', 'distributed ledger technology', ""banks' dominant position"", 'Clearstream settlement arm', 'single shared version', 'new digital markets', 'relevant central banks', 'blockchain consortium Fnality', 'digital securities industry', 'digital bond', 'financial markets', 'securities services', ""MP3' moment"", 'financial instrument', 'digital versions', 'single version', 'real topic', 'derivatives market', 'real world', 'real business', 'digital assets', 'MP3 players', 'new technology', 'relevant legislation', 'securities trades', 'music industry', 'industry officials', 'full potential', 'many parties', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'next level', 'disruptive technology', 'streaming systems', 'middle men', 'similar pivot', 'specific markets', 'revenue chain', 'pilot project', 'greater clarity', 'regulatory definition', 'David Nicol', 'chief executive', 'many elements', 'Arjun Jayaram', 'Baton Systems', 'old"" technology', 'full benefits', 'European Union', 'pilot regime', 'PARALLEL SYSTEMS', 'Wells Fargo', 'same day-issuance', 'paperless processing', 'Rival Euroclear', 'Credit Suisse', 'payments account', 'Clearing Corp', 'same-day settlement', 'potential savings', ""time-consuming 'reconciliation"", 'Faster completion', 'less risk', 'less capital', 'machine-readable blueprint', 'small numbers', 'Huw Jones', 'Kirsten Donovan', 'data errors', 'transaction data', 'trade data', 'tokenised assets', 'derivatives dealers', 'fragmented regulation', 'same time', 'Gerd Hartung', 'fiat currencies', 'development phase', 'two days', 'cost base', 'trading securities', 'Javier Hernani', 'DLT platforms', 'blockchain company', 'LONDON', 'cryptoassets', 'bitcoin', 'application', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'head', 'digitisation', 'arrival', 'slew', 'barriers', 'entry', 'artist', 'hours', 'weeks', 'advantage', 'windows', 'calm', 'investors', 'issuing', 'step', 'launch', 'LedgerEdge', 'Everyone', 'founder', 'place', 'SIX', 'Zurich', 'need', 'dollar', 'sterling', 'something', 'bridge', 'digitised', 'Regulators', 'grips', 'Britain', 'speech', 'policymakers', 'obstacles', 'HSBC', 'July', 'certificates', 'warrants', 'proof', 'concepts', 'past', 'Santander', 'Barclays', 'MUFG', 'UBS', 'England', 'October', 'present', 'Consultants', 'areas', 'fixing', 'mismatches', 'transactions', 'Deloitte', 'costs', 'one-third', 'November', 'Editing']",2022-05-12,2022-05-12,zawya.com

DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT MAY BE CONTRARY TO THE LAW IN CERTAIN ...,"International Petroleum CorporationNOT FOR DISTRIBUTION IN OR TO  OR TO ANY PERSON LOCATED IN OR RESIDING IN ANY JURISDICTION WHERE THE ISSUANCE  PUBLICATION OR DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT IS PROHIBITED BY LAW. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT MAY BE CONTRARY TO THE LAW IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS.TORONTO  May 12  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- International Petroleum Corporation (IPC or the Corporation) (TSX  Nasdaq Stockholm: IPCO) is pleased to announce the terms of its substantial issuer bid (the Offer) to purchase for cancellation up to CDN$128 million (equivalent to approximately US$100 million and SEK 990 million) of its common shares (Shares)  commencing on May 16  2022 and expiring at 5:00 p.m. (Eastern Standard Time) on June 28  2022  unless varied or withdrawn. For shareholders who hold Shares directly or indirectly through the Swedish central securities depository system maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB (Euroclear)  the Offer will expire at 5:00 p.m. (Central European Time) on June 20  2022  unless the Offer is varied or withdrawn.The Offer by IPC is being made by way of ""modified Dutch Auction""  which will allow shareholders who choose to participate in the Offer to select a price of not more than CDN$14.00 (equivalent to approximately SEK 108.2) per Share and not less than CDN$12.00 (equivalent to approximately SEK 92.7) per Share (in increments of CDN$0.20 (equivalent to approximately SEK 1.55)) at which they are willing to tender all or part of their Shares to the Offer. Upon expiry of the Offer  IPC will determine the lowest purchase price per Share that will enable it to purchase the maximum number of Shares tendered to the Offer  having an aggregate purchase price not exceeding CDN$128 million. The purchase price under the Offer will be denominated in Canadian dollars and IPC's obligation to make payment of amounts owing to a depositing shareholder whose Shares are taken up will be made in Canadian dollars.Shareholders who wish to participate in the Offer will be able to do so through: (i) auction tenders  in which they specify the number of Shares being tendered at a specific price per Share; or (ii) purchase price tenders  in which they agree to have a specified number of Shares purchased at the purchase price to be determined pursuant to the Offer. Shareholders who validly deposit Shares without specifying the method in which they are tendering their Shares will be deemed to have made a purchase price tender.Story continuesIf Shares with an aggregate purchase price of more than CDN$128 million are tendered  IPC will purchase the Shares on a pro rata basis. All Shares tendered at or below the finally determined purchase price will be purchased  subject to proration  at the same purchase price determined pursuant to the terms of the Offer. All deposited Shares not purchased  including all Shares deposited pursuant to auction tenders at prices in excess of the purchase price  will be returned to shareholders.The Offer is not conditional upon any minimum number of Shares being tendered. The Corporation expects to fund any purchases of Shares pursuant to the Offer  including related fees and expenses  using the Corporation's available cash on hand.At the minimum and maximum of the pricing range of CDN$12.00 to CDN$14.00  the Offer will be for up to between 10.7 million Shares (approximately 7.1% of Shares currently outstanding) and 9.1 million Shares (approximately 6.1% of Shares currently outstanding)  respectively. As of May 12  2022  150 966 013 common shares of IPC are issued and outstanding and IPC holds no common shares in treasury.Nemesia S.à.r.l. (Nemesia)  an investment company wholly owned by a Lundin family trust  has informed IPC that it does not intend to participate in the Offer. Nemesia beneficially owns  directly or indirectly  or exercises control or direction over  40 697 533 Shares  representing approximately 27% of the current issued and outstanding Shares.Shareholders who hold Shares directly or indirectly through Euroclear will receive a corresponding amount in Swedish Krona to the purchase price in Canadian dollars  less an amount on account of Canadian withholding taxes. The corresponding amount in Swedish Krona for the purchase price will be determined at a date promptly following completion of the Offer  as determined by Pareto Securities AB (the Swedish Manager) based on the available market rate on the date the purchase price is converted from Canadian dollars to Swedish Krona. The risk of any fluctuations in such foreign exchange rate  including risks relating to the particular date and time at which funds are converted  will be borne solely by the tendering shareholders who hold Shares directly or indirectly through Euroclear.All shareholders who sell Shares under the Offer are generally expected to realize deemed dividends for purposes of the Income Tax Act (Canada). The amount of any such deemed dividend received by shareholders who hold Shares directly or indirectly through Euroclear will be subject to Canadian withholding tax at a rate of 25%  irrespective of (i) where such shareholder is resident for tax purposes; and (ii) whether such shareholder is entitled to the benefits of an applicable income tax treaty or convention. The amount of any such deemed dividend received by a shareholder who is a non-resident of Canada and who does not hold Shares directly or indirectly through Euroclear will be subject to Canadian withholding tax at a rate of 25% or such lower rate as may be substantiated under the terms of an applicable income tax treaty or convention. Shareholders are urged to evaluate carefully all information in the Offer Documents (as defined below) and consult their own financial  legal  investment  tax and other professional advisors in respect of the Offer.The Offer allows the Corporation an opportunity to return up to CDN$128 million of capital to shareholders who elect to tender  while at the same time increasing the proportionate Share ownership of shareholders who elect not to tender to the Offer. The Offer is not expected to restrict the Corporation from pursuing further business and strategic opportunities.The closing price of the Shares on May 2  2022 (the last full trading day before IPC announced its intention to make the Offer) on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) and Nasdaq Stockholm in Sweden (Nasdaq Stockholm) was CDN$12.28 and SEK 92.65  respectively. Further  the closing price of the Shares on May 10  2022 (the last full trading day before the date of the Offer Documents) on the TSX and the Nasdaq Stockholm was CDN$11.78 and SEK 91.70  respectively. During the six months ended May 10  2022: (i) the closing price of the Shares on the TSX has ranged from a low of CDN$6.32 to a high of CDN$13.15 per Share; and (ii) the closing price of the Shares on Nasdaq Stockholm has ranged from a low of SEK 43.8 to a high of SEK 100.0 per Share.Details of the Offer  including instructions for tendering Shares  will be included in the formal offer to purchase and issuer bid circular  letter of transmittal  notice of guaranteed delivery and other documents relating to the Offer (collectively  the Offer Documents).

Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this press release  unless otherwise indicated. IPC does not intend  and does not assume any obligation  to update these forward-looking statements  except as required by applicable securities laws.All statements other than statements of historical fact may be forward-looking statements. Any statements that express or involve discussions with respect to predictions  expectations  beliefs  plans  projections  forecasts  guidance  budgets  objectives  assumptions or future events or performance (often  but not always  using words or phrases such as ""seek""  ""anticipate""  ""plan""  ""continue""  ""estimate""  ""expect""  ""may""  ""will""  ""project""  ""forecast""  ""predict""  ""potential""  ""targeting""  ""intend""  ""could""  ""might""  ""should""  ""believe""  ""budget"" and similar expressions) are not statements of historical fact and may be ""forward-looking statements"". Forward-looking statements include  but are not limited to  statements with respect to: the terms the Offer; including the price range and number of the Shares IPC may purchase under the Offer; the commencement  timing and completion of the Offer; the sources and availability of funding for the Offer and the Corporation continuing to have sufficient financial resources and working capital to conduct its ongoing business and operations and to pursue its foreseeable or planned business  future strategic direction and capital allocation priorities.The forward-looking statements are based on certain key expectations and assumptions made by IPC  including expectations and assumptions concerning: the level of shareholder participation in the Offer; the conditions to the Offer being satisfied or waived in a timely manner; prevailing commodity prices and currency exchange rates; applicable royalty rates and tax laws; interest rates; future well production rates and reserve and contingent resource volumes; operating costs; the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals; the performance of existing wells; the success obtained in drilling new wells; anticipated timing and results of capital expenditures; the sufficiency of budgeted capital expenditures in carrying out planned activities; the timing  location and extent of future drilling operations; the successful completion of acquisitions and dispositions; the benefits of acquisitions; the state of the political environment  economy and the exploration and production business in the jurisdictions in which IPC operates and globally; the availability and cost of financing  labour and services; and the ability to market crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids successfully.Although IPC believes that the expectations and assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are based are reasonable  undue reliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements because IPC can give no assurances that they will prove to be correct.

With this new offering  we further support them in making an informed assessment and decision.”Guido Wille  head of Eurobonds business at Clearstream  added: “Being at the beginning and the end of the fixed-income value chain  we are uniquely positioned to provide comprehensive post-trade data  making the international bond market more transparent and thus more efficient.”Last July  Clearstream said the firm was focusing on ETF product development to enhance its global ETF service.Related articles,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,negative,0.01,0.2,0.79,True,English,"['Deutsche Boerse partners', 'bond liquidity data', 'Clearstream', 'centralised ETF issuance process', 'International Central Securities Depository', 'transparent” European bond market', 'bond liquidity data service', 'European ETF market', 'ETF product development', 'international bond market', 'fixed income portfolio', 'fixed income market', 'global ETF service', 'different market participants', 'fixed-income value chain', 'comprehensive post-trade data', 'fixed-income instrument prices', 'international securities', 'market data', 'bond issuers', 'European trading', 'different data', 'execution prices', 'high-quality data', 'fixed-income instruments', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'most transactions', 'assets portfolios', 'systemic risk', 'secondary trades', '800,000 new issuances', 'key step', 'Alireza Dorfard', 'strong demand', 'new offering', 'informed assessment', 'Guido Wille', 'Eurobonds business', 'Related articles', 'ICSD model', 'Clearstream', 'Investors', 'partnership', 'bid', 'transparency', 'tool', 'fragmented', 'counter', 'move', 'introduction', 'fragmentation', 'head', 'services', 'customers', 'volumes', 'decision', 'beginning', 'end', 'firm']",2022-12-05,2022-05-12,etfstream.com

The services provider’s IFS recorded a 6% increase in securities deposits  which rose MoM from €3 137 to €3 329.The total number of transactions in this regard increased by 4%  rising from 3.5 million to 3.6 million MoM.As a result of these  Clearstream’s IFS’ assets under custody (AUC) also jumped 5% MoM and 7% YTD  rising from €15 921 billion to €16 731 billion  and from €15 652 billion to €16 704 billion  respectively.Clearstream’s Recent MovesLast month  Clearstream sold its 50% stake in REGIS-TR  a European trade repository it co-founded in 2010  to Iberclear  a sub-subsidiary of the Swiss Infrastructure and Exchange Group (SIX).With the acquisition  SIX  the Swiss stock exchange and the parent company of the Bolsas y Mercados Españoles (BME)  became the sole owner of the repository.Last month  Clearstream entered into a partnership with FNZ  a leading international wealth management platform  to enhance transparency across the UK and the European asset management industry.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,neutral,0.03,0.87,0.1,True,English,"['Global Securities Financing', 'CSD Services', 'Clearstream', 'Upticks', 'April', 'leading international wealth management platform', 'European asset management industry', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'international central securities depository', 'Mercados Españoles', 'global securities financing', 'investment funds services', 'European trade repository', 'Swiss stock exchange', 'post-trade services provider', 'domestic securities deposits', 'total securities deposits', 'securities deposit transactions', 'collateral management', 'Exchange Group', 'depository side', 'securities lending', 'borrowing services', 'Swiss Infrastructure', 'domestic CSD', 'domestic level', 'domestic CDS', 'total number', 'small increases', 'business lines', 'monthly figures', 'Segmental Breakdown', 'Recent Moves', 'parent company', 'sole owner', 'YTD) basis', 'YTD basis', 'GSF service', 'IFS’ assets', '3.6 million MoM', '7% YTD', '3.5 million', '7% MoM', 'Clearstream', 'April', 'upticks', 'ICSD', 'updates', 'Wednesday', 'volume', 'period', '5% increase', 'fall', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'rise', '4% change', 'fact', '7% upturn', '6% increase', 'regard', 'result', 'custody', 'AUC', '50% stake', 'REGIS-TR', 'Iberclear', 'sub-subsidiary', 'SIX', 'acquisition', 'Bolsas', 'BME', 'partnership', 'FNZ', 'transparency', 'UK']",2022-05-12,2022-05-12,financemagnates.com
4715,Clearstream,Google API,https://www.zawya.com/en/opinion/markets-insights/blockchain-needs-mp3-music-moment-to-win-over-markets-m8wo8dsp,Blockchain needs MP3 music moment to win over markets,1 day ago,"LONDON - Blockchain needs its own music industry 'MP3' moment as fragmented regulation and technology hamper the development of a digital securities industry that could help realise its full potential  industry officials said.Blockchain  or distributed ledger technology (DLT)  underpins cryptoassets like bitcoin and allows many parties to access a single version of data at the same time.But extending its application to issuing  trading and settling securities like stocks and bonds requires a common digital format for the securities themselves  said Gerd Hartung  head of new digital markets at Deutsche Boerse.""The real topic is how do we get to the MP3 digital format you see in the music industry. The next level we are getting to is digitisation of the financial instrument itself "" he said.The digital MP3 file format  with its inferior audio quality  did not look like a disruptive technology until the arrival of MP3 players and streaming systems dramatically altered the music industry  removing a slew of middle men and almost all the barriers to entry faced by an artist.A similar pivot in financial markets would allow an instrument to be issued in hours rather than days or weeks  better targeting specific markets and taking advantage of windows of calm to reach more investors faster and free of data errors  industry officials say.But it would also challenge banks' dominant position in the revenue chain for issuing and trading securities.A further step from pilot project to live markets came this week with the launch of LedgerEdge  described as the first regulated  DLT-based corporate bond platform.""Everyone is looking for greater clarity on the regulatory definition of digital assets "" said David Nicol  chief executive and co-founder of LedgerEdge.But with many elements yet to fall into place  Arjun Jayaram  founder and chief executive of blockchain company Baton Systems  warned there was unlikely to be a ""big bang"" moment.Banks still use ""very old"" technology  making it harder to interface with DLT platforms  he said  while Javier Hernani  head of securities services at SIX which runs the Zurich and Madrid stock exchanges  said hooking up to blockchain was a cost that needed to be phased in.Hernani also pointed to the need for digital versions of currencies such as the dollar  euro or sterling to speed up payment and achieve the full benefits of DLT  something the relevant central banks have yet to decide on  let alone launch.Instead a ""bridge"" would be needed to allow digitised assets to be traded  but paid for in fiat currencies  he suggested.Regulators also need time to get to grips with the new technology  with the European Union and Britain preparing to test DLT in market infrastructure.""We intend to have this up and running next year  and if it teaches us that we need to update the relevant legislation  then we will do that too "" Britain's financial services minister John Glen said in a speech last month.The EU said its pilot regime would allow policymakers to identify obstacles in regulation.PARALLEL SYSTEMSHSBC and Wells Fargo are already using blockchain from Baton Systems to settle bilateral foreign currency trades  and in July Deutsche Boerse will use its digital central register to offer same day-issuance and paperless processing for digitised certificates and warrants in its Clearstream settlement arm.""We have done the proof of concepts in the past  but now it's really about bringing the real  fully-fledged financial  digital market infrastructure in place  and that needs to be productive and scalable "" Hartung said.Rival Euroclear has joined blockchain consortium Fnality - backed by banks including Santander  Barclays  Credit Suisse  MUFG and UBS - which is aiming to open a payments account for tokenised assets at the Bank of England in October.Meanwhile  the U.S. Depository Trust & Clearing Corp's platform that leverages DLT is moving to a development phase for same-day settlement of securities trades  compared with two days at present.Consultants estimate potential savings of 50% from using blockchain in areas like settlement  mainly through cutting time-consuming 'reconciliation' or the fixing of mismatches in transaction data.Faster completion of trades also means less risk and therefore less capital tied up in backing transactions.Looking at the derivatives market  Deloitte estimates a ""single shared version of trade data"" could reduce costs by one-third.Combining DLT with a machine-readable blueprint for how derivatives are managed and traded could cut the cost base for derivatives dealers by $3.2 billion  it says.SIX  which launched a digital bond in November  senses progress this year.""We are going from proof of concept to the real world  slowly "" the company's Hernani said.""We will continue to see some real business  but still in the small numbers. I think there will be parallel systems for a while.""(Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)",neutral,0.1,0.83,0.06,negative,0.03,0.15,0.82,True,English,"['MP3 music moment', 'Blockchain', 'markets', 'first regulated, DLT-based corporate bond platform', 'real, fully-fledged financial, digital market infrastructure', 'financial services minister John Glen', 'U.S. Depository Trust', 'bilateral foreign currency trades', 'digital MP3 file format', 'common digital format', 'MP3 digital format', 'digital central register', 'inferior audio quality', 'Madrid stock exchanges', 'big bang"" moment', 'distributed ledger technology', ""banks' dominant position"", 'Clearstream settlement arm', 'single shared version', 'new digital markets', 'relevant central banks', 'blockchain consortium Fnality', 'digital securities industry', 'digital bond', 'financial markets', 'securities services', ""MP3' moment"", 'financial instrument', 'digital versions', 'single version', 'real topic', 'derivatives market', 'real world', 'real business', 'digital assets', 'MP3 players', 'new technology', 'relevant legislation', 'securities trades', 'music industry', 'industry officials', 'full potential', 'many parties', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'next level', 'disruptive technology', 'streaming systems', 'middle men', 'similar pivot', 'specific markets', 'revenue chain', 'pilot project', 'greater clarity', 'regulatory definition', 'David Nicol', 'chief executive', 'many elements', 'Arjun Jayaram', 'Baton Systems', 'old"" technology', 'full benefits', 'European Union', 'pilot regime', 'PARALLEL SYSTEMS', 'Wells Fargo', 'same day-issuance', 'paperless processing', 'Rival Euroclear', 'Credit Suisse', 'payments account', 'Clearing Corp', 'same-day settlement', 'potential savings', ""time-consuming 'reconciliation"", 'Faster completion', 'less risk', 'less capital', 'machine-readable blueprint', 'small numbers', 'Huw Jones', 'Kirsten Donovan', 'data errors', 'transaction data', 'trade data', 'tokenised assets', 'derivatives dealers', 'fragmented regulation', 'same time', 'Gerd Hartung', 'fiat currencies', 'development phase', 'two days', 'cost base', 'trading securities', 'Javier Hernani', 'DLT platforms', 'blockchain company', 'LONDON', 'cryptoassets', 'bitcoin', 'application', 'stocks', 'bonds', 'head', 'digitisation', 'arrival', 'slew', 'barriers', 'entry', 'artist', 'hours', 'weeks', 'advantage', 'windows', 'calm', 'investors', 'issuing', 'step', 'launch', 'LedgerEdge', 'Everyone', 'founder', 'place', 'SIX', 'Zurich', 'need', 'dollar', 'sterling', 'something', 'bridge', 'digitised', 'Regulators', 'grips', 'Britain', 'speech', 'policymakers', 'obstacles', 'HSBC', 'July', 'certificates', 'warrants', 'proof', 'concepts', 'past', 'Santander', 'Barclays', 'MUFG', 'UBS', 'England', 'October', 'present', 'Consultants', 'areas', 'fixing', 'mismatches', 'transactions', 'Deloitte', 'costs', 'one-third', 'November', 'Editing']",2022-05-12,2022-05-12,zawya.com

This list excludes Pine Valley  which would have been the third-smallest with 21 residents but voted to merge into Pine Hill at the start of 2022.These are the best hiking spots in New Jersey A trip to New Jersey doesn't have to be all about the beach. Our state has some incredible trails  waterfalls  and lakes to enjoy.From the Pine Barrens to the Appalachian Trail to the hidden gems of New Jersey  you have plenty of options for a great hike. Hiking is such a great way to spend time outdoors and enjoy nature  plus it's a great workout.Before you go out on the trails and explore some of our listeners' suggestions  I have some tips on hiking etiquette from the American Hiking Society.If you are going downhill and run into an uphill hiker  step to the side and give the uphill hiker space. A hiker going uphill has the right of way unless they stop to catch their breath.Always stay on the trail  you may see side paths  unless they are marked as an official trail  steer clear of them. By going off-trail you may cause damage to the ecosystems around the trail  the plants  and wildlife that live there.You also do not want to disturb the wildlife you encounter  just keep your distance from the wildlife and continue hiking.Bicyclists should yield to hikers and horses. Hikers should also yield to horses  but I’m not sure how many horses you will encounter on the trails in New Jersey. If you are thinking of bringing your dog on your hike  they should be leashed  and make sure to clean up all pet waste.Lastly  be mindful of the weather  if the trail is too muddy  it's probably best to save your hike for another day.I asked our listeners for their suggestions of the best hiking spots in New Jersey  check out their suggestions:,negative,0.01,0.04,0.95,mixed,0.31,0.09,0.61,True,English,"['Missing NJ teens', 'Jackson police', 'pickup truck', 'Ocean County Juvenile Detention Center', 'gray 2007 Ford F150 pickup', 'average property tax bill', 'two male teenagers', 'interactive map version', '2021 NJ property taxes', 'North Boston Road', 'best hiking spots', 'American Hiking Society', 'uphill hiker space', 'average bill', 'juvenile complaint', 'pickup truck', 'Clearstream Road', 'hiking etiquette', 'group home', 'Tuesday afternoon', 'red tailgate', 'suspicious incident', 'Further investigation', 'Asbury Park', 'false names', 'younger teen', 'family member', 'outstanding warrant', 'New Jersey', 'full analysis', 'Food history', 'product innovations', 'major recalls', 'government sources', 'populated municipalities', 'Pine Valley', 'Pine Hill', 'Pine Barrens', 'hidden gems', 'great workout', 'pet waste', 'Township police', 'alphabetical list', 'smallest towns', 'great way', 'side paths', 'incredible trails', 'Appalachian Trail', 'great hike', 'official trail', 'many horses', 'Jackson police', 'Erin Vogt', ""listeners' suggestions"", 'Holmdel', 'custody', 'vehicle', 'Officers', 'patrol', 'cul-de-sac', 'description', 'Monday', 'teens', 'duo', 'apprehension', 'stolen', '15-year', 'old', 'violation', 'probation', 'reporter', 'anchor', 'townsquaremedia', 'editor', 'feedback', 'correction', 'municipality', 'others', 'LOOK', 'Stacker', 'news', 'population', '2020 Census', '21 residents', 'start', 'trip', 'beach', 'state', 'waterfalls', 'lakes', 'plenty', 'options', 'time', 'nature', 'tips', 'right', 'breath', 'damage', 'ecosystems', 'plants', 'wildlife', 'distance', 'Bicyclists', 'hikers', 'dog', 'weather']",2022-05-12,2022-05-12,nj1015.com

With this new offering  we further support them in making an informed assessment and decision.”Guido Wille  head of Eurobonds business at Clearstream  added: “Being at the beginning and the end of the fixed-income value chain  we are uniquely positioned to provide comprehensive post-trade data  making the international bond market more transparent and thus more efficient.”Last July  Clearstream said the firm was focusing on ETF product development to enhance its global ETF service.Related articles,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,negative,0.01,0.2,0.79,True,English,"['Deutsche Boerse partners', 'bond liquidity data', 'Clearstream', 'centralised ETF issuance process', 'International Central Securities Depository', 'transparent” European bond market', 'bond liquidity data service', 'European ETF market', 'ETF product development', 'international bond market', 'fixed income portfolio', 'fixed income market', 'global ETF service', 'different market participants', 'fixed-income value chain', 'comprehensive post-trade data', 'fixed-income instrument prices', 'international securities', 'market data', 'bond issuers', 'European trading', 'different data', 'execution prices', 'high-quality data', 'fixed-income instruments', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'most transactions', 'assets portfolios', 'systemic risk', 'secondary trades', '800,000 new issuances', 'key step', 'Alireza Dorfard', 'strong demand', 'new offering', 'informed assessment', 'Guido Wille', 'Eurobonds business', 'Related articles', 'ICSD model', 'Clearstream', 'Investors', 'partnership', 'bid', 'transparency', 'tool', 'fragmented', 'counter', 'move', 'introduction', 'fragmentation', 'head', 'services', 'customers', 'volumes', 'decision', 'beginning', 'end', 'firm']",2022-12-05,2022-05-12,etfstream.com

The next level we are getting to is digitisation of the financial instrument itself ” he said.The digital MP3 file format  with its inferior audio quality  did not look like a disruptive technology until the arrival of MP3 players and streaming systems dramatically altered the music industry  removing a slew of middle men and almost all the barriers to entry an artist faced.A similar pivot in financial markets will enable an instrument to be issued in hours rather than days or weeks  better targeting specific markets and taking advantage of windows of calm to reach more investors faster and free of data errors  say industry officials.But it will also challenge banks’ dominant position in the revenue chain for issuing and trading securities.Greater clarityA further step from pilot project to live markets came this week with the launch of LedgerEdge  described as the first regulated  DLT-based corporate bond platform.“Everyone is looking for greater clarity on the regulatory definition of digital assets ” said David Nicol  CEO and co-founder of LedgerEdge.But with many elements yet to fall into place  Arjun Jayaram  founder and CEO of blockchain company Baton Systems  warn that a “big bang” moment is not likely.Banks still use “very old” technology  making it harder to interface with DLT platforms  he said  while Javier Hernani  head of securities services at SIX which runs the Zurich and Madrid stock exchanges  said hooking up to blockchain is a cost that should be phased in.Hernani also pointed to the need for digital versions of currencies such as the dollar  euro or sterling to speed up payment and achieve the full benefits of DLT  something central banks have yet to decide on let alone launch.Instead a “bridge” will be needed to enable digitised assets to be traded  but paid for in fiat currencies  he said.Regulators also need time to get to grips with the new technology. The EU and Britain are preparing to test DLT in market infrastructure.Pilot regime“We intend to have this up and running next year  and if it teaches us that we need to update the relevant legislation  then we will do that too ” UK financial services minister John Glen said in a speech last month.The EU said its pilot regime will enable policymakers to identify obstacles in regulation.HSBC and Wells Fargo are already using blockchain from Baton Systems to settle bilateral foreign currency trades. Deutsche Boerse will use its digital central register in July to offer same day-issuance and paperless processing for digitised certificates and warrants in its Clearstream settlement arm.“We have done the proof of concepts in the past  but now it’s really about bringing the real  fully fledged financial  digital market infrastructure in place  and that needs to be productive and scalable ” said Hartung.Rival Euroclear has joined blockchain consortium Fnality — backed by banks including Santander  Barclays  Credit Suisse  MUFG and UBS — which is aiming to open a payments account for tokenised assets at the Bank of England in October.Meanwhile  the US Depository Trust & Clearing Corp’s platform that leverages DLT is moving to a development phase for same-day settlement of securities trades  compared with two days now.Less riskConsultants estimate potential savings of 50% from using blockchain in areas such as settlement  mainly through cutting time-consuming “reconciliation” or the fixing of mismatches in transaction data.Faster completion of trades also means less risk and therefore less capital tied up in backing transactions.Looking at the derivatives market  Deloitte estimates a “single shared version of trade data” can reduce costs by one-third.Combining DLT with a machine-readable blueprint for how derivatives are managed and traded can cut the cost base for derivatives dealers by $3.2bn  it says.SIX  which launched a digital bond in November  senses progress this year.“We are going from proof of concept to the real world  slowly ” said Hernani.“We will continue to see some real business  but still in the small numbers.

Stahl AG / Key word(s): Quarterly / Interim Statement/Quarter ResultsR. STAHL starts 2022 with sales increase and strong order intake in the first quarter - effects of Corona pandemic and Russia-Ukraine crisis negatively impact quarterly results and expectations for fuThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.R. STAHL starts 2022 with sales increase and strong order intake in the first quarter - effects of Corona pandemic and Russia-Ukraine crisis negatively impact quarterly results and expectations for full year - First-quarter sales of € 61.0 million up 4.8% year-on-year. - EBITDA pre exceptionals up € 0.4 million to € 3.0 million. - Net profit negatively impacted by the partial write-down on the Russian investment and amounted to € -5.4 million  compared with € -2.5 million in the same quarter of the previous year. - Earnings per share at € -0.84. - Order intake of € 75.1 million up 17.5% year-on-year. - Forecast for full year 2022 confirmed: Growth in sales and EBITDA pre exceptionals expected in the low double-digit percentage range.Waldenburg  12 May 2022 – R. STAHL today publishes preliminary business figures for financial year 2022. Group sales increased by € 2.8 million compared with the prior-year quarter  reaching € 61.0 million. As a result of this sales growth and despite higher cost items  EBITDA pre exceptionals amounted to € 3.0 million. By contrast  net profit fell to € -5.4 million in the reporting period compared with € -2.5 million in the prior-year quarter. Operating activities as a whole continued to be impacted by the effects of the Corona pandemic and  since February  also increasingly by those of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Thanks to a noticeable revival in demand across all regions and industries  order intake rose by 17.5% to € 75.1 million in the reporting period.Business development in the first quarter of 2022As was already apparent in previous quarters  business performance in the first quarter was increasingly characterized by disrupted supply chains and price increases. This effect was exacerbated by the escalation of the Russia-Ukraine conflict in February. The price increases were offset by price adjustments. Despite the difficult conditions  R. STAHL was able to increase sales by 4.8% to € 61.0 million (Q1 2021: € 58.2 million) in the reporting period  which was supported in particular by orders from the chemical and pharmaceutical industries. This positive development extended to all regions with just one exception. In Germany  the company generated sales of € 16.9 million  up 15.5%  driven by increases from the chemical and mechanical engineering sectors. In the central region (Europe and Africa excluding Germany)  sales were at exactly the same level as the previous year at € 28.2 million. The chemical industry in particular contributed to the stability of sales here. Coming from a weak level  a significant market recovery was perceptible in the Americas  resulting in an increase of 33.9% to € 6.4 million in sales. Wholesale for the oil and gas industry in particular made a gratifying contribution to sales. Only in the Asia/Pacific region did sales fall by -9.8% to € 9.5 million. R. STAHL also encountered a noticeable revival of demand for incoming orders across almost all regions and industries and was able to record an increase of 17.5% to € 75.1 million for the first quarter. As a result  order backlog increased to € 86.6 million (31 December 2020: € 72.2 million). Development of financial position and performance in the first quarter of 2022Sales growth of 4.8% led to a year-on-year increase in EBITDA pre exceptionals of € 0.4 million to € 3.0 million  despite a simultaneous rise in cost items. As a result  the EBITDA margin pre exceptionals also increased to 5.0%. Not including significant special items  EBITDA reached € 2.9 million (Q1 2021: € 2.6 million). Due to the inventory build-up of € 4.0 million  the cost of materials increased by 10.0% to € -23.6 million in the reporting period (Q1 2021: € -21.4 million). Due to the higher total operating performance and the price adjustment made  the ratio of cost of materials to total operating performance remained unchanged year-on-year at 35.4% (Q1 2021: 35.0% of total operating performance) remained almost constant. Personnel expenses increased by 5.7% to € -31.8 million  mainly as a result of higher capacities and temporarily increased working hours at the Waldenburg site. The balance of other operating income and other operating expenses increased by € 1.1 million to € -8.3 million in the reporting period (Q1 2021: € -7.2 million). Net profit decreased by € 2.9 million to € -5.4 million in the first quarter of 2022 (Q1 2021: € -2.5 million). This corresponds to earnings per share of € -0.84 (Q1 2021: € -0.39). Cash flow in the reporting period improved by € 0.9 million to € 2.7 million (Q1 2021: € 1.8 million). Cash flow from operating activities decreased by € -5.8 million to € -7.1 million (Q1 2021: € -1.3 million). This was due to the increase in working capital  which increased as a result of the build-up of inventories in particular. The liquidation of a non-current financial investment  accompanied by a slight increase in investments in intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  led to a decrease in cash flow from investment activities of € 3.0 million to € -0.2 million (Q1 2021: € -3.2 million). Overall  free cash flow in the reporting quarter was € -7.3 million or € -2.8 million below the prior-year figure (Q1 2021: € -4.5 million). As of 31 March 2022  R. STAHL Group had cash and cash equivalents of € 18.8 million available (31 December 2020: € 6.3 million). Compared to the previous year  cash and cash equivalents thus increased by € 1.5 million (Q1 2021: € 17.2 million). As a result of the negative free cash flow  net debt (excluding pension provisions and lease liabilities) increased by € 8.9 million to € 27.1 million as of 31 March 2022 compared with the level at the beginning of the year (31 December 2021: € 18.3 million). Equity improved by € 2.6 million compared to the end of the prior year to € 52.3 million. The positive equity effect from lower provisions for pension obligations compensated for the negative net profit. This resulted in a nearly unchanged equity ratio of 20.3% compared with 20.2% as of 31 December 2021.Forecast for the 2022 financial yearGiven the pleasing order situation and continued strong demand for modern LED and automation solutions  but also given ongoing uncertainties regarding supply bottlenecks  material price developments and the further impact of the Russia-Ukraine crisis  we confirm the forecast we issued when we published our financial figures for 2021 in April. Accordingly  we continue to anticipate year-on-year sales growth in the low double-digit percentage range for 2022. As the full impact of the crisis cannot be passed on to customers  the Executive Board also expects EBITDA pre exceptionals to improve by a low double-digit percentage. The partial write-down of our 25% investment in ZAVOD Goreltex and the continuing uncertainties may result in negative net profit in the higher single-digit million range.

4734,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2022/05/12/deana-lawson-wins-the-deutsche-borse-photography-foundation-prize-2022,Deana Lawson wins the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize 2022,The US photographer has been awarded the £30 000 prize for her “sheer inventiveness and complexity of her approach to image making”,The US artist Deana Lawson has won this year’s Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize  one of the world’s most prestigious photography awards  for her unsettling  sometimes surreal  interventions and manipulations of candid snapshots.“Deana Lawson is a deserved winner of this year’s prize not least for the sheer inventiveness and complexity of her approach to image making ” says Brett Rogers  the director The Photographers’ Gallery and chair of the prize’s jury. “Her work  which reframes and reclaims the Black experience  harnesses the traditional and the experimental and opens up a very unique connection between the everyday and the mystical.”Lawson has been awarded the £30 000 prize for her 2020 solo exhibition Centropy at the Kunsthalle  Basel  and her works  along with those of the other shortlisted artists can be seen at The Photographers’ Gallery in London (until 12 June).Installation view of Lawson's work at The Photographers' Gallery  London Photo: Kate ElliotLawson’s work plays with scale and traditional hierarchies  for instance by blowing up damaged snapshots—one scribbled on  another seemingly water damaged—and shrinking down (and inverting) majestic images of nature  in this case the Niagara Falls  while using mirrored frames and sometimes introducing other elements such as holograms.Lawson’s works also provide an intimate insiders' view to the lives of others but we are never quite sure what is going on: a man holds the viewer's gaze seated alongside a dead body at a wake  while a woman poses with a masked child. “The boldness of her vision and the empowered sensibility she brings to her protagonists is clearly the result of a carefully nuanced collaboration with her cast of ‘family’ members  which places her in a rare position of partner or narrator rather than Auteur ” Rogers says.The jury consisted of the artist Yto Barrada; the New York Times’s deputy director of photography Jessica Dimson; the Tate Modern’s photography curator Yasufumi Nakamori; and the director of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation  Anne-Marie Beckmann. The three other shortlisted photographers—Anastasia Samoylova  Jo Ractliffe and Gilles Peress—were also commended by the members of the jury and each receive £5 000.Anastasia Samoylova's Pink Sidewalk (2017) from the series FloodZone © Anastasia SamoylovaThe Russian photographer Anastasia Samoylova was nominated for her FloodZone exhibition at Moscow’s Multimedia Art Museum  which featured a series of images highlighting how the effects of climate change are not some future prospect but are already being felt  in this case in Miami  Florida. Samoylova’s uncanny photographs play with the boundaries between the manmade and natural landscapes  as the two increasingly abut against each other. Although many of the images are playful  whether a tarpaulin printed with a tropical forest or palm trees toppling over a pink pavement  they have a serious undertone.Jo Ractliffe's Roadside stall on the way to Viana (2007) from the series Terreno Ocupado © Jo RactliffeThe South African photographer Jo Ractliffe was nominated for her Photographs 1980 – Now book. It brings together landscape photographs taken in Angola and South Africa over the past four decades  which often depict the remnants of conflicts or scars of industry. The black and white photographs emphasise the burning sun that washes out the landscapes  whether in images of hillside missile bunkers  graves  or a small building used as a “comfort station”. Ractliffe’s use of silhouttes and animals in her images are also striking. The creatures are often lone subjects that highlight the harsh conditions  such as a suspended dead bird  a solitary donkey at an asbestos mine or a street dogs rummaging among rubbish.Images from Gilles Peress's Whatever You Say  Say Nothing from the chapter 'The Last Night' © Gilles PeressThe French photographer Gilles Peress was nominated for the Whatever You Say  Say Nothing book of images mostly taken in the 1980s in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. In the Photographers’ Gallery show they are arranged in concertinas  strips and grids on the wall. The images do not adhere to a simple narrative but instead evoke the extremes of the period  and are arranged into “semi-fictional” days in the book. Peress builds up a picture of the times  with images of Ulster men marching or snoozing on the grass  children playing on swings  teens kissing as a fire in the street roars white  guns  a woman in hair rollers  goalposts in the snow  and graffiti saying “Fuck the Queen”.,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.13,0.14,0.73,True,English,"['Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize', 'Deana Lawson', 'Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize', 'three other shortlisted photographers', 'The South African photographer', 'other shortlisted artists', 'prestigious photography awards', 'The Photographers’ Gallery', ""The Photographers' Gallery"", 'The Last Night', 'Photographers’ Gallery show', 'Multimedia Art Museum', 'past four decades', 'hillside missile bunkers', '2020 solo exhibition Centropy', ""intimate insiders' view"", 'New York Times', 'photography curator', 'other elements', 'Russian photographer', 'French photographer', 'Installation view', 'surreal, interventions', 'candid snapshots', 'deserved winner', 'sheer inventiveness', 'image making', 'unique connection', 'Kate Elliot', 'damaged snapshots', 'Niagara Falls', 'mirrored frames', 'dead body', 'masked child', 'nuanced collaboration', 'rare position', 'Yto Barrada', 'Jessica Dimson', 'Tate Modern', 'Yasufumi Nakamori', 'Anne-Marie Beckmann', 'Pink Sidewalk', 'FloodZone exhibition', 'climate change', 'future prospect', 'tropical forest', 'palm trees', 'pink pavement', 'serious undertone', 'Roadside stall', 'Terreno Ocupado', 'burning sun', 'small building', 'comfort station', 'lone subjects', 'harsh conditions', 'dead bird', 'solitary donkey', 'asbestos mine', 'Northern Ireland', 'simple narrative', 'semi-fictional” days', 'Ulster men', 'hair rollers', 'Anastasia Samoylova', 'Jo Ractliffe', 'Gilles Peress', 'uncanny photographs', 'landscape photographs', 'white photographs', 'US artist', 'Brett Rogers', 'Black experience', 'London Photo', 'traditional hierarchies', 'family’ members', 'natural landscapes', 'street dogs', 'Deana Lawson', 'deputy director', 'majestic images', '£30,000 prize', 'world', 'manipulations', 'year', 'complexity', 'approach', 'chair', 'jury', 'work', 'experimental', 'everyday', 'mystical', 'Kunsthalle', 'Basel', '12 June', 'scale', 'instance', 'nature', 'case', 'holograms', 'lives', 'others', 'viewer', 'gaze', 'wake', 'woman', 'boldness', 'vision', 'empowered', 'sensibility', 'protagonists', 'result', 'cast', 'partner', 'narrator', 'Auteur', 'series', 'Moscow', 'effects', 'Miami', 'Florida', 'boundaries', 'manmade', 'tarpaulin', 'way', 'Viana', 'book', 'Angola', 'remnants', 'conflicts', 'scars', 'industry', 'graves', 'silhouttes', 'animals', 'creatures', 'rubbish', 'chapter', '1980s', 'Troubles', 'concertinas', 'strips', 'grids', 'wall', 'extremes', 'period', 'picture', 'grass', 'children', 'swings', 'teens', 'fire', 'guns', 'goalposts', 'snow', 'graffiti', 'Queen']",2022-05-12,2022-05-12,theartnewspaper.com

The boldness of her vision and the empowered sensibility she brings to her protagonists is clearly the result of a carefully nuanced collaboration with her cast of ‘family’ members  which places her in a rare position of partner or narrator rather than auteur.”An Ode to Yemaya  2019. Photograph: Deana LawsonLawson is renowned for her intimate staged portraits that explore intergenerational relationships and their effects within black culture. They reflect tropes from documentary photography and art history as well as the language of the family photo album.She frequently positions women as central protagonists  alongside the presence of elders  totemic male figures and symbolic archetypal characters  such as the celestial child. The images depict familiar domestic settings but contain some unsettling element – what the artist calls portals into other worlds  or portrayals of death or birth.Visitors are introduced to what Lawson calls her “ever-expanding mythological family”.Anne-Marie Beckmann  the director of the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation  said that while Lawson was grounded in the traditions of photography and in many ways quite classical  her images offered up new possibilities for the medium and its reception.“Interrogating the position of the black body in visual culture and playing with tropes such as family portraiture  artifice and nature  she takes the personal and makes it political  forcing an often unsettling contemplation of how and what we see.”The presentation at The Photographers’ Gallery marks Lawson’s first institutional show in the UK.

The objective of the parties is that  as a result of the Business Combination  Bone Therapeutics would remain a Belgian listed company and own fifty-one percent (51%) of the share capital of Medsenic.Based on the current information available and subject to due diligence  the parties expect that immediately after closing of the Business Combination  approximately 80% of the total outstanding share capital of Bone Therapeutics shall be held by the shareholders of Medsenic. Parties however agreed that subscription rights of Bone Therapeutics shall be offered to all its existing shareholders but not to the Medsenic shareholders. The terms and conditions of such subscription rights still need to be agreed by the Parties. The final valuation of both companies and exchange ratio shall be further discussed between Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics and confirmed by its auditor  on the basis of mutually accepted external valuations.Story continuesIf this Business Combination were to materialize  which is not certain at the moment  the combined company would create a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company with a diverse therapeutic portfolio targeting a broad array of inflammatory and orthopedic indications. The Business Combination would offer economic and financial benefits and synergies especially in clinical development as both companies shall together have several mid to advanced stage clinical trials ongoing in lupus  chronic graft-versus-host disease  tibial fractures and other indications. In addition to the Bone Therapeutics ongoing controlled phase IIb study in difficult fractures  Medsenic just completed a successful phase II study and plans to soon submit for a phase III pivotal study in Graft versus Host Disease.Bone Therapeutics and Medsenic aim to reach an agreement in the course of Q2/Q3 2022  subject to regulatory control clearance  the outcome of due diligence  shareholders' approval and other customary conditions precedent. Further announcements on the final structure and terms of the Business Combination will be made in due course  if and when the final documentation regarding the potential Business Combination is approved or if circumstances so allow or require.This public announcement does not constitute an offer  or any solicitation of any offer  to buy or subscribe for any securities in Bone Therapeutics.About Medsenic SASMedsenic innovates and exploits the new possibilities offered by the therapeutic use of arsenic trioxide in several autoimmune diseases and is currently in clinical trials in Europe.

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its (unaudited) financial report for the first quarter of the year ended 31 March 2022.Pharming Group N.V. logoThe Company will hold an analyst conference call at 13.30 CET/07.30 EST today.

This increase is a combination of launch preparation for leniolisib  increased travel expenses post-COVID-19 and phasing of costs.Net profit of US$3.5 million decreased 59% (Q1 2021: US$8.5 million). The decrease was caused as a result of a significant decrease in finance income from US$6.6 million in Q1 2021 to US$1.8 million in Q1 2022  mainly due to more favorable exchange rate gains in Q1 2021. The remainder of the decrease relates to the increased operating expenses  partly offset by the growth in gross profit.Positive cash flows from operations amounted to US$0.6 million in Q1 2022. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by US$2.3 million to US$189.7 million from US$191.9 million at the end of Q4 2021.Operational highlightsStory continuesBoth co-primary endpoints met in Phase II/III pivotal clinical study of leniolisib for the treatment of PI3K delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency disease. Submission of global regulatory filings for leniolisib subsequently planned to begin in Q2 2022  with US launch expected in Q1 2023 and European launch in H2 2023  subject to regulatory approvals.Positive decision received from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and  post-period  the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)  on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children  which provides a regulatory pathway to market authorization in Europe and the UK  respectively. The leniolisib PIP includes two planned global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS. The Company expects to initiate recruitment for this pediatric program for leniolisib during the second half of 2022.Post-period operational highlightsPrincipal Investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  shared findings from the pivotal Phase II/III clinical trial of leniolisib for the treatment of APDS demonstrating the reduction in APDS disease markers in patients treated with leniolisib in a presentation at the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) 2022 Annual Meeting.Granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation for leniolisib for the treatment of ADPS from the MHRA. A PIM designation indicates that a medicinal product is a promising candidate for the MHRA's Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS)  which provides pre-market access to products that are intended for the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition and have the potential to address an unmet medical need.One-off payment of US$7.5 million received following Pharming's change in holding in BioConnection BV  the Company's long-term fill and finish partner for RUCONEST®. Pharming retains a 22.98% holding in BioConnection following an acquisition of a majority stake in BioConnection by European investment company Gimv. Pharming continues to support BioConnection to accelerate its growth strategy together with its other shareholders.Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries  commented:""The first quarter of 2022 was a key moment in the Company's history following the report of positive data for leniolisib in a pivotal study in patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome  a complex and progressive rare primary immunodeficiency disease with limited treatment options. We therefore remain focused on bringing this important product to patients  as we continue to increase our planned pre- launch activities and expect to be able to launch leniolisib in the US  subject to regulatory approval  in Q1 2023  followed by launches in the EU markets  subject to regulatory approval  starting in H2 2023.These activities include continuing to identify potential APDS patients eligible for treatment with leniolisib. In the US and Canada  this is through our partnership with Invitae and the navigateAPDS program  which will offer immunologists in these regions access to free genetic testing for primary immune deficiency patients exhibiting APDS symptoms. In Europe  we are intensifying our patient identification efforts together with leading immunology centers of excellence treating patients with APDS and other rare immune deficiencies. We are also actively collaborating with patient organizations to create awareness  advocacy and education for APDS patients and their families.Our investment in leniolisib has been made possible by the underlying strength of our business  and we are pleased to report a marked increase in revenue growth for the first quarter of the year driven by ongoing new patient enrollment and product demand for RUCONEST®. This growth is despite some continued impact of COVID-19 on a number of medical practices in the US  especially pertaining to the time it takes for the administrative processing and approval of prescriptions.""OutlookFor the remainder of 2022  the Company anticipates:Single digit growth in Group revenues from RUCONEST® sales  driven by the US and expanded EU operations  subject to the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarterly fluctuations in revenues are expected.The submission of leniolisib regulatory filings to FDA and EMA  with commercial launch expected from early Q1 2023 onwards  subject to regulatory approvals.The company will invest in this new product opportunity to accelerate future growth. Investments in launch preparations and focused clinical development for leniolisib will significantly increase and will significantly impact profit. With continued cash flow from RUCONEST® to fund these investments  no additional financing to support the current business is expected.Focused investment in potential acquisitions and in-licensing of new late-stage development opportunities and assets in rare diseases. Financing  if required  would come via a combination of our strong balance sheet and access to capital markets.Continued focus on our strategic development  ensuring Pharming's growth through developed assets and a potentially expanded pipeline of in-licensed products to provide further life-saving therapies for patients with unmet medical needs and increase returns for our shareholders.No further specific financial guidance for 2022 is provided.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

Recent months have seen meaningful progress on the commercial front in particular with the successful commercialization of EUTELSAT QUANTUM. Elsewhere  our global distribution agreement with OneWeb to address key connectivity verticals enhances the competitive position of both companies and represents a first step towards the development of combined GEO/LEO solutions. Overall  revenues at the Nine Month stage are in line with our expectations  and we confirm all our financial objectives.”HIGHLIGHTSThird Quarter operating vertical revenues of €285m  broadly stable (-0.7%) quarter-on-quarter.Improvement in Broadcast revenue trend (-6.8% year-on-year in the Third Quarter after -8.6% in the second quarter) with Third Quarter revenues broadly stable (-0.8%) relative to the Second Quarter.Robust double-digit growth for both Fixed Broadband and Mobile Connectivity in the Third Quarter  at respectively circa plus 30% and plus 25% year-on-year  highlighting the significant potential in Connectivity.Strong progress in the commercialization of EUTELSAT QUANTUM with six beams (out of eight) already sold after six months of operation and the entire capacity expected to be fully sold in the coming months.Global distribution partnership secured with OneWeb to address key connectivity verticals  deepening cooperation and showcasing operational synergies between the two companies.Nine Month Operating Verticals of €853m down 4.0% year-on-year and in line with expectations  enabling us to reiterate our objective for the Full Year of between €1 110 million and €1 130 million4.All other financial objectives also confirmed.THIRD QUARTER REVENUES5Total revenues for the Third Quarter stood at €287 million down 4.8% on a reported basis and by 2.7% like-for-like.Revenues of the five Operating Verticals (ie  excluding ‘Other Revenues’) stood at €285 million. They were down by 3.5% on a like-for-like basis excluding a negative perimeter effect of circa three points from the disposal of Euro Broadband Infrastructure (EBI) on 30 April 2021 and a positive currency effect of circa three points.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues of the five Operating Verticals were down by 0.7% like-for-like.Unless otherwise stated  all variations indicated hereunder are on a like-for-like basis  ie  at constant currency and perimeter.Broadcast (61% of revenues)Third Quarter Broadcast revenues amounted to €173 million  down 6.8% year-on-year  representing an improvement in trend relative to the Second Quarter (-8.6% year-on-year). The revenue decline reflected predominantly the effect of the partial renewal of capacity with Nilesat at 7/8°West  which is not offset by the resale of this capacity  and elsewhere  a slight erosion in the underlying business in Europe. Excluding the 7/8°West impact  Broadcast revenues experienced a low-single-digit decline.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were broadly stable with the slight  -0.8%  erosion reflecting the carry-forward effect of the above-mentioned 7/8°West headwind which impacted revenues from mid-October onwards. Revenues were flat excluding this item.Revenues are expected to remain broadly stable in the Fourth Quarter relative to the Third Quarter.Data & Professional Video (14% of revenues)Third Quarter Data & Professional Video revenues stood at €40 million  down by 2.7% year-on-year.In Fixed Data  which represents two thirds of this application  improved volume trends are now offsetting most of the negative impact of competitive pressure.The Professional Video revenues trend saw a slight uptick  reflecting the phasing of a specific contract which is beneficial to the Second Half but neutral over the Full Year  as well as growth of occasional use.Quarter-on-quarter revenues were stable reflecting notably the above-mentioned Professional Video tailwind as well as the broad stabilization of Fixed Data.On the commercial front  a multi-year agreement was signed with Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation for connectivity on the EUTELSAT 172B satellite to support the extension of corporate networks for government offices and businesses of the Tuvalu Islands.We expect this application to decline at a mid-single digit pace over the Full Fiscal Year  consistent with previous indications.Government Services (12% of revenues)Third Quarter Government Services revenues stood at €35 million  down 11.3% year-on-year. This reflected the negative carry-forward effect of US Government renewals  driven by the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan with in particular a renewal rate of only 75% in Fall 2021  as well as the end of life in stable orbit of EUTELSAT 174A.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were down by 8.0% with the full effect of Fall 2021 renewals now in the quarterly base.On the commercial front  as anticipated in February  the latest renewal campaign with the US Government (Spring 2022) resulted in a below-average renewal rate estimated at above 70% reflecting the continued impact of the geopolitical context in the Middle East. Elsewhere  the commercialisation of EUTELSAT QUANTUM made further strong progress with five beams now secured for Government Services  of which three for incremental business and two to favour the renewal of existing business.In the Fourth Quarter  the full effect of Spring 2022 renewals relative to the Third Quarter should be largely offset by the ramp-up of new business on EUTELSAT QUANTUM.Fixed Broadband (6% of revenues)Third Quarter Fixed Broadband revenues stood at €17 million  up 30.2% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. They reflected the contribution from the wholesale agreements with TIM and Hispasat  the strong dynamic of our African operations and the ramp-up of the multi-beam agreement signed on EUTELSAT 65 West A with several Mexican service providers. Conversely  revenues also reflected the erosion of the legacy business of Bigblu Broadband on the KA-SAT satellite.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were up by 7.7%.The favourable momentum in this application is set to continue into the Fourth Quarter.Mobile Connectivity (7% of revenues)Third Quarter Mobile Connectivity revenues stood at €21 million  up 24.5% year-on-year. They reflected the carry-forward effect of the contract signed with Anuvu last year as well as the ongoing strong growth of Maritime  driven by the ramp-up of contracts with service providers signed in recent years and by the agreement inked earlier this year on EUTELSAT QUANTUM with a customer in the Middle East.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were up by 4.5%.On the commercial front  we continue to see a robust pipeline of business for maritime mobility highlighting both the strong demand in this vertical as well as the quality of our in-orbit resources and services.In the Fourth Quarter  growth is expected to decelerate as the comparison base will notably integrate the above-mentioned agreement with Anuvu.Other Revenues‘Other Revenues’ amounted to €2.1 million in the Third Quarter versus €6.9 million a year earlier and €1.0 million in the Second Quarter. They included a negative (€2.8) million impact from hedging operations compared to a positive impact of +€4.3 million last year and a negative impact of (€2) million in the Second Quarter.OPERATIONAL AND UTILIZED TRANSPONDERSThe number of operational transponders as of 31 March 2022 stood at 1 358 down by 22 units quarter-on-quarter  the latter reflecting principally the end of life in stable orbit of EUTELSAT 174A.The number of utilized transponders stood at 961  down 13 units quarter-on-quarter  reflecting principally the same effect as above as well as the Fall 2021 renewal campaign with the US Government.As a result  the fill rate stood at 70.7% compared with 69.5% a year ago and 70.6% at end-December 2021.31 March 2021 31 Dec. 2021 31 March 2022 Operational transponders6 1 366 1 380 1 358 Utilized transponders7 950 974 961 Fill rate 69.5% 70.6% 70.7%Note: Based on 36 MHz-equivalent transponders excluding high throughput capacityBACKLOGThe backlog stood at €4.0 billion as of 31 March 2022 versus €4.5 billion a year ago  and €4.2 billion at end-December 2021  reflecting its natural consumption in the absence of major broadcast renewals this quarter.It was equivalent to 3.3 times 2020-21 revenues  with Broadcast representing 63%.31 Mar. 2021 31 Dec. 2021 31 Mar. 2022 Value of contracts (in billions of euros) 4.5 4.2 4.0 In years of annual revenues 3.5 3.4 3.3 Share of Broadcast 64% 64% 63%Note: The backlog represents future revenues from capacity or service agreements and can include contracts for satellites under procurement.NINE MONTH REVENUESRevenues for the first Nine Months of FY 2021-22 stood at €859 million  down by 7.6% on a reported basis and by 4.0% at constant currency and perimeter.Revenues of the five Operating Verticals (excluding ‘Other Revenues’) were down by 6.0% on a reported basis. They were down by 4.0% on a like-for-like basis excluding a positive effect from currency representing circa one point and a negative perimeter effect of circa three points from the disposal of Euro Broadband Infrastructure (EBI) on 30 April 2021 only partly offset by the consolidation of Bigblu Broadband Europe since 1st October 2020.At a 1.20 €/$ rate (rate as per financial objectives) they stood at €840 million.In € millions 9m 2020-21 9m 2021-22 Change Reported Like-for-like8 Broadcast 560.9 523.0 -6.8% -7.3% Data & Professional Video 120.9 117.8 -2.6% -3.7% Government Services 113.6 108.4 -4.6% -6.3% Fixed Broadband 62.6 47.0 -24.9% +34.4% Mobile Connectivity 49.6 57.2 +15.3% +14.5% Total Operating Verticals 907.5 853.4 -6.0% -4.0% Other Revenues 22.3 5.6 -74.9% -10.4% Total 929.9 859.0 -7.6% -4.1% EUR/USD exchange rate 1.18 1.16FINANCIAL OUTLOOKOn the back of the performance of the first Nine Months  we confirm our objective for the Full Year of Operating Vertical Revenues of between €1 110 to €1 130 million9.All other elements of the financial outlook are also confirmed:Cash Capex 10 not exceeding €400 million per annum for each of the next three fiscal years (FY 2021-22 / FY 2022-23 / FY 2023-24).not exceeding €400 million per annum for each of the next three fiscal years (FY 2021-22 / FY 2022-23 / FY 2023-24). Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow of between €400 million and €430 million in FY 2021-22 at a €/$ rate of 1.20. Adjusted Discretionary Free Cash Flow is expected to grow in FY 2022-23 and in FY 2023-24.The LEAP 2 plan aimed at generating €20-25 million in annual savings by FY 2021-22.Commitment to a sound financial structure to support our solicited investment grade credit ratings targeting a medium-term net debt / EBITDA ratio of around 3x.The policy of a stable to progressive dividend is also reiterated.This outlook is based on the nominal deployment plan outlined below.

The Group also leases capacity on four satellites owned by the Russian operator  RSCC  serving mostly the above-mentioned Russian customers and representing a net present value (included in Net Financial Debt) of €322 million as of 31 December 2021.Furthermore  the OneWeb low-orbit constellation in which Eutelsat owns a 22.9% stake had to suspend the remaining six upcoming launches which were planned from Baikonur Cosmodrome. Since then  OneWeb entered into agreements with SpaceX and New Space India that will enable to resume satellite launches.Consistent with its Code of Ethics and as a provider of infrastructure globally Eutelsat upholds a commitment to neutrality and is therefore guided by sanctions and by the decisions of its competent regulatory bodies  which it strictly applies. In this context  Eutelsat immediately implemented EU Council Regulation 2022/350  suspending the broadcasting activities of Russian television stations such as Russia Today.*******Third Quarter 2021-22 revenues conference callA conference call will be held on Thursday  12 May 2022 at 18.30 CET / 17.30 GMT / 12.30 ESTTo connect to the call  please use the following numbers:- France: +33 (0) 1 76 77 25 07- UK: +44 (0) 330 165 4045- United States: +1 720-543-0214Access code: 5156191#Instant replay will be available from 12 May  22.30 CET to 19 May  22.30 CET on the following numbers:- France: +33 (0) 1 70 48 00 94- UK: + 44 (0) 20 3859 5407- United States: + 1 719 457 0820Access code: 5156191#Financial calendarNote: The financial calendar is provided for information purposes only.

Focused exclusively on the design  development and marketing of professional civil drone solutions  combining microdrones and image analysis software  the Group is seeing the benefits of its strategy rolled out since the end of 2018  against a backdrop of increased demand for its technologies.Revenues (€m and % of revenues) Q1 2022 Q1 2021 Change FY 2021 A Parrot Drones 7.7 54% 4.8 39% +60% 20.9 38% B Of which  consumer products(2) 0 0% 1.2 9% - 6.2 11% C Pix4D 6.7 46% 5.6 45% +20% 26.2 48% D Parrot SA 0.1 1% 0.1 1% - 0.3 1% E Intragroup eliminations -0.1 -1% -0.2 -2% - -0.8 -2% F SenseFly (activity divested in October 2021) - - 2.2 18% - 7.7 14% CONSOLIDATED PARROT GROUP TOTAL 14.4 100% 12.4 100% +16% 54.3 100% NEW SCOPE TOTAL (1) (=A-B+C+D+E) 14.4 100% 9.0 73% +60% 40.4 74%(1) “New scope total” is a performance indicator reflecting the impact of the strategy rolled out since end-2018. It corresponds to the Parrot Group’s consolidated revenues after deducting revenues from consumer products (see 2) and revenues from the subsidiaries divested (Micasense sold in January 2021  revenues in 2021  and Sensefly SA and Sensefly Inc  sold in October 2021). Note that intragroup eliminations are not reallocated and therefore include a relatively insignificant percentage for sales from the subsidiaries divested.(2) Consumer products: consumer drones (all ranges)  legacy automotive products (car kit  plug & play) and connected devices  for which sales were discontinued in 2021.Over the period  the Group’s commercial development was marked by:The 60% growth in revenues for microdrones (+58% at constant exchange rates) to €7.7m was driven by strong sales growth for ANAFI USA commercial micro-drones and the start of sales for the ANAFI Ai  which is combined with a continued high level of gross margin. ANAFI USA sales are being further strengthened by the context of the war in Ukraine and a new delivery for the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA). A second order from 2022 is being looked into  for delivery in the second semester. More widely  Parrot is seeing increased demand for its microdrones  highlighting the gradual integration of drone technologies on its core target markets (inspection  surveillance  mapping)  supported by the high level of security provided by its equipment.The 20% growth in revenues from data analysis software (+14% at constant exchange rates) to €6.7m reflects the international development of the sales and marketing strategy and the continued increase in the number of users  for both the new business solutions launched at the start of 2020 and Pix4Dmapper  the flagship solution.Outlook for 2022Realigned and driven by professional solutions at the forefront of innovation  Parrot is continuing to look ahead to 2022 with confidence in its strategy and vigilance concerning the changes in the international environment.The Group is continuing to allocate its resources to an ambitious R&D roadmap. Supported by its advances in the field of artificial intelligence and the growing integration between hardware and software  Parrot aims to continue facilitating the adoption of drone technologies and offer new use cases that are aligned with the needs of professionals  businesses and institutions  focused on (i) 3D Mapping  Geomatics and Inspection  (ii) Defense and Security  and (iii) Precision Farming.To secure its production capacity over the medium and long term  and respond to the growing interest in its microdrones at the start of this year  Parrot is further strengthening the synergies between R&D  procurement and production tracking. The increase in the resources allocated to these operations will be combined with an agile sourcing management approach. These transformational initiatives could limit the reduction in costs in 2022  and their efficiency and effectiveness are still strongly correlated with changes in the health context in China  where the situation is still disrupted at the start of this year.Looking beyond the disruption linked to the economic and geopolitical environment  which is difficult to predict  the Group plans to move forward with its roadmap for revenue growth on its “new scope” and capitalize on the opportunities opened up by the growing adoption of drone technologies in businesses and the public sector. The Group will continue to closely monitor the allocation of its cash  and will be ready to respond and adapt to potential changes in the conditions.Next financial datesParrot’s general shareholders’ meeting: Wednesday June 15  20222022 first-half earnings: Thursday July 28  2022ABOUT PARROTFounded in 1994 by Henri Seydoux  Parrot is today the leading European drone manufacturer in this rapidly expanding market.Visionary  at the forefront of innovation Parrot has a complementary range of equipment and software adapted to the needs of companies  large groups and government organizations.

The accounting presentation of revenue from activities is presented in the appendix to the press release.In a context where asset utilisation rates remain high  owned activity increased by €13.0 million (+56.6%) due to:the growth in recurring leasing revenue (+€2.3 million) and ancillary services (+€3.0 million).the increase in sales of owned equipment (+€7.8 million)The management activity was down slightly by €0.2 million due to the drop in sales fees on investor equipment  with equipment leased and unavailable for sale.ANALYSIS OF CONTRIBUTIONS BY DIVISIONRestated revenue from activities(in € thousand) Q1 2022 Q1 2021 Variation Leasing revenue on owned equipment 10 544 9 152 1 392 Ancillary services 1 858 1 873 (15) Total leasing activity 12 402 11 025 1 377 Sales of owned equipment 110 320 (210) Total sales of equipment 110 320 (210) Total of owned activity 12 512 11 345 1 167 Management fees 466 463 3 Total of management activity 466 463 3 Total Freight railcars 12 978 11 808 1 170 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 1 619 1 688 (69) Ancillary services 1 807 683 1 124 Total leasing activity 3 426 2 371 1 055 Sales of owned equipment 0 41 (41) Total sales of equipment 0 41 (41) Total of owned activity 3 426 2 412 1 014 Management fees 14 6 8 Total of management activity 14 6 8 Total River Barges 3 440 2 418 1 022 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 3 342 2 384 958 Ancillary services 2 418 191 2 227 Total leasing activity 5 760 2 575 3 185 Sales of owned equipment 13 205 3 480 9 725 Total sales of equipment 13 205 3 480 9 725 Total of owned activity 18 965 6 055 12 910 Syndication fees 0 17 (17) Management fees 498 428 70 Sales fees 336 591 (255) Total of management activity 834 1 036 (202) Total Containers 19 799 7 091 12 708 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 4 5 (1) Ancillary services (350) (2) (348) Total leasing activity (346) 3 (349) Sales of owned equipment 1 547 3 244 (1 697) Total sales of equipment 1 547 3 244 (1 697) Total of owned activity 1 201 3 247 (2 046) Total Miscellaneous & eliminations 1 201 3 247 (2 046) Total Restated Revenue from activities 37 418 24 564 12 854The Freight Railcars division posted an increase of 9.9% to €13.0 million in the first quarter:Rental business increased by €1.4 million (+12.5%)  driven by the investment policy carried out in 2021 and the increase in the fleet utilisation rate (to 88% on average in Q1 2022).Management fees remained stable  while sales of owned equipment recorded a slight decline of €0.2 million.The River Barges division posted an increase in income restated from its activities of €1.0 million  to €3.4 million  due to the €1.1 million increase in ancillary services (chartering in the Rhine basin).Leasing revenue from Group-owned equipment decreased slightly at the beginning of the year  due to a temporary drop in the utilisation rate in January and February  corrected in March (utilisation rate of 98.9% at end-March).The Containers division confirmed the performance of its trading and investment policy in owned activity  posting a sharp increase in its revenue of €12.7 million  to €19.8 million.Sales of Group-owned equipment related to the trading business posted a sharp increase of €9.7 million. Meanwhile  pick-up charges improved by €2.2 million. Rental revenue supported this trend  posting a significant increase of +40.2% over the quarter to €3.3 million.The management activity was down slightly by €0.2 million due to the drop in sales fees on investor equipment  reflecting the persistent lack of available-for-sale containers.The Modular Construction business in Africa  presented in the “miscellaneous” line  decreased by €1.7 million due to an unfavourable comparison basis (significant deliveries took place in Q1 2021).OUTLOOKFrom an economic viewpoint in the short term  the global macroeconomic environment is volatile and uncertain due to the current armed conflict in Ukraine. However  Touax is not directly exposed to this conflict or the economic sanctions on Russia  as it has no subsidiaries  customers or leased transport assets (with the possible exception of a few non-material containers in transit) in Ukraine or Russia. Indirectly  this conflict may have consequences that are difficult to ascertain in terms of rising inflation  impact on European economic growth  logistical disruptions  shortages of equipment  spare parts and raw materials in certain industrial sectors (including the rail sector) and rising interest rates. We note that our assets are gaining value during this inflationary period.From a structural and medium/long-term perspective  the business outlook in the long-term leasing of equipment for sustainable transportation is positive. Our various asset classes are benefiting from the development of infrastructure  e-commerce and intermodal logistics  as well as the support of public authorities  consumers  lenders and investors for green transport.UPCOMING EVENTS22 June 2022: Annual General Meeting28 September 2022: Publication of H1 results and videoconferencing presentation29 September 2022: Video conference call to present the H1 results in English14 November 2022: Q3 revenue from activitiesTOUAX Group leases out tangible assets (freight railcars  river barges and containers) on a daily basis worldwide  both on its own account and for investors.

Focused exclusively on the design  development and marketing of professional civil drone solutions  combining microdrones and image analysis software  the Group is seeing the benefits of its strategy rolled out since the end of 2018  against a backdrop of increased demand for its technologies.Revenues (€m and % of revenues) Q1 2022 Q1 2021 Change FY 2021 A Parrot Drones 7.7 54% 4.8 39% +60% 20.9 38% B Of which  consumer products(2) 0 0% 1.2 9% - 6.2 11% C Pix4D 6.7 46% 5.6 45% +20% 26.2 48% D Parrot SA 0.1 1% 0.1 1% - 0.3 1% E Intragroup eliminations -0.1 -1% -0.2 -2% - -0.8 -2% F SenseFly (activity divested in October 2021) - - 2.2 18% - 7.7 14% CONSOLIDATED PARROT GROUP TOTAL 14.4 100% 12.4 100% +16% 54.3 100% NEW SCOPE TOTAL (1) (=A-B+C+D+E) 14.4 100% 9.0 73% +60% 40.4 74%(1) “New scope total” is a performance indicator reflecting the impact of the strategy rolled out since end-2018. It corresponds to the Parrot Group’s consolidated revenues after deducting revenues from consumer products (see 2) and revenues from the subsidiaries divested (Micasense sold in January 2021  revenues in 2021  and Sensefly SA and Sensefly Inc  sold in October 2021). Note that intragroup eliminations are not reallocated and therefore include a relatively insignificant percentage for sales from the subsidiaries divested.(2) Consumer products: consumer drones (all ranges)  legacy automotive products (car kit  plug & play) and connected devices  for which sales were discontinued in 2021.Over the period  the Group’s commercial development was marked by:The 60% growth in revenues for microdrones (+58% at constant exchange rates) to €7.7m was driven by strong sales growth for ANAFI USA commercial micro-drones and the start of sales for the ANAFI Ai  which is combined with a continued high level of gross margin. ANAFI USA sales are being further strengthened by the context of the war in Ukraine and a new delivery for the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA). A second order from 2022 is being looked into  for delivery in the second semester. More widely  Parrot is seeing increased demand for its microdrones  highlighting the gradual integration of drone technologies on its core target markets (inspection  surveillance  mapping)  supported by the high level of security provided by its equipment.The 20% growth in revenues from data analysis software (+14% at constant exchange rates) to €6.7m reflects the international development of the sales and marketing strategy and the continued increase in the number of users  for both the new business solutions launched at the start of 2020 and Pix4Dmapper  the flagship solution.Story continuesOutlook for 2022Realigned and driven by professional solutions at the forefront of innovation  Parrot is continuing to look ahead to 2022 with confidence in its strategy and vigilance concerning the changes in the international environment.The Group is continuing to allocate its resources to an ambitious R&D roadmap. Supported by its advances in the field of artificial intelligence and the growing integration between hardware and software  Parrot aims to continue facilitating the adoption of drone technologies and offer new use cases that are aligned with the needs of professionals  businesses and institutions  focused on (i) 3D Mapping  Geomatics and Inspection  (ii) Defense and Security  and (iii) Precision Farming.To secure its production capacity over the medium and long term  and respond to the growing interest in its microdrones at the start of this year  Parrot is further strengthening the synergies between R&D  procurement and production tracking. The increase in the resources allocated to these operations will be combined with an agile sourcing management approach. These transformational initiatives could limit the reduction in costs in 2022  and their efficiency and effectiveness are still strongly correlated with changes in the health context in China  where the situation is still disrupted at the start of this year.Looking beyond the disruption linked to the economic and geopolitical environment  which is difficult to predict  the Group plans to move forward with its roadmap for revenue growth on its “new scope” and capitalize on the opportunities opened up by the growing adoption of drone technologies in businesses and the public sector. The Group will continue to closely monitor the allocation of its cash  and will be ready to respond and adapt to potential changes in the conditions.Next financial datesParrot’s general shareholders’ meeting: Wednesday June 15  20222022 first-half earnings: Thursday July 28  2022ABOUT PARROTFounded in 1994 by Henri Seydoux  Parrot is today the leading European drone manufacturer in this rapidly expanding market.Visionary  at the forefront of innovation Parrot has a complementary range of equipment and software adapted to the needs of companies  large groups and government organizations.

In addition  the Electronic Labelling business activity was enhanced by combining its offering with those of OFFITAG and ASCAETIQ.Italy: +19.98% vs. Q1 2021.This Business Unit continues to benefit from solid business trends both with wholesaler-distributors (hardware sales and a significant contribution from ATHESIA customers integrated since July 1  2021) and pharmacies driven by the launch of European id. solutions (including notably the first installations of id.TAG  development of id.DESK  a new interactive and informationally rich dashboard or id.EASYQ for pharmacy queue management). In addition  the deployment of MultiMeds (manual pill dispenser) is expected to accelerate with the publication by the Italian government of measures introducing the generalisation of home care for chronic patients in rural areas.Story continuesBelgium: +22.72% vs. Q1 2021.Commercial activity is recovering along with recurring business  with this trend expected to continue in the coming quarters with the launch of the Labelling offering.Digital Communication Business Unit: +8.87% vs. Q1 2021.Maintaining the momentum of the last few months  this business confirms the trend of steady growth.The PHARMAGEST Division accounts for 72.98% of Equasens Group revenue (compared to 74.63% in 2021).AXIGATE LINK Division (formally the Health and Social Care Facilities Solutions) had revenue of €7.26m  up 2.78% from Q1 2021. The Hospital-at-Home ( HaH ) care sector : -12.44% vs. Q1 2021.Compared to Q1 2021  the HaH care sector marked a slowdown  notably in response to adjustments to license agreements. Despite this  the sector is benefiting from a strong commercial momentum  expected to accelerate with the first contracts under the French Digital Healthcare programme Ségur du Numérique en Santé and setting the stage for growth in revenue in the coming months.Nursing homes sector: +1.77% vs. Q1 2021.After the slowdown at the end of 2021  the Nursing home sector has displayed renewed commercial momentum  both in France and in Belgium. While Q1 2022 sales growth (+1.77%) was modest  strong order intake to date and the first commitments under the French Digital Healthcare programme Ségur du Numérique en Santé should contribute to significant improvements for this sector over the coming quarters.All the other sectors are up: Hospitals (+24.99%)  Health Establishments and Private Practice (+7.39%) and the Telemedicine Business Unit (+6.69%). As a reminder  the Telemedicine Business Unit includes the ETPLINK  eNephro and CARELIB EHPAD Nursing home programmes.

All the Division's other businesses are progressing: +11.69% for Compliance and +26.03% for the e-Connect Business Unit   which also got off to a good start for the year (advance purchases by customers at the end of 2020 during the health crisis to ensure sufficient stocks in Q1 2021 were not renewed at the end of 2021).The E-CONNECT Division accounts for 9.40% of Equasens Group revenue (compared to 8.33% in 2021).The FINTECH Division had revenue of €0.52m  down 20.12 % from Q1 2021. The investments at the end of 2021 strengthened the Division's commercial network by means of new partnerships. The effects of these commitments are expected to be seen in the coming months.The FINTECH Division accounts for 1.06% of Equasens Group revenue (compared to 1.45% in 2021).The new MEDICAL SOFT Division (currently consisting solely of PROKOV EDITIONS) recorded revenue of €0.92m. The launch of the “Ségur” digital offering should enable this new Division to meet the Group’s growth targets over the coming months.The MEDICAL SOFT Division accounts for 1.86% of Equasens Group revenue.Significant events occurring after 31 March 2022New GovernanceOn the proposal of the Chairman of the Board of Directors  Thierry CHAPUSOT  the Board of Directors which met in March adopted the following Executive Management changes:Dominique PAUTRAT stepped down from his position as CEO of Equasens Group to become Chairman of the Executive Board of La Coopérative WELCOOP  the parent company of Equasens Group;Denis SUPPLISSON   stepped down from his position as Executive Vice President and Director of the PHARMAGEST Division to become Chief Executive Officer of Equasens Group  replacing Dominique PAUTRAT  effective April 23  2022;Grégoire de ROTALIER  appointed in July 2020  will continue to serve as Deputy CEO  develop the AXIGATE LINK Division he manages  and contribute to the Group's cross-corporate projects.Name change now in effect:The Extraordinary General Meeting of the Shareholders held on 6 May at the company's headquarters adopted the resolution to change the company’s name to EQUASENS.This new name highlights the interoperability of solutions developed for patients and healthcare professionals and healthcare establishments while reinforcing the Group's ""Patient-Centred” positioning initiated over 10 years ago:EQUA refers to equation  and by extension the Group’s scientific origins  technology;SENS emphasizes the underlying meaning of its core mission: providing the right information  to the right caregiver  at the right time for the right patient.This new name thus provides a perfect fit with the Group's tagline “Technology for a more human experience”.“This name change from Pharmagest to Equasens better reflects the Group's new identity in terms of the diversity of its activities and new markets. Today  our Group is no longer solely a software publishing company also but a leading provider of healthcare solutions in Europe. For more than 10 years now  we have expanded our positioning focused on the pharmacy market to a provider of IT solutions to all healthcare professionals in France and tomorrow in Europe. This new name and visual identity embodies the Group’s new identity and direction as a multi-sector healthcare group monitoring the continuing changes in the industry  anticipating future developments and developing high added-value and increasingly interoperable healthcare solutions” commented Thierry CHAPUSOT  Chairman of the Board of Directors of Equasens Group.2022 O utlookThe Group is expecting growth momentum to remain on track  in line with the previous quarters  and confirms its goals for the upcoming months.The approval of its software solutions and the launch of funding (Wave 1) for the government's Digital Health programme Ségur du Numérique en Santé will consolidate this progress over the coming quarters and reinforce the Group's key position within the healthcare ecosystem.Financial calendar:Annual General Meeting 28 June 2022.

4778,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/volta-finance-limited-net-asset-161500150.html,Volta Finance Limited : Net Asset Value as at 30 April 2022,Volta Finance Limited (VTA / VTAS) – April 2022 monthly report NOT FOR RELEASE  DISTRIBUTION  OR PUBLICATION  IN WHOLE OR PART  IN OR INTO THE UNITED STATES ...,"Volta Finance LimitedVolta Finance Limited (VTA / VTAS) – April 2022 monthly reportNOT FOR RELEASE  DISTRIBUTION  OR PUBLICATION  IN WHOLE OR PART  IN OR INTO THE UNITED STATES*****Guernsey  12 May 2022AXA IM has published the Volta Finance Limited (the “Company” or “Volta Finance” or “Volta”) monthly report for April. The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYApril saw a continuation of the recovery from the losses experienced in February following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. During April  the fund gained 2.3% which leaves the year-to-date performance at +1.4%. Part of this good performance is due to the USD exposure in Volta (+1.6% contribution in April).Turning to the broad asset classes  the monthly performances** were: +0.8% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +0.9% for CLO equity tranches; +0.5% for CLO debt; +0.7% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (together representing 2.8% of NAV).Most markets were relatively flat in April including the US and the European loan markets. Relative to end-of-year levels  loan prices were down by roughly 1% in the US and 1.5% in Europe on average. Both markets are now 1% lower in terms of average prices.Our view is unchanged: we still think that we may see an increase in default rates: 1 to 2% for 2022 and 2 to 3% for 2023 seem reasonable expectations for both loan markets.With central banks fighting against inflation  we may see volatility continuing during the rest of the year. Given the significant weight of CLO Equities  the outlook for Volta mainly depends on the magnitude of positive impacts (purchasing loans at a discount and new loans at higher spreads) to compensate for the negative outcome coming from higher default rates.One clear and positive thing is the fact that most of Volta’s CLO Equity positions have been sourced  refinanced or reset in 2021 with a relatively low cost of debt and relatively long reinvestment periods. If loan spreads are to be higher for some time  we will benefit from the increase in the weighted average spread of the underlying loan pools while the cost of leverage has been fixed at a relatively low level.Story continuesFor the coming quarters  there are no signs that Volta may suffer from any diversion of cashflows from its CLO Equity positions. Receiving a continuing high level will allow us to take advantage of opportunities arising from the current market environment while paying a solid quarterly dividend.In April  Volta received the equivalent of €9.7m in terms of interest and coupons. For the 6 months ended April 2022  Volta received €22.5m interest and coupons representing a 17.0% annualized return on NAV.As at the end of April 2022  Volta’s NAV was €264.1m or €7.22 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 9.4% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 3.0% as at 31 March 2022  5.9% as at 31 January 2022  and 0.5% as at 31 December 2021.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas Securities Services S.C.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Group Solvency II ratio stands at 210%  reflecting the sale of Aegon’s businesses in Hungary and the deduction of both the previously announced debt tender offer and EUR 300 million share buybackAegon to engage with external parties to further explore the potential for a reinsurance transaction on parts of the US variable annuity portfolio. Aegon will assess if this could be value accretive to shareholders compared with the alternative of continued full ownership and active management of a de-risked variable annuity portfolioStatement of Lard Friese  CEO“The first three months of 2022 have been unprecedented in many ways. The Russian invasion in Ukraine has had a devastating impact on the lives of many people and fueled inflationary pressures and volatility on the global financial markets at a time that many economies were opening up after relaxing COVID-19 measures. I am proud of our colleagues who continued to effectively support and service our customers in a turbulent environment as evidenced by our results  and the substantial progress we made on our 2023 strategic and financial objectives.Story continuesWe continued sharpening our strategic focus and increasing our financial flexibility with the completion of the divestments of our businesses in Hungary and Turkey to Vienna Insurance Group  and the sale of part of our European venture fund. The closing of the sale of our Hungarian businesses resulted in an increase in Cash Capital at the Holding to EUR 1.8 billion. This enabled us to announce a EUR 300 million share buyback program and a further reduction of our debt  thereby reaching our deleveraging target range 1.5 years early.Furthermore  we are maintaining a high pace in maximizing the value of our Financial Assets. We took management actions to further reduce the sensitivity of our capital position to market movements in our Dutch Life and US variable annuity businesses. The progress we’ve made so far  enables us to now engage with external parties to further explore the potential for a reinsurance transaction on parts of the US variable annuity portfolio and assess if this could be value accretive to shareholders.As part of our strategy  we’re also reinvesting in our Strategic Assets to enhance our customer service and strengthen our ability to compete by expanding our distribution network. These investments resulted in higher sales and net deposits in our US life business  UK Retail business and the retirement businesses in our core markets. Our Global Asset Manager also continued its track record of positive third-party net deposits. In the US  we acquired TAG Resources  strengthening our competitive position in the pooled retirement plan market  which is a strategic growth driver. While COVID-19 mortality claims in the US continued to have an adverse impact  we saw our growth initiatives positively contribute to a solid first quarter 2022 operating result.Our responsibility extends well beyond achieving attractive financial returns. In line with our purpose of helping people live their best lives  we actively contribute to help protect our environment and society. In February  we made a significant donation to the Red Cross to aid the victims of the hostile attack on Ukraine and excluded future investments in Russia and Belarus-based companies. We also sharpened our Responsible Investment policy to further align our investments with our net-zero carbon commitment. Transamerica introduced an innovative retirement plan that offers participants access to ESG investments. Our progress is increasingly recognized by our external stakeholders  as evidenced by the Responsible Investor of the Year award Aegon Asset Management received at the Insurance Asset Risk Awards 2022.While global economic and geopolitical uncertainty remains  we are seeing the impact from COVID-19 subside and several central banks tightening their monetary policies to protect the economy and address rising inflation. Looking ahead  I am confident that the progress we are making on the execution of our strategy and the implementation of our operational improvement plan  as well as the actions we are taking to strengthen our balance sheet keep us on track for delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.”Dick Schiethart Jan Willem Weidema +31 (0) 6 22 88 99 25gcc@aegon.com +31 (0) 70 344 8028ir@aegon.comAdditional informationFor the official press release we refer to our corporate website.PresentationThe conference call presentation is available on aegon.com as of 7.30 a.m. CET.SupplementsAegon’s 1Q 2022 Financial Supplement and other supplementary documents are available on aegon.com.Conference call including Q&AThe conference call starts at 9:00 a.m. CET  with an audio webcast on aegon.com.

These non-IFRS-EU measures  except for addressable expenses  are calculated by consolidating on a proportionate basis Aegon’s joint ventures and associated companies. The reconciliation of these measures  except for market consistent value of new business and return on equity  to the most comparable IFRS-EU measure is provided in the notes to this press release. Market consistent value of new business is not based on IFRS-EU  which are used to report Aegon’s primary financial statements and should not be viewed as a substitute for IFRS-EU financial measures. Aegon may define and calculate market consistent value of new business differently than other companies. Return on equity is a ratio using a non-IFRS-EU measure and is calculated by dividing the operating result after tax less cost of leverage by the average shareholders’ equity excluding the revaluation reserve. Operating expenses are all expenses associated with selling and administrative activities (excluding commissions) after reallocation of claim handling expenses to benefits paid. This includes certain expenses recorded in other charges  including restructuring charges. Addressable expenses are expenses reflected in the operating result  excluding deferrable acquisition expenses  expenses in joint ventures and associates and expenses related to operations in CEE countries. Aegon believes that these non-IFRS-EU measures  together with the IFRS-EU information  provide meaningful supplemental information about the operating results of Aegon’s business including insight into the financial measures that senior management uses in managing the business.Local currencies and constant currency exchange ratesThis document contains certain information about Aegon’s results  financial condition and revenue generating investments presented in USD for the Americas and in GBP for the United Kingdom  because those businesses operate and are managed primarily in those currencies. Certain comparative information presented on a constant currency basis eliminates the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. None of this information is a substitute for or superior to financial information about Aegon presented in EUR  which is the currency of Aegon’s primary financial statements.Forward-looking statementsThe statements contained in this document that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

In the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in particular  the continued high level of housing supply has sustained intense competition between rental housing providers. SATO is investing strongly in its presence at SATO-owned properties and in developing personal service for customers.There are slight signs of the record-high rate of construction slowing. According to Statistics Finland  the number of building permits issued in November–January decreased by 15% year on year.The war in Ukraine has increased uncertainty relating to the development of the economy. The impacts of the war are reflected particularly in the surge in energy and materials prices and in the accelerating inflation.SATO’s House Expert model is now fully deployed in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area  Tampere and Turku. With the House Expert model  SATO aims to improve the customer service in the daily lives of its residents.The renovation of an apartment building started in Castréninkatu  Kallio  Helsinki in February and it is estimated to take around 18 months. SATO repairs its properties in accordance with the lifecycle principle and  when renovating properties  energy efficiency is also improved. The aim is to improve energy efficiency by around 30% compared to the pre-renovation level.Events after the review period: SATO sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in Lahti  Jyväskylä and Oulu region to Heimstaden. The divestment implements the SATO strategy to focus housing investments on the Helsinki Metropolitan area and its commuter area along the main railway line as well as on Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.I would like to thank SATO employees for their great work to ensure customer satisfaction and the comfort of our residents.Story continuesOperating environmentOver the reporting period  SATO’s operating environment was affected by the war in Ukraine  accelerating inflation and the continued high level of rental housing supply  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area.The first months of the year saw rapid economic growth as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. Russia’s attack on Ukraine in late February transformed the economic outlook. The biggest impacts are related to the surge in energy and materials prices and challenges in supply chains  which were already visible in the end of the year 2021. According to a Bank of Finland analysis of 11 March 2022  the war in Ukraine is increasing uncertainty over the outlook for Finland’s economy and will slow economic growth. The analysis projects that Finland’s economic growth will slow to 0.5%–2% in the current year. The uncertainty has resulted in a major decline in consumer confidence. According to the consumer confidence indicator published by Statistics Finland on 28 March 2022  consumers’ expectations concerning their own finances and especially the Finnish economy were very pessimistic.Inflation has continued to accelerate in early 2022. According to preliminary Eurostat data published on 1 April 2022  inflation in March was expected to be 7.5% in the euro area and 5.6% in Finland. The main component pushing prices up has been the surge in energy prices  which has accelerated after Russia's attack on Ukraine. The accelerating inflation has raised the overall interest rate level  and central banks have tightened their monetary policy to curb price increases. The US Federal Reserve approved its first interest rate hike in March  and the European Central Bank (ECB) announced it would scale down its securities purchase programme. Contrary to previous forecasts  inflation is anticipated to remain at a high level during 2022.The continued high level of housing supply particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area has maintained intense competition for good tenants between rental housing providers  which was reflected over the reporting period in SATO’s business as a decline in the economic occupancy rate and in a slight decrease in average rents year on year. However  with COVID-19 restrictions lifted and service-sector employment improving  demand for centrally located homes started to grow towards the end of the reporting period. There are slight signs of slowing in the record-high rate of construction that has been seen for a long period of time. According to Statistics Finland  the number of building permits issued in November–January decreased by 15% year on year.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental homes and the urbanisation trend continues. Dense urban housing with good access to public transport is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA)  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while at the same time Statistics Finland forecasts a downturn in the nationwide population trend in 2031. The HMA is projected to grow by more than 200 000 new residents by 2040. Almost 80% of HMA residents already live in households with one to two members  and the proportion of small households continues to grow. The proportion of immigrants is projected to increase in the HMA from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. The ageing population is moving to growth centres providing access to services and expects more and more housing-related services.The demographic change and the price development of owner-occupied homes create a stable foundation for demand for rental housing  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku. Outside growth centres  the real prices of homes are declining  which makes home ownership in a growth centre even more challenging for people coming from those areas.REVIEW PERIOD 1 January to 31 March 2022 (1 January to 31 March 2021)Net sales and profitIn January–March 2022  SATO Corporation’s consolidated net sales totalled EUR 74.7 million (74.0).Operating profit was EUR 117.9 million (67.9).

Since 2000  SATO has invested more than EUR 3 billion in non-subsidised rental apartments. SATO acquires and builds entire rental buildings and single rental apartments. Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments in Finland. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through renovation activities.Investments in rental apartments stood at EUR 23.7 million (16.9). The Helsinki Metropolitan Area represented 82.4% of all investments during the reporting period. New apartments accounted for 66.3% of the total. In addition  on 31 March 2022  there were binding purchase agreements to a total of EUR 131.3 million (76.8) in Finland.SATO repairs its properties in accordance with the lifecycle principle and  when renovating properties  energy efficiency is also improved. The aim is to improve energy efficiency by around 30% compared to the pre-renovation level. In February saw the commencement of the renovation of an apartment building in Castréninkatu  Kallio  Helsinki  which is estimated to take around 18 months. The renovation will involve the full refurbishment of the kitchens  bathrooms and other living areas of the apartments. In addition  the property’s staircases and corridors will be painted and the water and drain pipes as well as electrical and building automation and control systems will be replaced. The natural ventilation of the apartment building will be replaced by centralised supply and exhaust ventilation with heat recovery. The building’s apartment distribution will change  and the renovated building will feature 95 homes  which is five more than before the project. The exteriors and roof of the building already underwent refurbishment in 2016.The renovation of a total of 300 rental homes in Helsinki Kontula and Pihlajamäki was completed during the review period.

Transaction was closed 25 April 2022. The properties sold in this transaction are located in Hämeenlinna  Jyväskylä  Lahti  Oulu  Vihti and Ylöjärvi. The lease agreements will be transferred to the buyer as they are in the transaction.The divestment implements the SATO strategy to focus housing investments on the Helsinki Metropolitan area and its commuter area along the main railway line as well as on Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities. The properties sold are mostly located outside the growth centres covered by the strategy.Short-term risks and uncertaintiesRisk management is used to ensure that risks impacting the company’s business are identified  managed and monitored. The main risks of SATO’s business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.The war in Ukraine is a short-term risk affecting the operating environment  the duration and impacts of which on the Finnish economy are difficult to estimate. The war’s biggest impacts have been seen in energy  food and materials prices as well as supply chains. An increase in energy  food and consumer goods prices may slow economic growth  considerably increase the interest rate level  and have a negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers as well as on their capacity to fulfil their obligations. Such a decline in the economy or economic activity may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  finance costs or value of SATO-owned properties.The highest risks in apartment rental are to do with cyclical movements and changes in supply and demand. The market risk may push the supply of rental homes higher than their demand. This would result in idle rental housing stock and pressure for the rent level to level off or fall  especially as regards old housing stock.A decline in the housing market may have a negative effect on the market value of SATO’s housing stock. In line with its refined strategy  SATO has been focusing in its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing existing housing stock and  consequently  ensuring the rentability and value development of the apartments.Changes in regulation by the authorities and in legislation and related uncertainty may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and  consequently  on SATO’s business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group’s treasury policy. Our risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy adopted by SATO’s Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other financing commitments. In 2019  the company established an EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Programme under which SATO has issued bonds in the total amount of EUR 1 050.0 million.The means for managing the liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  EUR 700 million in committed credit facilities and a EUR 400 million commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans form an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by fixed rate debt arrangements or interest rate derivatives. In accordance with our treasury policy  our aim is for fixed-rate loans  including interest rate derivatives  to account for more than 60% of our debt portfolio.SATO currently has 522 apartments in St Petersburg. Investments in Russia commenced in 2007. The last investment decision was made in 2013 and the property was completed in 2016. There are risks related to the business environment in our St. Petersburg operations  including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk  with related hedging options examined in accordance with our treasury policy. SATO will refrain from making new investments in Russia. Following the start of the war in Ukraine  the company has looked into opportunities to exit the business in Russia. According to the explorations  a speedy exit is not possible  which is why SATO will continue to rent out the homes in St Petersburg for the time being. It is expected that the operating environment in Russia will be highly uncertain for a long period of time and could result in disruptions to SATO's business activities in Russia and with parties related to Russia  the ability to make payments to its suppliers  employees and authorities as well as to receive payments from its customers  which could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on SATO's business in Russia and even result in SATO limiting or ceasing its operations in Russia and with parties related to Russia for a long period of time. Should the war in Ukraine be prolonged  carrying out business in Russia may have negative impacts on the company’s reputation and may hamper business in Finland or have adverse effects on the company’s ability to access finance in the market  which may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  finance costs or value of SATO-owned properties.For a broader description of risks and risk management  see the Group’s website and Annual Report for 2021 at www.sato.fi/en.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO’s business activities are mainly affected by the urbanisation trend  competitive situation  interest rate level  consumer confidence  the development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  and housing policies. The war in Ukraine that broke out in February and the resulting acceleration of inflation have brought a great deal of uncertainty to the economic outlook.The first months of the year saw rapid economic growth as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. Russia’s attack on Ukraine in late February transformed the economic outlook. The biggest impacts are related to the surge in energy and materials prices and challenges in supply chains  which were already visible in the end of the year 2021. According to a Bank of Finland analysis of 11 March 2022  the war in Ukraine is increasing uncertainty over the outlook for Finland’s economy and will slow economic growth. The analysis projects that Finland’s economic growth will slow to 0.5%–2% in the current year. The uncertainty has resulted in a major decline in consumer confidence. According to the consumer confidence indicator published by Statistics Finland on 28 March 2022  consumers’ expectations concerning their own finances and especially the Finnish economy were very pessimistic.Inflation has continued to accelerate in early 2022. According to preliminary Eurostat data published on 1 April 2022  inflation in March was expected to be 7.5% in the euro area and 5.6% in Finland. The main component pushing prices up has been the surge in energy prices  which has accelerated after Russia's attack on Ukraine. The accelerating inflation has raised the overall interest rate level  and central banks have tightened their monetary policy to curb price increases. The US Federal Reserve approved its first interest rate hike in March  and the European Central Bank (ECB) announced it would scale down its securities purchase programme. Contrary to previous forecasts  inflation is anticipated to remain at a high level during 2022. High inflation increases the interest rate level and  consequently  SATO’s finance costs. The abundant supply of rental homes prevents the transfer of higher costs caused by inflation fully to rents.The continued high level of housing supply particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area has maintained intense competition for good tenants between rental housing providers. However  with COVID-19 restrictions lifted and service-sector employment improving  demand for centrally located homes started to grow towards the end of the reporting period. There are signs of slowing in the record-high rate of construction that has been seen for a long period of time.With the increased choice available for those looking for a home  the role of a successful customer experience has become even more important. SATO is investing strongly in increasing its presence close to customers and in digital services.SATO Corporation’s shareholders on 31 March 2022Largest shareholders and their holdingsBalder Finska Otas Ab / Fastighets Ab Balder31 754 24555.9% Stichting Depositary APG Strategic Real Estate Pool12 811 647 22.6% Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company7 233 081 12.7% State Pension Fund2 796 200 4.9% Valkila Erkka385 000 0.7% Research Foundation of the Pulmonary Diseases227 000 0.4% SATO Corporation166 000 0.3% Entelä Tuula159 000 0.3% Heinonen Erkki 156 684 0.3% Tradeka-invest Ltd 126 500 0.2% Others (116 shareholders) 967 710 1.7%On 31 March 2022  SATO had 56 783 067 shares and 126 shareholders registered in the book-entry system.

We therefore remain focused on bringing this important product to patients  as we continue to increase our planned pre- launch activities and expect to be able to launch leniolisib in the US  subject to regulatory approval  in Q1 2023  followed by launches in the EU markets  subject to regulatory approval  starting in H2 2023.These activities include continuing to identify potential APDS patients eligible for treatment with leniolisib. In the US and Canada  this is through our partnership with Invitae and the navigateAPDS program  which will offer immunologists in these regions access to free genetic testing for primary immune deficiency patients exhibiting APDS symptoms. In Europe  we are intensifying our patient identification efforts together with leading immunology centers of excellence treating patients with APDS and other rare immune deficiencies. We are also actively collaborating with patient organizations to create awareness  advocacy and education for APDS patients and their families.Our investment in leniolisib has been made possible by the underlying strength of our business  and we are pleased to report a marked increase in revenue growth for the first quarter of the year driven by ongoing new patient enrollment and product demand for RUCONEST®. This growth is despite some continued impact of COVID-19 on a number of medical practices in the US  especially pertaining to the time it takes for the administrative processing and approval of prescriptions.""OutlookFor the remainder of 2022  the Company anticipates:Single digit growth in Group revenues from RUCONEST® sales  driven by the US and expanded EU operations  subject to the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarterly fluctuations in revenues are expected.The submission of leniolisib regulatory filings to FDA and EMA  with commercial launch expected from early Q1 2023 onwards  subject to regulatory approvals.The company will invest in this new product opportunity to accelerate future growth. Investments in launch preparations and focused clinical development for leniolisib will significantly increase and will significantly impact profit. With continued cash flow from RUCONEST® to fund these investments  no additional financing to support the current business is expected.Focused investment in potential acquisitions and in-licensing of new late-stage development opportunities and assets in rare diseases. Financing  if required  would come via a combination of our strong balance sheet and access to capital markets.Continued focus on our strategic development  ensuring Pharming's growth through developed assets and a potentially expanded pipeline of in-licensed products to provide further life-saving therapies for patients with unmet medical needs and increase returns for our shareholders.No further specific financial guidance for 2022 is provided.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

""This brings us in a good position for the ongoing review of strategic options for the company  while we continue to focus on seeking an approval in the United States for our lead product candidate eryaspase (GRASPA) for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemiapatients who experienced hypersensitivities to pegylated asparaginase.""Business Highlights of the first quarter and April 2022U.S. cell therapy manufacturing facility sold to Catalent for a total consideration of USD 44.5 millionUnder the terms of an asset purchase agreement between ERYTECH and Catalent (the ""APA"")  Catalent acquired ERYTECH's state-of-the-art commercial-scale cell therapy manufacturing facility in Princeton  New Jersey  for a total consideration of $44.5 million. ERYTECH's staff at the site of approximately 40 people have been offered Catalent's employment.The parties also agreed on the terms of a long-term supply agreement  under which Catalent will manufacture ERYTECH's lead product candidate eryaspase (GRASPA) for clinical and commercial supply in the United States.The Princeton facility is a 30 900 square foot modern manufacturing facility  designed with the flexibility to expand to support various cell therapy production requirements and capacities. Catalent intends to expand the Princeton site and leverage the experienced staff previously employed by ERYTECH to manufacture a broader portfolio of cell therapies. ERYTECH retained its manufacturing site in Lyon  France and its expertise and capabilities in manufacturing process science to continue innovating in cell therapy manufacturing.Path to BLA in hypersensitive ALL  based on results of NOPHO-sponsored Phase 2 trialThe NOPHO trial evaluated the safety and pharmacological profile of eryaspase in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who had previously experienced hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase therapy. In December 2020  positive trial results were presented at the 2020 American Society of Hematology annual meeting.The Company pursues its interactions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding a potential regulatory approval in this indication based on the NOPHO-sponsored trial. A pre-BLA meeting to discuss the submission of a Biologics License Application (BLA) took place in June 2021 after which the Company confirmed its intention to submit a BLA  subject to successful completion of remaining activities.The BLA application is now almost completed  and the Company is planning for submission once the FDA has finalized its review of the remaining information requests.rESPECT  Phase 1 investigator-sponsored trial (IST) in first-line pancreatic cancerrESPECT is a Phase 1 trial  sponsored by the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center  evaluating the safety of eryaspase in combination with mFOLFIRINOX as a first-line treatment for locally advanced and metastatic pancreatic cancer in approximately 18 patients.Interim data  presented at ASCO GI in January 2022  confirmed the acceptable safety profile in the trial and showed encouraging clinical activity. Out of the twelve patients enrolled  ten patients have been evaluated for response. They all achieved disease control; five patients had an objective response and five achieved stable disease.The trial will continue enrolling up to approximately 18 patients. Reporting of data is expected in the third quarter of 2022.ERYCEVTM  novel red blood cell vesiculation technologyERYTECH presented its red blood cell vesiculation technology at the 24th Meeting of the European Red Cell Society (ERCS) in April 2022.RBC-derived extracellular vesicles are formed naturally during senescence and storage of mature RBCs and are a potentially attractive drug delivery system. Vesiculation of RBCs that have already been loaded with active therapeutic compounds utilizing the ERYCAPS process  entails the potential of producing cargo-loaded RBC-derived extracellular vesicles for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.Process to review strategic options and partnering alternativesAs announced on October 25th 2021  the Company has appointed a specialized advisor to evaluate its strategic and partnering options. After the transaction with Catalent  the Company continues to evaluate further strategic options to leverage its ERYCAPS platform with complementary assets and/or a broader corporate transaction.Q1 2022 Financial ResultsKey financial figures for the first quarter of 2022 compared with the same period of the previous year are summarized below:In thousands of euros Q1 2022(3 months) Q1 2021(3 months) Revenues - - Other income 539 1 440 Operating income 539 1 440 Research and development (8 116) (10 512) General and administrative (4 938) (4 173) Operating expenses (13 054) (14 685) Operating loss (12 515) (13 245) Financial income 841 2 047 Financial expenses (236) (747) Financial income (net) 605 1 300 Income tax - - Net loss (11 911) (11 945)Net loss for the first quarter of 2022 was €11.9 million  stable year-over-year  with a €0.7 million improvement (-5.5%) in operating loss and a €0.7 million decline in net financial income. The €0.7 million improvement in operating loss was attributable to the €2.4 million decrease in preclinical and clinical development expenses  offset in part by the €0.9 million decrease in other income from R&D tax credits  both reflecting the decrease in the Company's clinical development activities  while general and administrative expenses increased by €0.8 million  mostly related to legal and due diligence expenses for partnering activities.As of March 31  2022  ERYTECH had cash and cash equivalents totaling €25.1 million (approximately $27.9 million)  compared with €33.7 million as of December 31  2021. The €8.6 million decrease in cash position during the first three months of 2022 was the result of a €10.7 million net cash utilization in operating activities and investing activities and €1.8 million generated in financing activities  including €2.3 million in pre-payment of a portion of the expected 2021 R&D tax credit  while the variation of the U.S. dollar against the euro led to a €0.3 million positive currency exchange impact.The Company has not drawn any new tranche on the convertible note facility (OCABSA) since August 2021 and as of September 2021  there were no outstanding and unconverted notes. The company does not plan to draw any further OCABSA tranche until the expiration of the financing facility in June 2022.The Company believes that its current cash position  including the $44.5 million gross proceeds received upon closing of the transaction with Catalent in April 2022  can fund its current development programs and planned operating expenses to mid-2024.Key News Flow and Milestones Expected Over the Next 12 MonthsTargeted BLA submission of eryaspase in hypersensitive ALL (Q3 2022)Results from the Phase 1 rESPECT trial of eryaspase in combination with mFOLFIRINOX in first-line pancreatic cancer (Q3 2022)Data from the randomized Phase 2 TRYbeCA-2 trial of eryaspase in TNBC (Q3 2022)First Quarter 2022 Conference Call DetailsERYTECH management will hold a conference call and webcast on Friday  May 13  2022  at 8:30am ET / 2:30 pm CEST on the business highlights and financial results for the quarter ended March 31  2022.

Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS platform  which uses a novel technology to encapsulate drug substances inside red blood cells  ERYTECH is developing a pipeline of product candidates for patients with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH's primary focus is on the development of product candidates that target the altered metabolism of cancer cells by depriving them of amino acids necessary for their growth and survival.The Company's lead product candidate  eryaspase (GRASPA)  which consists of L-asparaginase encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells  targets the cancer cells' altered asparagine and glutamine metabolism. The proof of concept of eryaspase as a cancer metabolism agent was established in different trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and pancreatic cancer. An investigator sponsored Phase 2 trial (IST) evaluating the use of eryaspase in ALL patients who developed hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase recently reported positive results  based on which the Company intends to request approval in the United States and potentially other territories. The Company is also pursuing a Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial in first-line pancreatic cancer.Eryaspase received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who have developed hypersensitivity reactions to E. coli-derived pegylated asparaginase. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency have granted eryaspase orphan drug status for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and ALL. Eryaspase is not an approved medicine.ERYTECH produces its product candidates for treatment of patients in Europe at its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France  and expects to be able to produce for patients in the United States through an anticipated long-term supply agreement with Catalent  operating from ERYTECH's former GMP facility in Princeton  New Jersey  USA.ERYTECH is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States (ticker: ERYP) and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0011471135  ticker: ERYP).

All statements contained in this press release other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements  including  without limitation  statements regarding ERYTECH's business strategy and its evaluation of potential strategic transactions; the timing for reporting data from clinical trials; the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones; ERYTECH's anticipated manufacturing capacity and ability to meet future demand  including the anticipated long-term supply agreement with Catalent  and ERYTECH's anticipated cash runway and sufficiency of cash resources. Such statements  forecasts and estimates are based on various assumptions and assessments of known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  which were deemed reasonable when made but may or may not prove to be correct. Actual events are difficult to predict and may depend upon factors that are beyond ERYTECH's control. Therefore  actual results may turn out to be materially different from the anticipated future results  performance or achievements expressed or implied by such statements  forecasts and estimates. Important factors that could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements include  among others  the following: (1) the failure to achieve certain regulatory and commercial milestones; (2) the inability to maintain the listing of ERYTECH's shares on the Nasdaq Global Select market and the Euronext regulated market; (3) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (4) the possibility that ERYTECH may be adversely affected by other economic  business and/or competitive factors; (5) the inability to agree to terms on a long-term supply agreement with Catalent; and (6) other risks and uncertainties indicated from time to time in ERYTECH's regulatory filings. Further description of these risks  uncertainties and other risks can be found in the Company's regulatory filings with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF)  the Company's Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and reports  including in the Company's 2021 Universal Registration Document (Document d'EnregistrementUniversel) filed with the AMF on April 27  2022 and in the Company's Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on April 28  2022 and future filings and reports by the Company.

After the transaction with Catalent  the Company continues to evaluate further strategic options to leverage its ERYCAPS® platform with complementary assets and/or a broader corporate transaction.ADVERTISEMENTQ1 2022 Financial ResultsKey financial figures for the first quarter of 2022 compared with the same period of the previous year are summarized below:In thousands of euros Q1 2022(3 months) Q1 2021(3 months) Revenues — — Other income 539 1 440 Operating income 539 1 440 Research and development (8 116) (10 512) General and administrative (4 938) (4 173) Operating expenses (13 054) (14 685) Operating loss (12 515) (13 245) Financial income 841 2 047 Financial expenses (236) (747) Financial income (net) 605 1 300 Income tax - - Net loss (11 911) (11 945)Net loss for the first quarter of 2022 was €11.9 million  stable year-over-year  with a €0.7 million improvement (-5.5%) in operating loss and a €0.7 million decline in net financial income. The €0.7 million improvement in operating loss was attributable to the €2.4 million decrease in preclinical and clinical development expenses  offset in part by the €0.9 million decrease in other income from R&D tax credits  both reflecting the decrease in the Company’s clinical development activities  while general and administrative expenses increased by €0.8 million  mostly related to legal and due diligence expenses for partnering activities.As of March 31  2022  ERYTECH had cash and cash equivalents totaling €25.1 million (approximately $27.9 million)  compared with €33.7 million as of December 31  2021. The €8.6 million decrease in cash position during the first three months of 2022 was the result of a €10.7 million net cash utilization in operating activities and investing activities and €1.8 million generated in financing activities  including €2.3 million in pre-payment of a portion of the expected 2021 R&D tax credit  while the variation of the U.S. dollar against the euro led to a €0.3 million positive currency exchange impact.ADVERTISEMENTThe Company has not drawn any new tranche on the convertible note facility (OCABSA) since August 2021 and as of September 2021  there were no outstanding and unconverted notes. The company does not plan to draw any further OCABSA tranche until the expiration of the financing facility in June 2022.The Company believes that its current cash position  including the $44.5 million gross proceeds received upon closing of the transaction with Catalent in April 2022  can fund its current development programs and planned operating expenses to mid-2024.Key News Flow and Milestones Expected Over the Next 12 MonthsTargeted BLA submission of eryaspase in hypersensitive ALL (Q3 2022)Results from the Phase 1 rESPECT trial of eryaspase in combination with mFOLFIRINOX in first-line pancreatic cancer (Q3 2022)Data from the randomized Phase 2 TRYbeCA-2 trial of eryaspase in TNBC (Q3 2022)First Quarter 2022 Conference Call DetailsERYTECH management will hold a conference call and webcast on Friday  May 13  2022  at 8:30am ET / 2:30 pm CEST on the business highlights and financial results for the quarter ended March 31  2022.

Leveraging its proprietary ERYCAPS® platform  which uses a novel technology to encapsulate drug substances inside red blood cells  ERYTECH is developing a pipeline of product candidates for patients with high unmet medical needs. ERYTECH’s primary focus is on the development of product candidates that target the altered metabolism of cancer cells by depriving them of amino acids necessary for their growth and survival.The Company’s lead product candidate  eryaspase (GRASPA®)  which consists of L-asparaginase encapsulated inside donor-derived red blood cells  targets the cancer cells’ altered asparagine and glutamine metabolism. The proof of concept of eryaspase as a cancer metabolism agent was established in different trials in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and pancreatic cancer. An investigator sponsored Phase 2 trial (IST) evaluating the use of eryaspase in ALL patients who developed hypersensitivity reactions to pegylated asparaginase recently reported positive results  based on which the Company intends to request approval in the United States and potentially other territories. The Company is also pursuing a Phase 1 investigator-sponsored clinical trial in first-line pancreatic cancer.Eryaspase received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer and treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients who have developed hypersensitivity reactions to E. coli-derived pegylated asparaginase. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency have granted eryaspase orphan drug status for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and ALL. Eryaspase is not an approved medicine.ERYTECH produces its product candidates for treatment of patients in Europe at its GMP-approved manufacturing site in Lyon  France  and expects to be able to produce for patients in the United States through an anticipated long-term supply agreement with Catalent  operating from ERYTECH’s former GMP facility in Princeton  New Jersey  USA.ERYTECH is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market in the United States (ticker: ERYP) and on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN code: FR0011471135  ticker: ERYP). ERYTECH is part of the CAC Healthcare  CAC Pharma & Bio  CAC Mid & Small  CAC All Tradable  EnterNext PEA-PME 150 and Next Biotech indexes.For more information  please visit www.erytech.comCONTACTSERYTECHEric SoyerCFO & COO NewCapMathilde Bohin / Louis-Victor DelouvrierInvestor relationsNicolas MerigeauMedia relations+33 4 78 74 44 38investors@erytech.com+33 1 44 71 94 94erytech@newcap.euForward-looking informationThis press release contains forward-looking statements  forecasts and estimates with respect to the clinical results from and the development plans of eryaspase  business and regulatory strategy  expansion of manufacturing capacity and anticipated future performance of ERYTECH and of the market in which it operates.
