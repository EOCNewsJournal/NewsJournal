Our state has some incredible trails  waterfalls  and lakes to enjoy.From the Pine Barrens to the Appalachian Trail to the hidden gems of New Jersey  you have plenty of options for a great hike. Hiking is such a great way to spend time outdoors and enjoy nature  plus it's a great workout.Before you go out on the trails and explore some of our listeners' suggestions  I have some tips on hiking etiquette from the American Hiking Society.If you are going downhill and run into an uphill hiker  step to the side and give the uphill hiker space. A hiker going uphill has the right of way unless they stop to catch their breath.Always stay on the trail  you may see side paths  unless they are marked as an official trail  steer clear of them. By going off-trail you may cause damage to the ecosystems around the trail  the plants  and wildlife that live there.You also do not want to disturb the wildlife you encounter  just keep your distance from the wildlife and continue hiking.Bicyclists should yield to hikers and horses. Hikers should also yield to horses  but I‚Äôm not sure how many horses you will encounter on the trails in New Jersey. If you are thinking of bringing your dog on your hike  they should be leashed  and make sure to clean up all pet waste.Lastly  be mindful of the weather  if the trail is too muddy  it's probably best to save your hike for another day.I asked our listeners for their suggestions of the best hiking spots in New Jersey  check out their suggestions:,negative,0.01,0.04,0.95,mixed,0.31,0.09,0.61,True,English,"['Missing NJ teens', 'Jackson police', 'pickup truck', 'Ocean County Juvenile Detention Center', 'gray 2007 Ford F150 pickup', 'average property tax bill', 'two male teenagers', 'interactive map version', '2021 NJ property taxes', 'North Boston Road', 'best hiking spots', 'American Hiking Society', 'uphill hiker space', 'average bill', 'juvenile complaint', 'pickup truck', 'Clearstream Road', 'hiking etiquette', 'group home', 'Tuesday afternoon', 'red tailgate', 'suspicious incident', 'Further investigation', 'Asbury Park', 'false names', 'younger teen', 'family member', 'outstanding warrant', 'New Jersey', 'full analysis', 'Food history', 'product innovations', 'major recalls', 'government sources', 'populated municipalities', 'Pine Valley', 'Pine Hill', 'Pine Barrens', 'hidden gems', 'great workout', 'pet waste', 'Township police', 'alphabetical list', 'smallest towns', 'great way', 'side paths', 'incredible trails', 'Appalachian Trail', 'great hike', 'official trail', 'many horses', 'Jackson police', 'Erin Vogt', ""listeners' suggestions"", 'Holmdel', 'custody', 'vehicle', 'Officers', 'patrol', 'cul-de-sac', 'description', 'Monday', 'teens', 'duo', 'apprehension', 'stolen', '15-year', 'old', 'violation', 'probation', 'reporter', 'anchor', 'townsquaremedia', 'editor', 'feedback', 'correction', 'municipality', 'others', 'LOOK', 'Stacker', 'news', 'population', '2020 Census', '21 residents', 'start', 'trip', 'beach', 'state', 'waterfalls', 'lakes', 'plenty', 'options', 'time', 'nature', 'tips', 'right', 'breath', 'damage', 'ecosystems', 'plants', 'wildlife', 'distance', 'Bicyclists', 'hikers', 'dog', 'weather']",2022-05-12,2022-05-13,nj1015.com

(""Pharming"" or ""the Company"") (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM) (Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its (unaudited) financial report for the first quarter of the year ended 31 March 2022.Pharming Group N.V. logoThe Company will hold an analyst conference call at 13.30 CET/07.30 EST today.

This increase is a combination of launch preparation for leniolisib  increased travel expenses post-COVID-19 and phasing of costs.Net profit of US$3.5 million decreased 59% (Q1 2021: US$8.5 million). The decrease was caused as a result of a significant decrease in finance income from US$6.6 million in Q1 2021 to US$1.8 million in Q1 2022  mainly due to more favorable exchange rate gains in Q1 2021. The remainder of the decrease relates to the increased operating expenses  partly offset by the growth in gross profit.Positive cash flows from operations amounted to US$0.6 million in Q1 2022. Cash and cash equivalents decreased by US$2.3 million to US$189.7 million from US$191.9 million at the end of Q4 2021.Operational highlightsStory continuesBoth co-primary endpoints met in Phase II/III pivotal clinical study of leniolisib for the treatment of PI3K delta syndrome (APDS)  a rare primary immunodeficiency disease. Submission of global regulatory filings for leniolisib subsequently planned to begin in Q2 2022  with US launch expected in Q1 2023 and European launch in H2 2023  subject to regulatory approvals.Positive decision received from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and  post-period  the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)  on the Pediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for leniolisib as a treatment for APDS in children  which provides a regulatory pathway to market authorization in Europe and the UK  respectively. The leniolisib PIP includes two planned global clinical trials in pediatric patients with APDS. The Company expects to initiate recruitment for this pediatric program for leniolisib during the second half of 2022.Post-period operational highlightsPrincipal Investigator V. Koneti Rao  M.D.  a staff physician in the Primary Immune Deficiency Clinic at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda  Maryland  shared findings from the pivotal Phase II/III clinical trial of leniolisib for the treatment of APDS demonstrating the reduction in APDS disease markers in patients treated with leniolisib in a presentation at the Clinical Immunology Society (CIS) 2022 Annual Meeting.Granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) designation for leniolisib for the treatment of ADPS from the MHRA. A PIM designation indicates that a medicinal product is a promising candidate for the MHRA's Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS)  which provides pre-market access to products that are intended for the treatment  diagnosis  or prevention of a life-threatening or seriously debilitating condition and have the potential to address an unmet medical need.One-off payment of US$7.5 million received following Pharming's change in holding in BioConnection BV  the Company's long-term fill and finish partner for RUCONEST¬Æ. Pharming retains a 22.98% holding in BioConnection following an acquisition of a majority stake in BioConnection by European investment company Gimv. Pharming continues to support BioConnection to accelerate its growth strategy together with its other shareholders.Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries  commented:""The first quarter of 2022 was a key moment in the Company's history following the report of positive data for leniolisib in a pivotal study in patients with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome  a complex and progressive rare primary immunodeficiency disease with limited treatment options. We therefore remain focused on bringing this important product to patients  as we continue to increase our planned pre- launch activities and expect to be able to launch leniolisib in the US  subject to regulatory approval  in Q1 2023  followed by launches in the EU markets  subject to regulatory approval  starting in H2 2023.These activities include continuing to identify potential APDS patients eligible for treatment with leniolisib. In the US and Canada  this is through our partnership with Invitae and the navigateAPDS program  which will offer immunologists in these regions access to free genetic testing for primary immune deficiency patients exhibiting APDS symptoms. In Europe  we are intensifying our patient identification efforts together with leading immunology centers of excellence treating patients with APDS and other rare immune deficiencies. We are also actively collaborating with patient organizations to create awareness  advocacy and education for APDS patients and their families.Our investment in leniolisib has been made possible by the underlying strength of our business  and we are pleased to report a marked increase in revenue growth for the first quarter of the year driven by ongoing new patient enrollment and product demand for RUCONEST¬Æ. This growth is despite some continued impact of COVID-19 on a number of medical practices in the US  especially pertaining to the time it takes for the administrative processing and approval of prescriptions.""OutlookFor the remainder of 2022  the Company anticipates:Single digit growth in Group revenues from RUCONEST¬Æ sales  driven by the US and expanded EU operations  subject to the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarterly fluctuations in revenues are expected.The submission of leniolisib regulatory filings to FDA and EMA  with commercial launch expected from early Q1 2023 onwards  subject to regulatory approvals.The company will invest in this new product opportunity to accelerate future growth. Investments in launch preparations and focused clinical development for leniolisib will significantly increase and will significantly impact profit. With continued cash flow from RUCONEST¬Æ to fund these investments  no additional financing to support the current business is expected.Focused investment in potential acquisitions and in-licensing of new late-stage development opportunities and assets in rare diseases. Financing  if required  would come via a combination of our strong balance sheet and access to capital markets.Continued focus on our strategic development  ensuring Pharming's growth through developed assets and a potentially expanded pipeline of in-licensed products to provide further life-saving therapies for patients with unmet medical needs and increase returns for our shareholders.No further specific financial guidance for 2022 is provided.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

Recent months have seen meaningful progress on the commercial front in particular with the successful commercialization of EUTELSAT QUANTUM. Elsewhere  our global distribution agreement with OneWeb to address key connectivity verticals enhances the competitive position of both companies and represents a first step towards the development of combined GEO/LEO solutions. Overall  revenues at the Nine Month stage are in line with our expectations  and we confirm all our financial objectives.‚ÄùHIGHLIGHTSThird Quarter operating vertical revenues of ‚Ç¨285m  broadly stable (-0.7%) quarter-on-quarter.Improvement in Broadcast revenue trend (-6.8% year-on-year in the Third Quarter after -8.6% in the second quarter) with Third Quarter revenues broadly stable (-0.8%) relative to the Second Quarter.Robust double-digit growth for both Fixed Broadband and Mobile Connectivity in the Third Quarter  at respectively circa plus 30% and plus 25% year-on-year  highlighting the significant potential in Connectivity.Strong progress in the commercialization of EUTELSAT QUANTUM with six beams (out of eight) already sold after six months of operation and the entire capacity expected to be fully sold in the coming months.Global distribution partnership secured with OneWeb to address key connectivity verticals  deepening cooperation and showcasing operational synergies between the two companies.Nine Month Operating Verticals of ‚Ç¨853m down 4.0% year-on-year and in line with expectations  enabling us to reiterate our objective for the Full Year of between ‚Ç¨1 110 million and ‚Ç¨1 130 million4.All other financial objectives also confirmed.THIRD QUARTER REVENUES5Total revenues for the Third Quarter stood at ‚Ç¨287 million down 4.8% on a reported basis and by 2.7% like-for-like.Revenues of the five Operating Verticals (ie  excluding ‚ÄòOther Revenues‚Äô) stood at ‚Ç¨285 million. They were down by 3.5% on a like-for-like basis excluding a negative perimeter effect of circa three points from the disposal of Euro Broadband Infrastructure (EBI) on 30 April 2021 and a positive currency effect of circa three points.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues of the five Operating Verticals were down by 0.7% like-for-like.Unless otherwise stated  all variations indicated hereunder are on a like-for-like basis  ie  at constant currency and perimeter.Broadcast (61% of revenues)Third Quarter Broadcast revenues amounted to ‚Ç¨173 million  down 6.8% year-on-year  representing an improvement in trend relative to the Second Quarter (-8.6% year-on-year). The revenue decline reflected predominantly the effect of the partial renewal of capacity with Nilesat at 7/8¬∞West  which is not offset by the resale of this capacity  and elsewhere  a slight erosion in the underlying business in Europe. Excluding the 7/8¬∞West impact  Broadcast revenues experienced a low-single-digit decline.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were broadly stable with the slight  -0.8%  erosion reflecting the carry-forward effect of the above-mentioned 7/8¬∞West headwind which impacted revenues from mid-October onwards. Revenues were flat excluding this item.Revenues are expected to remain broadly stable in the Fourth Quarter relative to the Third Quarter.Data & Professional Video (14% of revenues)Third Quarter Data & Professional Video revenues stood at ‚Ç¨40 million  down by 2.7% year-on-year.In Fixed Data  which represents two thirds of this application  improved volume trends are now offsetting most of the negative impact of competitive pressure.The Professional Video revenues trend saw a slight uptick  reflecting the phasing of a specific contract which is beneficial to the Second Half but neutral over the Full Year  as well as growth of occasional use.Quarter-on-quarter revenues were stable reflecting notably the above-mentioned Professional Video tailwind as well as the broad stabilization of Fixed Data.On the commercial front  a multi-year agreement was signed with Tuvalu Telecommunications Corporation for connectivity on the EUTELSAT 172B satellite to support the extension of corporate networks for government offices and businesses of the Tuvalu Islands.We expect this application to decline at a mid-single digit pace over the Full Fiscal Year  consistent with previous indications.Government Services (12% of revenues)Third Quarter Government Services revenues stood at ‚Ç¨35 million  down 11.3% year-on-year. This reflected the negative carry-forward effect of US Government renewals  driven by the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan with in particular a renewal rate of only 75% in Fall 2021  as well as the end of life in stable orbit of EUTELSAT 174A.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were down by 8.0% with the full effect of Fall 2021 renewals now in the quarterly base.On the commercial front  as anticipated in February  the latest renewal campaign with the US Government (Spring 2022) resulted in a below-average renewal rate estimated at above 70% reflecting the continued impact of the geopolitical context in the Middle East. Elsewhere  the commercialisation of EUTELSAT QUANTUM made further strong progress with five beams now secured for Government Services  of which three for incremental business and two to favour the renewal of existing business.In the Fourth Quarter  the full effect of Spring 2022 renewals relative to the Third Quarter should be largely offset by the ramp-up of new business on EUTELSAT QUANTUM.Fixed Broadband (6% of revenues)Third Quarter Fixed Broadband revenues stood at ‚Ç¨17 million  up 30.2% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. They reflected the contribution from the wholesale agreements with TIM and Hispasat  the strong dynamic of our African operations and the ramp-up of the multi-beam agreement signed on EUTELSAT 65 West A with several Mexican service providers. Conversely  revenues also reflected the erosion of the legacy business of Bigblu Broadband on the KA-SAT satellite.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were up by 7.7%.The favourable momentum in this application is set to continue into the Fourth Quarter.Mobile Connectivity (7% of revenues)Third Quarter Mobile Connectivity revenues stood at ‚Ç¨21 million  up 24.5% year-on-year. They reflected the carry-forward effect of the contract signed with Anuvu last year as well as the ongoing strong growth of Maritime  driven by the ramp-up of contracts with service providers signed in recent years and by the agreement inked earlier this year on EUTELSAT QUANTUM with a customer in the Middle East.Quarter-on-quarter  revenues were up by 4.5%.On the commercial front  we continue to see a robust pipeline of business for maritime mobility highlighting both the strong demand in this vertical as well as the quality of our in-orbit resources and services.In the Fourth Quarter  growth is expected to decelerate as the comparison base will notably integrate the above-mentioned agreement with Anuvu.Other Revenues‚ÄòOther Revenues‚Äô amounted to ‚Ç¨2.1 million in the Third Quarter versus ‚Ç¨6.9 million a year earlier and ‚Ç¨1.0 million in the Second Quarter. They included a negative (‚Ç¨2.8) million impact from hedging operations compared to a positive impact of +‚Ç¨4.3 million last year and a negative impact of (‚Ç¨2) million in the Second Quarter.OPERATIONAL AND UTILIZED TRANSPONDERSThe number of operational transponders as of 31 March 2022 stood at 1 358 down by 22 units quarter-on-quarter  the latter reflecting principally the end of life in stable orbit of EUTELSAT 174A.The number of utilized transponders stood at 961  down 13 units quarter-on-quarter  reflecting principally the same effect as above as well as the Fall 2021 renewal campaign with the US Government.As a result  the fill rate stood at 70.7% compared with 69.5% a year ago and 70.6% at end-December 2021.31 March 2021 31 Dec. 2021 31 March 2022 Operational transponders6 1 366 1 380 1 358 Utilized transponders7 950 974 961 Fill rate 69.5% 70.6% 70.7%Note: Based on 36 MHz-equivalent transponders excluding high throughput capacityBACKLOGThe backlog stood at ‚Ç¨4.0 billion as of 31 March 2022 versus ‚Ç¨4.5 billion a year ago  and ‚Ç¨4.2 billion at end-December 2021  reflecting its natural consumption in the absence of major broadcast renewals this quarter.It was equivalent to 3.3 times 2020-21 revenues  with Broadcast representing 63%.31 Mar. 2021 31 Dec. 2021 31 Mar. 2022 Value of contracts (in billions of euros) 4.5 4.2 4.0 In years of annual revenues 3.5 3.4 3.3 Share of Broadcast 64% 64% 63%Note: The backlog represents future revenues from capacity or service agreements and can include contracts for satellites under procurement.NINE MONTH REVENUESRevenues for the first Nine Months of FY 2021-22 stood at ‚Ç¨859 million  down by 7.6% on a reported basis and by 4.0% at constant currency and perimeter.Revenues of the five Operating Verticals (excluding ‚ÄòOther Revenues‚Äô) were down by 6.0% on a reported basis. They were down by 4.0% on a like-for-like basis excluding a positive effect from currency representing circa one point and a negative perimeter effect of circa three points from the disposal of Euro Broadband Infrastructure (EBI) on 30 April 2021 only partly offset by the consolidation of Bigblu Broadband Europe since 1st October 2020.At a 1.20 ‚Ç¨/$ rate (rate as per financial objectives) they stood at ‚Ç¨840 million.In ‚Ç¨ millions 9m 2020-21 9m 2021-22 Change Reported Like-for-like8 Broadcast 560.9 523.0 -6.8% -7.3% Data & Professional Video 120.9 117.8 -2.6% -3.7% Government Services 113.6 108.4 -4.6% -6.3% Fixed Broadband 62.6 47.0 -24.9% +34.4% Mobile Connectivity 49.6 57.2 +15.3% +14.5% Total Operating Verticals 907.5 853.4 -6.0% -4.0% Other Revenues 22.3 5.6 -74.9% -10.4% Total 929.9 859.0 -7.6% -4.1% EUR/USD exchange rate 1.18 1.16FINANCIAL OUTLOOKOn the back of the performance of the first Nine Months  we confirm our objective for the Full Year of Operating Vertical Revenues of between ‚Ç¨1 110 to ‚Ç¨1 130 million9.All other elements of the financial outlook are also confirmed:Cash Capex 10 not exceeding ‚Ç¨400 million per annum for each of the next three fiscal years (FY 2021-22 / FY 2022-23 / FY 2023-24).not exceeding ‚Ç¨400 million per annum for each of the next three fiscal years (FY 2021-22 / FY 2022-23 / FY 2023-24).

The Group also leases capacity on four satellites owned by the Russian operator  RSCC  serving mostly the above-mentioned Russian customers and representing a net present value (included in Net Financial Debt) of ‚Ç¨322 million as of 31 December 2021.Furthermore  the OneWeb low-orbit constellation in which Eutelsat owns a 22.9% stake had to suspend the remaining six upcoming launches which were planned from Baikonur Cosmodrome. Since then  OneWeb entered into agreements with SpaceX and New Space India that will enable to resume satellite launches.Consistent with its Code of Ethics and as a provider of infrastructure globally Eutelsat upholds a commitment to neutrality and is therefore guided by sanctions and by the decisions of its competent regulatory bodies  which it strictly applies. In this context  Eutelsat immediately implemented EU Council Regulation 2022/350  suspending the broadcasting activities of Russian television stations such as Russia Today.*******Third Quarter 2021-22 revenues conference callA conference call will be held on Thursday  12 May 2022 at 18.30 CET / 17.30 GMT / 12.30 ESTTo connect to the call  please use the following numbers:- France: +33 (0) 1 76 77 25 07- UK: +44 (0) 330 165 4045- United States: +1 720-543-0214Access code: 5156191#Instant replay will be available from 12 May  22.30 CET to 19 May  22.30 CET on the following numbers:- France: +33 (0) 1 70 48 00 94- UK: + 44 (0) 20 3859 5407- United States: + 1 719 457 0820Access code: 5156191#Financial calendarNote: The financial calendar is provided for information purposes only.

The maximum amount of the capital increase that will be carried out will be approximately 0.6% of EDF's share capital  this amount may be increased to 0.7% in the event of oversubscription.This operation is reserved for employees who can prove that they have been employed for at least 3 months1 by the company  by one of the French subsidiaries which are members of the PEG or by one of the subsidiaries whose registered office is in the United Kingdom which are members of the PEGI  as well as for retired employees of one or more participating companies of the EDF Group who still have assets within the PEG or the PEGI.The capital increase will comprise a structured (or ""leveraged"") formula with a guarantee of the personal contribution  up to a limit of approximately 0.21% of EDF's share capital  and a so-called classic formula. It will be carried out through a Company Mutual Fund (Fonds Commun de Placement d'Entreprise - FCPE).

Focused exclusively on the design  development and marketing of professional civil drone solutions  combining microdrones and image analysis software  the Group is seeing the benefits of its strategy rolled out since the end of 2018  against a backdrop of increased demand for its technologies.Revenues (‚Ç¨m and % of revenues) Q1 2022 Q1 2021 Change FY 2021 A Parrot Drones 7.7 54% 4.8 39% +60% 20.9 38% B Of which  consumer products(2) 0 0% 1.2 9% - 6.2 11% C Pix4D 6.7 46% 5.6 45% +20% 26.2 48% D Parrot SA 0.1 1% 0.1 1% - 0.3 1% E Intragroup eliminations -0.1 -1% -0.2 -2% - -0.8 -2% F SenseFly (activity divested in October 2021) - - 2.2 18% - 7.7 14% CONSOLIDATED PARROT GROUP TOTAL 14.4 100% 12.4 100% +16% 54.3 100% NEW SCOPE TOTAL (1) (=A-B+C+D+E) 14.4 100% 9.0 73% +60% 40.4 74%(1) ‚ÄúNew scope total‚Äù is a performance indicator reflecting the impact of the strategy rolled out since end-2018. It corresponds to the Parrot Group‚Äôs consolidated revenues after deducting revenues from consumer products (see 2) and revenues from the subsidiaries divested (Micasense sold in January 2021  revenues in 2021  and Sensefly SA and Sensefly Inc  sold in October 2021). Note that intragroup eliminations are not reallocated and therefore include a relatively insignificant percentage for sales from the subsidiaries divested.(2) Consumer products: consumer drones (all ranges)  legacy automotive products (car kit  plug & play) and connected devices  for which sales were discontinued in 2021.Over the period  the Group‚Äôs commercial development was marked by:The 60% growth in revenues for microdrones (+58% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨7.7m was driven by strong sales growth for ANAFI USA commercial micro-drones and the start of sales for the ANAFI Ai  which is combined with a continued high level of gross margin. ANAFI USA sales are being further strengthened by the context of the war in Ukraine and a new delivery for the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA). A second order from 2022 is being looked into  for delivery in the second semester. More widely  Parrot is seeing increased demand for its microdrones  highlighting the gradual integration of drone technologies on its core target markets (inspection  surveillance  mapping)  supported by the high level of security provided by its equipment.The 20% growth in revenues from data analysis software (+14% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨6.7m reflects the international development of the sales and marketing strategy and the continued increase in the number of users  for both the new business solutions launched at the start of 2020 and Pix4Dmapper  the flagship solution.Outlook for 2022Realigned and driven by professional solutions at the forefront of innovation  Parrot is continuing to look ahead to 2022 with confidence in its strategy and vigilance concerning the changes in the international environment.The Group is continuing to allocate its resources to an ambitious R&D roadmap. Supported by its advances in the field of artificial intelligence and the growing integration between hardware and software  Parrot aims to continue facilitating the adoption of drone technologies and offer new use cases that are aligned with the needs of professionals  businesses and institutions  focused on (i) 3D Mapping  Geomatics and Inspection  (ii) Defense and Security  and (iii) Precision Farming.To secure its production capacity over the medium and long term  and respond to the growing interest in its microdrones at the start of this year  Parrot is further strengthening the synergies between R&D  procurement and production tracking. The increase in the resources allocated to these operations will be combined with an agile sourcing management approach. These transformational initiatives could limit the reduction in costs in 2022  and their efficiency and effectiveness are still strongly correlated with changes in the health context in China  where the situation is still disrupted at the start of this year.Looking beyond the disruption linked to the economic and geopolitical environment  which is difficult to predict  the Group plans to move forward with its roadmap for revenue growth on its ‚Äúnew scope‚Äù and capitalize on the opportunities opened up by the growing adoption of drone technologies in businesses and the public sector. The Group will continue to closely monitor the allocation of its cash  and will be ready to respond and adapt to potential changes in the conditions.Next financial datesParrot‚Äôs general shareholders‚Äô meeting: Wednesday June 15  20222022 first-half earnings: Thursday July 28  2022ABOUT PARROTFounded in 1994 by Henri Seydoux  Parrot is today the leading European drone manufacturer in this rapidly expanding market.Visionary  at the forefront of innovation Parrot has a complementary range of equipment and software adapted to the needs of companies  large groups and government organizations.

Meanwhile  pick-up charges improved by ‚Ç¨2.2 million. Rental revenue supported this trend  posting a significant increase of +40.2% over the quarter to ‚Ç¨3.3 million.The management activity was down slightly by ‚Ç¨0.2 million due to the drop in sales fees on investor equipment  reflecting the persistent lack of available-for-sale containers.The Modular Construction business in Africa  presented in the ‚Äúmiscellaneous‚Äù line  decreased by ‚Ç¨1.7 million due to an unfavourable comparison basis (significant deliveries took place in Q1 2021).OUTLOOKFrom an economic viewpoint in the short term  the global macroeconomic environment is volatile and uncertain due to the current armed conflict in Ukraine. However  Touax is not directly exposed to this conflict or the economic sanctions on Russia  as it has no subsidiaries  customers or leased transport assets (with the possible exception of a few non-material containers in transit) in Ukraine or Russia. Indirectly  this conflict may have consequences that are difficult to ascertain in terms of rising inflation  impact on European economic growth  logistical disruptions  shortages of equipment  spare parts and raw materials in certain industrial sectors (including the rail sector) and rising interest rates. We note that our assets are gaining value during this inflationary period.From a structural and medium/long-term perspective  the business outlook in the long-term leasing of equipment for sustainable transportation is positive. Our various asset classes are benefiting from the development of infrastructure  e-commerce and intermodal logistics  as well as the support of public authorities  consumers  lenders and investors for green transport.UPCOMING EVENTS22 June 2022: Annual General Meeting28 September 2022: Publication of H1 results and videoconferencing presentation29 September 2022: Video conference call to present the H1 results in English14 November 2022: Q3 revenue from activitiesTOUAX Group leases out tangible assets (freight railcars  river barges and containers) on a daily basis worldwide  both on its own account and for investors.

Focused exclusively on the design  development and marketing of professional civil drone solutions  combining microdrones and image analysis software  the Group is seeing the benefits of its strategy rolled out since the end of 2018  against a backdrop of increased demand for its technologies.Revenues (‚Ç¨m and % of revenues) Q1 2022 Q1 2021 Change FY 2021 A Parrot Drones 7.7 54% 4.8 39% +60% 20.9 38% B Of which  consumer products(2) 0 0% 1.2 9% - 6.2 11% C Pix4D 6.7 46% 5.6 45% +20% 26.2 48% D Parrot SA 0.1 1% 0.1 1% - 0.3 1% E Intragroup eliminations -0.1 -1% -0.2 -2% - -0.8 -2% F SenseFly (activity divested in October 2021) - - 2.2 18% - 7.7 14% CONSOLIDATED PARROT GROUP TOTAL 14.4 100% 12.4 100% +16% 54.3 100% NEW SCOPE TOTAL (1) (=A-B+C+D+E) 14.4 100% 9.0 73% +60% 40.4 74%(1) ‚ÄúNew scope total‚Äù is a performance indicator reflecting the impact of the strategy rolled out since end-2018. It corresponds to the Parrot Group‚Äôs consolidated revenues after deducting revenues from consumer products (see 2) and revenues from the subsidiaries divested (Micasense sold in January 2021  revenues in 2021  and Sensefly SA and Sensefly Inc  sold in October 2021). Note that intragroup eliminations are not reallocated and therefore include a relatively insignificant percentage for sales from the subsidiaries divested.(2) Consumer products: consumer drones (all ranges)  legacy automotive products (car kit  plug & play) and connected devices  for which sales were discontinued in 2021.Over the period  the Group‚Äôs commercial development was marked by:The 60% growth in revenues for microdrones (+58% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨7.7m was driven by strong sales growth for ANAFI USA commercial micro-drones and the start of sales for the ANAFI Ai  which is combined with a continued high level of gross margin. ANAFI USA sales are being further strengthened by the context of the war in Ukraine and a new delivery for the French Defense Procurement Agency (DGA). A second order from 2022 is being looked into  for delivery in the second semester. More widely  Parrot is seeing increased demand for its microdrones  highlighting the gradual integration of drone technologies on its core target markets (inspection  surveillance  mapping)  supported by the high level of security provided by its equipment.The 20% growth in revenues from data analysis software (+14% at constant exchange rates) to ‚Ç¨6.7m reflects the international development of the sales and marketing strategy and the continued increase in the number of users  for both the new business solutions launched at the start of 2020 and Pix4Dmapper  the flagship solution.Story continuesOutlook for 2022Realigned and driven by professional solutions at the forefront of innovation  Parrot is continuing to look ahead to 2022 with confidence in its strategy and vigilance concerning the changes in the international environment.The Group is continuing to allocate its resources to an ambitious R&D roadmap. Supported by its advances in the field of artificial intelligence and the growing integration between hardware and software  Parrot aims to continue facilitating the adoption of drone technologies and offer new use cases that are aligned with the needs of professionals  businesses and institutions  focused on (i) 3D Mapping  Geomatics and Inspection  (ii) Defense and Security  and (iii) Precision Farming.To secure its production capacity over the medium and long term  and respond to the growing interest in its microdrones at the start of this year  Parrot is further strengthening the synergies between R&D  procurement and production tracking. The increase in the resources allocated to these operations will be combined with an agile sourcing management approach. These transformational initiatives could limit the reduction in costs in 2022  and their efficiency and effectiveness are still strongly correlated with changes in the health context in China  where the situation is still disrupted at the start of this year.Looking beyond the disruption linked to the economic and geopolitical environment  which is difficult to predict  the Group plans to move forward with its roadmap for revenue growth on its ‚Äúnew scope‚Äù and capitalize on the opportunities opened up by the growing adoption of drone technologies in businesses and the public sector. The Group will continue to closely monitor the allocation of its cash  and will be ready to respond and adapt to potential changes in the conditions.Next financial datesParrot‚Äôs general shareholders‚Äô meeting: Wednesday June 15  20222022 first-half earnings: Thursday July 28  2022ABOUT PARROTFounded in 1994 by Henri Seydoux  Parrot is today the leading European drone manufacturer in this rapidly expanding market.Visionary  at the forefront of innovation Parrot has a complementary range of equipment and software adapted to the needs of companies  large groups and government organizations.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta‚Äôs website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYApril saw a continuation of the recovery from the losses experienced in February following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. During April  the fund gained 2.3% which leaves the year-to-date performance at +1.4%. Part of this good performance is due to the USD exposure in Volta (+1.6% contribution in April).Turning to the broad asset classes  the monthly performances** were: +0.8% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +0.9% for CLO equity tranches; +0.5% for CLO debt; +0.7% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS (together representing 2.8% of NAV).Most markets were relatively flat in April including the US and the European loan markets. Relative to end-of-year levels  loan prices were down by roughly 1% in the US and 1.5% in Europe on average. Both markets are now 1% lower in terms of average prices.Our view is unchanged: we still think that we may see an increase in default rates: 1 to 2% for 2022 and 2 to 3% for 2023 seem reasonable expectations for both loan markets.With central banks fighting against inflation  we may see volatility continuing during the rest of the year. Given the significant weight of CLO Equities  the outlook for Volta mainly depends on the magnitude of positive impacts (purchasing loans at a discount and new loans at higher spreads) to compensate for the negative outcome coming from higher default rates.One clear and positive thing is the fact that most of Volta‚Äôs CLO Equity positions have been sourced  refinanced or reset in 2021 with a relatively low cost of debt and relatively long reinvestment periods. If loan spreads are to be higher for some time  we will benefit from the increase in the weighted average spread of the underlying loan pools while the cost of leverage has been fixed at a relatively low level.Story continuesFor the coming quarters  there are no signs that Volta may suffer from any diversion of cashflows from its CLO Equity positions. Receiving a continuing high level will allow us to take advantage of opportunities arising from the current market environment while paying a solid quarterly dividend.In April  Volta received the equivalent of ‚Ç¨9.7m in terms of interest and coupons. For the 6 months ended April 2022  Volta received ‚Ç¨22.5m interest and coupons representing a 17.0% annualized return on NAV.As at the end of April 2022  Volta‚Äôs NAV was ‚Ç¨264.1m or ‚Ç¨7.22 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 9.4% of Volta‚Äôs GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta‚Äôs NAV has already been published. Volta‚Äôs policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta‚Äôs appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 3.0% as at 31 March 2022  5.9% as at 31 January 2022  and 0.5% as at 31 December 2021.** ‚Äúperformances‚Äù of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisSerge Demayserge.demay@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 84 47Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas Securities Services S.C.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Aegon will assess if this could be value accretive to shareholders compared with the alternative of continued full ownership and active management of a de-risked variable annuity portfolioStatement of Lard Friese  CEO‚ÄúThe first three months of 2022 have been unprecedented in many ways. The Russian invasion in Ukraine has had a devastating impact on the lives of many people and fueled inflationary pressures and volatility on the global financial markets at a time that many economies were opening up after relaxing COVID-19 measures. I am proud of our colleagues who continued to effectively support and service our customers in a turbulent environment as evidenced by our results  and the substantial progress we made on our 2023 strategic and financial objectives.Story continuesWe continued sharpening our strategic focus and increasing our financial flexibility with the completion of the divestments of our businesses in Hungary and Turkey to Vienna Insurance Group  and the sale of part of our European venture fund. The closing of the sale of our Hungarian businesses resulted in an increase in Cash Capital at the Holding to EUR 1.8 billion. This enabled us to announce a EUR 300 million share buyback program and a further reduction of our debt  thereby reaching our deleveraging target range 1.5 years early.Furthermore  we are maintaining a high pace in maximizing the value of our Financial Assets. We took management actions to further reduce the sensitivity of our capital position to market movements in our Dutch Life and US variable annuity businesses. The progress we‚Äôve made so far  enables us to now engage with external parties to further explore the potential for a reinsurance transaction on parts of the US variable annuity portfolio and assess if this could be value accretive to shareholders.As part of our strategy  we‚Äôre also reinvesting in our Strategic Assets to enhance our customer service and strengthen our ability to compete by expanding our distribution network. These investments resulted in higher sales and net deposits in our US life business  UK Retail business and the retirement businesses in our core markets. Our Global Asset Manager also continued its track record of positive third-party net deposits. In the US  we acquired TAG Resources  strengthening our competitive position in the pooled retirement plan market  which is a strategic growth driver. While COVID-19 mortality claims in the US continued to have an adverse impact  we saw our growth initiatives positively contribute to a solid first quarter 2022 operating result.Our responsibility extends well beyond achieving attractive financial returns. In line with our purpose of helping people live their best lives  we actively contribute to help protect our environment and society. In February  we made a significant donation to the Red Cross to aid the victims of the hostile attack on Ukraine and excluded future investments in Russia and Belarus-based companies. We also sharpened our Responsible Investment policy to further align our investments with our net-zero carbon commitment. Transamerica introduced an innovative retirement plan that offers participants access to ESG investments. Our progress is increasingly recognized by our external stakeholders  as evidenced by the Responsible Investor of the Year award Aegon Asset Management received at the Insurance Asset Risk Awards 2022.While global economic and geopolitical uncertainty remains  we are seeing the impact from COVID-19 subside and several central banks tightening their monetary policies to protect the economy and address rising inflation. Looking ahead  I am confident that the progress we are making on the execution of our strategy and the implementation of our operational improvement plan  as well as the actions we are taking to strengthen our balance sheet keep us on track for delivering on our strategic and financial objectives.‚ÄùDick Schiethart Jan Willem Weidema +31 (0) 6 22 88 99 25gcc@aegon.com +31 (0) 70 344 8028ir@aegon.comAdditional informationFor the official press release we refer to our corporate website.PresentationThe conference call presentation is available on aegon.com as of 7.30 a.m. CET.SupplementsAegon‚Äôs 1Q 2022 Financial Supplement and other supplementary documents are available on aegon.com.Conference call including Q&AThe conference call starts at 9:00 a.m. CET  with an audio webcast on aegon.com.

More information can be found at aegon.com.Cautionary note regarding non-IFRS-EU measuresThis document includes the following non-IFRS-EU financial measures: operating result  income tax  result before tax  market consistent value of new business  return on equity and addressable expenses. These non-IFRS-EU measures  except for addressable expenses  are calculated by consolidating on a proportionate basis Aegon‚Äôs joint ventures and associated companies. The reconciliation of these measures  except for market consistent value of new business and return on equity  to the most comparable IFRS-EU measure is provided in the notes to this press release. Market consistent value of new business is not based on IFRS-EU  which are used to report Aegon‚Äôs primary financial statements and should not be viewed as a substitute for IFRS-EU financial measures. Aegon may define and calculate market consistent value of new business differently than other companies. Return on equity is a ratio using a non-IFRS-EU measure and is calculated by dividing the operating result after tax less cost of leverage by the average shareholders‚Äô equity excluding the revaluation reserve. Operating expenses are all expenses associated with selling and administrative activities (excluding commissions) after reallocation of claim handling expenses to benefits paid. This includes certain expenses recorded in other charges  including restructuring charges. Addressable expenses are expenses reflected in the operating result  excluding deferrable acquisition expenses  expenses in joint ventures and associates and expenses related to operations in CEE countries. Aegon believes that these non-IFRS-EU measures  together with the IFRS-EU information  provide meaningful supplemental information about the operating results of Aegon‚Äôs business including insight into the financial measures that senior management uses in managing the business.Local currencies and constant currency exchange ratesThis document contains certain information about Aegon‚Äôs results  financial condition and revenue generating investments presented in USD for the Americas and in GBP for the United Kingdom  because those businesses operate and are managed primarily in those currencies. Certain comparative information presented on a constant currency basis eliminates the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. None of this information is a substitute for or superior to financial information about Aegon presented in EUR  which is the currency of Aegon‚Äôs primary financial statements.Forward-looking statementsThe statements contained in this document that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements as defined in the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

In the Helsinki Metropolitan Area in particular  the continued high level of housing supply has sustained intense competition between rental housing providers. SATO is investing strongly in its presence at SATO-owned properties and in developing personal service for customers.There are slight signs of the record-high rate of construction slowing. According to Statistics Finland  the number of building permits issued in November‚ÄìJanuary decreased by 15% year on year.The war in Ukraine has increased uncertainty relating to the development of the economy. The impacts of the war are reflected particularly in the surge in energy and materials prices and in the accelerating inflation.SATO‚Äôs House Expert model is now fully deployed in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area  Tampere and Turku. With the House Expert model  SATO aims to improve the customer service in the daily lives of its residents.The renovation of an apartment building started in Castr√©ninkatu  Kallio  Helsinki in February and it is estimated to take around 18 months. SATO repairs its properties in accordance with the lifecycle principle and  when renovating properties  energy efficiency is also improved. The aim is to improve energy efficiency by around 30% compared to the pre-renovation level.Events after the review period: SATO sold 2 009 rental apartments mainly in Lahti  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu region to Heimstaden. The divestment implements the SATO strategy to focus housing investments on the Helsinki Metropolitan area and its commuter area along the main railway line as well as on Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities.I would like to thank SATO employees for their great work to ensure customer satisfaction and the comfort of our residents.Story continuesOperating environmentOver the reporting period  SATO‚Äôs operating environment was affected by the war in Ukraine  accelerating inflation and the continued high level of rental housing supply  particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area.The first months of the year saw rapid economic growth as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine in late February transformed the economic outlook. The biggest impacts are related to the surge in energy and materials prices and challenges in supply chains  which were already visible in the end of the year 2021. According to a Bank of Finland analysis of 11 March 2022  the war in Ukraine is increasing uncertainty over the outlook for Finland‚Äôs economy and will slow economic growth. The analysis projects that Finland‚Äôs economic growth will slow to 0.5%‚Äì2% in the current year. The uncertainty has resulted in a major decline in consumer confidence. According to the consumer confidence indicator published by Statistics Finland on 28 March 2022  consumers‚Äô expectations concerning their own finances and especially the Finnish economy were very pessimistic.Inflation has continued to accelerate in early 2022. According to preliminary Eurostat data published on 1 April 2022  inflation in March was expected to be 7.5% in the euro area and 5.6% in Finland. The main component pushing prices up has been the surge in energy prices  which has accelerated after Russia's attack on Ukraine. The accelerating inflation has raised the overall interest rate level  and central banks have tightened their monetary policy to curb price increases. The US Federal Reserve approved its first interest rate hike in March  and the European Central Bank (ECB) announced it would scale down its securities purchase programme. Contrary to previous forecasts  inflation is anticipated to remain at a high level during 2022.The continued high level of housing supply particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area has maintained intense competition for good tenants between rental housing providers  which was reflected over the reporting period in SATO‚Äôs business as a decline in the economic occupancy rate and in a slight decrease in average rents year on year. However  with COVID-19 restrictions lifted and service-sector employment improving  demand for centrally located homes started to grow towards the end of the reporting period. There are slight signs of slowing in the record-high rate of construction that has been seen for a long period of time. According to Statistics Finland  the number of building permits issued in November‚ÄìJanuary decreased by 15% year on year.Despite the economic uncertainty  there is demand for rental homes and the urbanisation trend continues. Dense urban housing with good access to public transport is becoming increasingly popular in Finland. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA)  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while at the same time Statistics Finland forecasts a downturn in the nationwide population trend in 2031. The HMA is projected to grow by more than 200 000 new residents by 2040. Almost 80% of HMA residents already live in households with one to two members  and the proportion of small households continues to grow. The proportion of immigrants is projected to increase in the HMA from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. The ageing population is moving to growth centres providing access to services and expects more and more housing-related services.The demographic change and the price development of owner-occupied homes create a stable foundation for demand for rental housing  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku. Outside growth centres  the real prices of homes are declining  which makes home ownership in a growth centre even more challenging for people coming from those areas.REVIEW PERIOD 1 January to 31 March 2022 (1 January to 31 March 2021)Net sales and profitIn January‚ÄìMarch 2022  SATO Corporation‚Äôs consolidated net sales totalled EUR 74.7 million (74.0).Operating profit was EUR 117.9 million (67.9).

The reporting period saw the completion of 0 (0) new rental homes. The number of divested rental apartments and part-ownership apartments redeemed by residents totalled 7.Fair valueThe development of the value of rental apartments is a key factor for SATO. Its housing stock is concentrated in areas and apartment sizes which are expected to be the focus  in the long term  of increasing rental apartment demand. The allocation of building repairs is based on lifecycle plans and repair need specifications.At the end of March  the fair value of investment properties came to a total of EUR 5 129.1 million (4 804.5). The change in the value of investment properties  including investments and divestments during the review period  was EUR 96.3 million (51.0).At the end of March  the commuting zone of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area accounted for around 83%  Tampere and Turku together made up around 11%  Jyv√§skyl√§ and Oulu around 4% and St Petersburg around 2% of the value of apartments.Investments  divestments and property developmentInvestment activities are used to manage the housing portfolio and prepare the ground for growth. Since 2000  SATO has invested more than EUR 3 billion in non-subsidised rental apartments. SATO acquires and builds entire rental buildings and single rental apartments. Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments in Finland. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through renovation activities.Investments in rental apartments stood at EUR 23.7 million (16.9). The Helsinki Metropolitan Area represented 82.4% of all investments during the reporting period. New apartments accounted for 66.3% of the total. In addition  on 31 March 2022  there were binding purchase agreements to a total of EUR 131.3 million (76.8) in Finland.SATO repairs its properties in accordance with the lifecycle principle and  when renovating properties  energy efficiency is also improved. The aim is to improve energy efficiency by around 30% compared to the pre-renovation level. In February saw the commencement of the renovation of an apartment building in Castr√©ninkatu  Kallio  Helsinki  which is estimated to take around 18 months. The renovation will involve the full refurbishment of the kitchens  bathrooms and other living areas of the apartments. In addition  the property‚Äôs staircases and corridors will be painted and the water and drain pipes as well as electrical and building automation and control systems will be replaced. The natural ventilation of the apartment building will be replaced by centralised supply and exhaust ventilation with heat recovery. The building‚Äôs apartment distribution will change  and the renovated building will feature 95 homes  which is five more than before the project. The exteriors and roof of the building already underwent refurbishment in 2016.The renovation of a total of 300 rental homes in Helsinki Kontula and Pihlajam√§ki was completed during the review period. On 31 March 2022  there were 382 rental homes undergoing renovation in Helsinki and Vantaa and 13 units undergoing repurposing from office space to homes in Turku.During the reporting period  7 (5) rental homes were divested in Finland.

Transaction was closed 25 April 2022. The properties sold in this transaction are located in H√§meenlinna  Jyv√§skyl√§  Lahti  Oulu  Vihti and Yl√∂j√§rvi. The lease agreements will be transferred to the buyer as they are in the transaction.The divestment implements the SATO strategy to focus housing investments on the Helsinki Metropolitan area and its commuter area along the main railway line as well as on Tampere and Turku and their surrounding municipalities. The properties sold are mostly located outside the growth centres covered by the strategy.Short-term risks and uncertaintiesRisk management is used to ensure that risks impacting the company‚Äôs business are identified  managed and monitored. The main risks of SATO‚Äôs business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.The war in Ukraine is a short-term risk affecting the operating environment  the duration and impacts of which on the Finnish economy are difficult to estimate. The war‚Äôs biggest impacts have been seen in energy  food and materials prices as well as supply chains. An increase in energy  food and consumer goods prices may slow economic growth  considerably increase the interest rate level  and have a negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers as well as on their capacity to fulfil their obligations. Such a decline in the economy or economic activity may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  finance costs or value of SATO-owned properties.The highest risks in apartment rental are to do with cyclical movements and changes in supply and demand. The market risk may push the supply of rental homes higher than their demand. This would result in idle rental housing stock and pressure for the rent level to level off or fall  especially as regards old housing stock.A decline in the housing market may have a negative effect on the market value of SATO‚Äôs housing stock. In line with its refined strategy  SATO has been focusing in its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing existing housing stock and  consequently  ensuring the rentability and value development of the apartments.Changes in regulation by the authorities and in legislation and related uncertainty may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and  consequently  on SATO‚Äôs business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and also calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group‚Äôs treasury policy. Our risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy adopted by SATO‚Äôs Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other financing commitments. In 2019  the company established an EUR 1.5 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Programme under which SATO has issued bonds in the total amount of EUR 1 050.0 million.The means for managing the liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  EUR 700 million in committed credit facilities and a EUR 400 million commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating rate loans form an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed and floating rate loans either by fixed rate debt arrangements or interest rate derivatives. In accordance with our treasury policy  our aim is for fixed-rate loans  including interest rate derivatives  to account for more than 60% of our debt portfolio.SATO currently has 522 apartments in St Petersburg. Investments in Russia commenced in 2007. The last investment decision was made in 2013 and the property was completed in 2016. There are risks related to the business environment in our St. Petersburg operations  including currency risk. The consolidation of foreign currency-denominated assets in the consolidated financial statements also involves a translation risk  with related hedging options examined in accordance with our treasury policy. SATO will refrain from making new investments in Russia. Following the start of the war in Ukraine  the company has looked into opportunities to exit the business in Russia. According to the explorations  a speedy exit is not possible  which is why SATO will continue to rent out the homes in St Petersburg for the time being. It is expected that the operating environment in Russia will be highly uncertain for a long period of time and could result in disruptions to SATO's business activities in Russia and with parties related to Russia  the ability to make payments to its suppliers  employees and authorities as well as to receive payments from its customers  which could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on SATO's business in Russia and even result in SATO limiting or ceasing its operations in Russia and with parties related to Russia for a long period of time. Should the war in Ukraine be prolonged  carrying out business in Russia may have negative impacts on the company‚Äôs reputation and may hamper business in Finland or have adverse effects on the company‚Äôs ability to access finance in the market  which may have an adverse effect on the financial performance or activities  finance costs or value of SATO-owned properties.For a broader description of risks and risk management  see the Group‚Äôs website and Annual Report for 2021 at www.sato.fi/en.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO‚Äôs business activities are mainly affected by the urbanisation trend  competitive situation  interest rate level  consumer confidence  the development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  and housing policies. The war in Ukraine that broke out in February and the resulting acceleration of inflation have brought a great deal of uncertainty to the economic outlook.The first months of the year saw rapid economic growth as COVID-19 restrictions were lifted. Russia‚Äôs attack on Ukraine in late February transformed the economic outlook. The biggest impacts are related to the surge in energy and materials prices and challenges in supply chains  which were already visible in the end of the year 2021. According to a Bank of Finland analysis of 11 March 2022  the war in Ukraine is increasing uncertainty over the outlook for Finland‚Äôs economy and will slow economic growth. The analysis projects that Finland‚Äôs economic growth will slow to 0.5%‚Äì2% in the current year. The uncertainty has resulted in a major decline in consumer confidence. According to the consumer confidence indicator published by Statistics Finland on 28 March 2022  consumers‚Äô expectations concerning their own finances and especially the Finnish economy were very pessimistic.Inflation has continued to accelerate in early 2022. According to preliminary Eurostat data published on 1 April 2022  inflation in March was expected to be 7.5% in the euro area and 5.6% in Finland.

The accelerating inflation has raised the overall interest rate level  and central banks have tightened their monetary policy to curb price increases. The US Federal Reserve approved its first interest rate hike in March  and the European Central Bank (ECB) announced it would scale down its securities purchase programme. Contrary to previous forecasts  inflation is anticipated to remain at a high level during 2022. High inflation increases the interest rate level and  consequently  SATO‚Äôs finance costs. The abundant supply of rental homes prevents the transfer of higher costs caused by inflation fully to rents.The continued high level of housing supply particularly in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area has maintained intense competition for good tenants between rental housing providers. However  with COVID-19 restrictions lifted and service-sector employment improving  demand for centrally located homes started to grow towards the end of the reporting period. There are signs of slowing in the record-high rate of construction that has been seen for a long period of time.With the increased choice available for those looking for a home  the role of a successful customer experience has become even more important. SATO is investing strongly in increasing its presence close to customers and in digital services.SATO Corporation‚Äôs shareholders on 31 March 2022Largest shareholders and their holdingsBalder Finska Otas Ab / Fastighets Ab Balder31 754 24555.9% Stichting Depositary APG Strategic Real Estate Pool12 811 647 22.6% Elo Mutual Pension Insurance Company7 233 081 12.7% State Pension Fund2 796 200 4.9% Valkila Erkka385 000 0.7% Research Foundation of the Pulmonary Diseases227 000 0.4% SATO Corporation166 000 0.3% Entel√§ Tuula159 000 0.3% Heinonen Erkki 156 684 0.3% Tradeka-invest Ltd 126 500 0.2% Others (116 shareholders) 967 710 1.7%On 31 March 2022  SATO had 56 783 067 shares and 126 shareholders registered in the book-entry system.

The coin also offers financial tools applications and NFT solutions.After the coin depegged  Kwon made a last-ditch attempt to restore UST to its alignment with the US dollar by increasing the rate of luna minted per day in a bid to boost the price.Related articles,neutral,0.02,0.92,0.06,negative,0.01,0.05,0.94,True,English,"['21Shares', 'Valour', 'VanEck', 'terra', 'ETPs', 'hedge fund giant Citadel Securities', 'South Korean eCommerce platform', 'resulting severe price developments', 'The 21Shares Terra ETP', 'Apple software engineer', 'financial tools applications', 'Nordic Growth Market', 'wild price swings', 'The Valour Terra', 'terra exchange-traded products', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'VanEck Terra ETN', 'UST) stable coin', 'terra ecosystem', 'terra blockchain', 'token price', 'redemption operations', 'prevailing uncertainty', 'US dollar', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'ETF Stream', 'Hany Rashwan', 'evolving situation', 'current instability', 'market makers', 'bid-offer spreads', 'NGM exchange', 'continuous dialogue', 'decentralised stablecoin', 'Daniel Shin', 'former Microsoft', 'NFT solutions', 'Related articles', 'affected products', 'high volatility', 'LUNA) ETP', 'torrid week', 'one day', 'Do Kwon', 'luna network', 'market statement', '21Shares‚Äô LUNA', 'ETP.', 'ETPs', 'creations', 'redemptions', 'trading', 'VLNA', '13 May', 'TerraUSD', 'suspensions', 'ETFs', 'NAV', 'Euronext', 'Xetra', '15.8% discount', 'Bloomberg', '218.4% premium', 'founder', 'CEO', 'quotation', 'underlying', 'illiquidity', 'inability', 'issuer', 'shareholders', 'intention', 'BlackRock', 'depegging', 'tokens', 'line', 'cryptocurrencies', 'TicketMonster', 'last', 'ditch', 'alignment', 'rate']",2022-05-13,2022-05-13,etfstream.com

4829,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://spacinsider.com/2022/05/13/top-3-spac-targets-discretionary-spending/,Top 3 SPAC Targets - Discretionary Spending,9 hours ago,SPACInsider contributors Anthony Sozzi and Sam Beattie this week compiled their three favorite potential SPAC targets among companies gaining a boost from post-pandemic leisure spending. We look at why they are compelling and why each could be a fit for a blank-check merger.Trading in the market has clearly been driven by fear of rates and inflation to start off 2022. But despite recent headlines  there is still appetite for ‚Äúfun‚Äù after having spent the last two years enduring a pandemic.US consumer spending on services jumped up 1.1% in March and 1.2% on goods in March. Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) meanwhile recorded its best quarter on record for direct bookings as it shifts to reclaim commerce from third party sites. But  it‚Äôs not like those sites are hurting either.Booking.com itself experienced the best quarter in gross travel bookings in its history to start the year. With the pandemic waning  consumers are launching their delayed travel plans and gorging on apparel and experiences  inflation be damned.There are concerns as to where this all leads  with much of this spending being put on credit cards. But  for now  it represents an opportunity for SPACs. As discussed on a recent episode of the SPACInsider Podcast covering ITHAX‚Äôs (NASDAQ:ITHX) pending combination with travel software company Mondee. The travel and leisure sectors are still ‚Äúbuy low‚Äù opportunities despite the fact the sectors‚Äô recoveries are already in progress.United Rugby ChampionshipWith people going back to events  why not de-SPAC an entire sport? United Rugby Championship doesn‚Äôt quite encompass the entirety of professional rugby  but it is growing in a way that is reminiscent of rising sports like Endeavor (NYSE:EDR) subsidiary UFC by steadily absorbing more leagues and squads.Back in 2020  CVC Capital Partners bought a 28% stake in the business in exchange for a ¬£120 million ($146 million) investment and the league has since expanded from 12 teams in Ireland  Great Britain and Italy to absorb four South African teams as well as the Dubai Lions.There are many more pro rugby teams that could be brought into the fold with additional capital and flexibility from a SPAC deal  but more importantly  a combination could also make for a play for US expansion.CVC Capital was previously a part of the ownership group behind Formula One (F1) racing  but sold it to Liberty Media for $4.4 billion in 2016 as a part of a strategy to Americanize the popular European racing competition. That strategy has paid off  with F1 fixtures now regularly drawing about 1 million viewers on ESPN  culminating in this past weekend‚Äôs Miami Grand Prix  which drew 85 000 spectators.Rugby is similarly a rising sport with nearly 1 billion viewers tuning into the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan  a 26% increase from the previous international tournament. So  CVC has made the pivot once before and it may be easier to make the market entry alongside a US listing.Arctos NorthStar (NYSE:ANAC) jumps off the page as a fit for more deeply engraining rugby in the US. It has an attractive IPO structure with about $316 million in trust with units bearing a ¬º warrant and it has until February 2023 to complete a deal.Its team would also be well-aligned with a transaction. It is led by CEO Theo Epstein ‚Äì a long time MLB general manager ‚Äì and Chairman David O‚ÄôConner  a managing partner at Arctos Sports Partners  a sports-focused private equity firm focused on providing liquidity options to ownership groups.RainFocusBusiness travel is coming back as well  but few of the companies facilitating those trips are fully set up for the new hybrid working environment.Lehi  Utah-based RainFocus is focused on maintaining marketing connections between event attendees and hosts with software tools to maintain high levels of engagement. But  this same platform is applicable for companies running in-person and virtual leisure events as well.Its software was used to hold together wine clubs through tasting series‚Äô that went virtual and expanded to new vendors and influencers. Those same experience organizers hope to maintain that same velocity for in-person events now and have engagement tools and analytics from their pandemic work to help back them up.RainFocus also handles the payments for organizers including taking responsibility for local tax compliance and VAT across international locations. Some teams may already be familiar with the software as RainFocus clients have put it to work on roadshows and private equity bakeoffs.The company has raised $103 million in outside funding up to this point and its $60 million Series C last September was led by KKR with a focus on building out its R&D for expanding the suite. At the time  it already had plenty of velocity in its commercialization with 430% growth in hosted events over the previous 12 months with about 5 million business users and 9 million session engagements across 167 countries.PumaAs discussed before  consumer staples are going to stick around no matter what the economy does. But  what appears to be happening in early 2022 is not simply consumers buying what they need but rather splurging and upgrading the wardrobe and summer plans for the pandemic‚Äôs end.And with that  Puma (DE:PUM) may be looking to upgrade its digs as well. While plenty of sportswear and athleisure brands are listed in Europe  their US-listed counterparts tend to be better appreciated by the market. Puma currently trades at about 16x current EBITDA  while fellow Euro footwear peer Adidas (DE:ADS) trades at 11.4x.Meanwhile  their US-listed competitors Nike (NYSE:NKE) and Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) trade at 21.7x and 25x  respectively. At least some of this is down to company performance  of course  but the dynamics are legitimately different on the Deutsche Boerse as compared to the Nasdaq  which handles 17-times its trading volume  and the NYSE  which hosts 15.1x as much.Puma‚Äôs business is increasingly going West already  with sales in the Americas exceeding those in the EMEA region by about 15%. It grew faster to start 2022 on this side of the pond as well  with 44.1% sales growth here in Q1 as compared with 25.5% growth in EMEA and a -17% contraction in the Asia/Pacific region.There could be incentive at Puma to bring more liquidity as well. About 67% of Puma‚Äôs shares are currently free-floating  with the remainder made up by a roughly 9.8% stake held by French luxury group Kering (PA:KER) and the rest held by Kering‚Äôs own largest shareholder Groupe Artemis.Kering already sold a 5.9% stake in Puma in a private placement in May 2021 and could likely be persuaded to let go of more equity. Puma already trades hotter at 16.6x EBITDA than the wider Kering group at 9.7x  and should it receive a premium valuation and partial cash-out with a SPAC deal  this could be a value play for the company.While not quite shooting to the moon  Italian fashion group Ermenegildo Zegna (NYSE:ZGN) made the move to the US markets via SPAC in December 2021 and has been notably resilient to the current market winds  which tend to blow harder against de-SPACs. It closed Thursday at $9.71.,neutral,0.04,0.6,0.37,mixed,0.29,0.11,0.6,True,English,"['Top 3 SPAC Targets', 'Discretionary Spending', 'three favorite potential SPAC targets', 'Chairman David O‚ÄôConner', 'popular European racing competition', 'sports-focused private equity firm', 'new hybrid working environment', 'four South African teams', 'travel software company Mondee', 'private equity bakeoffs', 'last two years', 'Miami Grand Prix', 'attractive IPO structure', 'CEO Theo Epstein', 'MLB general manager', 'local tax compliance', '9 million session engagements', 'United Rugby Championship', '2019 Rugby World Cup', 'post-pandemic leisure spending', 'third party sites', 'NYSE:EDR) subsidiary', 'previous international tournament', 'Arctos Sports Partners', 'gross travel bookings', '$60 million Series C', 'pro rugby teams', 'virtual leisure events', 'CVC Capital Partners', 'same experience organizers', '5 million business users', 'US consumer spending', 'F1) racing', 'new vendors', 'leisure sectors', 'direct bookings', 'rising sports', 'Arctos NorthStar', 'tasting series', 'international locations', 'previous 12 months', 'consumer staples', 'travel plans', 'Business travel', '46 million) investment', 'additional capital', '1 million viewers', 'same platform', 'professional rugby', 'SPAC deal', 'SPACInsider contributors', 'Anthony Sozzi', 'Sam Beattie', 'blank-check merger', 'recent headlines', 'best quarter', 'Booking.com', 'credit cards', 'recent episode', 'SPACInsider Podcast', 'low‚Äù opportunities', 'sectors‚Äô recoveries', 'entire sport', 'Great Britain', 'Dubai Lions', 'US expansion', 'ownership group', 'Formula One', 'Liberty Media', 'F1 fixtures', 'past weekend', '1 billion viewers', 'US listing', 'managing partner', 'liquidity options', 'marketing connections', 'event attendees', 'software tools', 'high levels', 'wine clubs', 'outside funding', 'R&D', 'same velocity', 'NASDAQ:ITHX', 'pending combination', 'market entry', 'long time', 'Utah-based RainFocus', 'engagement tools', 'RainFocus clients', 'pandemic work', 'person events', '¬£120 million', '12 teams', 'companies', 'boost', 'fit', 'Trading', 'fear', 'rates', 'inflation', 'appetite', 'services', 'March', 'goods', 'Marriott', 'record', 'commerce', 'history', 'consumers', 'apparel', 'experiences', 'concerns', 'opportunity', 'SPACs', 'ITHAX', 'fact', 'progress', 'people', 'entirety', 'way', 'Endeavor', 'UFC', 'leagues', 'squads', '28% stake', 'exchange', 'Ireland', 'Italy', 'fold', 'flexibility', 'play', 'strategy', 'ESPN', '85,000 spectators', 'Japan', 'pivot', 'ANAC', 'page', 'engraining', 'trust', 'units', '¬º warrant', 'February', 'transaction', 'trips', 'Lehi', 'hosts', 'influencers', 'analytics', 'payments', 'responsibility', 'roadshows', 'point', 'KKR', 'suite', 'plenty', 'commercialization', '430% growth', '167 countries', 'Puma', 'economy', 'early 202']",2022-05-13,2022-05-13,spacinsider.com
4830,Deutsche Boerse,Google API,https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-etfs-for-an-inflationary-and-rising-rate-environment,Stock ETFs for an Inflationary and Rising Rate Environment,3 hours ago,When the US Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) for March 2022 was reported in April  it was the first time in over 40 years that the index had increased by over 8% annually. It represents only the fifth period since January 1948 that this has happened. Moreover  annual inflation continued to be above 8% in the April CPI-U number announced in May 2022. The table below shows the other periods where the annual CPI increase has exceeded 8%.Table 1: Periods Post 1948 with an Annual CPI Increase of >8%Energy prices have been the primary driver of recent inflation  with the gasoline index increasing annually by 48% in March 2022  although there was some relief in April with the index falling 6.1% over the month. However  inflation has been broad based  with the food index having increased by 8% annually in March and rising again in April 2022  the seventeenth consecutive monthly increase in this index. Items other than food and energy increased by 6.5% annually in March and rose again in April  driven by increasing rents and a sharp rise in airline fares.How long inflation will be sustained remains unclear since the 50 basis point Fed Funds rate hike announced on May 4  2022  will likely be followed by additional 50 basis point hikes this year and multiple quarter point hikes through the end of 2023. This is likely to be accompanied by other forms of quantitative tightening. However  at least for now  U.S. consumers and investors appear to be entering an unusual inflationary period  since the median annual CPI increase over the last 74 years has been 2.8%.Investor Response to Rising RatesIn an environment marked by inflation and rising rates  investors will need to assess how to rebalance their portfolios. Analysis by Sam Stovall  CFRA‚Äôs Chief Investment Strategist  shows that as of end-April 2022  the S&P 500‚Äôs 12.4% year-to-date (YTD) decline was the deepest selloff during that calendar period since WWII  and history says  but does not guarantee  that the market may continue to be challenged  since the S&P 500 rose only 30% of the time in May following the 10 worst YTD-April declines.Typically  during periods of inflation and rising rates  investors may adopt a range of strategies. One strategy is to invest in commodities and REITs since ‚Äòreal assets‚Äô tend to be viewed as an inflation hedge. Another is to rotate into shorter duration bonds since they typically tend to outperform longer dated bonds during periods of rising rates.Within the equity sleeve of their portfolios  investors will want to stay invested but potentially rotate into strategies that may perform better in this environment. In the past  investors would have had to analyze and construct such portfolios themselves. In the last few years  however  there have been a few specialized equity ETFs launched that are designed for inflationary and rising rate environments.Stock ETFs for Inflationary ConditionsTwo equity ETFs designed for inflationary conditions are the Fidelity Stocks for Inflation ETF (FCPI) and the Horizon Kinetics Inflation Beneficiaries ETF (INFL). FCPI gives investors an index-linked option priced at a competitive 0.29%. It tracks the Fidelity Stocks for Inflation Factor index  which has large- and mid-cap U.S. constituent stocks that the index provider believes has the potential to outperform in inflationary conditions. The index is designed relative to the broader market as measured by the Russell 1000 index and is overweight those sectors that benefit from inflation like energy  materials  healthcare  consumer staples  and real estate. The ETF is currently rated 5 stars by CFRA due to its high scores on both the risk and reward parameters in CFRA‚Äôs quantitative ETF rating system.INFL gives investors an actively managed option  although at a higher cost of 0.85%. This ETF also scores high on both CFRA‚Äôs reward and risk dimensions and has an overall 4-star rating in CFRA‚Äôs model due to its slightly lower score on the cost parameter.Table 2: Stock-Based ETFs in the U.S. Intended for Inflationary EnvironmentsIn terms of their constituent holdings  these two ETFs take very different approaches. As of May 9  2022  INFL had the largest exposure to the materials (26%)  financials (26%)  and energy (23%) sectors. It held energy stocks like Viper Energy (VNOM NR) and PrairieSky Royalty (PSK NR) as well as consumer staples like Archer Daniel Midlands (ADM) and Bunge Limited (BG). It also held materials stocks like Franco-Nevada (FNV) and Glencore (GLEN) as well as trading-oriented financials stocks like the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)  ASX Limited (ASX NR) and Deutsche Boerse (DB1).In the same period  FCPI had a much higher weight in the technology (21%)  healthcare (18%)  and consumer staples (11%) sectors. It is important to examine this ETF in relation to the broader market since its sector allocation is designed relative to the Russell 1000 index. It is overweight by 5% in the energy  materials  healthcare  consumer staples  and real estate sectors relative to the broader U.S. equity market and underweight in sectors like IT and financials. As of May 9  2022  the two largest holdings in FCPI were technology stocks Apple (APPL) (5%) and Microsoft (MSFT) (4.3%)  with the ETF also holding healthcare stocks like UnitedHealth (UNH) (2.4%)  Pfizer (PFE) (1.8%) and Anthem (ANTM )(1.6%).Figure 1: Sector Comparison Between FCPI and INFLSource: CFRA ETF database; sponsor websites. As of May 9  2022.Stock ETFs for Rising Rate ConditionsThere are also two equity ETFs listed in the U.S. designed specifically for rising rate conditions  both of which are index linked. The ProShares Equities For Rising Rates ETF (EQRR) is linked to a Nasdaq index designed to track sectors and stocks within those sectors that have a high correlation to 10-year U.S. treasury yields. The Fidelity Dividend ETF for Rising Rates (FDRR) holds large- and mid-cap dividend payors that also have a positive correlation to 10-year U.S. treasury yields.Table 3: Stock-Based ETFs in the U.S. Intended for Inflationary EnvironmentsThese two ETFs also have significant differences in GICS industry exposure. As of May 9  2022  EQRR was more heavily concentrated in financials (32%)  energy (28%)  and materials (22%). Some of the largest holdings were energy stocks like Valero Energy (VLO ***) (3.4%) and Marathon Petroleum (MRO ***) (3.1%) as well as financials like M&T Bank (MTB ***) (3%) and JP Morgan Chase (JPM ***) (2.8%).The holdings of FDRR are spread across a larger number of sectors and the ETF rebalances annually to a sector neutral profile. As of May 9  2022  IT was the largest sector (27%)  and it also had >10% exposure to the healthcare  consumer discretionary  and financials sectors (see Figure 2).Figure 2: Sector Comparison Between EQRR and FDRRSource: CFRA ETF database; sponsor websites. As of May 9  2022.Looking AheadThroughout 2022  the CPI-U and the Fed Funds rate will be very closely watched indicators to gauge the environment facing investors. If inflation persists despite rising rates and quantitative tightening  investors will likely explore different strategies.

4831,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.amateurphotographer.co.uk/latest/photo-news/deana-lawson-wins-deutsche-borse-photography-foundation-prize-166069,Deana Lawson wins Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation Prize,US photographer and educator Deana Lawson has been announced as the winner of the prestigious Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation Prize 2022.,Deana Lawson wins Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation Prize May 13  2022Deana Lawson was announced as the winner of the prestigious Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation Prize 2022 at a special ceremony at The Photographers‚Äô Gallery (TPG)  London  on Thursday  12 May 2022.The influential prize (worth ¬£30 000) has been presented in partnership with Deutsche B√∂rse Group since 2005 ‚Äì it rewards artists and projects recognised as having made a significant contribution to international photography over the past 12 months.Lawson  who comes from Rochester  New York  was awarded the prize for her solo exhibition Centropy  which was originally exhibited at the Kunsthalle Basel from June to October 2020.Lawson presents a distinctive and provocative approach to image making  which  while drawing on art history as well as the wider traditions of photography  proposes a wholly original arena to reframe and reclaim the Black experience.Casting strangersThe photographer  who is a professor of visual arts in the Lewis Center for the Arts at Princeton University  often casts models to pose in a style reminiscent of family photographs.Despite that  there is an intimacy to her portraits and seeming familiarity between the characters  whom Lawson describes as  ‚Äòa mythological extended family.‚ÄôHer interest lies in exploring the space held by communities and individuals and seeks to assert a position within an ever-shifting terrain of racial and ecological disorder for which she evokes a range of strategies.Lawson‚Äôs subject matter is carefully choreographed and harnesses the tropes of family photographs to explore intergenerational relationships and their effects within Black culture.She frequently positions women as central protagonists  alongside the presence of elders  totemic male figures and symbolic or archetypal characters  such as the celestial child.While her figures are often shown in apparently familiar domestic settings  the images contain unsettling elements which function as what the artist calls ‚Äòportals‚Äô into other worlds or portray scenes of death or birth.The presentation at TPG is Lawson‚Äôs first institutional show in the UK.It includes large-scale photographs spanning 2013-2020 are encased in mirrored frames to reflect and utilise light ‚Äì they are presented alongside holograms and rough-hewn blocks of crystal.The juryThe jury of the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation Prize 2022 was Yto Barrada (an artist living in New York and Morocco)  Jessica Dimson (deputy director of photography  The New York Times)  Yasufumi Nakamori (Tate Modern‚Äôs international art [photography] senior curator  London)  Anne-Marie Beckmann (director  Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation) and Brett Rogers OBE (director  The Photographers‚Äô Gallery) as voting chair.Brett Rogers OBE commented  ‚ÄòDeana Lawson is a deserved winner of this year‚Äôs prize  not least for the sheer inventiveness and complexity of her approach to image making. Her work  which reframes and reclaims the Black experience  harnesses the traditional and the experimental and opens up a very unique connection between the everyday and the mystical. Her subject matter sits somewhere between the ‚Äúhere and now‚Äù and the past  a person and a people  the staged and the naturalistic  in a manner which is not didactic or issue driven but genuinely radical. The boldness of her vision and the empowered sensibility she brings to her protagonists is clearly the result of a carefully nuanced collaboration with her cast of ‚Äòfamily‚Äô members  which places her in a rare position of partner or narrator rather than auteur. Huge congratulations from myself and my fellow jurors. I also want to acknowledge the extraordinary work and talent of fellow shortlisted artists Anastasia Samoylova  Gilles Peress and Jo Ractliffe.‚ÄôAnne-Marie Beckmann  director of the Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation  said  ‚ÄòWhile she [Lawson] is grounded in the traditions of photography and in many ways quite classical  her images offer up new possibilities for both the medium and its reception. Interrogating the position of the black body in visual culture and playing with tropes such as family portraiture  artifice and nature  she takes the personal and makes it political  forcing an often-unsettling contemplation of how and what we see.‚ÄôExhibition set to tourThe exhibition (curated by TPG‚Äôs Katrina Schwarz) showcasing the four shortlisted artists for 2022 ‚Äì Deana Lawson  Gilles Peress  Jo Ractliffe and Anastasia Samoylova ‚Äì will remain on display at The Photographers‚Äô Gallery  London  until 12 June 2022.The exhibition will then tour to Deutsche B√∂rse‚Äôs headquarters in Eschborn/Frankfurt  Germany  from 30 June 2022 onwards.Founded in 1996 by TPG  and now in its 26th year  the Prize has become one of the most prestigious international arts awards and has launched and established the careers of many photographers over the years.In 2016 the Prize was retitled the Deutsche BoÃàrse Photography Foundation Prize following the establishment of the foundation as a non-profit organisation dedicated to the collection  exhibition  and promotion of contemporary photography.For more details visit The Photographers‚Äô Gallery website.Related articles:TPG to showcase 2022 Deutsche B√∂rse Photo Prize finalistsPhotographers‚Äô Gallery director on her OBE: ‚ÄòThis is a great honour‚ÄôPhotographers‚Äô Gallery set for move,neutral,0.05,0.93,0.02,mixed,0.37,0.2,0.43,True,English,"['Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation Prize', 'Deana Lawson', 'prestigious Deutsche B√∂rse Photography Foundation Prize', 'Deutsche BoÃàrse Photography Foundation Prize', 'Deutsche B√∂rse Group', 'prestigious international arts awards', 'The New York Times', 'international art [photography', 'The Photographers‚Äô Gallery', 'familiar domestic settings', 'first institutional show', 'Brett Rogers OBE', 'non-profit organisation dedicat', 'four shortlisted artists', 'mythological extended family', 'totemic male figures', 'fellow shortlisted artists', 'international photography', 'influential prize', 'many photographers', 'art history', 'fellow jurors', 'new possibilities', 'visual arts', 'family photographs', 'family‚Äô members', 'family portraiture', 'special ceremony', 'significant contribution', 'Kunsthalle Basel', 'original arena', 'Black experience', 'Lewis Center', 'Princeton University', 'shifting terrain', 'ecological disorder', 'subject matter', 'intergenerational relationships', 'Black culture', 'celestial child', 'unsettling elements', 'other worlds', 'large-scale photographs', 'mirrored frames', 'rough-hewn blocks', 'Yto Barrada', 'Jessica Dimson', 'Yasufumi Nakamori', 'Tate Modern', 'senior curator', 'Anne-Marie Beckmann', 'voting chair', 'sheer inventiveness', 'unique connection', 'empowered sensibility', 'nuanced collaboration', 'Huge congratulations', 'Anastasia Samoylova', 'Gilles Peress', 'Jo Ractliffe', 'many ways', 'black body', 'visual culture', 'unsettling contemplation', 'Katrina Schwarz', 'past 12 months', 'provocative approach', 'image making', 'wider traditions', 'central protagonists', 'archetypal characters', 'deserved winner', 'extraordinary work', '26th year', 'Deana Lawson', 'rare position', 'solo exhibition', 'deputy director', 'TPG', 'London', 'Thursday', 'May', 'partnership', 'projects', 'Rochester', 'Centropy', 'June', 'October', 'distinctive', 'strangers', 'professor', 'models', 'style', 'intimacy', 'portraits', 'familiarity', 'interest', 'space', 'communities', 'individuals', 'racial', 'strategies', 'tropes', 'effects', 'women', 'presence', 'elders', 'symbolic', 'images', 'scenes', 'death', 'birth', 'presentation', 'UK', 'light', 'holograms', 'crystal', 'jury', 'Morocco', 'complexity', 'traditional', 'experimental', 'everyday', 'mystical', 'person', 'people', 'manner', 'boldness', 'vision', 'result', 'cast', 'narrator', 'auteur', 'talent', 'medium', 'reception', 'artifice', 'nature', 'display', 'headquarters', 'Eschborn/Frankfurt', 'Germany', 'careers', 'years', 'establishment']",2022-05-13,2022-05-13,amateurphotographer.co.uk

May 12 (Reuters) - Despite global wheat prices trading at record highs for the time of year  market participants may have been too optimistic on the supply outlook for the upcoming year if the U.S. government‚Äôs new projections are any indication.The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday pegged world wheat ending stocks for the 2022-23 marketing year at 267 million tonnes  a six-year low  well below analyst estimates of 272 million.But relative to estimated global demand  wheat supplies for the upcoming cycle are seen dangerously close to all-time lows and notably below this year‚Äôs reduced levels.Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com RegisterWhen excluding China  world wheat stocks-to-use for 2022-23 falls to 14.9% from 16.4% this year  and it would be the fourth lowest ever. The record of 14.3% was set in 2007-08  and the average from mid-last decade was 19%.That could keep wheat prices elevated into 2023  impacting food prices for consumers globally and ensuring continued high costs for importer countries. Further risks to 2022-23 wheat supplies are possible.Most-active Chicago wheat futures hit a two-month high of $11.83 per bushel on Thursday. Futures in mid-May had traded in the lower $8-range in 2008 and 2011  the month‚Äôs highest prior to 2022.Paris-traded Euronext wheat hit contract highs on Thursday with September reaching 416.25 euros per tonne.USDA's Thursday estimates were its first for the 2022-23 cycle.World wheat stocks-to-use minus ChinaNARROW OUTLOOKOne of the most surprising forecasts on Thursday was U.S. hard red winter wheat production from USDA‚Äôs statistics service at 590 million bushels. Analysts were expecting 685 million  already far off last year‚Äôs 749 million. It would be the United States‚Äô smallest HRW harvest since 1963.Condition ratings in U.S. HRW states are terrible  among the worst ever  though history indicates that USDA‚Äôs prediction could be reasonable. In the last decade  USDA‚Äôs May HRW forecast was substantially closer on average to the final in poor-yielding years than in strong ones.But the U.S. spring wheat crop is of major concern and could limit the country‚Äôs output. As of Sunday  the planting pace was the slowest since 2011 and top producer North Dakota had sown just 8% of the crop versus 37% average. More rains this week may have worsened delays.Ukraine's situation also brings great uncertainty to the wheat market as Russian military still occupies parts of the country  normally a top five exporter. USDA pegged Ukraine's 2022-23 wheat harvest  which was planted last fall  at 21.5 million tonnes  a 10-year low and down 35% on the year.Ukraine's wheat exports were pegged at just 10 million tonnes  down 47% on the year and a nine-year low.Top wheat exporter Russia's crop is forecast to rise more than 6% on the year  but USDA predicts smaller 2022-23 crops in major suppliers Argentina  Australia  India and the European Union by a collective 4%. Unfavorable weather in France and India could pressure volumes there.Canada's wheat harvest is set to rebound 50% from last year's drought-stricken catastrophe  though the planting pace and dry conditions are being eyed by analysts. USDA shows the total U.S. crop rising 5% on the year  but that is completely driven by tentative spring wheat assumptions.China  which is often excluded from global grain analyses due to its stockpiling habit  is slated to have a record 53% of the world's wheat in storage by mid-2023.Karen Braun is a market analyst for Reuters.

Trust Stamp has reported several significant developments over the past quarter as we delivered growth across the business  from our targeted suite of solutions and intellectual property portfolio to our earnings and client base.This strong financial and operational performance reflects Trust Stamp‚Äôs ability to capture diversified market opportunities and grow existing commercial relationships to generate long-term revenue streams. Notably  we expanded upon an existing customer relationship within the government sector while increasing our scope of work with multiple Fortune 500 commercial clients in the financial services sector. Our technology has garnered interest across multiple government use cases in the United States and internationally  addressing pressing concerns around the privacy and security of legacy biometric implementations. Towards this end  Trust Stamp has made a significant investment in expanding our government-facing business development team and are in active discussions with several overseas governments.Story continuesWe continue to innovate through investment in research and development to expand and productize our portfolio of solutions  which has led to five patent issuances and nine new patent application filings in Q1. Trust Stamp‚Äôs core technology delivers unparalleled security  utility  and privacy  at a fraction of the cost of traditional biometric solutions  driving commercial growth as we address cross-industry needs for fraud prevention  operational efficiency  and accessibility in digital services.We are notably pleased with the launch and commercial adoption of our next-generation Biometric Multi-Factor Authentication (Biometric MFATM) offering and Identity Orchestration Platform  which transforms secure digital operations across the identity lifecycle with seamless rapid deployment of custom workflows built on our range of innovative AI-powered solutions.

On behalf of the Trust Stamp team  I want to thank our shareholders for your continued support as we execute our mission to accelerate secure global financial and societal inclusion.‚ÄùFinancial Performance OverviewRevenueNet revenue increased by $2.29 million or 430.0%  to $2.82 million for Q1 2022  compared to $532 thousand for Q1 2021. This increase was primarily due to revenue contracts executed by newly acquired and existing customers.Gross ProfitGross profit increased by a notable $1.86 million or 673.9% year-over-year in the first quarter  while gross profit margin improved to 75.4% in Q1 2022  compared to 51.6% for Q1 2021. The improvement was due in part to the Company‚Äôs prior investment in research and development  which enabled the utilization of existing technologies with relatively nominal implementation costs for new deployments.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development (R&D) costs decreased by $261 thousand or 34.6% year-over-year in the first quarter. The decrease in R&D expenses in the comparison periods was driven by the Company‚Äôs continued efforts to transition software development resources towards expanding internal capabilities and away from external third-party software development.Selling  General  and Administrative ExpensesSelling  general  and administrative (SG&A) expense increased to $3.12 million for Q1 2022  compared to $1.33 million for Q1 2021. The increase in SG&A expense during the period ended March 31  2022 was driven by legal and professional services fees  other fees related to the listing of the Company‚Äôs common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market  and internal sales commissions.Operating LossOperating loss decreased by $295 thousand to $1.64 million for Q1 2022  compared to $1.94 million for Q1 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in operating loss was the growth in net revenue  which outpaced the growth in operating costs by a factor of 5.3. Adjusting for additional non-cash and non-recurring activities results in an even more significant improvement to the operating margin.Net LossNet loss decreased 16.7% or $0.07 per basic and diluted share for Q1 2022 to $1.69M from $2.03 million or $0.11 per basic and diluted share for the same period last year.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of March 31  2022  and December 31  2021  the Company had approximately $5.84 million and $3.48 million of cash  respectively. The increase in cash during the comparative periods was a result of the net positive cash inflow from the combination of financing and operating activities. In Q1 2022  the Company received $1.95 million related to a government contract and $3.32 million from a warrant exercise  as well as $365 thousand in units sold and warrants exercised in connection to the Company's 2022 fundraising efforts in preparation for its Nasdaq listing.Total working capital as of March 31  2022 was $5.63 million  compared to $3.36 million as of December 31  2021.

This decrease can be explained primarily by lower volumes on several products  in particular hand sanitizers  as well as a lower R&D activity over the quarter. The activity however benefited from the first positive effects of the commercial production of Estetrol for Mithra at the Villeneuve-la-Garenne site and which volumes are expected to increase over the rest of 2022 and in 2023  as well as from a strong demand at the sites of Turku in Finland and Aramon.Fine Specialty ChemicalsNet sales of Fine Specialty Chemicals totaled ‚Ç¨19.9 million  a 20.5% increase compared to 2021 (+18.2% at a constant exchange rate). All the activities have experienced a strong growth in sales with  in particular  a very strong demand on Electronics  Cosmetics and Lubricant Additives. Supply and logistical difficulties were able to be controlled and ultimately had only a small impact on net sales. Several new projects were also launched.OutlookAll the PCAS Group teams  with the support of its majority shareholder Seqens for the financing of its activities and its development  remain fully committed to improving the results in 2022 and a return to positive results in 2023  supported by the ramp-up in Estetrol volumes for Mithra.Story continuesNEXT FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE:Shareholders‚Äô meeting  June 9  2022ABOUT PCASPCAS specializes in the development and production of complex molecules for life sciences and innovative technologies.

Restricted cash was $5 million as of March 31  2022  of which $0.5 million were classified as current financial assets.NEW YORK  May 12  2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Cellectis (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù) (Euronext Growth: ALCLS - NASDAQ: CLLS)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies  today provided a business update and announced its results for the three-month period ending March 31  2022.‚ÄúCellectis made progress with our pipeline this quarter. We took a notable step forward with the first pre-clinical data on UCART20x22  the allogeneic dual CAR T-cell product candidate being developed for patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma (NHL). We were proud to see that the data demonstrated a robust pre-clinical proof-of-concept with strong activity against tumor cell lines expressing either a single antigen  CD20 or CD22  or both simultaneously.We were proud to publish preclinical data in Nature Communications  providing validation of our product candidate UCART123  being developed for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This is the first preclinical data published on UCART123 supporting the rationale for using allogeneic CD123-directed CAR T cells to treat AML and blastic plasmacytoid denditric cell neoplasm (BPDCN). These preclinical results reinforce our commitment to deliver therapies for cancer patients with unmet medical needs.The development of our partnerships was an exciting highlight for Cellectis. In March  our partner Iovance Biotherapeutics announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to proceed for its first TALEN¬Æ-edited Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) therapy  developed using Cellectis‚Äô technology. In April  we received a $20 million convertible note  representing the upfront collaboration consideration under our collaboration agreement with Cytovia Therapeutics. Cellectis is developing custom TALEN¬Æ for Cytovia to develop gene-edited iPSC-derived Natural Killer cells. These announcements validated our belief that TALEN¬Æ‚Äôs status as technology of choice for gene editing.Based on our current operating plan  our cash position of $142 million at the end of the first quarter 2022 (excluding Calyxt  Inc.)  is expected to fund our operations into early 2024.As we approach several developmental milestones during the second half of this year  we are excited to expand our CAR T platform by the expected filing of an IND for UCART20x22  and release of batches of this product from our in-house manufacturing facility. UCART20x22 is expected to be Cellectis‚Äô first product candidate with fully integrated in-house development ‚Äù said Andr√© Choulika  CEO of Cellectis.Pipeline highlightsCellectis continues to make progress  enrolling patients throughout its three sponsored Phase 1 dose escalation trials:BALLI-01 (evaluating UCART22) in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL)UCART22 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD22 and being evaluated in patients with r/r B-ALL in the BALLI-01  multicenter  Phase 1 dose escalation clinical study.BALLI-01 is currently enrolling patients at dose level 3 (DL3) with Fludarabine  Cyclophosphamide and Alemtuzumab (FCA) preconditioning regimen.Cellectis plans to initiate dosing patients with UCART22 product candidate that is expected to be fully manufactured in-house in the second half of this year.AMELI-01 (evaluating UCART123) in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML)UCART123 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD123 and being evaluated in patients with r/r AML in the AMELI-01  multi-center Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.AMELI-01 is currently enrolling patients at dose level 2 (DL2) (6.25 √ó 105 cells/kg) with FCA preconditioning regimen.MELANI-01 (evaluating UCARTCS1) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)UCARTCS1 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CS1 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r MM in the MELANI-01  multi-center Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.Cellectis is currently enrolling patients at dose level 1 (DL1) with Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide (FC) preconditioning regimen.UCART Preclinical Data and ProgramsUCART123:On April 28  Cellectis published two manuscripts in Nature Communications providing preclinical validation of UCART123 to treat AML.Preclinical data showed that:Cellectis‚Äô product candidate UCART123 effectively eliminates AML cells in vitro and in vivo in mouse models with significant benefits in overall animal survival and minimal impact against normal hematopoietic progenitors.UCART123 demonstrates cytotoxic activity against primary AML samples with minimum toxicity against normal hematopoietic progenitor cells.Support Cellectis‚Äô rationale of using allogeneic CD123 CAR T cells to treat AML.UCART20x22:UCART20x22 is Cellectis‚Äô first allogeneic dual CAR T-cell product candidate being developed for patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r NHL).On April 8  Cellectis released its first preclinical data at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. The poster presentation highlighted the following results: UCART20x22 shows strong activity against tumor cell lines expressing either a single antigen  CD20 or CD22  or both simultaneously.In vivo pre-clinical models demonstrates that UCART20x22 efficiently eradicates tumors expressing both or either antigen  and sustained presence of UCART20x22 cells was observed in the bone marrow after tumor clearance.In vitro assays against primary cells from NHL patients with diverse CD22 and CD20 antigen levels demonstrate that UCART20x22 has potent and specific cytotoxic activity.UCART20x22 would be Cellectis‚Äô first product candidate fully designed  developed and manufactured in-house from day zero  showcasing the Company‚Äôs transformation into an end-to-end cell and gene therapy platform from discovery  product development and manufacturing to clinical development.An Investigational New Drug application (IND) for UCART20x22 is expected to be filed this year.Licensed Allogeneic CAR-T Cell Development ProgramsAllogene Therapeutics  Inc.‚Äôs CAR T programs utilize Cellectis technologies. ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A are anti-CD19 products being jointly developed under a collaboration agreement between Les Laboratoires Servier (‚ÄúServier‚Äù) and Allogene Therapeutics  Inc. (‚ÄúAllogene‚Äù) based on an exclusive license granted by Cellectis to Servier1. Servier grants to Allogene exclusive rights to ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A in the U.S. while Servier retains exclusive rights for all other countries. Allogene‚Äôs anti-BCMA and anti-CD70 programs are licensed exclusively from Cellectis by Allogene and Allogene holds global development and commercial rights to these programs.Servier and Allogene: anti-CD19 programsEnrollment in the Phase 1 ALLO-501A ALPHA2 trial in relapsed/refractory (r/r) Large B Cell Lymphoma (LBCL) has re-opened with the goal of offering AlloCAR T‚Ñ¢ to patients while Allogene prepares to launch the pivotal Phase 2 ALPHA2 trial. Allogene has announced that subject to FDA discussion  including with respect to chemistry  manufacturing and controls (CMC)  Allogene plans to proceed to the Phase 2 portion of the ALPHA2 trial in adult patients with r/r LBCL in mid-2022.Allogene: anti-BCMA and anti-CD70 programsAnti-BCMA programAllogene announced that enrollment had previously resumed in trials targeting BCMA for the treatment of patients with r/r multiple myeloma (MM)  including the UNIVERSAL trial with ALLO-715 and the IGNITE trial with TurboCAR‚Ñ¢ candidate  ALLO-605. During the quarter  preclinical data was published by Allogene demonstrating the superior long-term in vitro myeloma-killing activity of allogeneic anti-BCMA CAR T cells from healthy donors compared with anti-BCMA CAR T cells from patients with MM. The findings were published in Cancer Research Communications  a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR).In May 2022  Allogene announced that U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for ALLO-605 for the treatment of MM. Allogene intends to provide an update on its CD19 and BCMA programs by the end of the year.Anti-CD70 programALLO-316 is Allogene‚Äôs first AlloCAR T candidate for solid tumors. The Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial is designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  anti-tumor efficacy  pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics of ALLO-316 in patients with advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Allogene announced that the trial  now in its second dose level cohort  continues to accrue patients.In April 2022  Allogene presented preclinical data at the 2022 AACR Annual Meeting which support the ongoing clinical evaluation of ALLO-316 for the treatment of patients with RCC and other CD70 expressing cancers. The findings were simultaneously published in AACR‚Äôs Cancer Research.In March 2022  Allogene announced that the FDA granted ALLO-316 Fast Track Designation (FTD) based on its potential to address the unmet need for patients with difficult to treat RCC who have failed standard RCC therapies.Manufacturing FacilitiesCellectis‚Äô starting materials manufacturing facility in Paris  France is focusing on the production of starting materials including plasmids and mRNA for our TALEN¬Æ gene editing technology  as well as viral vectors for use in clinical manufacturing.Cellectis‚Äô UCART GMP manufacturing facility in Raleigh  North Carolina is focusing on release testing of batches of product candidates UCART22 and UCART20x22 as well as manufacturing additional batches of these products.Partnerships:Iovance Biotherapeutics  Inc. (‚ÄúIovance‚Äù)On March 15  2022 Iovance announced that the FDA allowed an IND to proceed for its first genetically modified TIL therapy  IOV-4001  for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma and stage III or IV NSCLC.IOV-4001 leverages the gene editing TALEN¬Æ technology licensed from Cellectis to inactivate the gene coding for the PD-1 protein. By removal of this important barrier for T cells to attack cancer  IOV-4001 has the potential to become an optimized  next generation TIL therapy for several solid tumor cancers. Iovance announced that a clinical study of IOV-4001 in patients with metastatic melanoma or stage III or IV NSCLC is expected to begin this year.A poster highlighting preclinical activity  clinical-scale manufacturing process development  and characterization of IOV-4001 was presented by Iovance at the AACR 2022 Annual Meeting. In the abstract  anti-tumor activity of IOV-4001 was shown to be superior to non-edited TIL  as well as to non-edited TIL in combination with anti-PD-1  in a murine model.In January 2020  Iovance and Cellectis entered into a research collaboration and exclusive worldwide license agreement whereby Iovance licensed certain TALEN¬Æ technology from Cellectis. The worldwide exclusive license enables Iovance to use certain TALEN¬Æ technology addressing multiple gene targets to modify TIL for therapeutic use in several cancer indications.Cytovia Therapeutics  Inc. (‚ÄúCytovia‚Äù)On April 27  2022  Cellectis received a $20 million convertible note (the ‚Äú2022 Convertible Note‚Äù) in payment of the upfront collaboration consideration provided for pursuant to the research collaboration and non-exclusive license agreement entered between Cellectis and Cytovia in February 2021. The 2022 Convertible Note superseded and replaced the equity compensation initial requirement under the collaboration and license agreement with Cytovia.The terms of the note provide for conversion into common stock of the combined company upon completion of the business combination of Cytovia with Iselworth Healthcare Acquisition Corp.  a special purpose acquisition company. In connection with this convertible note  Cellectis received a warrant to purchase additional shares of the combined company representing up to 35% of the shares issued upon conversion of the note at a predetermined exercise price  with the number of shares issuable upon exercise and the exercise subject to certain adjustments.Cellectis is developing custom TALEN¬Æ  which Cytovia uses to edit iPSCs. Cytovia is responsible for the differentiation and expansion of the gene-edited iPSC master cell bank into NK cells and is conducting the pre-clinical evaluation  clinical development  and commercialization of the mutually-agreed-upon selected therapeutic candidates. Cellectis has granted Cytovia a worldwide license under the patent rights over which Cellectis has control in this field  including in China  in order for Cytovia to modify NK cells to address multiple gene-targets for therapeutic use in several cancer indications.Financial ResultsThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  which consolidate the results of Calyxt  Inc. of which Cellectis owned approximately 56.1% of outstanding shares of common stock (as of March 31  2022)  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‚ÄúIFRS‚Äù).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments ‚Äì Therapeutics and Plants ‚Äì in the appendices of this Q1 2022 financial results press release.Cash: As of March 31  2022  Cellectis  including Calyxt  had $160 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  current financial assets and restricted cash of which $142 million are attributable to Cellectis on a stand-alone basis. This compares to $191 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  current financial assets and restricted cash as of December 31  2021  of which $177 million was attributable to Cellectis on a stand-alone basis. This net decrease of $31 million primarily reflects (i) $33 million of net cash flows used in operating  investing and lease financing activities of Cellectis  (ii) $7 million of net cash flows used in operating  capital expenditures and lease financing activities of Calyxt and (iii) $2 millions of unfavorable FOREX impact which was partially offset by (iv) $10 million of net proceeds from capital raise at Calyxt. Based on the current operating plan  Cellectis excluding Calyxt anticipates that the cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of $142 million as of March 31  2022 will fund its operations into early 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $4 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 compared to $28 million for the three months ended March 31  2021. 99% of consolidated revenues and other income was attributable to Cellectis in the first three months of 2022. This decrease between the three months ended March 31  2022 and 2021 was mainly attributable to (i) a decrease of revenue pursuant to the recognition of a $15.0 million convertible note obtained as consideration for a ‚Äúright-to-use‚Äù license granted to Cytovia and a $5.0 million Allogene milestone during the three-month period ended March 31  2021  while revenue related to collaboration agreements for the three months of 2022 consists of the recognition of two milestones related to Cellectis‚Äô agreement with Cytovia for $1.5 million and (ii) a decrease in other revenues of $5 million relating to the timing of revenue stream from the Calyxt‚Äôs business model for its PlantSpring technology and BioFactory compared to the Calyxt‚Äôs sales in the prior year of soybean products.Cost of Revenues: Consolidated cost of revenues were $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 compared to $8 million for the three months ended March 31  2021. This decrease is driven by Calyxt‚Äôs business model for its PlantSpring and BioFactory compared to the sales of soybean products under its prior business model.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $29 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 compared to $31 million for the three months ended March 31  2021. 90% of consolidated R&D expenses was attributable to Cellectis in the first three months of 2022. The $2 million decrease between the first three months of 2022 and 2021 was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease of purchases  external expenses and other by $2 million (from $18 million in 2021 to $16 million in 2022) due to lower consumables  subcontracting costs and depreciation and amortization for the therapeutic segment  and (ii) a $1 million decrease in social charges on stock option partially offset by an increase of $2 million in wages and salaries mainly driven by the increased R&D headcount in the therapeutic segment.SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $9 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 and 2021. 65% of consolidated SG&A expenses was attributable to Cellectis in the first three months of 2022. The $0.5 million increase primarily reflects a $1 million increase in purchases  external expenses and other (from $4 million in 2021 to $5 million in 2022) and (ii) a $3 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense mainly explained by the favorable impact in 2021 of the recapture of non-cash stock-based compensation from the forfeiture of certain of Calyxt‚Äôs former CEO‚Äôs unvested stock options  restricted stock units  and performance stock units following his departure  partially offset by (i) a $3 million decrease in wages and salaries and (ii) a $0.3 million decrease in social charges on stock option grants.Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $32 million (or $0.70 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2022  of which $28 million was attributed to Cellectis  compared to $12 million (or $0.28 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2021  of which $6 million was attributed to Cellectis. This $20 million increase in net loss between first three months 2022 and 2021 was primarily driven by a decrease in revenues and other income of $24 million  a decrease in financial gain of $4 million and a decrease of $1 million in non-controlling interest  partially offset by a $9 million decrease in operating expenses.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $29 million (or $0.64 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2022  of which $26 million is attributed to Cellectis  compared to a net loss of $11 million (or $0.26 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2021  of which $4 million was attributed to Cellectis.

Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense‚Äîa non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis‚Äô financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company‚Äôs operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME ‚Äì First three-months(unaudited)($ in thousands  except per share data)For the three-month period ended March 31  2021 2022 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (11 868 ) (31 911 ) Adjustment:Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 595 2 648 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (11 273 ) (29 263 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0 26 ) (0 64 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) (1) 42 866 517 45 486 477 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0 26 ) (0 64 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) (1) 43 461 047 45 486 477(1) When we have adjusted net loss  in accordance with IFRS  we use the Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic to compute the Diluted adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share).

We took a notable step forward with the first pre-clinical data on UCART20x22  the allogeneic dual CAR T-cell product candidate being developed for patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin‚Äôs lymphoma (NHL). We were proud to see that the data demonstrated a robust pre-clinical proof-of-concept with strong activity against tumor cell lines expressing either a single antigen  CD20 or CD22  or both simultaneously.We were proud to publish preclinical data in Nature Communications  providing validation of our product candidate UCART123  being developed for patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This is the first preclinical data published on UCART123 supporting the rationale for using allogeneic CD123-directed CAR T cells to treat AML and blastic plasmacytoid denditric cell neoplasm (BPDCN). These preclinical results reinforce our commitment to deliver therapies for cancer patients with unmet medical needs.Story continuesThe development of our partnerships was an exciting highlight for Cellectis. In March  our partner Iovance Biotherapeutics announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allowed an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) to proceed for its first TALEN¬Æ-edited Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TIL) therapy  developed using Cellectis‚Äô technology. In April  we received a $20 million convertible note  representing the upfront collaboration consideration under our collaboration agreement with Cytovia Therapeutics. Cellectis is developing custom TALEN¬Æ for Cytovia to develop gene-edited iPSC-derived Natural Killer cells. These announcements validated our belief that TALEN¬Æ‚Äôs status as technology of choice for gene editing.Based on our current operating plan  our cash position of $142 million at the end of the first quarter 2022 (excluding Calyxt  Inc.)  is expected to fund our operations into early 2024.As we approach several developmental milestones during the second half of this year  we are excited to expand our CAR T platform by the expected filing of an IND for UCART20x22  and release of batches of this product from our in-house manufacturing facility. UCART20x22 is expected to be Cellectis‚Äô first product candidate with fully integrated in-house development ‚Äù said Andr√© Choulika  CEO of Cellectis.Pipeline highlightsCellectis continues to make progress  enrolling patients throughout its three sponsored Phase 1 dose escalation trials:BALLI-01 (evaluating UCART22) in relapsed or refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (r/r B-ALL)UCART22 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD22 and being evaluated in patients with r/r B-ALL in the BALLI-01  multicenter  Phase 1 dose escalation clinical study.BALLI-01 is currently enrolling patients at dose level 3 (DL3) with Fludarabine  Cyclophosphamide and Alemtuzumab (FCA) preconditioning regimen.Cellectis plans to initiate dosing patients with UCART22 product candidate that is expected to be fully manufactured in-house in the second half of this year.AMELI-01 (evaluating UCART123) in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML)UCART123 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD123 and being evaluated in patients with r/r AML in the AMELI-01  multi-center Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.AMELI-01 is currently enrolling patients at dose level 2 (DL2) (6.25 √ó 105 cells/kg) with FCA preconditioning regimen.MELANI-01 (evaluating UCARTCS1) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)UCARTCS1 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CS1 and is being evaluated in patients with r/r MM in the MELANI-01  multi-center Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical study.Cellectis is currently enrolling patients at dose level 1 (DL1) with Fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide (FC) preconditioning regimen.UCART Preclinical Data and ProgramsUCART123:On April 28  Cellectis published two manuscripts in Nature Communications providing preclinical validation of UCART123 to treat AML.Preclinical data showed that:Cellectis‚Äô product candidate UCART123 effectively eliminates AML cells in vitro and in vivo in mouse models with significant benefits in overall animal survival and minimal impact against normal hematopoietic progenitors.UCART123 demonstrates cytotoxic activity against primary AML samples with minimum toxicity against normal hematopoietic progenitor cells.Support Cellectis‚Äô rationale of using allogeneic CD123 CAR T cells to treat AML.UCART20x22:UCART20x22 is Cellectis‚Äô first allogeneic dual CAR T-cell product candidate being developed for patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r NHL).On April 8  Cellectis released its first preclinical data at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting. The poster presentation highlighted the following results: UCART20x22 shows strong activity against tumor cell lines expressing either a single antigen  CD20 or CD22  or both simultaneously.In vivo pre-clinical models demonstrates that UCART20x22 efficiently eradicates tumors expressing both or either antigen  and sustained presence of UCART20x22 cells was observed in the bone marrow after tumor clearance.In vitro assays against primary cells from NHL patients with diverse CD22 and CD20 antigen levels demonstrate that UCART20x22 has potent and specific cytotoxic activity.UCART20x22 would be Cellectis‚Äô first product candidate fully designed  developed and manufactured in-house from day zero  showcasing the Company‚Äôs transformation into an end-to-end cell and gene therapy platform from discovery  product development and manufacturing to clinical development.An Investigational New Drug application (IND) for UCART20x22 is expected to be filed this year.Licensed Allogeneic CAR-T Cell Development ProgramsAllogene Therapeutics  Inc.‚Äôs CAR T programs utilize Cellectis technologies. ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A are anti-CD19 products being jointly developed under a collaboration agreement between Les Laboratoires Servier (‚ÄúServier‚Äù) and Allogene Therapeutics  Inc. (‚ÄúAllogene‚Äù) based on an exclusive license granted by Cellectis to Servier1. Servier grants to Allogene exclusive rights to ALLO-501 and ALLO-501A in the U.S. while Servier retains exclusive rights for all other countries. Allogene‚Äôs anti-BCMA and anti-CD70 programs are licensed exclusively from Cellectis by Allogene and Allogene holds global development and commercial rights to these programs.Servier and Allogene: anti-CD19 programsEnrollment in the Phase 1 ALLO-501A ALPHA2 trial in relapsed/refractory (r/r) Large B Cell Lymphoma (LBCL) has re-opened with the goal of offering AlloCAR T‚Ñ¢ to patients while Allogene prepares to launch the pivotal Phase 2 ALPHA2 trial. Allogene has announced that subject to FDA discussion  including with respect to chemistry  manufacturing and controls (CMC)  Allogene plans to proceed to the Phase 2 portion of the ALPHA2 trial in adult patients with r/r LBCL in mid-2022.Allogene: anti-BCMA and anti-CD70 programsAnti-BCMA programAllogene announced that enrollment had previously resumed in trials targeting BCMA for the treatment of patients with r/r multiple myeloma (MM)  including the UNIVERSAL trial with ALLO-715 and the IGNITE trial with TurboCAR‚Ñ¢ candidate  ALLO-605. During the quarter  preclinical data was published by Allogene demonstrating the superior long-term in vitro myeloma-killing activity of allogeneic anti-BCMA CAR T cells from healthy donors compared with anti-BCMA CAR T cells from patients with MM. The findings were published in Cancer Research Communications  a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR).In May 2022  Allogene announced that U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) for ALLO-605 for the treatment of MM. Allogene intends to provide an update on its CD19 and BCMA programs by the end of the year.Anti-CD70 programALLO-316 is Allogene‚Äôs first AlloCAR T candidate for solid tumors. The Phase 1 TRAVERSE trial is designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  anti-tumor efficacy  pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics of ALLO-316 in patients with advanced or metastatic clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Allogene announced that the trial  now in its second dose level cohort  continues to accrue patients.In April 2022  Allogene presented preclinical data at the 2022 AACR Annual Meeting which support the ongoing clinical evaluation of ALLO-316 for the treatment of patients with RCC and other CD70 expressing cancers. The findings were simultaneously published in AACR‚Äôs Cancer Research.In March 2022  Allogene announced that the FDA granted ALLO-316 Fast Track Designation (FTD) based on its potential to address the unmet need for patients with difficult to treat RCC who have failed standard RCC therapies.Manufacturing FacilitiesCellectis‚Äô starting materials manufacturing facility in Paris  France is focusing on the production of starting materials including plasmids and mRNA for our TALEN¬Æ gene editing technology  as well as viral vectors for use in clinical manufacturing.Cellectis‚Äô UCART GMP manufacturing facility in Raleigh  North Carolina is focusing on release testing of batches of product candidates UCART22 and UCART20x22 as well as manufacturing additional batches of these products.Partnerships:Iovance Biotherapeutics  Inc. (‚ÄúIovance‚Äù)On March 15  2022 Iovance announced that the FDA allowed an IND to proceed for its first genetically modified TIL therapy  IOV-4001  for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma and stage III or IV NSCLC.IOV-4001 leverages the gene editing TALEN¬Æ technology licensed from Cellectis to inactivate the gene coding for the PD-1 protein. By removal of this important barrier for T cells to attack cancer  IOV-4001 has the potential to become an optimized  next generation TIL therapy for several solid tumor cancers. Iovance announced that a clinical study of IOV-4001 in patients with metastatic melanoma or stage III or IV NSCLC is expected to begin this year.A poster highlighting preclinical activity  clinical-scale manufacturing process development  and characterization of IOV-4001 was presented by Iovance at the AACR 2022 Annual Meeting. In the abstract  anti-tumor activity of IOV-4001 was shown to be superior to non-edited TIL  as well as to non-edited TIL in combination with anti-PD-1  in a murine model.In January 2020  Iovance and Cellectis entered into a research collaboration and exclusive worldwide license agreement whereby Iovance licensed certain TALEN¬Æ technology from Cellectis. The worldwide exclusive license enables Iovance to use certain TALEN¬Æ technology addressing multiple gene targets to modify TIL for therapeutic use in several cancer indications.Cytovia Therapeutics  Inc. (‚ÄúCytovia‚Äù)On April 27  2022  Cellectis received a $20 million convertible note (the ‚Äú2022 Convertible Note‚Äù) in payment of the upfront collaboration consideration provided for pursuant to the research collaboration and non-exclusive license agreement entered between Cellectis and Cytovia in February 2021. The 2022 Convertible Note superseded and replaced the equity compensation initial requirement under the collaboration and license agreement with Cytovia.The terms of the note provide for conversion into common stock of the combined company upon completion of the business combination of Cytovia with Iselworth Healthcare Acquisition Corp.  a special purpose acquisition company. In connection with this convertible note  Cellectis received a warrant to purchase additional shares of the combined company representing up to 35% of the shares issued upon conversion of the note at a predetermined exercise price  with the number of shares issuable upon exercise and the exercise subject to certain adjustments.Cellectis is developing custom TALEN¬Æ  which Cytovia uses to edit iPSCs. Cytovia is responsible for the differentiation and expansion of the gene-edited iPSC master cell bank into NK cells and is conducting the pre-clinical evaluation  clinical development  and commercialization of the mutually-agreed-upon selected therapeutic candidates. Cellectis has granted Cytovia a worldwide license under the patent rights over which Cellectis has control in this field  including in China  in order for Cytovia to modify NK cells to address multiple gene-targets for therapeutic use in several cancer indications.Financial ResultsThe interim condensed consolidated financial statements of Cellectis  which consolidate the results of Calyxt  Inc. of which Cellectis owned approximately 56.1% of outstanding shares of common stock (as of March 31  2022)  have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‚ÄúIFRS‚Äù).We present certain financial metrics broken out between our two reportable segments ‚Äì Therapeutics and Plants ‚Äì in the appendices of this Q1 2022 financial results press release.Cash: As of March 31  2022  Cellectis  including Calyxt  had $160 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  current financial assets and restricted cash of which $142 million are attributable to Cellectis on a stand-alone basis. This compares to $191 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  current financial assets and restricted cash as of December 31  2021  of which $177 million was attributable to Cellectis on a stand-alone basis. This net decrease of $31 million primarily reflects (i) $33 million of net cash flows used in operating  investing and lease financing activities of Cellectis  (ii) $7 million of net cash flows used in operating  capital expenditures and lease financing activities of Calyxt and (iii) $2 millions of unfavorable FOREX impact which was partially offset by (iv) $10 million of net proceeds from capital raise at Calyxt. Based on the current operating plan  Cellectis excluding Calyxt anticipates that the cash  cash equivalents  and restricted cash of $142 million as of March 31  2022 will fund its operations into early 2024.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $4 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 compared to $28 million for the three months ended March 31  2021. 99% of consolidated revenues and other income was attributable to Cellectis in the first three months of 2022. This decrease between the three months ended March 31  2022 and 2021 was mainly attributable to (i) a decrease of revenue pursuant to the recognition of a $15.0 million convertible note obtained as consideration for a ‚Äúright-to-use‚Äù license granted to Cytovia and a $5.0 million Allogene milestone during the three-month period ended March 31  2021  while revenue related to collaboration agreements for the three months of 2022 consists of the recognition of two milestones related to Cellectis‚Äô agreement with Cytovia for $1.5 million and (ii) a decrease in other revenues of $5 million relating to the timing of revenue stream from the Calyxt‚Äôs business model for its PlantSpring technology and BioFactory compared to the Calyxt‚Äôs sales in the prior year of soybean products.Cost of Revenues: Consolidated cost of revenues were $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 compared to $8 million for the three months ended March 31  2021. This decrease is driven by Calyxt‚Äôs business model for its PlantSpring and BioFactory compared to the sales of soybean products under its prior business model.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $29 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 compared to $31 million for the three months ended March 31  2021. 90% of consolidated R&D expenses was attributable to Cellectis in the first three months of 2022. The $2 million decrease between the first three months of 2022 and 2021 was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease of purchases  external expenses and other by $2 million (from $18 million in 2021 to $16 million in 2022) due to lower consumables  subcontracting costs and depreciation and amortization for the therapeutic segment  and (ii) a $1 million decrease in social charges on stock option partially offset by an increase of $2 million in wages and salaries mainly driven by the increased R&D headcount in the therapeutic segment.SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $9 million for the three months ended March 31  2022 and 2021. 65% of consolidated SG&A expenses was attributable to Cellectis in the first three months of 2022. The $0.5 million increase primarily reflects a $1 million increase in purchases  external expenses and other (from $4 million in 2021 to $5 million in 2022) and (ii) a $3 million increase in non-cash stock-based compensation expense mainly explained by the favorable impact in 2021 of the recapture of non-cash stock-based compensation from the forfeiture of certain of Calyxt‚Äôs former CEO‚Äôs unvested stock options  restricted stock units  and performance stock units following his departure  partially offset by (i) a $3 million decrease in wages and salaries and (ii) a $0.3 million decrease in social charges on stock option grants.Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $32 million (or $0.70 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2022  of which $28 million was attributed to Cellectis  compared to $12 million (or $0.28 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2021  of which $6 million was attributed to Cellectis. This $20 million increase in net loss between first three months 2022 and 2021 was primarily driven by a decrease in revenues and other income of $24 million  a decrease in financial gain of $4 million and a decrease of $1 million in non-controlling interest  partially offset by a $9 million decrease in operating expenses.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $29 million (or $0.64 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2022  of which $26 million is attributed to Cellectis  compared to a net loss of $11 million (or $0.26 per share) for the three months ended March 31  2021  of which $4 million was attributed to Cellectis. Please see ""Note Regarding Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for the Full Year of 2022 in the following areas:Supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART123  UCART22  UCARTCS1 and new product candidates  andOperating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France)  and Raleigh (North Carolina  U.S.A); andContinuing strengthening our manufacturing and clinical departments.CELLECTIS S.A.(unaudited)STATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION($ in thousands  except per share data)As of December 31  2021 March 31  2022 ASSETS Non-current assets Intangible assets 1 854 1 698 Property  plant  and equipment 78 846 76 523 Right-of-use assets 69 423 67 227 Non-current financial assets 6 524 6 567 Total non-current assets 156 647 152 016 Current assets Trade receivables 20 361 21 839 Subsidies receivables 9 268 10 446 Other current assets 9 665 7 524 Cash and cash equivalent and Current financial assets 186 135 155 367 Total current assets 225 429 195 175 TOTAL ASSETS 382 076 347 191 LIABILITIES Shareholders‚Äô equity Share capital 2 945 2 945 Premiums related to the share capital 934 696 937 333 Currency translation adjustment (18 021 ) (21 261 ) Retained earnings (584 129 ) (696 062 ) Net income (loss) (114 197 ) (31 911 ) Total shareholders‚Äô equity - Group Share 221 293 191 044 Non-controlling interests 15 181 12 010 Total shareholders‚Äô equity 236 474 203 054 Non-current liabilities Non-current financial liabilities 20 030 18 345 Non-current lease debts 71 526 69 739 Non-current provisions 4 073 3 716 Non-current liabilities 626 - Total non-current liabilities 96 254 91 800 Current liabilities Current financial liabilities 2 354 12 607 Current lease debts 8 329 8 408 Trade payables 23 762 20 921 Deferred revenues and deferred income 301 581 Current provisions 871 578 Other current liabilities 13 731 9 242 Total current liabilities 49 348 52 337 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS‚Äô EQUITY 382 076 347 191Cellectis S.A.UNAUDITED STATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATIONSFor the three-month period ended March 31 $ in thousands  except per share amountsFor the three-month period ended March 31  2021 2022 Revenues and other income Revenues 25 601 1 697 Other income 2 365 2 135 Total revenues and other income 27 966 3 832 Operating expenses Cost of revenue (8 145 ) (385 ) Research and development expenses (31 004 ) (29 479 ) Selling  general and administrative expenses (8 779 ) (9 279 ) Other operating income (expenses) 56 65 Total operating expenses (47 872 ) (39 078 ) Operating income (loss) (19 907 ) (35 247 ) Financial gain (loss) 4 561 490 Net income (loss) (15 346 ) (34 757 ) Attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (11 868 ) (31 911 ) Attributable to non-controlling interests (3 478 ) (2 846 ) Basic net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis per share ($/share) (0 28 ) (0 70 ) Diluted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis per share ($/share) (0 28 ) (0 70 )CELLECTIS S.A.DETAILS OF KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS BY REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ‚Äì First three-months(unaudited) - ($ in thousands)For the three-month period ended March 31  2021 For the three-month period ended March 31  2022 $ in thousands Plants Therapeutics Total reportable segments Plants Therapeutics Total reportable segments External revenues 4 988 20 613 25 601 32 1 665 1 697 External other income - 2 365 2 365 - 2 135 2 135 External revenues and other income 4 988 22 978 27 966 32 3 800 3 832 Cost of revenue (7 369 ) (776 ) (8 145 ) (0 ) (385 ) (385 ) Research and development expenses (3 025 ) (27 979 ) (31 004 ) (2 878 ) (26 601 ) (29 479 ) Selling  general and administrative expenses (4 118 ) (4 660 ) (8 779 ) (3 216 ) (6 063 ) (9 279 ) Other operating income and expenses (24 ) 80 56 43 21 65 Total operating expenses (14 536 ) (33 336 ) (47 872 ) (6 050 ) (33 028 ) (39 078 ) Operating income (loss) before tax (9 548 ) (10 358 ) (19 907 ) (6 019 ) (29 228 ) (35 247 ) Net financial gain (loss) (290 ) 4 851 4 561 (422 ) 912 490 Net income (loss) (9 839 ) (5 507 ) (15 346 ) (6 441 ) (28 316 ) (34 757 ) Non-controlling interests 3 478 - 3 478 2 846 - 2 846 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (6 361 ) (5 507 ) (11 868 ) (3 595 ) (28 316 ) (31 911 ) R&D non-cash stock-based expense attributable to shareholder of Cellectis 262 1 305 1 567 (11 ) 1 680 1 669 SG&A non-cash stock-based expense attributable to shareholder of Cellectis (1 295 ) 323 (973 ) 342 636 979 Adjustment of share-based compensation attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (1 033 ) 1 628 595 332 2 316 2 648 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (7 394 ) (3 879 ) (11 273 ) (3 263 ) (26 000 ) (29 263 ) Depreciation and amortization (604 ) (3 186 ) (3 791 ) (708 ) (4 934 ) (5 641 ) Additions to tangible and intangible assets 268 6 332 6 601 363 581 945Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresCellectis S.A. presents adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis in this press release. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense‚Äîa non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis‚Äô financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company‚Äôs operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure. In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure. Because of these and other limitations  you should consider adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis alongside our IFRS financial results  including Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.RECONCILIATION OF IFRS TO NON-IFRS NET INCOME ‚Äì First three-months(unaudited)($ in thousands  except per share data)For the three-month period ended March 31  2021 2022 Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (11 868 ) (31 911 ) Adjustment:Non-cash stock-based compensation expense attributable to shareholders of Cellectis 595 2 648 Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (11 273 ) (29 263 ) Basic Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (0 26 ) (0 64 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic (units) (1) 42 866 517 45 486 477 Diluted Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share) (1) (0 26 ) (0 64 ) Weighted average number of outstanding shares  diluted (units) (1) 43 461 047 45 486 477(1) When we have adjusted net loss  in accordance with IFRS  we use the Weighted average number of outstanding shares  basic to compute the Diluted adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis ($/share).

(Reuters) -   Despite global wheat prices trading at record highs for the time of year  market participants may have been too optimistic on the supply outlook for the upcoming year if the U.S. government‚Äôs new projections are a‚Ä¶,The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Thursday pegged world wheat ending stocks for the 2022-23 marketing year at 267 million tonnes  a six-year low  well below analyst estimates of 272 million.But relative to estimated global demand  wheat supplies for the upcoming cycle are seen dangerously close to all-time lows and notably below this year‚Äôs reduced levels.When excluding China  world wheat stocks-to-use for 2022-23 falls to 14.9% from 16.4% this year  and it would be the fourth lowest ever. The record of 14.3% was set in 2007-08  and the average from mid-last decade was 19%.That could keep wheat prices elevated into 2023  impacting food prices for consumers globally and ensuring continued high costs for importer countries. Further risks to 2022-23 wheat supplies are possible.Most-active Chicago wheat futures hit a two-month high of $11.83 per bushel on Thursday. Futures in mid-May had traded in the lower $8-range in 2008 and 2011  the month‚Äôs highest prior to 2022.Paris-traded Euronext wheat hit contract highs on Thursday with September reaching 416.25 euros per tonne.USDA‚Äôs Thursday estimates were its first for the 2022-23 cycle.Graphic- World wheat stocks-to-use minus China: https://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/ce/znvnemyeopl/wht_world_stks_use_minus_cn_12May22.pngNARROW OUTLOOKOne of the most surprising forecasts on Thursday was U.S. hard red winter wheat production from USDA‚Äôs statistics service at 590 million bushels. Analysts were expecting 685 million  already far off last year‚Äôs 749 million. It would be the United States‚Äô smallest HRW harvest since 1963.Condition ratings in U.S. HRW states are terrible  among the worst ever  though history indicates that USDA‚Äôs prediction could be reasonable. In the last decade  USDA‚Äôs May HRW forecast was substantially closer on average to the final in poor-yielding years than in strong ones.But the U.S. spring wheat crop is of major concern and could limit the country‚Äôs output. As of Sunday  the planting pace was the slowest since 2011 and top producer North Dakota had sown just 8% of the crop versus 37% average. More rains this week may have worsened delays.Ukraine‚Äôs situation also brings great uncertainty to the wheat market as Russian military still occupies parts of the country  normally a top five exporter. USDA pegged Ukraine‚Äôs 2022-23 wheat harvest  which was planted last fall  at 21.5 million tonnes  a 10-year low and down 35% on the year.Ukraine‚Äôs wheat exports were pegged at just 10 million tonnes  down 47% on the year and a nine-year low.Top wheat exporter Russia‚Äôs crop is forecast to rise more than 6% on the year  but USDA predicts smaller 2022-23 crops in major suppliers Argentina  Australia  India and the European Union by a collective 4%. Unfavorable weather in France and India could pressure volumes there.Canada‚Äôs wheat harvest is set to rebound 50% from last year‚Äôs drought-stricken catastrophe  though the planting pace and dry conditions are being eyed by analysts. USDA shows the total U.S. crop rising 5% on the year  but that is completely driven by tentative spring wheat assumptions.China  which is often excluded from global grain analyses due to its stockpiling habit  is slated to have a record 53% of the world‚Äôs wheat in storage by mid-2023.Karen Braun is a market analyst for Reuters.

It‚Äôs been a manic week but fortunately one that can be summarized neatly in several paragraphs  as evidenced below. Read on International Insider crew. Big Cannes Interviews & Packages Sitting down with David and Riz: With Cannes on the horizon‚Ä¶,Afternoon all! It‚Äôs been a manic week but fortunately one that can be summarized neatly in several paragraphs  as evidenced below. Read on International Insider crew.Big Cannes Interviews & PackagesSitting down with David and Riz: With Cannes on the horizon  Deadline has been breaking packages here  there and everywhere this week but we still found time to sit down with two of those most prominently involved. On Tuesday  Damon Wise published his interview with Eastern Promises creator Cronenberg to talk Crimes of the Future  his latest Cannes pic. David talked variety  25 years‚Äô worth of Cannes trips and whether his violence in movies can go too far. Not to be missed. Meanwhile  Andreas broke the news of hot Riz feature Hamlet  a modern adaptation of the Shakespeare classic  and spoke at length with the Sound of Metal star about his plans for one of his boldest projects yet. Not content with breaking one Riz pic  Andreas had the exclusive on the other  the Jessie Buckley-starring Fingernails  which landed a day before Hamlet. Deadline also revealed Sony Pictures landing rights to Tom Hanks-starring Here  Susan Sarandon wedding comedy The Fabulous Four  the movie version of Tony-winner Clybourne Park  Liam Neeson‚Äôs latest Taken-style action hit and BAFTA winner Jodie Comer‚Äôs The End We Start From with Benedict Cumberbatch‚Äôs SunnyMarch among producers. Elsewhere  nod to our International Editor-At-Large Baz Bamigboye for breaking Emerald Fennell‚Äôs new film and check out this reveal from our very own Mike Fleming Jr on Spinal Tap II ‚Äî wow. Now breathe once again. Andreas  Diana Lodderhose and Baz will be at Cannes next week bringing you the latest in what is sure to be one of the busiest periods of the year. Stay tuned.Just landed: And in the past few minutes  Andreas has revealed Amazon Prime quietly picking domestic rights to UK boxing movie Prizefighter: The Life Of Jem Belcher featuring Russell Crowe. Turns out the pic has been anything but plain sailing  however. Multiple parties contacted Deadline to tell of payments outstanding for months and there is bad blood between producing and financial partners.Global Indie ShakeupsIn their Element: It might make thoughtful  lowkey drama but Element Pictures was the star of the show in the M&A world this week and the sale of the Conversations With Friends producer to Fremantle kicked off a big week in the independent TV production sector. The hot Ireland-based drama company had been on the block for several weeks  with American Gods producer-distributor Fremantle emerging as the buyer. Known for its tastefully shot  high-end productions  Element will fit nicely into a Fremantle roster including Italy‚Äôs Wildside and Lux Vide and the UK‚Äôs Dancing Ledge Productions.Banijay goes public: On Tuesday  the news broke that Survivor owner Banijay was being taken public  with Chairman St√©phane Courbit leading the establishment of a new parent company  FL Entertainment. This followed an agreement with SPAC investment group Pegasus Entrepreneurs. So  what does this mean in practice? Well  the France-based company‚Äôs shares will be traded on Amsterdam‚Äôs Euronext and gives the combined group  which also includes online gambling firm Betclic  an enterprise value of ‚Ç¨7.2B ($7.6B)  but Banijay reps are keen to stress it‚Äôs business as usual and if anything a chance for more growth. Having acquired Italian scripted producer Gr√∏enlandia Group in March  the company looks well set ‚Äî operationally and financially ‚Äî to make more noteworthy international moves.Sparkling drama: Staying in France  Jesse had the scoop on Sparkling ‚Äî the latest production business to enter the increasingly competitive European production market. Co-production guru Patrick Nebout (Cannes Confidential  Midnight Sun) is leading the Paris-based operation as President and Chief Content Officer  with his long-time production partner Henrik Jansson-Schweizer among those joining him. Notably  Sparkling is a sister company to US-French comic book publisher Humanoids  the firm behind lauded graphic novel universe The Incal. Expect Nebout to exploit the extensive Humanoids back catalogue  while also creating original stories with European partners. ‚ÄúAll will be premium projects ‚Äù he assured Deadline.Enter The DragonConquering Japan: Also in the indie TV world  Korean media giant CJ ENM and its subsidiary Studio Dragon unveiled plans to conquer Japan through a joint venture with Line Digital Frontier  a Japanese operation affiliated with Naver Webtoon. With 30B Korean won ($23M) being jointly invested in the provisionally titled Studio Dragon Japan  the JV operation has the lofty ambition of becoming the ‚Äúleading production company‚Äù in the key Asian territory. Stayed tuned for more.BAFTA WhoIt‚Äôs A Snub: It was BAFTA TV time Sunday and there were surprises galore  along with the unveiling of one of the most lucrative casting annos in British TV  the new Doctor. While dragging on a bit as ever  the ceremony itself saw It‚Äôs a Sin fail to pick up awards time after time  as all five nominees were snubbed for the likes of social realist dramas Help and Time. All the talk of the week has been how the show failed to win anything and while some have been keen to point out that the Channel 4/HBO drama won two BAFTA Craft Awards  creator Russell T Davies also lost out in that ceremony the previous week. On a politically-charged night  there were big wins for Jodie Comer  Sean Bean and Succession‚Äôs Matthew Macfadyen  while ITV hit new heights  winning several factual gongs and two more than Channel 4. I attended the event and  while there were plenty of wifi and accreditation-related teething problems  along with plenty of confusion about embargos  I can confirm that it is wonderful to be back celebrating British television in all its glory.Doctor Ncuti: Landing in journalists‚Äô inboxes mere hours before the ceremony started was the biggest news story of the week: Sex Education star Ncuti Gatwa  who both presented and was up for a BAFTA  is to replace Jodie Whittaker as Doctor Who‚Äôs next Time Lord. Despite minor protestations from a small number of die-hard Twitter-based Whovians  the response was a welcoming one. Ncuti is the first Black Doctor and will likely bring a new dynamic to the show: he‚Äôs unquestionably cool and draws a readymade fan base from one of Netflix‚Äôs biggest youth-skewing hits. All eyes to Russell T Davies now and how he shapes the next series. You never know  he might even land himself a BAFTA.BBC Factual WoesAnd the job goes to‚Ä¶ nobody: The biggest job in British non-scripted programing was the talk of the BAFTAs Royal Festival Hall afterparty but the post remains dramatically unfilled. I broke the news this week that all candidates to be the BBC‚Äôs next Director of Factual  Arts and Classical Music had been unsuccessful and Chief Content Officer Charlotte Moore is now rethinking the very nature of the role  almost six months after it was advertised. Deadline spoke to several within and outside the corporation who grumbled as to why it had taken Moore so long to make this U-turn. They questioned why she couldn‚Äôt have just decided the job  which was expanded to accommodate Patrick Holland last year before he departed to Banijay  was too unwieldy  especially as she is understood to have personally reached out to several of the candidates to ask them to apply in the first place. The wait goes on  with BBC Three Controller Fiona Campbell remaining in interim charge in the meantime.The Essentialsüå∂Ô∏è Here‚Äôs a hot one: Alec Baldwin has launched production company Persona Entertainment with veteran actor and producer Anjul Nigam just months after the fatal Rust shooting.

Trust Stamp has reported several significant developments over the past quarter as we delivered growth across the business  from our targeted suite of solutions and intellectual property portfolio to our earnings and client base.This strong financial and operational performance reflects Trust Stamp‚Äôs ability to capture diversified market opportunities and grow existing commercial relationships to generate long-term revenue streams. Notably  we expanded upon an existing customer relationship within the government sector while increasing our scope of work with multiple Fortune 500 commercial clients in the financial services sector. Our technology has garnered interest across multiple government use cases in the United States and internationally  addressing pressing concerns around the privacy and security of legacy biometric implementations. Towards this end  Trust Stamp has made a significant investment in expanding our government-facing business development team and are in active discussions with several overseas governments.We continue to innovate through investment in research and development to expand and productize our portfolio of solutions  which has led to five patent issuances and nine new patent application filings in Q1. Trust Stamp‚Äôs core technology delivers unparalleled security  utility  and privacy  at a fraction of the cost of traditional biometric solutions  driving commercial growth as we address cross-industry needs for fraud prevention  operational efficiency  and accessibility in digital services.We are notably pleased with the launch and commercial adoption of our next-generation Biometric Multi-Factor Authentication (Biometric MFATM) offering and Identity Orchestration Platform  which transforms secure digital operations across the identity lifecycle with seamless rapid deployment of custom workflows built on our range of innovative AI-powered solutions.

We continue to onboard new clients and partners  including VIVA Finance  which is integrating our biometric verification  document validation  and data protection technology to power and protect robust  accessible  and equitable financial services.

This increase was primarily due to revenue contracts executed by newly acquired and existing customers.Gross ProfitGross profit increased by a notable $1.86 million or 673.9% year-over-year in the first quarter  while gross profit margin improved to 75.4% in Q1 2022  compared to 51.6% for Q1 2021. The improvement was due in part to the Company‚Äôs prior investment in research and development  which enabled the utilization of existing technologies with relatively nominal implementation costs for new deployments.Research and DevelopmentResearch and development (R&D) costs decreased by $261 thousand or 34.6% year-over-year in the first quarter. The decrease in R&D expenses in the comparison periods was driven by the Company‚Äôs continued efforts to transition software development resources towards expanding internal capabilities and away from external third-party software development.Selling  General  and Administrative ExpensesSelling  general  and administrative (SG&A) expense increased to $3.12 million for Q1 2022  compared to $1.33 million for Q1 2021. The increase in SG&A expense during the period ended March 31  2022 was driven by legal and professional services fees  other fees related to the listing of the Company‚Äôs common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market  and internal sales commissions.Operating LossOperating loss decreased by $295 thousand to $1.64 million for Q1 2022  compared to $1.94 million for Q1 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in operating loss was the growth in net revenue  which outpaced the growth in operating costs by a factor of 5.3. Adjusting for additional non-cash and non-recurring activities results in an even more significant improvement to the operating margin.Net LossNet loss decreased 16.7% or $0.07 per basic and diluted share for Q1 2022 to $1.69M from $2.03 million or $0.11 per basic and diluted share for the same period last year.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of March 31  2022  and December 31  2021  the Company had approximately $5.84 million and $3.48 million of cash  respectively. The increase in cash during the comparative periods was a result of the net positive cash inflow from the combination of financing and operating activities. In Q1 2022  the Company received $1.95 million related to a government contract and $3.32 million from a warrant exercise  as well as $365 thousand in units sold and warrants exercised in connection to the Company's 2022 fundraising efforts in preparation for its Nasdaq listing.Total working capital as of March 31  2022 was $5.63 million  compared to $3.36 million as of December 31  2021.

Trust Stamp has reported several significant developments over the past quarter as we delivered growth across the business  from our targeted suite of solutions and intellectual property portfolio to our earnings and client base.This strong financial and operational performance reflects Trust Stamp‚Äôs ability to capture diversified market opportunities and grow existing commercial relationships to generate long-term revenue streams.

Our technology has garnered interest across multiple government use cases in the United States and internationally  addressing pressing concerns around the privacy and security of legacy biometric implementations. Towards this end  Trust Stamp has made a significant investment in expanding our government-facing business development team and are in active discussions with several overseas governments.We continue to innovate through investment in research and development to expand and productize our portfolio of solutions  which has led to five patent issuances and nine new patent application filings in Q1. Trust Stamp‚Äôs core technology delivers unparalleled security  utility  and privacy  at a fraction of the cost of traditional biometric solutions  driving commercial growth as we address cross-industry needs for fraud prevention  operational efficiency  and accessibility in digital services.We are notably pleased with the launch and commercial adoption of our next-generation Biometric Multi-Factor Authentication (Biometric MFATM) offering and Identity Orchestration Platform  which transforms secure digital operations across the identity lifecycle with seamless rapid deployment of custom workflows built on our range of innovative AI-powered solutions.

This increase was primarily due to revenue contracts executed by newly acquired and existing customers.Gross ProfitGross profit increased by a notable $1.86 million or 673.9% year-over-year in the first quarter  while gross profit margin improved to 75.4% in Q1 2022  compared to 51.6% for Q1 2021. The improvement was due in part to the Company‚Äôs prior investment in research and development  which enabled the utilization of existing technologies with relatively nominal implementation costs for new deployments.ADVERTISEMENTResearch and DevelopmentResearch and development (R&D) costs decreased by $261 thousand or 34.6% year-over-year in the first quarter. The decrease in R&D expenses in the comparison periods was driven by the Company‚Äôs continued efforts to transition software development resources towards expanding internal capabilities and away from external third-party software development.Selling  General  and Administrative ExpensesSelling  general  and administrative (SG&A) expense increased to $3.12 million for Q1 2022  compared to $1.33 million for Q1 2021. The increase in SG&A expense during the period ended March 31  2022 was driven by legal and professional services fees  other fees related to the listing of the Company‚Äôs common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market  and internal sales commissions.Operating LossOperating loss decreased by $295 thousand to $1.64 million for Q1 2022  compared to $1.94 million for Q1 2021. The primary reason for the decrease in operating loss was the growth in net revenue  which outpaced the growth in operating costs by a factor of 5.3. Adjusting for additional non-cash and non-recurring activities results in an even more significant improvement to the operating margin.ADVERTISEMENTNet LossNet loss decreased 16.7% or $0.07 per basic and diluted share for Q1 2022 to $1.69M from $2.03 million or $0.11 per basic and diluted share for the same period last year.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of March 31  2022  and December 31  2021  the Company had approximately $5.84 million and $3.48 million of cash  respectively. The increase in cash during the comparative periods was a result of the net positive cash inflow from the combination of financing and operating activities. In Q1 2022  the Company received $1.95 million related to a government contract and $3.32 million from a warrant exercise  as well as $365 thousand in units sold and warrants exercised in connection to the Company‚Äôs 2022 fundraising efforts in preparation for its Nasdaq listing.Total working capital as of March 31  2022 was $5.63 million  compared to $3.36 million as of December 31  2021.
